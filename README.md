Collections of english historical texts



Note: for reasons I have not ascertained, there are no collections of statutes, such as those compiled by Pickering or Ruffhead, amongst the TCP texts, and I think very few digitised by Gale.
A pet interest of mine, I have started to OCR copies digitized by Google and Microsoft, and to correct the text; preliminary versions can be found in a separate git hub repository:

And for further information on the project see:
