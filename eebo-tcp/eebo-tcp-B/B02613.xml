         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The CASE of Sir <hi>JOHN EDWARDS,</hi> Knight, Appellant from a Decrcee made in the High and Honourable Court of Chancery, in a Cauſe there Depending, wherein <hi>Mary Howard,</hi> Widow, was Plaintiff, and the Appellant was Defendant: <hi>Humbly Offered to the Conſideration of the Right Honourable the Lords Spiritual and Temporal in Parliament Aſſembled.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>HENRY HOWARD,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> being ſeiz'd in Fee of the Honour of <hi>Cl<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ne,</hi> the Mannor of <hi>Bucknill,</hi> and of other Mannors and Lands in the County of <hi>Salop,</hi> the 19th day of <hi>January</hi> 1669; after his Marriage with the Reſpondiſt, did ſettle part of the Premiſes of the value of 500 <hi>l. per. ann.</hi> upon her for her Joynture; and the 7th day of <hi>December</hi> following, did make her a voluntary additional Settlement of other Lands, worth (if in poſſeſſion) 1500 <hi>l. per annum</hi> more. <hi>Henry Howard</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, <hi>viz.</hi> the 10th day of <hi>July</hi> 1671, ſold to the Appellant for a full and valuable Conſideration, really paid the Reverſion after three Lives of three Tenements in <hi>Bucknill;</hi> which unknown to the Appellant, were in the aforeſaid voluntary and additional Settlement, and of two ſmall Tenements in the Forreſt of <hi>Clone,</hi> which were not in that voluntary additional Settlement. All which ſaid Premiſes, were an abſolute purchaſe, without any power of Redemption, either by Word or Writing. Which Premiſes ſo purchaſed by the Appellant (to ſave charges, and to protect them by Collateral ſecurity from incumbrances) were included in the ſame conveyance with other Lands about that time contracted for by one Mr. <hi>Edward Powell,</hi> with the ſame Mr. <hi>Howard;</hi> but the Contracts were ſeveral, and the Tenements purchaſed by the Appellant, were by the ſaid <hi>Powell</hi> immediately to be conveyed to the Appellant and his Heirs; and a Draught for that purpoſe was then prepared, and agreed on, and afterwards was executed by the ſaid <hi>Powell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſaid Mr. <hi>Powell</hi> voluntarily gave Mr. <hi>Howard</hi> a Note to admit him to re-purchaſe the Premiſes by him the ſaid <hi>Powell</hi> contracted for and purchaſed. Mr. <hi>Howard,</hi> after he had ſupplied his occaſions with the ſaid Purchaſe-money, preferr'd his Bill in Chancery againſt <hi>Powell,</hi> and the Appellant to have Redemption from them both, of the Lands by them ſeverally purchaſed, upon pretence that the ſaid Note given by <hi>Powell,</hi> did amount to an agreement, that Mr. <hi>Howard</hi> might re-purchaſe the ſame, and Mr. <hi>Howard</hi> would therein have included the Lands purchaſed by the Appellant. But it appearing that the Appellants purchaſe was a diſtinct purchaſe from <hi>Powells,</hi> and ſo not to be affected with <hi>Powell</hi>'s Note, That Bill was diſmiſt, and then Mr. <hi>Howard</hi> exhibited a new Bill againſt <hi>Powell</hi> alone to redeem the ſame; who ſubmitting thereto the 6th of <hi>July,</hi> 26 <hi>Car.</hi> 2<hi>di,</hi> the ſame was decreed accordingly, but without prejudice as to the Premiſes purchaſed by the Appellant.</p>
            <p>In <hi>November</hi> 1675, Mr. <hi>Henry Howard</hi> dyed, and the Appellant having, as he was, and is adviſed, an abſolute and irredeemable Eſtate in the Premiſes, and conceiving himſelf at peace and quiet, did in conſideration of a Marriage and Portion, received with his new Wife, abſolutely ſettle the ſaid Lands in <hi>Bucknill (inter alia)</hi> upon Sir <hi>Edward Harley,</hi> Knight of the Bath, and <hi>Robert Beale,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> in Truſt for the Appellants Wife, for part of her Joynture, and afterwards to the Uſe of the Heirs Male of their two bodies, and charged with Portions for younger Children; That the Reſpondiſt <hi>May Howard,</hi> Relict of the aforeſaid <hi>Henry Howard,</hi> deceaſed, claiming part of the Premiſes, as being comprized in her ſaid volantary additional Settlement, made as aforeſaid, brought her Bill in Chancery againſt the Appellant for a Re-conveyance of all the whole Premiſes, and a Redemption thereof though abſolutely bought and purchaſed by him, and ſetled for a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable conſideration as aforeſaid, on pretence, that the Appellants having accepted of a conveyance from <hi>Powell;</hi> and being privy to <hi>Powells</hi> giving the aforeſaid Note, and not oppoſing the ſame, ought to be affected thereby.</p>
            <p>Whereas,</p>
            <list>
               <item>1ſt, The Appellants Purchaſe and Contract was diſtinct from that of Mr. <hi>Powells;</hi> the Purchaſes were treated for ſeverally, and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally paid for.</item>
               <item>2ly, Mr. <hi>Powell</hi> only agreed to admit Mr. <hi>Howard</hi> to re-purchaſe what he himſelf had contracted for, and ſo the Appellants purchaſe not comprehended in that Note.</item>
               <item>3ly, The Premiſes purchaſed by the Appellant, not being included in <hi>Powells</hi> Note; therefore, though the Appellant was preſent when the Note was given, yet had he no reaſon to oppoſe it, or to deſire that to be excluded, which, in truth, was never included therein.</item>
               <item>4ly, The Note given by Mr. <hi>Powell,</hi> was voluntary, and he hath ſworn expreſly it was ſo; and that it was to extend only to his own purchaſe, and not to the Appellants.</item>
               <item>5ly, To make a Conſtruction, that the Appellants Lands ſhould be redeemable, becauſe <hi>Powell</hi> ſo agreed for his own, is not only againſt the truth, but a conſtruction contrary to all common ſenſe and underſtanding: For can any man think it probable, that the Appellant would part with his money, and take only a ſecurity of a dry Reverſion, after three Lives in being, for the ſame? Out of what could he expect to be paid his Intereſt? It would be worthy of enquiry, Whether ever any man lent his money upon a dry Reverſon, after three Lives, without ſomething in poſſeſſion, that might anſwer his Intereſt, or ſome Collareral ſecurity for the ſame?</item>
               <item>6ly, The money paid by the Appellant, was the full value of the Reverſions, conſidering the Lives then in being.</item>
               <item>7ly, The Appellant on preſumption, that this abſolute purchaſe of his, was only a Mortgage, is decreed to re-convey the ſame free from incumbrances, which is abſolutely impoſſible for him to do, he having for a valuable conſideration ſettled the ſame on his wife and Children, as aforeſaid; ſo that it is out of his power to perform the Decree, and conſequently his Perſon decreed to perpetual Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment.</item>
               <item>8ly, The Reſpondiſt is admitted to a Redemption of all the Five Tenements aforeſaid; whereas (were the Appellants title but a Mortgage, yet hath the title only to three of them) none of them being in her Joynture, and there being but three of them in her addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional voluntary Settlement, the equity of Redemption of the other two (if redeemable at all) being in another perſon, <hi>viz.</hi> Mr. <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cott,</hi> who purchaſed <hi>Clone,</hi> whereof thoſe Tenements are a part, who is neither Plaintiff nor Defendant, and to whoſe proſecution the Appellant is equally lyable.</item>
               <item>9ly, The Reſpondiſt is relieved by the ſaid Decree, upon a voluntary conveyance againſt the Appellant, who is a Purchaſor for a full and valuable conſideration, and upon account ſtated by the Maſter in Chancery, according to the Reſpondiſts own values in proofs; the money now due to the Appellant, is more then the Reverſions are worth, if now to be ſold, although ſeveral of the Lives are dead ſince the purchaſe; ſo that the Decree is purely obtain'd for vexation, and can be in no caſe for the Reſpondiſts advantage, yet De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees an impoſſibility to be performed; and if not performed, the Appellants perſon is lyable to perpetual Impriſonment, as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid.</item>
               <item>10ly, That the Appellant having the conveyance of the Reverſion in his own Name, his Eſtates for three Lives are Merg'd; which is an evidence of an abſolute Purchaſe, not a Mortgage.</item>
            </list>
            <p>
               <hi>All which it most humbly ſubmitted to the Wiſdom and grave Conſideration of this Supreme Fountain of Justice, your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips in Parliament Aſſembled. And the Appellant humbly prays Relief according to Justice, and that the Decree afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid may stand reverſed.</hi>
