            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p n="1">I. The Firſt deſcribes the <hi>Burning of LONDON,</hi> which hath been proved undeniably by Dr. <hi>Oates,</hi> Mr. <hi>Bedloe,</hi> and others, to be contrived and carried on by the <hi>Papiſts. A bleſſed Religion, that muſt be introduced by the Ruine of ſo many thouſand Families!</hi> But <hi>Devaſtation</hi> alone would not content, without <hi>Blood:</hi> For, in the next place,</p>
               <p n="2">II. We deſcribe <hi>The Manner of their murthering Sir Edmondbury Godfrey, who took Dr. Oates</hi>'s <hi>Depoſitions of the Plot;</hi> which was no more than every Gentleman in the Commiſſion of the Peace was bound to do: yet for this neceſſary diſcharge of his Duty, the Conſpirators were ſo enraged, that they reſolved to cut him off; the rather, as may reaſonably be ſuppoſed, to deter all other Magiſtrates from intermed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with any Affairs relating to the Plot. The Perſons actually pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at this Murther were, <hi>Girald</hi> and <hi>Kelly,</hi> two Prieſts; <hi>Green, Bury,</hi> and <hi>Hill,</hi> who were ſince executed for it. The whole diſcovered by Mr. <hi>Miles Praunce,</hi> who was to have acted in it.</p>
               <p n="3">III. We come to deſeribe <hi>The General Days of Humiliation</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by His Majeſties Proclamations, on the Thirteenth of <hi>Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> 1678. and on the Eleventh of <hi>April,</hi> 1679. to implore the Mercies of Almighty God, in the Protection of His Majeſties Sacred Perſon; and that he would infatuate and defeat the Counſels of the Papiſts, our <unclear>Enemies</unclear>.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. The next thing in order of Time was <hi>The Execution of ſeveral of the Plotters,</hi> viz. <hi>Coleman, Ireland, Grove, Pickering, Whitebread, Harcourt, Fenwick, Gavan, Turner,</hi> and <hi>Langhorn, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">V. We come now to the <hi>Sham-Plots.</hi> Their next great Deſign was to take off one of our great Bulwarks, <hi>viz.</hi> the Right Honourable <hi>Anthony Earl of Shaftsbury.</hi> In this Fifth Diviſion we give you the manner of Mr. <hi>Dangerfield</hi>'s coming to attempt him; and,</p>
               <p n="6">VI.

                  </gap>'d to blow off this Helliſh Plot, their next Stratagem was to forge <hi>a Plot upon the Presbyterians,</hi> by Name; but in Truth to involve the moſt zealous and active Proteſtant Nobility, Gentry, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> throughout the Nation: which being fortified with bold Perjuries, and ſpecious Pretences, might gain Credit; and thereby they being deſtroy'd as a Sacrifice to Juſtice, it might ſeem probable, <hi>That the laſt Years Plot was onely their malicious Contrivance againſt the Catholicks,</hi> who would then appear the King's beſt Subjects. <hi>The Model of this deſigned Plot againſt the</hi> Presbyterians <hi>was found by Sir</hi> William Waller, <hi>in the Houſe of Mrs.</hi> Cellier, <hi>hid in a MEAL-T<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>B, in a Paper Book, tied with Red Ribbons: It purported to be onely Remarks or Chief Heads of Things and Perſons to be charged; as, amongſt the reſt, there were named, the Lords</hi> Hallifax, Shaftsbury, Radnor, Eſſex, Wharton, <hi>the Duke of</hi> Buckingham, <hi>and others, to be of Counſel in this pretended Conſpiracy; the Duke of</hi> Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth <hi>General; the Lord</hi> Grey, <hi>Lord</hi> Gerard, <hi>and his Son, and Sir</hi> Thomas Armſtrong, <hi>Lieutenant-Generals in this Rebellious Army; Sir</hi> William Waller, <hi>and others, Major-Generals; Colonel</hi> Manſel, <hi>Quarter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter-General. By this whole Contrivance it moſt evidently appears, that their aim was to ruine all that were true Proteſtants, or honeſt Aſſerters of the Liberties and Property of the Subject: for indeed there cannot be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned above two or three, in all their long forged Liſt, that can with any Colour of Reaſon, or uſual acceptation of the Word, be called</hi> Presbyterians.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. Next we come to deſcribe the manner of <hi>Mrs. Celliers ſitting in State on the Pillory,</hi> near the <hi>Maypole</hi> in the <hi>Strand,</hi> with her famous Wooden Shield, to defend her from the Fury of the People. <hi>She was moſt juſtly ſentenced to this ignominious Puniſhment, for publiſhing an abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable lying Pamphlet, entituled,</hi> Malice Defeated: <hi>A Book ſtuffed with ſo many Lies, and notorious Equivocations, and with ſo much Malice and Envy to all Proteſtants in general, that the like was never publickly ſold.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">IX. We deſcribe the manner of <hi>Aſſaulting Juſtice Arnold,</hi> by Three notorious Ruſſians; <hi>one of whom,</hi> viz. Giles, <hi>hath been ſince Tryed, and found Guilty, and accordingly deſervedly puniſhed for it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">X. We next deſcribe <hi>The manner of their tearing their Treaſonable Papers,</hi> for fear of a Diſcovery.</p>
               <p n="11">XI. In the next place, we deſcribe <hi>their Holy Fathers receiving com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable Letters from England,</hi> (with Tears of Joy) of the likely Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of their <hi>Plot.</hi>
