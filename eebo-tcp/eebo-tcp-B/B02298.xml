         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A COMMENTATION <hi>On the late wonderful Diſcovery</hi> OF THE New Popiſh PLOT, Being the Jeſuites Diabolick. Device to Inveagle the Son to betray the Father.</head>
            <lg>
               <l>IN ſpite of Fate, the Jeſuite like the Devil</l>
               <l>To the Worlds end muſt ſtill be doing Evil:</l>
               <l>Plotting his Nature is, and he doth think</l>
               <l>To miſchief Hereticks, is meat and drink.</l>
               <l>Tho God his Vengeance on their plots hath ſhown</l>
               <l>And by his mighty Hand has them or'e thrown,</l>
               <l>They ſtill againſt all Mercy ſhut their Eyes,</l>
               <l>And will new Miſcheif, and new plots deviſe.</l>
               <l>What is it that theſe Devils doe not dare</l>
               <l>To Act; for God nor Nature doe they Care,</l>
               <l>True Labourers, unweariable ſtill,</l>
               <l>In plotting miſcheif, and in doeing ill.</l>
               <l>Whence Comes their plots, Can any mortal tell?</l>
               <l>If not from the <hi>Divan</hi> that's held in Hell,</l>
               <l>Wkoſe black reſults are by evil ſpirits ſent</l>
               <l>To th' Jeſuites, the Devils Inſtrument;</l>
               <l>Who with much pleaſure and induſtry go</l>
               <l>To Act the miſchief they had hatch'd below.</l>
               <l>Tho their She Champion had but ill ſueceſs,</l>
               <l>And had a devilish ſqueeze got in the preſs</l>
               <l>Tho ſhe who midwifes Trade well underſtood.</l>
               <l>Miſcarried with her bladders Cram'd with blood,</l>
               <l>Yet they, like <hi>Antheus</hi> who new ſtrength ſtill found,</l>
               <l>Each time that He was flung unto the Ground,</l>
               <l>For all theſe falls, new Life and ſtrength do gather,</l>
               <l>And plot to make the ſon betray his Father</l>
               <l>Thus againſt Nature they dare make their way</l>
               <l>And urge a Son his Father to betray,</l>
               <l>Thus for the Cauſe to Such Extreams they run</l>
               <l>To hang the Innoent Father by the Son.</l>
               <l>Horrid! if this Jeſuites Religion be</l>
               <l>I ſtill will put it in my Letanie</l>
               <l>From Such Religion Lord deliver me.</l>
               <l>The firſt true plot, ſtill ſticks within their Maw,</l>
               <l>Which they with all their Arts off ne'r will Claw,</l>
               <l>Tho ſince that time they Kept ſo fowl a ſtir,</l>
               <l>And thought to fling it on the Presbyter,</l>
               <l>Tho God their Arts ſo planely did Conſound</l>
               <l>When Waller did the Mealtubs bottom ſound.</l>
               <l>A new plot now from Hell it ſelf they ſprung,</l>
               <l>To lay the old on Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> and Tongue;</l>
               <l>And the poor ſon is made an Inſtrumnt,</l>
               <l>To Swear the Father did the plot Invent.</l>
               <l>To ſend the Son they to the devil ment,</l>
               <l>God touch'd his Heart and made him to Repent,</l>

                  </gap> of Sin,</l>
               <l>And turn'd them looſe Some more ſtrange Plots to ſpin</l>
               <l>Ere it be long we ſhall more plainly See</l>
               <l>Who theſe damn'd <hi>Machivilian</hi> Plotters be,</l>
               <l>Not Priest or ſeſuites all, I am afraid,</l>
               <l>Some lay men will be found in Maſquerade:</l>
               <l>who rather then their Arts ſhall not prevail,</l>
               <l>Will ſtoop to wipe clean madam Celliers Tail</l>
               <l>And at the ſame time againſt <hi>Baxter</hi> rail.</l>
               <l>Never ſince firſt our happy Reformation</l>
               <l>Did Pope or Jeſuite So beſtride our Nation,</l>
               <l>They hop'b by th' Engliſh Fleeces to grow Rich</l>
               <l>Finding the ſheep had got a Popiſh Itch,</l>
               <l>But we yet hope, the aproaching Parliament</l>
               <l>Will find ſome way th' Infection to prevent,</l>
               <l>That this Diſeaſe ſo very lately bred,</l>
               <l>May now among the Flock no farther Spread,</l>
               <l>But Father Pope and his induſtrious Tools</l>
               <l>who are no dreaming or unthinking Fools;</l>
               <l>With Wondrous Induſty, and Pollitick Care-</l>

               <l>Doeing their Father Pope and devils work'</l>
               <l>More dreadfull to us then either Jew or Turk'</l>
