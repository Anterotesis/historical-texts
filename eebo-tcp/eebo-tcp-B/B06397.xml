            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>my purpoſe is to write,</l>
               <l>By whom a Father was undone,</l>
               <l>and clearly ruin'd quite:</l>
               <l>The Sequel of this Song</l>
               <l>will make it well appear,</l>
               <l>That thoſe that do their Parents wrong,</l>
               <l>will feel God's Wrath ſevere.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>An ancient wealthy Man,</l>
               <l>near <hi>London</hi> lived indeed,</l>
               <l>Who at his Door reliev'd the Poor,</l>
               <l>and thoſe that ſtood in need:</l>
               <l>But Troubles coming on,</l>
               <l>we find that ev'ry where,</l>
               <l>Religious Men, not One in Ten,</l>
               <l>but perſecuted were.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>And eke for Conſcience ſake,</l>
               <l>in Priſon was likewiſe,</l>
               <l>Informers they made them their Prey,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Rome</hi>'s Malice to ſuffice;</l>
               <l>Both Lands and Goods were ſeiz'd,</l>
               <l>no Pity they'd afford,</l>
               <l>For at that time 'twas thought a Crime,</l>
               <l>to ſerve the living Lord.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>This good man ſeeing then,</l>
               <l>how ſtrange the things did run,</l>
               <l>He did depend, to find a Friend</l>
               <l>of his beloved Son;</l>
               <l>Therefore without delay,</l>
               <l>he call'd him out of hand,</l>
               <l>And did make o're his Goods and Store,</l>
               <l>likewiſe his Houſe and Land.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Said he, my Son be juſt,</l>
               <l>ſecure the ſame for me;</l>
               <l>I have no Friend that I can truſt</l>
               <l>in theſe Affairs but thee:</l>
               <l>Dear Father, then ſaid he,</l>
               <l>Your Will ſhall be obey'd,</l>
               <l>And if I wrong you let me ſee</l>
               <l>a juſt Example made.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The old Man him believ'd,</l>
               <l>and turn'd o're his Eſtate,</l>
               <l>But yet at laſt, e'er Three years paſt</l>
               <l>he did repent at laſt;</l>
               <l>For after turn of times,</l>
               <l>did Liberty afford.</l>
               <l>The old Man went with full intent,</l>
               <l>to have his Means reſtor'd.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Then coming to the Gate,</l>
               <l>whereas his Son did dwell,</l>
               <l>It was one Evening ſomething late,</l>
               <l>the very Truth to tell;</l>
               <l>The Servant let him in,</l>
               <l>and when he was ſet down,</l>
               <l>The Son with Anger did begin</l>
               <l>to knit his Brows and frown.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The Father ſaid, My Son,</l>
               <l>I come in hopes, that you</l>
               <l>Will now return the great Concern,</l>
               <l>which is my proper due:</l>
               <l>Ye Presbyterian Knave,</l>
               <l>ſaid this Son, void of ſhame,</l>
               <l>I'll part with nothing that I have,</l>
               <l>be gone from whence ye came.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The old Man then beſought</l>
               <l>this Villain to forbear,</l>
               <l>I am your Father which hath brought</l>
               <l>you up with Coſt and Care.</l>
               <l>But yet he rav'd the more,</l>
               <l>and Curſes did repeat,</l>
               <l>At length he threw him out of Door,</l>
               <l>and kick'd him in the Street.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>His Eyes like Fountains flow,</l>
               <l>run down his Cheeks like Rain,</l>
               <l>His aged Hair as white as Snow,</l>
               <l>no Pity could obtain.</l>
               <l>O cruel wretched Son!</l>
               <l>the Father then reply'd,</l>
               <l>Conſider well what thou haſt done,</l>
               <l>God will pull down thy Pride.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The bitter Winds did blow,</l>
               <l>the Skies was darkned quite,</l>
               <l>And for a Lodging where to go</l>
               <l>he did not know that Night;</l>
               <l>But Heaven did provide</l>
               <l>for him in that diſtreſs,</l>
               <l>He with a Farmer did reſide,</l>
               <l>who did his Love expreſs.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But for this wicked Son,</l>
               <l>e'er Morning did appear.</l>
               <l>He quite beſides his Wits did run,</l>
               <l>God's Wrath was ſo ſevere:</l>
               <l>Then for a Week or more,</l>
               <l>Father, Father, he cry'd,</l>
               <l>In frantick Fits beſides his Wits,</l>
               <l>and then at length he dy'd.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Thus for his Villany,</l>
               <l>God ſent him to the Grave;</l>
               <l>O let theſe Lines a warning be,</l>
               <l>to all that Parents have;</l>
               <l>Be dutiful always,</l>
               <l>and do not Parents ſcorn,</l>
