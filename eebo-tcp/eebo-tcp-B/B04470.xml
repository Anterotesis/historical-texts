            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE SPEECH OF A FYFE LAIRD; NEWLY COME FROM GRAVE.</head>
            <lg>
               <l>WHat accident, what ſtrange miſhap,</l>
               <l>Awakes me from my heavenly nap?</l>
               <l>What ſprit? what God-head by the lave,</l>
               <l>Hath rais'd my Body from the Grave?</l>
               <l>It is an hundred years almoſt,</l>
               <l>Since I was buried in the duſt:</l>
               <l>And now I think that I am living,</l>
               <l>Or elſe, but doubt, my brains are raving:</l>
               <l>Yet do I feel (while as I ſtudy)</l>
               <l>The faculties of all my Body:</l>
               <l>I taſte, I ſmel, I touch, I hear,</l>
               <l>I find my ſight exceeding clear:</l>
               <l>Then I'm alive, yea ſure I am,</l>
               <l>I know it by my corporal frame:</l>
               <l>But in what part where can I be,</l>
               <l>My wavering brains yet tortures me.</l>
               <l>Once I was call'd a great Fyff Laird,</l>
               <l>I dwelt not far from the Hall-yard.</l>
               <l>But who enjoys my Land and Pleugh,</l>
               <l>My Caſtle, and my fine Cole-heugh:</l>
               <l>I can find out no living man,</l>
               <l>Can tell me this, do what I can:</l>
               <l>Yet if my memory ſerve me well,</l>
               <l>This is the Shyre where I did dwell:</l>
               <l>This is the part where I was born:</l>
               <l>For lo, beneath me ſtands Kinghorn:</l>
               <l>And there about the Lowmond hill,</l>
               <l>Stands as it ſtood yet ever ſtill.</l>
               <l>There is Bruntiland, Aberdore,</l>
               <l>I ſee Fyffs coaſt alongſt the ſhore.</l>
               <l>Yet I am right, for my life,</l>
               <l>This is my native Countrey Fyff.</l>
               <l>O but it's long and many a year,</l>
               <l>Since laſt my feet did travel here.</l>
               <l>I find great change in old Lairds places,</l>
               <l>I know the ground, but not the faces.</l>
               <l>Where ſhall I turn me firſt about,</l>
               <l>for my acquaintance is worn out?</l>
               <l>O this is ſtrange that even in Fyff,</l>
               <l>I do know neither Man nor Wife;</l>
               <l>No Earl, no Lord, no Laird, no People,</l>
               <l>But Leſly and the Mark-inch ſteeple.</l>

               <l>I think enjoys their Farhers hall.</l>
