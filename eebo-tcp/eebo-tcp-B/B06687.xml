            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <lg>
               <l>Of my harſh Husband, moſt unkind,</l>

               <l>As by the ſequel you ſhall hear,</l>
               <l>No Mortal e're was ſo ſevere.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>My birth and education ſhows,</l>
               <l>I was not qualify'd for blows;</l>
               <l>Yet I ſo many did receive,</l>
               <l>That night and day my ſoul did grieve.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>My Parents had no Child but I,</l>
               <l>Therefore their care continually,</l>
               <l>Was ſtill to have me marry'd well;</l>
               <l>Yet under Fortune's frowns I fell.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>A wretched Miſer marry'd me,</l>
               <l>Whoſe age was threefore years and three,</l>
               <l>And I no more than ſeventeen;</l>
               <l>Would I his face had never ſeen.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Before we long had marry'd been,</l>
               <l>This aged Miſer did begin</l>
               <l>To have ſome jealous thoughts of me,</l>
               <l>And then began my miſery.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>When I abroad with him did go,</l>
               <l>Perhaps to ſee a Friend, or ſo,</l>
               <l>If any Man ſaluted me,</l>
               <l>It ſtrait encreas'd his jealouſie.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>And then at night when we come home,</l>
               <l>He would with rage and fury foam,</l>
               <l>Nay, likewiſe kick and ſpurn me too,</l>
               <l>While my poor limbs were black and blew.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>I wonder'd at the cauſe of this,</l>
               <l>Or what he found ſo far amiſs,</l>
               <l>Which ſhould create ſuch hateful ſtrife,</l>
               <l>For I was weary of my life.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>At length I found the miſchief bred</l>
               <l>Within his aged jealous head,</l>
               <l>And thereupon I found a way,</l>
               <l>His rage and malice to allay.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Soon after this, we went one night</l>
               <l>To reap the pleaſures of delight,</l>
               <l>Among ſome Friends in merriment,</l>
               <l>The which did cauſe much diſcontent.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>A Squire drank a glaſs to me,</l>
               <l>I pledg'd the Youth in modeſty,</l>
               <l>Thinking no harm, yet ne'ertheleſs,</l>
               <l>He did my ſides and ſhoulders dreſs.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>His bitter blows I could not bear,</l>
               <l>Therefore next morning, I declare,</l>
               <l>VVile he was ſleeping faſt in bed,</l>
               <l>I with a ladle broke his head.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>VVith that he ſtarts and ſtares about,</l>
               <l>I ſtood couragious, fierce and ſtout,</l>
               <l>Crying, I'll never be your Slave;</l>
               <l>VVith that another bang I gave.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>He with a cudgel run at me,</l>
               <l>I took a club as well as he,</l>
               <l>Crying, I am reſolv'd to try</l>
               <l>VVho ſhall be Maſter you or I.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>I gave him not a minute's reſt,</l>
               <l>But round the room the Rogue I dreſt,</l>
               <l>At length I brought him to his knees,</l>
               <l>Henceforth I'll never you diſpleaſe.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>This was his cry, ſtill o're and o're:</l>
               <l>Quoth I, VVill you he jealous more?</l>
               <l>No, no, I wont, ſweet loving VVife,</l>
               <l>If thou'lt be pleas'd to ſpare my life.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Pray keep your word, I then reply'd,</l>
               <l>Or elſe, adsfoot, I'll thraſh your hide;</l>
               <l>You muſt not think that I'll be fool'd,</l>
               <l>Or in the leaſt be over-rul'd.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Thus I my Husband did ſubdue,</l>
               <l>I'faith I made him buckle too,</l>
               <l>Now ever ſince the truth to tell,</l>
               <l>VVith him I live exceeding well.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>He never offers now to fight,</l>
               <l>But calls me love and hearts delight;</l>
               <l>Thus, loving Neighbours, you may ſee,</l>
               <l>I cur'd him of his jealouſie.</l>
