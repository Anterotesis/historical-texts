         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>UNDER GOD; Humbly Deſiring His BLESSING to this Famous and Wonderful Never-failing CORDIAL DRINK OF THE WORLD, The Great PRESERVER of Mankind. A SECRET Far Beyond any Thing YET KNOWN TO THE WORLD. Never Publiſhed by any but by me <hi>Thomas Hinde</hi> G. in <hi>London,</hi> Moſt Approved and Admirable for its EXCELLENT VERTUES AND USES.</head>
            <p>To be ſatisfied of the Truth, Pray Read this PREFACE.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This is to give notice to all Perſons, That they may not be deceived by the bold and injurious abuſes of ſeveral Pretenders, ſtarted up of late, (ſince the publiſhing of my Bills) which doth now moſt falſly lay claim to the Practice of this my Never-Failing-Cordial: and to prevent further fraud of theſe ſeveral Counterfeits; I have with full power ordered and confirmed my Eldeſt Brother Mr.</hi> John Hinde <hi>to be my ſucceſſor, and the faithful true preparer of my Cordial as my own ſelf; and to diſpoſe and put to ſale my Cordial as he ſhall approve and ſee fit, (and for the general Benefit of all) he doth ſell it at his own houſe, as at the end of my Bills will fully direct you, and the Price of each Bottle; (And is ſold no where elſe in</hi> YORK.)</p>
            <p>☞ <hi>And that you may know (that I</hi> Thomas Hinde <hi>am the true Author) I would fain know of theſe three New Upſtarts, [If they would be the true Authors] where were they, their Books or Bills of the</hi> GOUT, <hi>and other Diſtempers, before I Publiſhed mine? * But that they cannot produce, &amp;c. Therefore, I have, for prevention of all Pretenders and Counterfeits, ſet my Seal on my Bottles, being the Wounded Hinde with</hi> T. H. <hi>incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed in a Lawrel, that none may be Deceived by taking the Wounded Hinde with</hi> S. W. <hi>incompaſſed in a Lawrel, (which I declare to be none of mine) but a New Upſtart, as the other Pretenders mentioned in my Directions: Therefore look well to the Seal on my Bottles; for the Counterfeiting of it is daily Attempted to the Diſpleaſure of many that has been Deceived, and brought into great danger thereby. And though my Bills and Directions are now Counterfeited, and ſet forth in Books and Bills to Deceive the People; yet notwithſtanding, if they have it at my truſty Friend Mr.</hi> John Hindes <hi>Houſe, they * cannot be deceived.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But of late one boldly takes upon him to make uſe of my Cures in the words of my Bills and Directions, and ſets them forth in his own Name, and wilely under the Notion of the People, and injurious abuſe of my Name, so diſgorge inveterately his deſigned malice, ſpight and envy, with cloſe and great deceit againſt my ſucceſsful Proceedings, and great Cures atteſted by the People, and not only ſo, but willfully inventeth what he will, and uſeth endeavors to defame me too, and this to draw his purpoſe about, by amuſing the People, to bring a reputation on his Liquor, by maligning of my Never Failing-Cordial, which is above the Malice of a Libeller, where I am known, and where I am not, let my Cordial plead for it ſelf and me, — againſt ſuch known new Upſtarts, that would, if poſſible, Aſſume the Body of the Dead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>** <hi>As for his near driven ſhift, with hardy Brazen Brow, to ſay moſt impudently that he taught me, and that my Cordial which I ſold in the Country, I bought it of him, &amp;c.</hi> (☞ <hi>can be proved notorious falſe) for it is impoſſible that ſuch an Illiterate Fellow could teach that [which himſelf never knew] or ſell me that, which he could never make, Or I to Juſtifie his falſe Tranſactions, that has filched the very words of my Cures out of my Bills and Directions, and falſly ſets them down, as his (own)</hi> &amp;c.—<hi>and thus he has Poſted himſelf as a Mark, that all that Runs may Read a Libeller (a Fellow of no Value) not worth the anſwering, for he finding his Forgeries not at all Credited, has bodly preſumed to Print them with Allowance (which is ſince proved falſe to his face) ſo 'tis like he may hire Vouchers to Swear he is the Man right or wrong, as well as Impudence, to imploy ſuch deſperate Hectors of the Quill, as value not to Stab any mans Reputation for half a Crown.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>My laborious Travels in divers forraign Countries, and great pains above Twenty years is truly well known, and how curiouſly inquiſitive I was in the great concernment of Health, as now effectually appeareth, &amp;c.

               <p>Who may and would be helped, I have ſet forth this, to inform the wonderful Effects that have been wrought by this Cordial Spirit, and abundantly Teſtified at large by many, which this Bill cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, to give all ſorts of Perſons full ſatisfaction of its Innocent and wonderful Operation in the whole Body of Man; but for brevity ſake I have here omitted.</p>
               <p>☞ And (to ſatisfie the Curioſity of ſome) I do faithfully promiſe all Perſons, That my Cordial is not made by any Chymical preparations; neither is it offenſive to Nature, as ſome doth boldly affirm, to hold up their particular intereſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>—but this my Cordial <hi>is ſo ſafe, and ſo truly prepared,</hi> and does Taſte ſo Pleaſant, * <hi>That the leaſt Child may take it, Sick or Well,</hi> Winter or Summer. I have inſerted nothing but what my Cordial <hi>will not fail to Cure,</hi> AS EXPERIENCE HATH FOUND upon Men, Women, and Children, and doth find true to the End. And to prevent all doubts, that you may be certain and fully aſſured never to be deceived by any dangerous Counterfeits, I have with full power ordered and confirmed my Eldeſt Brother Mr. <hi>John Hinde</hi> to be my Succeſſor, and the Faithful true preparer of my Cordial as my own ſelf, and to diſpoſe and put to ſale my Cordial to whom he ſhall approve and ſee fit. For he was the very firſt that ever ſold it, from the very firſt time that ever it was Made, for he and I only knew, &amp;c. and after that, the jugling deceivers crept in. But to prevent the prejudice of many Poor Creatures languiſhing under grievous Diſtempers, that they may not be brought into great dangers by unknown cheating traſh, as hath been affirmed to me by ſeveral Perſons. And with prodigious impious impudence, doth not only Counterfeit my Bills and Directions in Print, but the Seal on my Bottles too, therefore to prevent the great deceit of ſuch Notorious Counterfeits. * I do aſſure the World, that THOMAS HINDES Famous and Never-Failing-Cordial Faithfully prepared, is no where elſe to be had, but at Mr. <hi>John Hindes</hi> Houſe on the Pavement, at the ſign of the Hand and Pen, and no where elſe in <hi>York,</hi> at Six ſhillings the Pint Bottle, and Three ſhillings the half Pint Bottle. And if you have it at the aboveſaid Houſe, you cannot be miſtaken, but may be aſſured it is right, and at all times ſhall have it as pure and good as out of my own hands. With Directions at large in Print for the Uſe of it, and for the Conveniency of all to ſave Charges, <hi>and bid farewel to their former ways for ever.</hi> A Happy Rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, and a Bleſſed Remedy.</p>
