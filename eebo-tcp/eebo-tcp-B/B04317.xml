         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Laſt Speech of Sir GODFREY M'CULLOCH of <hi>Myretoun,</hi> Knight and Baronet, who was Beheaded at the Croſs of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> 
               <date>the Twenty Sixth day of <hi>March,</hi> 1697.</date>
            </head>
            <p>I Am brought here good People to give Satisfaction to Juſtice, for the Slaughter of <hi>William Gordon</hi> deſigned of <hi>Cardines;</hi> And therefore I am obliged as a dying Man, to give a Faithfull and True Account of that matter.</p>
            <p>I do declare in the Sight of GOD, I had no deſign againſt his Life, nor did <hi>I</hi> expect to ſee him, when I came where the Accident happened; I came there contrair to my Inclination, being preſſed by theſe two Perſons, who were the Principal Witneſſes againſt me, (they declaring he was not out of Bed) that I might relieve their Goods he had poinded; I do freely forgive them, and I Pray heartily GOD may forgive them, for bringing me to that place.</p>
            <p>When I was in <hi>England,</hi> I was o<gap reason="illegible: in crease" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t times urged by ſeveral Perſons, who declared they had Commiſſion from <hi>Caſtle-Stewart</hi> and his Lady, (now the Purſuers for my Blood) that I might give up the Papers of theſe Lands of <hi>Cardines,</hi> wherupon they promiſed not only apiece of Money, But alſo to concurr for procuring me a Remiſſion; And I have been ſeveral times ſince in the Countrie, where the Misfortune happened, and where they lived, but never troubled by any of them: Although now after they have got themſelves ſecured in theſe Lands without <gap reason="illegible: damage" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> they have been very active in the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſute, untill at laſt they have got me brought to this place.</p>
            <p>I do acknowledge my Sentence is Juſt, and does not Repine; For albei<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> it was only a ſingle Wound in the Legg, by a ſhot of ſmall Hail, which was neither intended, nor could be foreſeen to be deadly; Yet I do believe, That GOD in his Juſtice hath ſuffered me to fall in that miſerable Accident, for which I am now to ſuffer, becauſe of my many other Great and Grievous unrepented for Sins: I do therefore heartily forgive my Judges, Accuſers, Witneſſes, and all Others who have now, or at any time Injured me, as I wiſh to be Foregiven.</p>
            <p>I Recommend my Wife, and poor Children to the Protection of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty GOD, who doth take Care of, and Provides for the Widow and Fatherleſs; And Prayes, That GOD may Stirr up and Enable their Friends and mine, to be Careful of them.</p>
            <p>I have been Branded as being a <hi>Roman Catholick,</hi> which I altogether diſown, And Declare, as the Words of a <hi>Dying Man,</hi> who am inſtantly to make my Appearance before the <hi>Great Tribunal of the Great GOD,</hi> That I die in the <hi>True Catholick Reformed Proteſtant Religion,</hi> Renouncing all Righteouſneſs of my own, or any Others; Relying only upon the Merits of <hi>CHRIST JESUS,</hi> through whoſe Blood, I hope to be Saved, And whom I Truſt, will not only be my Judge, But alſo, Advocate with the Father for my Redemption.</p>
            <p>Now Dear Spectators, As my Laſt Requeſt, <hi>Again and Again,</hi> I carnoſtly Deſire, and Begg, The Aſſiſtance of Your Fervent Prayers. That, Although I ſtand here Condemned by Man, I may be Abſolved before the <hi>Tribunal of the Great GOD,</hi> That in place of this Scaffold I may enjoy a Throne of Glory; That this Violent Death may bring me to a Life of Glorious Reſt, Eternal in the Heavens: And that in place of all theſe Spectators, I may be Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panyed with an Innumerable Company of Saints and Angels, Singing, <hi>Halle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lujah</hi> to the Great KING to all Eternity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now, O LORD, Remember me with that Love thou beareſt to Thy Own, O viſite we with Thy Salvation, that I may ſee the Good of Thy Choſen Ones, and may Glory in Thine Inheritance. LORD JESUS Purge me from all my Sins, and from this of Blood Guiltineſs, Waſh me into Thy Own Blood. Great are mine Iniquities, But Greater are the Mercies of GOD! O let me be amongſt the number of thoſe for whom CHRIST dyed; Be Thou my Advocat with the Father, Into thy hands do I recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend my Spirit: Come, LORD JESUS Come, and receive my Soul, Amen.</hi>
