            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </opener>
               <p>If the general diſtraction and confuſion which is ſpread over the whole Kingdom, doth not awaken all men to a deſire and longing that theſe wounds which have ſo many years together been kept bleeding, may be bound up, all we can ſay will be to no purpoſe; However, after this long ſilence, we have thought it our duty, to declare how much we deſire to contribute therunto: And that as we can never give over hope in good time to obtain the Poſſeſſion of that Right which GOD and Nature hath made our due, So we do make it our daily ſuit to the Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, that He will in Compaſſion to Vs and our Subjects (after ſo long miſery and ſufferings) remit us and put us into a quiet and peaceable Poſſeſſion of that Our Right, with as little blood and damage to Our people, as is poſſible; Nor do we deſire more to enjoy what is Ours, than that all our Subjects may enjoy what by Law is theirs, by a full and entire Adminiſtration of Iuſtice throughout the Land, and by extending our mercy where it is wanting and deſerved.</p>
               <p>And to the end That the fear of puniſhment may not engage any conſcious to themſelves of what is paſt, to a perſeverance in Guilt for the future, by oppoſing the quiet and happineſſe of their Country, in the reſtoration both of King, Peers and People, to their juſt ancient and fundamental Rights: We do by theſe preſents Declare, That we do grant a full and generall Pardon, which we are ready to paſs under our great Seal of <hi>England,</hi> to all our Subjects of what degree or quality ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, who within fourty dayes after the publication hereof ſhall lay hold upon this our grace and favour, and ſhall by any publick Act declare their doing ſo; And that they return to the Loyalty and Obedience of good Subjects, excepting only ſuch Perſons as ſhall hereafter be excepted by <hi>Parliament,</hi> Thoſe only excepted. Let our Subjects how faulty ſoever, relye upon the word of a King, ſolemnly given by this preſent <hi>Declaration,</hi> That no Crime what ſoever committed againſt us or our Royal Father before the publication of this, ſhall ever riſe in judgment, or be brought in queſtion againſt any of them, to the leaſt indamagment, either in their Lives, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties or Eſtates, or (as far forth lies in our power) ſo much as to the prejudice of their Reputations, by any reproach or term of diſtinction from the reſt of our beſt Subjects. We deſiring and ordaining, that hence forward all Notes of diſcord, ſeparation and difference of Parties, be utterly aboliſhed among all our Subjects, whom we invite and conjure to a perfect Vnion among themſelves under our Protection, for the reſettlement of our juſt Rights and theirs in a <hi>free Parliament;</hi> By which upon the word of a King we will be adviſed.</p>
               <p>And becauſe the paſſion and uncharitablneſſe of the times have produced ſeveral opinions in Religion, by which men are engaged in parties and animoſities againſt each other, which when they ſhall hereafter unite in a freedom of converſation will be compoſed or better underſtood: We do declare a Liberty to Tender Conſciences, and that no man ſhall be diſquieted or called in queſtion for differences of opinion in matters of Religion, which do not diſturb the Peace of the Kingdom; And that we ſhall be ready to conſent to ſuch an Act of Parliament, as upon mature Deliberation ſhall be offered to us for the full granting that indulgence: And becauſe in the continued diſtractions of ſo many years, and ſo many great Revolutions, many Grants and Purchaſes of Eſtates have béen made to and by many Officers and Soldiers, and others, who are now poſſeſſed of the ſame, and who may be liable to Actions at Law upon ſeveral Titles, We are likewiſe willing that all ſuch diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, &amp; all things relating to ſuch Grants, Sales and Purchaſes ſhall be determined in Parliament, which can beſt provide for the juſt ſatisfaction of all men who are concerned.</p>
               <p>And we, do further declare, That we will be ready to conſent to any Act or Acts of Parliament to the purpoſes aforeſaid, and for the full ſatisfaction of all Arrears due to the Officers and Souldiers of the Army, under the Command of General <hi>MONCK:</hi> And that they ſhall be received into our Service upon as good pay and conditions as they now enjoy.</p>

               <p>It cannot be believed but that We have been, are, and ever muſt be, as Solicitous as we can, by all endeavours, to improve the Affections of our good Subjects at home, and to procure the Aſſiſtance of our Friends and Allyes abroad, for the Recovery of that Right, which by the Laws of GOD and Man, is unqueſtionable; and of which we have been ſo long diſ-poſſeſſed by ſuch force, and with thoſe circumſtances, as we do not deſire to agravate by any ſharp expreſſions, but rather wiſh, That the Memory of what is paſſed, may be buried to the World. That We have more endeavoured to prepare, and to improve the Affections of Our Subjects at home, for Our Reſtoration, then to procure aſſiſtance from abroad, to invade either of Our Kingdoms, is as manifeſt to the World: And We cannot give a better evidence that We are ſtill of the ſame minde, then in this Conjuncture, when common reaſon muſt ſatisfie all men, that We cannot be without Aſſiſtance from abroad, We chooſe rather to ſend to you, who have it in your own power, to prevent that Ruine and Deſolation which a War would bring upon the Nation, and to make the whole Kingdom owe the Peace, Happineſs, Security and Glory it ſhall enjoy, to your vertue; and to acknowledge that your Armies have complyed with their obligations, for which they were firſt raiſed, for the preſervation of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion, the Honour and Dignity of the King, the Priviledges of Parliament, the Liberty and Property of the Subject, and the Fundamental Laws of the Land; and that you have vindicated that Truſt, which others moſt perfidiouſly abuſed and betrayed: How much we deſire and reſolve to contribute to thoſe good Ends, will appear to you by Our enclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>DECLARATION,</hi> which We deſire you to cauſe to be Publiſhed for the information and ſatisfaction of all good Subjects, who do not deſire a further effuſion of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Chriſtian Blood, but to have their Peace and Security founded upon that which can only ſupport it; an Unity of Affections amongſt our ſelves, an equal adminiſtration of Juſtice to Men, reſtoring Parliaments to a ful capacity of providing for all that is amiſs, and the Laws of the Land to their due veneration. You have been your ſelves Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of ſo many Revolutions, and have had ſo much experience, how far any power and authority that is onely aſſumed by paſſion and appetite, and not ſupported by Juſtice, is from providing for the Happineſſe and Peace of the People, or from receiving any obedience from them without which no Government can provide for them, that you may very reaſonably believe, that GOD hath not been well pleaſed with the Attempts that have been made, ſince He hath uſually encreaſed the Confuſion, by giving all the ſucceſſe that hath been deſired, and brought that to paſſe without effect, which the Deſigners have propoſed, as the beſt means to ſettle and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Nation; And therefore We cannot but hope and believe, that you will concur with Us in the Remedy We have applyed, which, to humane underſtanding, is only proper for the Ills we all groan under; And that you will make your ſelves the bleſſed Inſtruments to bring this bleſſing of Peace and Reconciliation upon King and People, it being the uſual method <unclear>in</unclear> which Divine Providence delighteth it ſelf, to uſe and ſanctifie thoſe very means which ill men deſign, for the ſatisfaction of private and particualr Ends and Ambition, and other wicked purpoſes, to wholſome and publick ends, and to eſtabliſh that Good which is moſt contrary to the Deſigners; which is the greateſt manifeſtation of Gods peculiar kindneſs to a Nation, that can be given in this world. How far we reſolve to preſerve your Intereſts, and reward your Services, we refer to our <hi>Declaration;</hi> and we hope God will inſpire you to perform your duty to us, and to your native Country, whoſe happineſs cannot be ſeparated from each other.</p>
