            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <l>Bring forth my Bride, or <hi>London</hi> burns,</l>
            <l>I ſwear by <hi>Acaron.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Then cries the King and Queen likewiſe,</l>
            <l>both weeping as they ſpeak,</l>
            <l>Lo, we have brought our Daughter dear,</l>
            <l>whom we are forc'd to forſake.</l>
            <l>With that ſtept out bold <hi>Robin Hood,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>crys, My Liege, it muſt not be ſo,</l>
            <l>Such Beauty as the fair Princeſs,</l>
            <l>is not for a Tyrant's <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <l>The Prince he then began ſtorm,</l>
            <l>crys, Fool, Fanatick, Baboon,</l>
            <l>How dares thou ſtop my Valour's Prize?</l>
            <l>I'll kill thee with a frown.</l>
            <l>Thou Tyrant, Turk, thou Infidel,</l>
            <l>thus <hi>Robin</hi> began to reply,</l>
            <l>Thy frowns I ſcorn, lo here's my gage,</l>
            <l>and thus I thee defie:</l>
            <l>And for thoſe two <hi>Goliahs</hi> there,</l>
            <l>that ſtand on either ſide,</l>
            <l>Here are two little <hi>Davids</hi> by,</l>
            <l>that ſoon can tame their pride.</l>

               </gap> did the King for armour ſend,</l>
            <l>for lances, ſwords and ſhields;</l>
            <l>And thus all three in armour bright</l>
            <l>came marching to the field.</l>
            <l>The trumpets began to ſound a charge,</l>
            <l>each ſingled out his Man,</l>
            <l>Their arms in pieces ſoon were hew'd,</l>
            <l>blood ſprang from every vain:</l>
            <l>The Prince he reacht <hi>Robin</hi> a blow,</l>
            <l>he ſtruck with might and main,</l>
            <l>Which forc'd him to re<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>l about the field,</l>
            <l>as though he had been ſlain.</l>
            <l>God-a-mercy, quoth <hi>Robin,</hi> for that blow,</l>
            <l>the Quarrel ſhall ſoon be try'd</l>
            <l>This ſtroke ſhall ſhew a full divorce,</l>
            <l>betwixt thee and the Bride.</l>
            <l>So from his ſhoulders he's cut his head,</l>
            <l>which on the ground did fall,</l>
            <l>And grumbling ſore at <hi>Robin Hood,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>to be ſo dealt withal.</l>
            <l>The Giants then began to rage,</l>
            <l>to ſee their Prince lie dead;</l>
            <l>Thou's be the next, quoth <hi>Little John,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>except thou well guard thy head:</l>
            <l>With that his faulchion be wherl'd about,</l>
            <l>it was both keen and ſharp.</l>
            <l>He clove the Giant to the belt,</l>
            <l>and cut in twain his heart.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Will. Scadlock</hi> well had play'd his part,</l>
            <l>the Giant he brought to his knee,</l>
            <l>Quoth he, The Devil cannot break his faſt,</l>
            <l>unleſs he have you all three:</l>
            <l>So with his faulchion he run him through,</l>
            <l>a deep and gaſhly wound,</l>
            <l>who dam'd and foam'd, curſt and blaſphem'd,</l>
            <l>and then fell to the ground,</l>
            <l>Now all the liſts with ſheets were fill'd,</l>
            <l>the skies they did reſound,</l>
            <l>Which brought the Princeſs to herſelf,</l>
            <l>who was fal'n in a ſwound.</l>
            <l>The King, and Queen, and Princeſs fair,</l>
            <l>came walking to the place,</l>
            <l>And gave the Champions many thanks,</l>
            <l>and did them further grace.</l>
            <l>Tell me, quoth the King, whence you are</l>
            <l>that thus diſguiſed came,</l>
            <l>Whoſe valour ſpeaks that noble blood</l>
            <l>doth run through every vain?</l>
            <l>A boon, a boon, quoth <hi>Robin Hood,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>on my knees I beg and crave.</l>
            <l>By my Crown, quoth the King, I grant,</l>
            <l>ask what, and thou ſhalt have.</l>
            <l>Then pardon I beg for my merry Men,</l>
            <l>which are within the green-wood,</l>
            <l>For <hi>Little John,</hi> and <hi>Will. Scadlock,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>and for me bold <hi>Robin Hood,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Art thou <hi>Robin Hood</hi> then? quoth the King,</l>
            <l>for the valour you have ſhown,</l>
            <l>Your pardons I do freely grant,</l>
            <l>and welcome every one.</l>
            <l>The Priceſs I promiſed the Victor's Prize,</l>
            <l>ſhe cannot have you all three:</l>
            <l>She ſhall chuſe, quoth <hi>Robin;</hi> ſaith <hi>Little John,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Then little ſhare falls to me.</l>
            <l>Then did the Princeſs view all three,</l>
            <l>with a comely lovely grace,</l>
            <l>Who took <hi>Will. Scadlock</hi> by the hand,</l>
            <l>quoth, Here I make my choice.</l>
            <l>With that a noble Lord ſ<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ept forth,</l>
            <l>of <hi>Maxfield</hi> Earl was he,</l>
            <l>Who lookt <hi>Will. Scadlock</hi> in the face,</l>
            <l>then wept moſt bitterly:</l>
            <l>Quoth he, I had a Son like thee,</l>
            <l>whom I lov'd wondrous well,</l>
            <l>But he is gone, or rather dead,</l>
            <l>his name is young <hi>Gamwell.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Then did <hi>Will. Scadlock</hi> fall on his knees,</l>
            <l>cries, Father, Father, here,</l>
            <l>Here kneels your Son, your young <hi>Gamwell,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>you ſaid you lov'd ſo dear.</l>
            <l>But, Lord! what inbracing and kiſſing was there,</l>
            <l>when all theſe Friends were met:</l>
            <l>They are gone to the wedding, and ſo to bedding,</l>
            <l>and ſo I did you good night.</l>
