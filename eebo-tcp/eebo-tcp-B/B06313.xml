            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>COncerning the surprising of the Kings Commissioners at <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> it was brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thus:</p>
            <p>The Generall being marched from the Leaguer <hi>Westward,</hi> upon some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended designes that way; left <hi>Sherburne</hi> still suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently besiedged. And the Enemy seeing their friends straitned in the Castle? Used meanes for some addresses to bee made to the King, for some course to be taken for their reliefe, and procured a Letter from the King to that purpose, which was sent to his Agents of the Club-men to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther strength, for the raising of the siedge, upon Sir <hi>Thomas Fairefaxes</hi> advance.</p>
            <p>The leaders of the Clubmen, receiving these Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters from the King, met at <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> on <hi>Saturday</hi> the 2 of <hi>August,</hi> 1645, to consult what course to take,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:113135:3"/>
for the effecting thereof; and having their instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ready, some observations were made, that they were not full enough for the carrying of of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe, and that therefore three more might be deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on to be added.</p>
            <p>But the meane while Sir <hi>Thomas Fairefax</hi> hearing of the proceedings of the Club-men; doubted that if they should goe on, it might impede the proceedings of those he had left before <hi>Sherburne,</hi> for the taking thereof; where were in the Leaguer, Colonell <hi>Picke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring</hi> with a Brigade of 2000 foot, and Colonell <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leyes</hi> Regiment of Horse; to whom the Generall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned the same day (being <hi>Saturday</hi>) to <hi>Sherburne,</hi> where he himselfe come, and tooke up his head quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; and from whence hee immediatly sent Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel <hi>Fleetwood</hi> with his owne, and Colonels <hi>Walleyes</hi> Regiments of Horse, to goe to <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> to oppose the Kings Commissioners Iesuiticall designe.</p>
            <p>With those two Regiments Collonel <hi>Fleetwood</hi> marched to <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> and so devided his Forces, that when he came before the Towne, he set one part to surround the Towne, whilest the rest marched into <hi>Sherburne,</hi> where the Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners were then sitting and surprised them all, not one of them escaping him; And they were all brought in Prisoners this day to the Generall to <hi>Sherburne,</hi> where they were all examined one by one; I have sent you the List of all their names many of them are malignant Priests, and all of them notable sticklers for the enemy in these parts.</p>

            <head>A Relation of the routing and dispersing of 2500 Club-men, by Leiutenant Generall Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well, that were gathered in a Body in Batalia upon Hambleton-Hill neere Blanford.</head>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>FOR my last, it was but in part of what (God be thanked) is since perfected; For since the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in of the Commissioners I then gave you an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of, which were the Malignant heads of the Club-men; we have now broken and routed the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy also, the manner thus;</p>
            <p>The Club-men sent (on the Lords day at night) to have their Leaders delivered to them, and caused their Bells to be rung in all places, and Alarms to be given in their usuall way of rising, and this morning about 2500. instantly met at <hi>Hambleton-Hill</hi> with their Colours which were all White, (for they had got white silken Colours) and their Drums, and seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Weapons, Muskets, Pikes, Pisto's, Birding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peeces, Bills, Halberts, and many severall Weapons and had drawn themselves into a body.</p>
            <p>Leiutenant Generall <hi>Cromwell</hi> with 500. Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goones, and 500. more in a reserve to march after them, marched out from the Leaguer towards the Club-men, and facing them, they drew into Batalia and stood in a great and ancient Roman worke which is upon those hills, and admitted a Parley.</p>
            <p>Lieutenant Generall <hi>Crumwell</hi> demanded of them the reason of their rising, they answered to redeeme
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:113135:4"/>
their heads, requiring the Commissioners to be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to them, and then they said, they would return, home, but without their Leaders they would not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.</p>
            <p>Lieut: Gen: <hi>Cromwell</hi> returned answer, that they had them Prisoners: and that they were to answer for what they had done; and that they were at <hi>Sherburne</hi> with the Generall, and made a very full and worthy speech to them, to perswade them to be wise and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne home in peace; shewing them how they have been misled by a company of Malignants: and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring what care the Generall had taken to secure their estates, and settle peace amongst them and what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort they found, that submitted thereunto.</p>
            <p>But the Club-men were very unruly; vapouring, and protesting, pounctually to rescue, and redeeme their Leaders, (&amp; indeed, they are the very notorious ringleaders of the Malignants of these parts) but the moderate party (especially about <hi>Sommersetshire</hi>) doe much deride their folly.</p>
            <p>Lievttenant Generall <hi>Cromwell</hi> took great paines to appease them without shedding of blood, but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing would satisfie them, but to have (their Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders) their Heads, delivered to them.</p>
            <p>Whereupon, the Club-men being in <hi>Battalia,</hi> Leivtenant General <hi>Cromwel</hi> drew up his Forces and charged them with the 500. Dragoons, and slew some 12 of them, wounded ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, tooke some 2 or 300 Prisoners, of the most notorious of them, and routed and dispersed the rest, who fled all home, leauing their Colours, and their Armes behinde them. And we hope that now they will no more trouble us so againe.</p>
