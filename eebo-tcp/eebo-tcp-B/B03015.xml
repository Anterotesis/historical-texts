            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Which Committees, or any two or more of them, ſhall have power and authority to value all kinde of Proviſions both for Men and Horſe, all kinde of Horſe for Service or otherwiſe, which ſhall be voluntarily offered to be lent upon the Publike Faith, or likewiſe to receive any Money or Plate to be lent as before; and that upon Certificate of any two of ſuch Committees, the ſame proviſions of Horſes, Money, and Plate, and the value thereof ſhall be entred by the Treaſurer of the Propoſitions, and ſhall be repayed to the party from whom the ſame was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, with like Conſideration as other Money lent.</p>
               <p>And in caſe the owners of ſuch proviſions, Money, Plate, and Horſes, ſhall refuſe or neglect to bring in the ſame upon

Publike Faith, for the uſe of the Army, for the better prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſpoyle and embezeling of ſuch proviſions of Money, Plate, and Horſes, by the diſorder of the Souldiers, and that they may not come into the hands of the Enemies, It is further ordered, That the Committees afore mentioned, or any two of them, be hereby authorized and enabled to ſend for ſuch Proviſions, Money, Plate, and Horſes, and take the ſame into their cuſtody, and to ſet an indifferent value and rate upon them; which value they ſhall certifie to the Treaſurers for the Propoſitions, to be repaid at ſuch time, and in ſuch manner, as ſhall be Ordered by both Houſes of Parliament. It is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe Ordered, That the ſaid Committees of the ſeverall and reſpective Counties ſhall meet and conſult with the Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tees of the adjacent and neighbour Counties, unto the place or places where the ſaid Army, or any part thereof, ſhall paſſe and remain, concerning the receiving, procuring, valuing, and diſpoſing of ſuch proviſions, Horſes, Money, and Plate. And if they cannot conveniently meet, that then it ſhall be lawfull for any two, or more of the Committee, to execute the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Services above mentioned in the adjoyning Counties, as well as in the County wherein he is named a Committee; and that ſuch certificates as they ſhall make of any Proviſions, Horſes, Money, or Plate, ſhall be as effectuall for the ſecurities of the parties, as if the ſame were received and taken within the County for which he or they are named Committees. And the ſaid Committees, or any two, or more of them, ſhall cauſe the ſaid proviſions to be delivered to the Commiſſary for the Victuals, or to his Deputy, and ſuch other Officers of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, who may be charged with the ſame upon their accompt, and ſhall certifie the Treaſurer of the Army, or his Deputy, that ſo defalcation of the value thereof may be made out of the pay of ſuch Officers and Souldiers as ſhall receive the ſame.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>t would not be beleeved (at leaſt great pains have been taken that it might not) that the pretended Ordinance of the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia</hi> (the firſt attempt that ever was to make a Law by Ordinance without Our conſent) or the keeping Vs out of <hi>Hull,</hi> and taking Our Arms and Muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from Vs, could any way concern the Intereſt, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, or Liberty of the Subject, and it was confeſſed by that deſperate Declaration it ſelf of the <hi>26,</hi> of <hi>May,</hi> that if they were found guilty of that charge of deſtroying the title and intereſt of Our Subjects to their Lands and Goods, it were indeed a very great Crime. But it was a ſtrange fatall Lethargy which had ſeized Our good People, and kept them from diſcerning, that the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, Gentry, Commonalty of <hi>England,</hi> were not onely ſtripped of their Preeminences and Priviledges, but of their Liberties and Eſtates, when Our juſt Rights were denyed Vs; and that no Subject could from thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth expect to dwell at home, when We were driven from Our Houſes and Our Towns. It was not poſſible, that a Commiſſion could be granted to the Earle of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> to raiſe an Army againſt Vs, and for the ſafety of Our
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:175215:13"/>
Perſon, and preſervation of the Peace of the Kingdom, to purſue, kill &amp; ſtay Vs and all who wiſh well to Vs, but that in a ſhort time inferior Commanders, by the ſame Authority, would require Our good Subjects for the maintenance of the Property of the Subject, to ſupply them with ſuch ſummes of Money as they think fit, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the penalty of being Plundred withall extremity of War (as the ſtile of Sir <hi>Edward Baytons</hi> Warrant runs againſt Our poore Subjects in <hi>Wiltſhire</hi>) and by ſuch Rules of unlimited Arbitrary Power, as are incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the leaſt pretence or ſhadow of that Property it would ſeem to defend.</p>
            <p>If there could be yet any underſtanding ſo unskilfull and Supine to beleeve, That theſe Diſturbers of the publike peace do intend any thing but a generall confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they have brought them a ſad Argument to their own doores to convince them; after this Ordinance and Declaration, 'tis not in any ſober mans power to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve himſelf worth any thing, or that there is ſuch a thing as Law, Liberty, Property left in <hi>England,</hi> under the Iurisdiction of theſe men, and the ſame power that robbs them now of the Twentieth part of their Eſtates, hath by that but made a claime and entitled it ſelf to the other Ninteen, when it ſhall be thought fit to haſten the generall ruine. Sure, if the minds of all men be not ſtubbornly prepared for Servitude, they will looke on this Ordinance as the greateſt Prodigie of Arbitrary Power and Tyranny that any Age hath brought forth in any Kingdom; other Grievances (and the greateſt) have been conceived intolerable, rather by the Logique and Conſequence, then by the Preſſure it ſelf, this at once ſweeps away all that the Wiſdom and Iuſtice of Parliaments have provided for them. Is their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty in their Eſtates (ſo carefully looked to by their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:175215:13"/>
and ſo amply eſtabliſhed by Vs againſt any poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of Invaſion from the Crown) which makes the meaneſt Subject as much a Lord of his own as the greateſt Peer, to be valued or conſidered? here is a Twentieth part of every mans Estate (or ſo much more as four men will pleaſe to call the Twentieth part) taken away at once, and yet a Power left to take a Twentieth ſtill of that which remains, and this to be levied by ſuch circumſtances of ſeverity, as no Act of Parliament ever conſented to. Is their liberty which diſtinguiſhes Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects from Slaves, and in which this free-born Nation hath the Advantage of all Chriſtendom, dear to them? they ſhall not onely be impriſoned in ſuch places of this Kingdom, (a latitude of Iudgement no Court can chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge to it ſelf in any Caſes) but for ſo long time as the Committee of the houſe of Commons for examination ſhall appoint and order; the Houſe of Commons it ſelf having never aſſumed, or in the leaſt degree pretended to a power of Iudicature, having no more Authority to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter an Oath (the onely way to diſcover and finde out the truth of facts) to, then to cut off the heads of any of Our Subjects; and this Committee being ſo far from being a part of the Parliament, that it is deſtructive to the whole, by uſurping to it ſelf all the power of King, Lords, &amp; Commons. All who know any thing of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, know, That a Committee of either Houſe ought not by the Law to publiſh their own Reſults, neither are their concluſions of any force without the Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Houſe, which hath the ſame power of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trolling them as if the matter had never been debated; but that any Committee ſhould be ſo contracted (as this of Examination, a ſtile no Committee ever bore before this Parliament) as to exclude the Members of the Houſe, who are equally truſted by their Countrey, from
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:175215:14"/>
being preſent at the Counſells, is ſo monſtrous to the Priviledges of Parliament, that it is no more in the power of any man to give up that freedom, then of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to order, That from that time the place for which he ſerves, ſhall never more ſend a Knight or Burgeſſe to the Parliament; and in truth is no leſſe then to alter the whole frame of Government, to pull up Parliaments by the Roots, and to commit the Lives, Liberties, and Eſtates of all the People of <hi>England</hi> to the Arbitrary power of a few unqualified Perſons, who ſhall diſpoſe thereof according to their diſcretion, without account to any Rule or Authority whatſoever.</p>
            <p>Are their Friends, their Wives, and Children (the greateſt bleſſings of Peace and the comforts of Life) pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious to them? would even their penury and impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be leſſe grievous by thoſe cordialls? they ſhall be devorced from them, baniſhed, and ſhall no longer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main within the Cities of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> the Suburbs and the Counties adjacent; and how far thoſe adjacent Counties ſhall extend no man knows.</p>
            <p>Is there any thing now left to enjoy, but Liberty to Rebell, and deſtroy one another? are the outward bleſſings onely of Peace, Property, and Liberty taken, and forced from Our Subjects? are their Conſciences free and unaſſaulted by the violence of theſe fire-brands? ſure the Liberty and freedom of Conſcience cannot ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer by theſe men: Alaſſe! all theſe puniſhments are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed upon them, becauſe they will not ſubmit to Actions contrary to their naturall Loyalty, to their Oathes of Allegiance and Supremacy, and to their late volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Proteſtation, which obliges them to the care of Our Perſon and Our juſt Rights. Now many Perſons of Honour, Quality, and Reputation of the ſeverall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>England,</hi> are now Impriſoned, without any ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection

againſt them, but ſuſpicion of their Loyalty? how many of the graveſt and moſt ſubſtantiall Citizens of <hi>London,</hi> by whom the Government and Diſcipline of that City was preſerved, are diſgraced, robbed, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned, without any Proceſſe of Law, or colour of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation, but of obedience to the Law and Government of the Kingdom? whileſt Anabaptiſts and Browniſts, with the aſſiſtance of vicious and deboſhed Perſons, of deſperate Fortunes, take upon them to break up and rifle houſes, as publike and avowed Miniſters of a new in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented Authority: How many godly, pious, and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Divines, whoſe Lives and Learning hath made them of reverend, Eſtimation, are now ſtandered with inclination to Popery, diſcountenanced, and impriſoned, for diſcharging their Conſciences in inſtructing the People in the Chriſtian duty of Religion and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, whileſt Shiſmaticall, Illiterate, and Scandalous Preachers till the Pulpits and Churches with Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy. Irreverence, and Treaſon, and incite their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditory to nothing but Murther and Rebellion. We paſſe over the vulgar charm, by which they have captivated ſuch who have been contented to diſpence with their Conſciences for the preſervation of their Eſtates, and by which they perſwade men cheerfully to part with this twentieth part of their Eſtate to the good work in hand, for whoever will give what he hath, may ſcape robbing; <hi>They ſhall be repaid upon the Publike Faith, as all other Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys lent upon the Propoſitions of both Houſes</hi>; It may be ſo, but men muſt be condemned to a ſtrange unthrifti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe who will lend upon ſuch Security. The Publike Faith indeed is as great an earneſt as the State can give, and engages the Honour, Reputation and Honeſty of the Nation, and is the Act of the Kingdom, 'tis the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of the King, the Lords and Commons, which can
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:175215:16"/>
never need an Executor, can never dye, never be Bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, and therefore We willingly conſented to it for the Indemnity of Our good Subjects of <hi>Scotland,</hi> (who We hope will not thinke the worse of it for being ſo often &amp; ſo cheaply mentioned ſince.) But that a Vote of one or both Houſes ſhould be an engagement upon the Publike Faith, is as impoſſible, as that the Committee of the House of Commons for Examinations, ſhould be the High Court of Parliament.</p>
            <p>And what is or can be ſaid with the leaſt ſhadow of reason to juſtifie theſe Extravagances? We have not lately heard of the old fundamentall Laws which uſed to warrant the Innovations, this needs a Refuge even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low thoſe foundations: They will ſay they cannot man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage their great undertakings without ſuch extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary wayes; We think ſo too, but that proves onely they have undertaken ſomewhat they ought not to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take, not that it is lawfull for them to do any thing that is convenient for those ends: We remembred them long agoe, and We cannot do it too often, of that excellent Speech of <hi>M. Pyms: The law is that which puts a difference betwixt good and evill, betwixt juſt and unjuſt if you take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the Law, all things will fall into a confuſion, every man will become a Law unto himſelf, which in the depraved con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of humane nature, muſt needs produce many great enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, Luſt will become a Law, and Envy will become a Law, Covetouſneſſe and Ambition will become Laws, and what Dictates, what Deciſions ſuch Laws will produce may eaſi1y be diſcerned.</hi> It may indeed by the ſad Inſtances over the whole Kingdom: But will Poſterity beleeve, that in the ſame Parliament this Doctrine was avowed with that Acclamation, and theſe Inſtances after produced; That in the ſame Parliament ſuch care was taken that no man ſhould be committed in what caſe ſoever, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
