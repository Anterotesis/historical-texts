            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>Who was it ſeems a young honeſt poor Taylor,</l>
               <l>which was not able to give her content;</l>
               <l>At length ſhe met with a jolly Kriſh Sailor,</l>
               <l>and to a Tabern they lovingly went.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>My deareſt Creature, ſaid he, I had rather</l>

               <l>home to the Tailor my Dear ſhall not go:</l>
               <l>We will enjoy all the raptures of pleaſure,</l>
               <l>a ſweeter Creature ſure never was known;</l>
               <l>I will endow thee with part my Treaſure,</l>
               <l>and let the Tailor this Night lye alone.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>As he the Charms of this Jilt did admire,</l>
               <l>and e'ery beautifull Feature adore,</l>
               <l>She did immediately grant his deſire,</l>
               <l>thinking there by for to riſle his flore:</l>
               <l>Said the I'll ſetze all the Cargo about him,</l>
               <l>and then his Courage will ſurely be laid,</l>
               <l>And down the Stairs I will ſoon ſteel without him</l>
               <l>for it is reaſon I ſhould be well paid.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The Seaman never fear'd rock, wind, nor weather,</l>
               <l>which the young Female the cunnſngly ſaw,</l>
               <l>And as they both did ſit drinking together,</l>
               <l>out from his Fob ſhe his Guinea's did draw,</l>
               <l>And the young Seaman he chanc'd to perceive her</l>
               <l>yet not a title or word did he ſay:</l>
               <l>Thought he, I now am reſolved to leave her</l>
               <l>in ſad neration, before Morning-day.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>She had no ſooner laid hold of the Booty,</l>
               <l>but down the Stairs ſhe was ready to go;</l>
               <l>Said the young Seaman, my amorous Beauty,</l>
               <l>we'll call the Drawer, it muſt not be ſo.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>This Seaman called for ſome of Canary,</l>
               <l>which was ſufficient to keep out the cold,</l>
               <l>Thus for a while they were heartily merry,</l>
               <l>for why? His pockets were lined with Gold,</l>
               <l>Thus enterthanging their tender Embraces,</l>
               <l>while in the Cavern together they ſtay'd,</l>
               <l>Still he admir'd her amorous Braces,</l>
               <l>and like two Lovers together they play'd.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Seeing alas! ſhe could not be admitted,</l>
