         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>'TIS <hi>Vertue</hi> which alone ſupports the <hi>whole,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>For without that the World's without a Soul,</l>
               <l>Moſt certain then, as that grows faint and weak,</l>
               <l>Th' eternal Chain decays; at laſt muſt break:</l>
               <l>When great <hi>Cooke</hi> fell the Jarring Links did twang,</l>
               <l>And Nature ſigh'd as if ſhe felt the Pang:</l>
               <l>Nor is it ſtrange,—for Vertue was his guide,</l>
               <l>With him it flouriſh'd, and with him it dy'd;</l>
               <l>Not all—ſome Lagging Atoms yet remain,</l>
               <l>To guard Mankind, and prop the ſinking Frame.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>In War he was nurs'd up, Arms his delight;</l>
               <l>Gentle in Peace, and Terrible in Fight:</l>
               <l>Death he had ſeen in various ſhapes, but none</l>
               <l>Cou'd move him to be fearfull of his own:</l>
               <l>Nor did old Age abate the Martial Flame,</l>
               <l>'Twas always great, and always was the ſame.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>His <hi>Charity</hi> did equally extend</l>
               <l>To cheriſh the diſtreſs'd and ſerve his Friend.</l>
               <lg>
                  <l>When he did good (and who his Life ſurveys,</l>
                  <l>Will find he did delight in't all his Days.)</l>
                  <l>'Twas for the ſake of good, and not for Praiſe.</l>
               </lg>
               <l>Great though he was, yet he was lowly too;</l>
               <l>Meekneſs gains more repute than Pride can doe.</l>
               <l>Reſtleſs Ambition ne're his Thoughts employ'd;</l>
               <l>Peace and Content he ſought, and thoſe enjoy'd,</l>
               <l>Vertue he priz'd, though 'twere in Rags enſhrin'd;</l>
               <l>He look't not on the Perſon but the Mind.</l>
               <l>His Judgment was unbyaſt, firm and ſtrong,</l>
               <l>His Converſation pleaſant, gay and young;</l>
               <l>But then his Mirth was ſtill from folly free,</l>
               <l>And ſuch as Nuns without a bluſh might be.</l>
               <lg>
                  <l>And, as when <hi>Tygers</hi> range the Woods for Prey,</l>
                  <l>And chance to meet a <hi>Lion</hi> in their way,</l>
                  <l>Straight they forget their rage, and learnt t' obey;</l>
               </lg>
               <l>So Atheous men, though they blaſphem'd before,</l>
               <l>Aw'd with his preſence, bluſh't and ſaid no more:</l>
               <l>For <hi>Piety</hi> was ſtill his conſtant Gueſt,</l>
               <l>And found its full Perfection in his Breaſt.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Such was his Life—and now his Death we'll ſhew,</l>
               <l>His Death, the greater wonder of the two!</l>
               <l>For when the fatal Pangs were drawing on,</l>
               <l>And the laſt Sands were eager to be gone,</l>
               <l>When all his Friends lay drown'd in Tears of Grief,</l>
               <l>Wiſhing, but yet deſpairing of Relief;</l>
               <l>Ev'n he alone his <hi>Change</hi> with Patience bore,</l>
               <l>Like all the Changes of his Life before;</l>
               <lg>
                  <l>And with a <hi>Cheerfulneſs</hi> too great to tell,</l>
                  <l>A <hi>Cheerfulneſs</hi> that does all thought excell,</l>
                  <l>At his laſt gaſp he cry'd, <hi>I'me well! I'me well!</hi>
