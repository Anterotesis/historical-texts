         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <l>CUſtom, which every where bears mighty Sway,</l>
            <l>Brings me to Act the Orator to Day:</l>
            <l>But Woman, you will ſay, are ill at Speeches,</l>
            <l>'Tis true, and therefore I appear in Breeches:</l>
            <l>Not for Example to you City-Wives,</l>
            <l>That by Preſcription's ſettled for your Lives.</l>
            <l>Was it for Gain the Husband firſt conſented?</l>
            <l>
               <note place="margin">Making Horns with her Hands over her Head.</note> O yes, their Gains are mightily augmented:</l>
            <lg>
               <l>And yet, methinks, it muſt have coſt ſome Strife:</l>
               <l>A Paſſive Husband, and an Active Wife!</l>
               <l>'Tis aukward, very aukward, by my Life.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But to my Speech. Aſſemblies of all Nations</l>
               <l>Still are ſuppos'd to open with Orations:</l>
               <l>Mine ſhall begin, to ſhew our Obligations.</l>
            </lg>
            <l>To you, our Benefactors, lowly Bowing,</l>
            <l>Whoſe Favours have prevented our Undoing;</l>
            <l>A long <hi>Egyptian</hi> Bondage we endur'd,</l>
            <l>'Till Freedom, by your Juſtice, we procur'd:</l>
            <lg>
               <l>Our Taskmaſters were grown ſuch very <hi>Jews,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>We muſt at length have Play'd in Wooden Shoos,</l>
               <l>Had not your Bounty taught us to refuſe.</l>
            </lg>
            <l>Freedom's of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Growth, I think, alone;</l>
            <l>What for loſt <hi>Engliſh</hi> Freedom can attone?</l>
            <l>A Free-born Player loaths to be compell'd;</l>
            <l>Our Rulers Tyranniz'd, and We Rebell'd.</l>
            <l>Freedom! the Wiſe Man's Wiſh, the Poor Mans Wealth?</l>
            <l>Which you, and I, and moſt of us enjoy by Stealth;</l>
            <lg>
               <l>The Soul of Pleaſure, and the Sweet of Life,</l>
               <l>The Woman's Charter, Widow, Maid or Wife,</l>
               <l>This they'd have concell'd, and thence grew the Strife.</l>
            </lg>
            <l>But you, perhaps, wou'd have me here confeſs</l>
            <l>How we obtain'd the Favour;—Can't you gueſs?</l>
            <l>Why then I'll tell you, (for I hate a Lie)</l>
            <l>By Brib'ry, errant Brib'ry, let me die:</l>
            <lg>
               <l>I was their Agent, but by <hi>Jove</hi> I ſwear,</l>
               <l>No honourable Member had a ſhare,</l>
               <l>Tho' young and able Members bid me Fair:</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>I choſe a wiſer way to make you willing,</l>
               <l>Which has not coſt the Houſe a ſingle Shilling;</l>
               <l>Now you ſuſpect at leaſt I went a Billing.</l>
            </lg>
            <l>You ſee I'm Young, and to that Air of Youth,</l>
            <l>Some will add Beauty, and a little Truth;</l>
            <l>Theſe pow'rful Charms, improv'd by pow'rful Arts,</l>
            <l>Prevail'd to captivate your op'ning Hearts.</l>
            <l>Thus furniſh'd, I preferr'd my poor Petition,</l>
            <l>And brib'd ye to commiſerate our Condition:</l>
            <l>I laugh'd, and ſigh'd, and ſung, and leer'd upon ye,</l>
            <l>With roguiſh loving Looks, and that way won you:</l>
            <l>The Young Men kiſs'd me, and the Old I kiſs'd,</l>
            <l>And luringly I led them as I liſt.</l>
            <l>The Ladies in meer Pity took our Parts,</l>
            <l>Pity's the Darling Paſſion of their Hearts.</l>
            <l>Thus Bribing, or thus Brib'd, fear no Diſgraces;</l>
