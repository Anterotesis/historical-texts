         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <lg>
                  <l>The Good and Bad are all a Caſe to Thee,</l>

               <l>Let Youth and Beauty both of them Combine;</l>
               <l>Nay to theſe two we'll Wit and Virtue Joyn,</l>
               <l>And all in their Superlative Degree,</l>
               <l>Yet ſha'n't the leaſt Remorce obtain from Thee:</l>
               <l>Witneſs one Fact Thou Perpetrat'ſt of late,</l>
               <l>(Oh! the Viciſſitude of Cruel Fate:)</l>
               <lg>
                  <l>A Fact Atchiev'd on this our <hi>Britiſh</hi> Shore,</l>
                  <l>Which if the Wings of Fame ſo far has bore,</l>
                  <l>It is Deplor'd its Spacious Turf all o'er:</l>
               </lg>
               <l>Fair Madam <hi>Hurne,</hi> (in whom Concenter'd were</l>
               <l>The Graces all,) whereby ſhe did appear,</l>
               <l>The very <hi>Star</hi> of this our Hemiſphere:</l>
               <l>Is Dead, this moſt Divine and Spotleſs Maid;</l>
               <l>With Grief, I ſpeak't, in Death's Gold Bed is laid:</l>
               <l>But tho' ſhe's gone, her Name doth ſtill remain</l>
               <l>Pure, Undefil'd, without a Spot or Stain,</l>
               <l>And ſhall Eternal Veneration gain.</l>
               <l>But Oh! my <hi>Genius</hi> faints, when Her I Name;</l>
               <l>Divine <hi>Apollo,</hi> ſince my Muſe is lame,</l>
               <l>Transform my Pen into the Tongue of Fame,</l>
               <l>Her Meritorious Virtues to Proclaim.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>While yet on Earth, ſhe might be ſaid in Heaven,</l>
               <l>To which her Thoughts Eternally were given:</l>
               <l>And tho' ſhe locally remained here,</l>
               <l>Her better Part, her Mind was ever there.</l>
               <lg>
                  <l>As for her Church, ſhe moſt Diſcreetly choſe,</l>
                  <l>That which the <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Presbyter</hi> oppoſe,</l>
                  <l>And in its Boſom took her ſoft Repoſe.</l>
               </lg>
               <l>Her Dear Indulgent Mother whom ſhe Lov'd,</l>
               <l>And could not brook to hear her Diſapprov'd;</l>
               <l>But to her Loyal Precepts fix'd her Mind,</l>
               <l>And ne'r to Factious Principles Enclin'd:</l>
               <lg>
                  <l>Altho' the <hi>Vipers</hi> Peſter'd her a while,</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Vipers</hi> far worſe than thoſe of Fruitful <hi>Nile,</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>Worſe than the Curs'd Diſſembling <hi>Crocodile:</hi>
                  </l>
               </lg>
               <l>I mean thoſe men, who by Denomination,</l>
               <l>The World call <hi>Whigs,</hi> but I the Peſt o th' Nation:</l>
               <l>Theſe all their little Arguments produce,</l>
               <l>In hopes they might her Loyalty Seduce;</l>
               <l>But as a Rock fix'd by the Ocean ſide,</l>
               <l>(Each towring wave does threaten with her Pride,</l>
               <l>As if it meant her Center to divide,)</l>
               <l>Do's Laugh to ſee the ſordid Ocean Roar,</l>
               <l>And than a Spoonful values it no more:</l>
               <lg>
                  <l>Even ſo my Female Champion like a Rock,</l>
                  <l>Did Unconcern'd ſuſtain the mighty Shock,</l>
                  <l>And Baffl'd both the Shepherd and the Flock:</l>
               </lg>
               <l>Or like St. <hi>George</hi> who made the <hi>Dragon</hi> fall,</l>
               <l>And with his Sword the hideous Monſter Sprall;</l>
               <l>So ſhe with Reaſon did Confound them all,</l>
               <l>In fine, kind Heaven and Nature did beſtow</l>
               <l>All the Rich Bleſſings that are here below,</l>
