         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE CASE OF <hi>THOMAS CHRISTY</hi> of <hi>Bedford,</hi> Eſquire.</head>
            <p>THE Precept for the Choice of two Burgeſſes for <hi>Bedford,</hi> was made by the Sheriff, and delivered to the Mayor the 18th day of <hi>February,</hi> who kept the ſame in his hands above 14 days, <hi>viz.</hi> until the 5th of <hi>March</hi> before he would Execute it, allthough Mr. <hi>Chriſtie</hi> ſent daily to him to know what day he would appoint, that his Friends might not be ſurprized, and all the Anſwer he would give, was that he ſhould have Legal Notice by Proclaiming the ſame, which was not till <hi>Monday</hi> Evening, and the Election on <hi>Wedneſday</hi> after.</p>
            <p>And altho' the Mayor took ſo much time, yet he choſe to appoint the Election upon <hi>Aſhwedneſday,</hi> a Solemn Faſt-day, knowing it would pleaſe the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> and other Diſſenters, who are numerous in that Town, (and were all of them, and alſo the Regulators for Sir <hi>William Francklynn</hi>) but would be an offence to the Church Men, for that the Miniſters of the five Pariſhes there, could none of them performe their Duties in the Churches on that day, the whole Town Attending the Election.</p>
            <p>Whether that delay was made at the inſtance of Sir <hi>William Francklin,</hi> who lodged at the Mayors Houſe all the while and ſpent pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſely, or that the Mayor being a common Brewer, and ſerving a great part of the Inns and Alehouſes of the Town, for his private Lucre, may be a queſtion. But it is certain, that the Mayor was wholy directed by him in all things touching the Election, both before, at, and after the ſame, and would not appoint a time, until Mr. <hi>Chriſty</hi> (being loaded with Libels and Slanders, and other illegal Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces) they thought themſelves ſecure of the greateſt number of Voters.</p>
            <p>Note,</p>
            <p>That all Precepts are directed to the Mayor and Bayliffs, but the Mayor would not ſhew the Precept to Mr. <hi>Robert Thomas</hi> the Eldeſt Bayliff, who had equal Power with the Mayor, nor acquaint him with the day of Election or any other of his Proceedings.</p>
            <p>Upon <hi>Aſh-Wedneſday</hi> (the day of Election) the four Candidates, were Sir <hi>Anthony Cheſter,</hi> Barronet, Sir <hi>William Francklyn,</hi> Knight, <hi>Thomas Hillerſdon</hi> and <hi>Thomas Chriſtie,</hi> Eſquires: Sir <hi>William Francklyn,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hillerſdon,</hi> having joyned their Intereſt from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning: And five Perſons were appointed by the Mayor (by conſent of the Candidates) to take the Polls, <hi>viz.</hi> one for each Candidate, and another for himſelf, who Poled all that day, and on the next day till Noon, and then no more Perſons coming to Vote on any ſide, after three Proclamations the Poll was cloſed, and the Mayor adjourned the finiſhing the Election, unto the <hi>Swan-Inn</hi> (the Treating-Houſe of Sir <hi>William Francklyn</hi>) at three of the Clock in the Afternoon, at which time, <hi>John Backwel,</hi> Eſquire, a Member of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, was nominated to be a Teller for Sir <hi>Anthony Cheſter, John Hervey,</hi> Eſquire, for Mr. <hi>Chriſtie,</hi> and then Sir <hi>William Francklyn,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hillerſdon,</hi> being deſired to name their Tellers, they refuſed to nominate any. The Eldeſt <hi>Bayliff</hi> deſired they might proceed to finiſh the Election: but the Mayor and the other <hi>Bayliff</hi> by direction of Sir <hi>William Francklyn,</hi> adjourned the Telling and Examining the Poll untill <hi>Friday</hi> the morrow ſeavenight after, to the ſame place, refuſing to give any reaſon, though the ſaid Mr. <hi>Backwell</hi> and Mr. <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey</hi> declared they ſhould be out of the Country at that time.</p>
            <p>At which <hi>Friday,</hi> Mr. <hi>Chriſtie,</hi> demanded that the Polls might be opened, Examined and Compared one with another.</p>
            <p>That the number of Votes for each Candidate might be Counted, and that they who had the Majority ſhould be proclaimed.</p>
            <p>That each Candidate ſhould have one of the five Polls that were taken, or Coppies thereof.</p>
            <p>All which, were deſired by the Eldeſt <hi>Bayliff</hi> alſo, but denyed by the Mayor at the inſtigation of Sir <hi>William Francklyn,</hi> who told the Mayor that he was the ſole Judge of the matter, and might if he pleaſed count the Polls in private, and declare who were to be returned, whereupon the Mayor adjourned again until the next day to the ſame place, at which time Mr. <hi>Chriſtie</hi> repeated his former demands, and the Mayor unſealed the Polls, giving out two of the Originals to the Perſons who took them, but refuſed to compare them or count the numbers, or Proclaim thoſe who had the Majority, but kept the other three Polls himſelf Unſealed, and Adjourned until the Tueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day after, at three of the Clock in the Afternoon, being but one whole day before the ſitting of the Parliament; pretending that <unclear>he</unclear> would make a Scrutiny for unqualified Voices, but was told, that he aſſumed the buſineſs and Authority of the Comittee of Elections, and that it was not in his Power to expunge whom he pleaſed, and was asked what the qualifications were, and what did diſable any to Vote, which he refuſed to declare, and was told by Mr. <hi>Chriſty,</hi> that then it was impoſſible to be prepared, to prove the Legality of the Electors Voices, and although the Electors with much importunity, preſſed the Mayor to Proclaim thoſe who were choſen, yet he refuſed and Adjourned to <hi>Tueſday</hi> as aforeſaid, when he knew that Mr. <hi>Chriſty</hi> would be out of Town, and on the Rode for <hi>London,</hi> to attend the Publick Service; and in his abſence, the Mayor and one of the Bayliffs have returned Sir <hi>William Francklyn</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerſdon,</hi> altho' it appeared upon counting of the Polls, that Sir <hi>William Francklyn</hi> had 249 Voices, Mr. <hi>Hillerſdon</hi> 284, and Mr. <hi>Chriſtie</hi> 291 Voices, ſo as Mr. <hi>Chriſtie</hi> had the Majority of all the Candidates, and 42 Voices more than Sir <hi>William Francklin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Note,<lb/>
That on <hi>Monday</hi> morning, the Mayor ſent for ſuch Perſons as he pleaſed to his own Houſe, (who all had Voted for Sir <hi>William Franck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyn</hi>) and in their Preſence, without giving notice to Mr. <hi>Chriſtie,</hi> had expunged out of the Poll, a great number of Mr. <hi>Chriſties</hi> Voices, and refuſed to give unto the ſaid Eldeſt Bayliff, who demanded the ſame, (and who was alſo to make a Return) the names of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons which he had ſo put out of Mr. <hi>Chriſties</hi> Voters, or the Reaſons why he did ſo: Whereupon the Eldeſt Bayliff (finding that Mr. <hi>Chriſty</hi> had the Majority of Voices by above forty, Proclaimed Mr. <hi>Hillerſdon</hi> and Mr. <hi>Chriſtie,</hi> and Sealed an Indenture accordingly, which the Sheriff hath alſo returned with the other.</p>
            <p>Note alſo,<lb/>
That on the Evening before the Election, the Mayor, Sir <hi>William Francklyn</hi> and 200 others (ſummoned or invited thither by them) met Tumultuouſly and Riotouſly in the Town-Hall, where one Mr. <hi>Eaſton</hi> a Draper, read publickly in the Hall before all the Multitude, a Libellous Paper againſt Mr. <hi>Chriſtie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So the Irregularities and Partiality of the Mayor appears in theſe particulars.
<list>
                  <item>1. He did not ſhew the Precept to the Eldeſt Bayliff.</item>
                  <item>2. Nor acquaint him of the day of Election.</item>
                  <item>3. But kept the Precept from the 18th of <hi>February,</hi> to the 5th of <hi>March,</hi> and delayed the Execution; being a common Brewer.</item>
                  <item>4. And gave but one whole days notice of the Election.</item>
                  <item>5. And then choſe to execute it upon <hi>Aſh-Wedneſday.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>6. And refuſed to tell the Poll and declare the Numbers.</item>
                  <item>7. But Adjourned from the 6th to the 15th, then to the 16th, then to the 18th of <hi>March.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>8. All theſe Adjournments againſt the conſent and proteſtation of the Eldeſt Bayliff.</item>
                  <item>9. And were made to Sir <hi>William Francklynn's</hi> Inn, and not to the Town-Hall.</item>
                  <item>10. Kept the Poll Unſealed three days in his own hands.</item>
                  <item>11. Expunged whom he pleaſed.</item>
                  <item>12. Made himſelf Judge of the Qualifications.</item>
                  <item>13. Refuſed the Eldeſt Bayliff, a Note of the Names and Diſabillities of the Perſons expunged.</item>
                  <item>14. And ſummoned a Tumultuous and Riotous Aſſembly to the Town-Hall, where were read defamatory Libels againſt Mr. <hi>Chriſtie.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>So if Mayors may Return whom they pleaſe, whether duly Elected or not, and not be puniſhed for ſuch Miſdemeanours, then they and not the Electors chooſe Parliament-Men.</p>
            <p>But now, the Mayor to colour what he hath done ſo unjuſtly, with ſome pretence gives out, that none have Voices, but ſuch as pay to the Church and Poor, whereas the Uſage or Cuſtom hath been time out of Mind, that all Houſe-Holders have Voices who do not receive Collection, and ſo it will be proved for eight or ten Parliaments ſucceſſively, and ſuch is the Cuſtome in many other places of the Kingdome, and here now they were all admitted to be Polled on both ſides.</p>
