            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>AN ELEGY On the DEATH of Sir JOSEPH SHELDON, LATE <hi>Lord Mayor of</hi> LONDON.</head>
            <lg>
               <l>SPight of the moſt Capricious Critticks Rage,</l>
               <l>Spight of my Self, my Follies, or my Age;</l>
               <lg>
                  <l>Though young in Years, yet by his Bounty bleſt,</l>
                  <l>For my Eternal Quiet and my Reſt,</l>
                  <l>I muſt unload the Burthen from my Breaſt:</l>
               </lg>
               <l>This mighty Gratitude that ſhakes my Soul,</l>
               <l>And muſt be thus expreſs'd, though ne'r ſo dull:</l>
               <l>For Oh! who can ſuch matchleſs Goodneſs ſee,</l>
               <l>Snatch'd from us by an early Deſtiny!</l>
               <l>Was't not enough, O Heaven! Grave <hi>Sheldon</hi> fell!</l>
               <l>Muſt our Grief be without a parallel!</l>
               <l>Muſt that whole <hi>Race</hi> be ſnatched from the Earth!</l>
               <l>And make of <hi>Goodneſs</hi> ſuch a Cruel Dearth?</l>
               <l>As with young Infants, we obſerve, 'tis ſtill</l>
               <l>That others in their early Wit excell;</l>
               <l>Mark'd with that Heavenly Sign we know muſt fall,</l>
               <l>And ſtill expect th' Unwelcome Funeral;</l>
               <l>Until at laſt, pliant to Fate, it bends,</l>
               <l>And ripe for Joys Unſpeakable aſcends.</l>
               <l>So <hi>He</hi> who moſt in Goodneſs did excell,</l>
               <l>Like to ripe Fruit, <hi>too good to laſt,</hi> He fell:</l>
               <l>Sure we could ne'r have bourn His <hi>Uncles</hi> Fall,</l>
               <l>Had not <hi>He</hi> then ſurviv'd his Funeral:</l>
               <l>As when the Univerſal <hi>Phoenix</hi> Dyes,</l>
               <l>A young One ſtill does from the Aſhes riſe:</l>
               <l>So the Twelve Patriarchs, when <hi>Jacob</hi> Dy'd,</l>
               <l>Alone on <hi>Joſeph</hi> all their Hopes rely'd:</l>
               <l>'Tis he, and only he, muſt raiſe their Name,</l>
               <l>And ſnatch from time their almoſt ſinking Fame;</l>
               <l>'Tis he muſt mollifie th' <hi>Aegyptians</hi> Pride,</l>
               <l>That they may ſafely in that Court abide:</l>
               <l>'Tis he muſt ſave them by his powerful Word</l>
               <l>From the ſharp Famine, or the ſharper Sword:</l>
               <l>That they did hope; All that our <hi>Joſeph</hi> did,</l>
               <l>But now from ours, he grows the City's Head:</l>
               <l>But now behold him, ſee his chearful Eye</l>
               <l>Not Clouded with a ſurley Gravity,</l>
               <l>But with Majeſtick Modeſty and Grace,</l>
               <l>Promiſing mighty Goodneſs in his Face.</l>
               <l>But if ſuch Beauty outwardly we find,</l>
               <l>Who can deſcribe the Beauty of his Mind?</l>
               <l>That innate Vertue which none e're could Paint,</l>
               <l>Which made him even upon Earth a Saint.</l>
               <lg>
                  <l>No Wonder <hi>London,</hi> once ſo famous grown,</l>
                  <l>Daily decreaſes from its toſt <hi>Renown,</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>And to its former <hi>Chaos</hi> does ſink down.</l>
               </lg>
               <l>Did not one mighty <hi>Prop</hi> uphold its State,</l>
               <l>We ſoon alas! ſhould ſee it bend to fate:</l>
               <l>And when the Pillar of a Stately Frame</l>
               <l>Falls, though 'tis Regiſtred i'th Book of Fame,</l>
               <l>The mighty Edifice muſt ſurely fall,</l>
               <l>And Univerſal <hi>Ruine</hi> drown'd it all;</l>
               <l>But ſtill the Fame ſurvives, and ſo will <hi>His,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>His Deeds have Built a Monument of Praiſe.</l>
               <l>O to behold ſuch Cluſters at his Gate</l>
               <l>Of poor weak Souls, that did his <hi>Bounty</hi> wait,</l>
               <l>And ne'r in vain; for each had ſure his ſhare</l>
               <l>Both of his Charity, his Love and Care:</l>
               <l>Nor did he proudly his large Gifts beſtow,</l>
               <l>But with Humility and Diſtance too.</l>
               <l>In's Countries good his time he did employ,</l>

               <l>His Noble Juſtice equal <hi>Ballance</hi> gave,</l>

               <l>Not large in promiſes, as moſt are now,</l>
               <l>Nor ſaying ought but what he meant to do.</l>

                  <l>In Feaſt or Pomps, Noble, and yet not proud,</l>
                  <l>With a great, not a groveling, mind endow'd,</l>
