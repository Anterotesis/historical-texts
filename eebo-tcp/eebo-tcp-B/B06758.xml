            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>This <hi>Mary Dudſon</hi> wrought by'th' week,</l>
               <l>and to the Market loads did bear;</l>
               <l>For ſhe was pliant, milde and meek,</l>
               <l>to gain a Living any where,</l>
               <l>Her work was in the Garden ſtill,</l>
               <l>for there ſhe ſpent the pleaſant day,</l>
               <l>For in ſuch work ſhe had moſt ſkill,</l>
               <l>and for the ſame received pay.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But when the pleaſant Sun ſhone hot,</l>
               <l>ſhe would lye down o'th ground to ſleep,</l>
               <l>Not dreading of any harm, God wot,</l>
               <l>but ſome Refreſhment for to reap.</l>
               <l>About the end of <hi>July</hi> last</l>
               <l>ſhe ſleeping in the Garden lay,</l>
               <l>In a dead Sleep ſhe lay ſo faſt</l>

               <l>Much fleam about her mouth did lie,</l>
               <l>in a moſt ſad and diſmal ſort,</l>

            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Thus ſhe continued many a day,</l>
               <l>in torments ſtrange both day and night,</l>
               <l>For ſhe could have eaſe no way,</l>
               <l>neither in ought could take delight:</l>
               <l>The women they did marvel much</l>
               <l>a Maiden ſhould be in ſuch caſe:</l>
               <l>At length the truth appeared ſuch,</l>
               <l>a greater Wonder came in place.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Her torments they grew very ſtrong,</l>
               <l>her body was exceeding weak:</l>
               <l>It ſeemed unto her great wrong</l>
               <l>to ſit, to lye, to walk, or ſpeak,</l>
               <l>Her thirſt it was exceeding ſtrange,</l>
               <l>ſhe did drink ſo abundantly,</l>
               <l>Her body all coal black did change,</l>
               <l>which ſeem'd a wondrous Prodigie.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But God that brings all truths to light,</l>

               <l>At times as I do underſtand,</l>
               <l>fourteen young Addres from her came</l>
               <l>By Vomit, and the Lords command,</l>

            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Theſe came from her all alive,</l>
               <l>and that in ſeveral peoples view:</l>
               <l>To get away they all did ſtrive,</l>
               <l>but into the fire they them threw.</l>
               <l>The fourteenth day of <hi>Auguſt</hi> laſt,</l>
               <l>the old Adder by vomit came</l>
               <l>Quite through her throat, and out was caſt,</l>
               <l>the ſtanders by admir'd the ſame.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>This hideous ſight put them to flight,</l>
               <l>they judg'd her fourteen Inches long:</l>
               <l>Her body thick, and colours bright,</l>
               <l>with ſeeming legs exceeding ſtrong.</l>
               <l>She hiſt, and back ſtrove to return</l>
               <l>into her mouth with eager ſpeed,</l>
               <l>Being withſtood, away ſhe run,</l>
