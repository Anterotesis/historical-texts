         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER,</head>
            <p>IT will not, I hope, ſeem ſtrange that I have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken to Anſwer a ſcurrilous Pamphlet lately ſet forth to defame Dr <hi>Pitcairne,</hi> and all true methods that are, or can be propoſed to advance the certainty of Medicine. Having defended theſe methods and Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings when I was abroad, I thought my ſelf more concern'd to defend them at Home. Abroad I was put to defend them againſt the Reaſonings of Ingenuous Perſons, who were ſeeking the truth, and trying every thing that tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to any ſuch end. But here I find, inſtead of Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemany and Philoſophical Language, a Rapſody of Lies, Calumnies, Scurrilous talk, in a word, a diſcourſe ſavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Dunghill that gave the Origine and Nuriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the inſect which brought forth the Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet.</p>
            <p>The Fellow has conceal'd his name, but we muſt ſpeak with him, and therefore a name he ſhall have: and he has himſelf helpt us For having told what a Spaniſh
<pb facs="tcp:180042:7"/>gravity and conſtancy attends thoſe who admire what is Old, to which party he inclines, he cannot take it ill if we give him a ſpaniſh name; and if we can in the Author of this Pamphlet diſcover the ways and Language, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther qualities which are proper to any Spaniard or Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſe whoſe Character is known in this place, that Perſon's name muſt we beſtow on the Author of the Pamphlet. No ſpaniſh name is better known in this place than <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rugo's.</hi> The farce that was ſome years agoe acted under that name in the <hi>Cannongate,</hi> makes the Rogue well enough known: And the Character of Cheating, Lying, Burleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quing, Coining propheſies for ſybilla (ſee page 24 of the Farce, and page 20 of the Pamphlet) calling Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticians Mad and Lunatick (ſee page 23 of the farce, and pages 45 and 47 &amp;c. of the Pamphlet) which are the chief Ornaments of <hi>Tarrugo</hi>'s Comedy, are alſo the chief Ornaments of <hi>Tarrugo's</hi> Pamphlet: For thus we'l hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth call it.</p>
            <p>There are two humours, or fits rather, that our <hi>Tarrugo</hi> is often obſerved to fall in. Tho he has to deal with Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who are no wayes Mad or Lunatick, nor guilty of drinking Brandy, yet without any occaſion given, he ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fals a railing againſt Mad men, Crackt-brain'd, and Mercurial Nodles, Lunaticks, &amp;c. Or againſt Brandy-drinkers. May we enquire into the reaſon of this behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our? ſince thoſe he has to deal with are not tourly free of both thoſe qualifications, it is plain, that he could not entertain any hopes of fixing ſuch a Character upon them, unleſs he were really Mad, or wrote his Pamphlet over a Bowl of Punſh. We have therefore no other thing left us to ſuſpect for the cauſe of <hi>Tarrugo's</hi> fits, but ſome <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamit
<pb facs="tcp:180042:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>as Domeſtica.</hi> Now becauſe he is unknown to me as well as his whole Family, it is not poſſible to define, if both the qualifications he ſo often complains of, belong to any one in it, or are divided. Yet this ſeems probable, that <hi>Tarrugo</hi> is the Lunatick, for he ſpeaks like one; and that the Moon has no influence on any other in his Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly except when ſhe is in the <hi>Cow-gate.</hi> This Domeſtick evil then that ſo eaſily beſets him, muſt be the Cauſe of his Paroxyſms.</p>
            <p>But the ſtrangeſt thing in <hi>Tarruge</hi>'s Pamphlet is, That the Fellow having publiſh'd it on purpoſe to defame his Neighbours, and for that end fil'd it with notorious Lyes, and villanous calumnies, yet he has the ſupererogating Impudence and Hypocriſy to complain of <hi>Atheiſm</hi> and contempt of Religion; while one of the great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives he had to rail at Doctor <hi>Pitcairn</hi>'s writtings was, becauſe the Doctor in them has given a demonſtration of the Deity's exiſtence, the belief of which is ſo incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with <hi>Tarrugo</hi>'s practice. Yet there is one thing that to ſome may ſeem as ſtrange; Whoever <hi>Tarrugo</hi> be, yet it's known That the papers which I call <hi>Tarru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go</hi>'s were reviſed, corrected, and approven by one who twice in one year changed his Religion, upon how honeſt and religious principles I doe not determine: Now it may ſeem ſtrange, that this Gentleman has not ſtruck out thoſe paſſages about <hi>Atheiſme</hi> and Irreligion, both for his own, and for his Author's ſake</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tarrugo</hi> has ſubjoin'd an appendix about Certainty which gives us a farther proof of his ignorance in Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicks, and of his want of Common ſenſe too. There he undertakes to prove, That the matters of fact that
<pb facs="tcp:180042:8"/>are told by travellers and ſeamen about the Towns in <hi>China,</hi> are as evidently true and certain, as it is evident that two and two make four: That he who ſaw a thing done is not ſo certain of its being done, as an other is who ſaw it not, but heard it only by the hundreth hand perhaps. Which are thoughts ſo widely different from thoſe of ſober perſons, that to entertain them ſeriouſly muſt be the higheſt degree of madneſs. But the paper <hi>de Inventoribus</hi> was not publiſh'd for the uſe of ſuch mean capacities as <hi>Tarrugo</hi>'s. It was deſign'd as a rule for deciding controverſies about Inventions in Medicine and Mathematicks, as appears from the paper it ſelf. And in it are cautions delivered to hinder any ignorant or Malicious perſon from ſtretching or wreſting what is there taugh; for in the laſt page of it the Doctor has theſe words. <hi>Eadem de cauſa, ſi</hi> Ariſtotelem <hi>vel</hi> Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocratem <hi>concedatur fuiſse infallibiles, certiores eſſe po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terimus de us quae illi tradidere, quam de aliis quae alio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum Hiſtoricorum fidei acceptum referimus.</hi> By which it is evident that the Doctor treats only of Hiſtorians or Obſervators that are not inſpir'd; and that in the Doctor's judgement, we have more than an Hiſtorical certainty of what is taught in the ſacred Scriptures: But this kind of certainly was not the ſubject of that paper <hi>de Invento ribus.</hi> &amp; ſo I think that paper may be left to defend it ſelf.</p>
            <p>I come then to conſider thoſe parts of <hi>Tarrugo</hi>'s Pamphlet where he pretends to be ſerious, and would ſeem Learn'd. The ſubject (as <hi>Tarrugo</hi> pretends) of the Debate is this. Dr. <hi>Pitcairne</hi> wiſhing to have Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine brought a greater length towards certainty and perfection than hitherto it has been, propoſed to take the
<pb facs="tcp:180042:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>help to Mathematics, a very certain ſcience; He told what affinity the two ſciences have, and he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged his hearers to embrace the propoſal, by letting them ſee how many hard problems in Medicine hall been already ſolv'd by only two Mathematicians, <hi>Borelli</hi> and <hi>Bellini.</hi> But to this propoſal <hi>Tarrugo</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſes to conſent, and very often ſays, but never proves, That Mathematicks cannot be of uſe in Medicine; and withall owns himſelf Ignorant of Mathematicks. From this aſſertion of <hi>Tarrugo</hi>'s we may infer how Ignorant he is of Medicine, ſince he knows nothing of theſe many and noble purpoſes belonging to it, which <hi>Borelli</hi> and <hi>Bellini</hi> have Mathematically demonſtrated: For how can we ſuppoſe him to know ſuch things who will nor allow any uſe of Mathematicks in Medicine? From this alſo we may judge, How fit <hi>Tarrugo</hi> is to diſcourſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the uſe of Mathematicks in Philoſophy and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine; he who by his own confeſſion is, and by his way of writing proves himſelf to be intirely Ignorant of all Mathematicks, and conſequently of all the uſes and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes they can be aply'd to. Can One who does not underſtand the 47 prop. of the firſt of <hi>Euclid,</hi> be a fit judge indetermining where it can be of uſe, and where it can not? And can he pretend to underſtand the firſt Elements of Mathematicks, who thinks (ſee page 85 of <hi>Tarrugo</hi>'s Pamphlet) That there are or can be bodies and particles triangular or ſquare.</p>
            <p>But theſe maters are more fully treated of in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing papers, in which the Reader is deſir'd not to take it ill, If <hi>Hippocrate</hi> and <hi>Galen</hi> be treated without any reſpect to their pretended Infallibility (allowed them by
<pb facs="tcp:180042:9"/>
               <hi>Tarrugo</hi>) for I thought it always of ill conſequence to a ſcribe Infallibility to Persons who knew much indeed in reſpect of their times, but were ignorant of what our times have diſcover'd, eſpecially ſince the lare diſcoveries are farr more valuable and uſeful than the former. And tho our Art be very highly oblig'd to thoſe two, and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Old boys, yet <hi>Hippocrate</hi> and <hi>Galen</hi>'s fault was great in Introducing the ſectarian philoſophy into Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine; and our Art had been much more beholden to them, if ſuch Idiots as <hi>Tarrugo</hi> had not made Idols of them, and endeavour'd to make their falſe Aphoriſms paſs for infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible concluſions.</p>

            <head>ANSWER TO A late Pamphlet Entitled <hi>Appolo Mathematicus</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THe Mathematical Science is the Art of finding out the properties of all figures which can hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to any Body, and of all the motions and effects of them; That is, the Art of finding out all that Bodies can do one with another; for there is nothing done or happeneth in nature, but by Bulk, Figure or Motion: and therefore a perfect Knowledge of Mathematicks is what no Man can pretnd to, for it would amount to a perfect knowledge of all natural things. This does not binder but that many excellent perſons have given themſelves to the Study of that Science; for tho' they knew well that they could not
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:180042:10"/>arrive to a perfection, yet they found that by following the ſteps and method of the preceeding Mathematicians, they could grow wiſer than their Maſters, and ſurmount difficulties inſuperable to thoſe who are ignorant of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicks. There is nothing in Natural Philoſophy (of which Medicin is a part) that deferves to be taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of, except what is invented and demonſtated by the Mathematicians; and this is the cauſe of Philoſophie's being ſo long in ſo low eſtate The Mathematicians were ſo intent upon the Geometrical Foundation and the Abſtract Speculation of Figutes that they had no leiſure to look abroad, and to draw thoſe Concluſions which are uſeful to the Philoſophers: But now that the Temple of Geometry is built, the Mathematicians have both Leiſure and Inclinations to aſſiſt their Neighbours, and to lend them Propoſitions and Truths uſeful in bringing their Works to a greater perfection. Mr. <hi>Newton</hi> has effectually helped the Philoſophers; and <hi>Borrelli,</hi> but above all <hi>Bellini</hi> has given great light in Medicipal mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, only by the help of Mathematicks: And it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſtrange that the Knowledge of Mathematicks ſhould be ſo uſeful in the Theory of Medicine, ſince Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicks are the Theory of the effects produced in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture by the means of Figure, Bulk, and Motion, which effects and events comprehend thoſe alſo which appear to us as Diſeaſes and the Actions of Remedies; And thereſore, tho' it is not expected that Medicine by the help of Mathematicks ſhould be brought to its abſolute and uttermoſt perfection, (for that is not expected in Natural Philoſophy) Yet it is evident from what has been here explained, and from what ſome Men have
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:180042:10"/>done as <hi>Bellini</hi>) that we ſhould have brought Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine to an incredible perfection, if Mathematical me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods had been uſed, at leaſt a far greater perfection than can be had by any other methods. For it is moſt mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, that if Medicine can be brought to any degree of perfection, it muſt be brought to it by the help of that Science, which teaches what are the effects of ſuch and ſuch motions in Bodies Solid and Liquid of ſuch and ſuch Bulks, Conſiſtences, Figures, and velocities combin'd in all manner of proportions: for the Actions, Diſeaſes, and Cures that hapen and are done in our Bodies, are effects which reſult from thoſe Figures, Motions, quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities and proportions treated of and demonſtrated in the Mathematicks; and thereſore, it we can have any clear knowledge of Diſeaſes &amp;c. We muft be beholden for it to <hi>Euclide, Apollonius, Archimedes, Newton,</hi> and to <hi>Borrelli</hi> and <hi>Bellini,</hi> with others who have made uſe of <hi>Euclide</hi> to advance the knowledge of Medicine. And it ſerves to no purpoſe to ſay, that the Fabrick of our Body is intricate, and many things in it fall not under our Senſes for the more intricate it is, the mote need is there and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to uſe the moſt general and comprehenſive me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods for finding the myſteries of that ſtructure: And ſince the Mathematical methods are theſe only which can ſerve us in this deſign, they ought to be try'd. And we have this motive to encourage us, to wit, that ſeveral things which paſs'd for Truths in Medicine while the Writers of it neglected the aſſiſtance of Mathematicks, have been found to be groſs Errors when viewed by a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematician; And many things that could not be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood not determin'd by Phyſitians when they did not
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:180042:11"/>conſult with the Mathemeticians, are now by the help of Mathemaricks fully explained and underſtood. And of this you have ſubjoin'd an Inſtance. It is a Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical explication of the moft conſiderable diſeaſes of the Eyes, never before underſtood by any Writers of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, and that only becauſe they did not uſe the Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks to help them in an enquiry of this Nature. From that explication it appears how ridiculous the Writers of Medecine have been both in the Theory and practice of the diſeaſes incident to the Eyes, and how naturally the true method of Cure is found out from the true and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematical Theory of the Diſeaſe. If ſome perſons have quibled and railed againſt this Invention, it is only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are Ignorant and ill natur'd, for the Doctors Thoery in this affair is pure Demonſtration.</p>
            <p>But the Doctor has given another inſtance of the uſe of Geometry in Medicine. There aroſe a queſtion, If purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing be the beſt cure for Fever? neither they who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd it to be, nor they who deny'd it could give any ſufficient reaſon for their opinion, but quibled and adduc'd arguments too mean to be uſ'd by School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boys when they diſpute about <hi>Ens Rationis,</hi> or if Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick be ane art, &amp;c. (for what learn'der are men diſputing without the help of Mathematicks, about natural things, than ſchool-boys? They have both learn'd their Logicks and Metaphyſicks and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteed of Natural Philoſophy mathematically handled, they have learn'd either from Ariſtorle and Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate, that the World conſiſts of four Eliments, or from Deſcartes, that it's made up of three; both equally falſe and uſeleſs: So that no more can be expected of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:180042:11"/>ſolid Theory from the one than from the other. Atlaſt Docter <hi>Pitcairne</hi> apply'd his Mathematicks to the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, and had ſolv'd it by a method not to be imitated by thoſe Puny Quiblers.</p>
            <p>If the greateſt part of Phyſick be not Mathemati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally cultivated, it is becauſe few Phyſitians have uſed Mathematicall reaſons, and one man or two cna not goe through with ſo great a work.</p>
            <p>How little then is Medicine and Mankind obliged to a Cabal of ignorant Block heads, who do not only not uſe any Mathematical reaſoning in Medicine, but cry out upon Mathematicall methods as uſeleſs, yea hurtfull when apply'd to Phyſick! But the beſt is, Theſe men who cry out upon the uſe of Mathematicks. What a noble diſcourſe then can we expect about the uſe of that Science and it's reach from them? Certainly no better than from School boys.</p>
            <p>The difference will be only here. That if ſome of this Anti mathematick Cabal have been Comedians, and earn'd ſome money by writting copies of <hi>Samuel Colvins</hi> poem againſt the Whigs betor it was printed, or if others have been Readers and School. maſters in a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-pariſh, Then we ſhall have a book full of ſcraps taken from poets and Rymers, Baudy-houſe language &amp;c: and then when nothing prevails, we ſhall be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taqued by a Mr Precentor with a Text of Scripture, which (now haveing loſt the privilege of reading in the Kirk) he throws inſtead of a ſtone or ſome heavy argument againſt his Nighbour, &amp; makes that an inſtrument of ſtrife which was brought into the World as comprehending the beſt and moſt perſwaſive inducements to peace. Now, we
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:180042:12"/>can expect none of theſe things from School-Boys who likewiſe will ſhow a Baſhfulneſs where there men are Impudence it ſelt: But the ſerious parr will be the ſame as if it were writ by School-boys, <hi>To whom the Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks have yet done no good;</hi> Except one ſhould think that thoſe may have forgot much of what they once knew after the manner of School boys, and ſo ſpeak nonſenſe even in the ſenſe of the Latter, and appear low and mean to the very capacity of Children. Of this I ſhall give perpetual inſtances in <hi>Tarrugo's</hi> pamphlet, where he ſpeaks of any thing after a ſerious manner, no School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boy being capable of ſo mean Nonſenſe as he then contents himſelſ with. Every man brings to doe his work the Talents he has, if the work be urgent, and give no delay; <hi>Tarrugo</hi> with his Comerads have no Matha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks, yet they would gladly be thought advancers and improvers of Medecine: They have then brought Rhymes, Scraps of School-Authors and Farces, Stage-talk, Buffoonrie, Dialogues with Boyes; and then to pleaſe both you and the Boyes, they preſent you with skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Rope-dancers, and immediatly after, fall a playing Jugler tricks with Screw-nails. And thus they advance Medicine many wayes; whereas their Antagoniſt, who cares for none of thoſe things, has only the Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, and nothing elſe to truſt unto.</p>
            <p>The deſign of the Drs diſcourſe, being to advice the Writers and practicers of <hi>Medecine,</hi> to abſtain from drawing conſequences therein from the poſition or prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of any Sect of Philoſophy. (a thing every day done both abroad and at home) he thought fit to ſhow them the right way, or put them in company of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:180042:12"/>thoſe who are in it, and to advice them to follow their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample: Therefore conſidering, that Medicine is ſo far like to Aſtronomy, that before a Concluſion can be fram'd in eirber, there muſt be a ſufficient number of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations made; and that the obſervations made in either of them preceed any Knowledge Men have of the nature of the things anent which they have theſe obſervations; He chuſe to perſwade Phyſicians to make obſervations with as great care, and in as great a number, in regard of the Medical Art, as the Aſtronomers (who have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſucceeded in heir deſign) had done in theirs; and to rely as much on obſervation, and as little on any Sect of Philoſophy as the others doe, ſince the principles of theſe Sects are intirely uncertain, and ſince they have not built their poſitions concerning the natures of things upon obſervation, but upon precarious and ill Reaſonings. The Doctor had too good cauſe for taking ſome pains to inculcat this for the knew that Hippocrat has built moſt of his Doctrine upon the idle and groundleſs belief, of all things being made and done by Heat and Cold, moiſt and dry, upon which he builds all his Medicinal art, (and for which <hi>Aristotle</hi> is ſo laughed at) whom in this nevertheleſs, <hi>Galen</hi> follow'd and extoll'd, and all the Writters of Medicine (except a very few) till this time. And theſe two, <hi>Hippocrat</hi> and <hi>Galen,</hi> are by the Author of the Pamphlet ſer up, ſee page 32. l. 13. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as our guides in Medicine, tho they have built and made a Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteme of it upon that rotten Foundation of the 4 Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and the four firſt qualities, ſee page 96, where he ſayes, Medicine can only be advanced by Hippocrat's me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, which they would not have done, had they made
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:180042:13"/>Sufficient obſervation. And that the Doctor has reaſon, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from the Pamphleteer, who is ſo addicted to Hippo-crat's ſect and philoſophy, that what Hippocrate has deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered not from obſervation, but from his principles of phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy, this Author admits for truth, and ſo could not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to tell us, pag. 46. That Hippocrat's aphoriſms are ſo many concluſions draw'n from along tract of obſervations you ſee he believes his aphoriſms all for unths, whereas moſt of them are falſe, and contrary to every man's ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation; and conſequently have never been built on, and draw'n from a long tract of experiences, but on Hippocrat's idle Philoſophy witneſs the 31 ſect. 5. which has coſt ſo many women theit lives, only becauſe they are treated by Phyſicians like to our Pamphleteer, and of the ſame principles with him.</p>
            <p>But that which is as conſiderable in this affair, is; That by imitating the Aſtronomers, we ſhould have made our obſervations in medicine, diſtinct and well circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiated, and conſequently ſuch as an uſeful conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence could be draw'n from them: whereas Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrate very often in obſervations of the greareſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment has altogether neglected the material conditions and circumſtances of the obſervation, and then gives us aphoriſms uſeleſs in the hands of men of ſenſe, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious when laid hold on by ſuch as our Pampheleteer Witneſs the 9 aph. ſect. 3 and the ſaid 31 ſect. 5. witneſs all his aphoriſms (which are very many) concerning the Criſes or Cools of Feavers, which he has draw'n either from the principles of his philoſophical ſect, and not from obſervation, or from obſervation ſo ill circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanciated, that they oftner fail than hold true; and are
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:180042:13"/>pernicious as oft as the patient is traited by one who thinks, that <hi>Hippocrat</hi>'s <hi>aphoriſms are concluſions draw'n from a long tract of obſervations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now Sir, there is one thing to be yet remarked. Some Aſtronomers before they had made a ſufficient number of exact obſervations, have attempted to make a Syſteme, as they called it, and to draw too large conſequences, and ſuch as required more obſervations. Theſe ert'd, by quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the method and way they were in. Others, after there had been made a ſufficient number of obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, for want of Geometry, that is, Reaſon ſufficient and judgement how to uſe and compare the obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, have ert'd and draw'n wrong conſequences. Theſe errings do not make the right way wrong. For we ſee that Mr. <hi>Newton</hi> has perfited the Syſteme by bringing ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient ſtrength of Geometry, or right reaſon to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to the ſufficient obſervations, whereof the moſt conſiderable was made by the <hi>Kepler.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It the Phyſicians would make a number of obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as ſufficient and exact in their Trade, as the Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomers have done in theirs, we ſhould be able to promiſe as much in the events of Diſeaſes as they can do in the events of the motions of the Planets. Till ſuch obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, and ſo many on each Diſeaſe and Cure be made, the Doctor in his Oration deſires the Phyſicians to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frain from making Syſtemes, or drawing conſequences, that is, from making Aphoriſms. Likewiſe, if it ſhall be found that a ſufficient number of exact obſervations is made in any Diſeaſe, yet the Doctor had cauſe to adviſe that Phyſician to abſtain from building a Syſteme on them, or drawing conſequences &amp; concluſions from them,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:180042:14"/>who had not enough of Judgement and Art to compare them aright. And becauſe this Art is not acquir'd but by uſe. (for it is more likely that a Man ſhall judge aright in an affair who has been uſ'd to weigh circumſtances, and conſider things calmely, and look well on every ſide, than another of no greater Spirit, who never apply'd him ſelf to be ſerious in any thing) Therefore the Doctor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended the ſtudy of Geometry and Mathematicks to Phyſicians, that they may learn to reaſon juſtly, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare things obſerved in Phyſick as exactly (as far at leaſt as the nature of the obſervations can admit) as they had been uſ'd to do in Mathematicks. And therefore this Pamphleteer ought not to meddle with drawing conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions in Medicine, ſince he is one of thoſe (ſee page 22.) <hi>To whom the Mathematicks have never done good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the Doctor was the more preſſing to this, Becauſe all the actions of our Body, and the Bodies that act upon ours, as Medicaments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are the motions of ſome fluid or ſolid things, and that theſe all obſerve the Laws of motion treated of and demonſtrated in the Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicks. And for this reaſon, did the Doctor recommend the ſtudy of Mathematicks to his Hearers.</p>
            <p>Now how bravely is all this refuted, by our Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phleteers ſaying, That all wiſe men know, that Medicine is of a quite other nature than Aſtronomy? What if it be? Are we therefore not to be exact in our obſervations, or are we not to follow a Medicine built on obſervations, becauſe the Aſtronomers build on them? But ſayes our Pamphleteer, the obſervations made by Phyſicians in ſundry places, agree, and thoſe made by Phyſicians in ſundry places, as <hi>France, AEgypt, Rome,</hi> doe not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree;
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:180042:14"/>and therefor different methods muſt be uſed in diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent places, and the the whole Art of Phyſick muſt ſtill be conjectural in reſpect of Aſtronomy, page 46. and 47.</p>
            <p>Here is a new confirmation of the neceſſity of imitat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Aſtronomers in the exact way of making Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations. <hi>Hippocrate, Gallen,</hi> and many others in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Countreys have made different obſervations con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the ſame thing. becauſe they did not conſider what influence the Climate and Dyet had upon the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations; which if they had conſidered, the obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in ſundry places made upon the ſame things had been found to be the ſame. But the Aſtronomers, tho in making their obſervations in different places, they often found the ſame Star at the ſame time, not in appearance in the ſame place; yet they wiſely conſidered the different degree of Refraction that is in different places, the different altititude. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And this being accounted for, they found their obſervations agreeing, becauſe they made them with more exactneſs than theſe made with, which our Pamphleteer would have us to embrace. And it ſeems to me that all the cauſe of this outcry againſt the Doctor is this. That the Pamphleteer being very deſirous to be eſteem'd a learn'd Phyſician, he finds himſelf not quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied enough to make exact obſervations; and thefore he'l ſet up with Hippocrat's, and cry down all better ones, or any deſign of making better ones, and then he knows he cannot be far outdone, if we'll follow his Example. But the Doctor deſigning to put Men in a way of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Medicine to a greater perfeceion, (a deſign not very criminal) adviſed to make more, and more perfect ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations; And that the Hearers might underſtand
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:180042:15"/>what exactneſs and perfection in theſe is required, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired them to take model of that from the Aſtrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers. This was precife, and ſo not very lyable to be miſ-underſtood.</p>
            <p>But our Pamphleteer wonders page, 48. <hi>That Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians ſhould be deſir'd to imitate the Aſtronomer, who are divided into Sects.</hi> For my part I know no Sect a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them. If any of them too raſhly built a Syſteme on obſervations, exact indeed, but not numerous enough, (as they could not be numerous enough before the uſe of Teleſcopes, by which many things are obſerved that were not obſerved at all by the Ancients) what is that to us, who have ways of making more obſervations, and who ſee Aſtronomy founded now upon exact, and ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently numerous obſervation, without any diſſention? Becauſe ſome Men went out of the right way? and others who went not out of it have ſucceeded to admiration, muſt we therefore defert the right way? And yet this is our Pamphleteers way of reaſoning. If any of the Aſtronomets of late went wrong, it was not in making wrong obſervations, but in truſting to Aphoriſms ſet ſorth by a Pope, and Cardinals, as our Pamphleteer truſts to Hippacrats; that is, in taking them for concluſions draw'n from a long tract of obſervations: for infallibility isequivalent to all this.</p>
            <p>The Doctor thought fit to deſire Phyſicians to imitat the Aſtronomers in building their Art and Theory upon obſervations, becauſe the greater part had built upon the principles of the Sects that ſet up for Philoſophy, and theſe principles being more uncertain than obſervations, it was no wonder if their Medicine was very uncertain.
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:180042:15"/>And for this the Doctor deſir'd Phyſicians to abſtain from the Inveſtigation of Phyſical cauſes, that is, the abſolute and intimat nature of things; For ſince theſe Cauſes are aſſigned different by the different Sects, and and none them has any foundation for that they aſſert as the Doctor proves in the II page of his Oration, what help can ſuch precarious cauſes bring to a phyſician? It is the principle of a great Sect in philoſophy: That all things are made up of a <hi>Meteria,</hi> a <hi>forma Substantialis</hi> from which iſſued forth the four firſt qualities, Heat, Cold, Moiſt and dry. The Phyſicians generally em, brac'd this opinion becauſe it was almoſt conform to Hippocrat's, who taught that all conſiſted of the four Elements whoſe natures were Hot. Cold, Moiſt and Dry. Now theſe Philoſophical Phyſicians without any ſincere and exact obſervations laid it down as a <hi>Maxime</hi> that <hi>Opium</hi> is Cold, and this according to them was the nature of <hi>Opium</hi> and the phyſical cauſe of all its Actions and effects on our Bodies: For by telling it was Cold, they by their principles pretended to have told its nature. This being believed they were ſure ro uſe <hi>Opium</hi> only in Hot Diſeaſes (for they as raſhly determin'd about the nature of Diſeaſes and diſtinguiſh'd them into Hot, Cold, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) and becauſs a Feaver, a Phrenzy <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were reckoned Hot, therefore in theſe <hi>Opium</hi> was uſed to very bad purpoſe. And becauſe ſome Tumors were by them reckon'd Cold, therefore the <hi>Cicuta</hi> (which they reckon'd Cold without ſincere and exact obſervation too) was condemned, as to its external uſe in ſuch Tumors, tho it be ſingularly uſeful in healing them. This is all the advantagee Medicine has from inveſtigating and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:180042:16"/>the phyſical cauſes, embracing a phyloſophical Sect and neglecting to intimat the Aſtronomers. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Hippocrat had without any ground or Knowledge of Anatomy taught that our Life conſiſted in a <hi>calidum in, natum,</hi> and that this was our nature and the phyſical cauſe of all our acrions and had obſerved that a certain quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Opium</hi> had kill'd any Animal, he and his followers inferr'd that the nature of <hi>Opium</hi> conſiſted in Cold; And is it not fit to warn phyſicians of the inſufficiency and hurtfulneſs of ſuch a method? For tho the humor of building Medicine on the Hypotheſis of Hot and Cold <hi>&amp;c.</hi> be not every where predominant amongſt the phyſicians as it was ſome years agoe yet the inclination &amp; diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to build on the uncertain and precarious principles of a ſect inſtead of making exact obſervations is predominant: So that thoſe who reject <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> philoſophy as uſeleſs, hurtful to Medicine, admit <hi>Hippocrat's</hi> or <hi>Des. Carter's</hi> that is equally prejudical and uncertain. Now that the Doctor is not the only perſon of this opinion is apparent from Mr. <hi>Newton</hi>'s preface to his Book entitled The Mathematical principles of Natural philoſophy, where he has theſe words. <hi>Multa me movent ut nonnihil ſuſpi. cer omnia naturae phaenomena ex viribus quibuſdam pen dere quibus corporum particuloe per cauſas nondum cogni. tas vel in ſe mutuo impelluntur &amp; ſecundum figuras regu. lares cohaerent, vel ab in invicem fugantur &amp; recedunt: quibus viribus ignotis Philoſophi hactenus naturam fruſtra tentarunt.</hi> You ſee Mr. <hi>Newton</hi> thinks that phyſical cauſes are yet unknown, and are like to remain unknown till wee uſe a Mathematical method for finding them. This is evident from what he ſay in the end of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:180042:16"/>the 11 Section. lib, 1. <hi>Princip In Matheſi inveſtigan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doe ſunt virium quantitates &amp; rationes illae, quae ex con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionthus quibuſcunque poſitis conſequentur: deinde uhi in phyſicam deſcenditur confer endie ſunt hae rationes cum phaenomenis, ut innoteſcat quaenam virium conditiones ſingulis corporum generibus competant. Et tuns demum de virium ſpeciebus, cauſis &amp; rationibus phyſicis tutius diſputare licebit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Dr, then had reaſon and authority for him when he adviſed the Phiſicians in their reaſonings to abſtain from the Sectarian. Philoſophy and lay aſide the Inveſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of Phyſical Cauſes after the mannet hitherto uſed by the Sects: Since theſe are altogethet unknown, and are not to be fond till we firſt find out the <hi>virium ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes et quantitates,</hi> which if we could find (and wee can only find them by the help of Mathamaticks) we ſhould have Medicine made perfect before any Phyſical cauſe were known. That which makes this Scribles ſo much concern'd for Phyſical Cauſes is becauſe he has learn'd a little of <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> Philoſophey, which is no, thing but a Metaphyfical diſcourſe, that is, a quibling and ſpeaking nonſenſe about phyſical Cauſes, and this he would have paſs for good reaſoning in Medicine. The difference then betwixt the Doctor and him is this, The Dr when he applied himſelf to Medecine perceived that many things in it were handled a very unſatisfactory Method, and therefore-reſolved to try a method that he had learn'd in reading Mathamatical Writers, this he found ſuccesſul, and coming to read <hi>Borelli</hi> and <hi>Bellini</hi> he found they had uſed that ſame method in medicinal affairs but with agreat deal of more ſucceſs, in as much as they are
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:180042:17"/>fat greater Mathamaticians than he is. This our Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler <hi>Tarrugo</hi> perceiving reſolved that he alſo would make a Noiſe amongſt the learn'd, tho it were no better nor more melodious than that of a Culroſs gridiron or girdle amongſt fine Violins. He had no Mathematicks to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry him through but he had learn'd Logicks and Metaphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicks, had a Natural ſtock of impudence, and an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd one of Stage Buffoonry (as his Book ſhows) and thus accontred he reſolves to burleſque and rail at any thing he underſtood not, and throw ſcraps of Logicks and Metaphyſic's before his Reader, which beingrealand down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right Nonſenſe, are harder to be underſtood than the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicks, and ſo <hi>Tarrugo</hi> muſt appear the profoundeſt Schollar of the two. Thus you ſee every man for im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving his Art brings the Talents he is endowed with. And if by ſo doing he has any hopes of bringing himſelf into Reputation, he'll hide none of his qualities: For the Dr, has vented his Mathematicks and has inculcated the neceſſity of them in a profeſſor of Medecine very often, well knowing he had ſome knowledge of them. <hi>Tarrugo</hi> on the other hand being no leſs greedy of repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and imployment, but ignorant of Mathamaticks, pretends there is no uſe of that ſcience in Medicine, and in a Book of 12 ſheets proves that Metaphyſical Nonſenſe, Impudence, Lying and Calumniating, Neſtie and Scurri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Ribaldry can doe as well: Forby theſe Arts he has ſeen a Phyſician brough to Reputation. 'Tis true ſome Mathematical blades will not eſteem him, but theſe are Few. But yee'l ask me perhaps if any man be ſo mad as to think Medicine will be better'd by lying and Buffoonry. for that is the queſtion, and improv'd more that way
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:180042:17"/>than by juſt and Mathematically exact reaſoning. Yes <hi>Tarrugo</hi> thinks it, for he having ſeen ſome perſons by ſuch artifices brought to ſome reputation did by a very Metaphyſical inference conclude that the method which betters and is advantagious to the Artiſt is alſo advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious to the Art. Here is the depth of Logicks and Metaphiſicks, and becauſe it is very great, I leave in to the Dr himſelf to fathom. The worſt that can be faid is that <hi>Tarrugo</hi> had no mind to better and improve Medicine, but enlarge his own imployment by this method, which he has found to agree with a practical Art more than does the ſpeculative ſcience of Mathematicks.</p>
            <p>But to return to our Pamphleteer who is certainly much diſobliged by this propoſal the of Doctors, for he rails at him moſt unmercifully; he at laſt, page 49 grave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tells, <hi>that nothing can be of more dangerous conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, than to ſet up a Practical Art and a ſpeculative science upon the same foot.</hi> Here we have an inſtance given us by our unthinking Pamphleteer, of the folly of medling with the deſign to improve Medicine by the help of the common Philoſophy taken from a Sect, and without the help of Mathematicks.</p>
            <p>The Dr in his diſcourſe deſir'd us to conſider, that Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine was of more uſe and moment than Aſtronomy (pag, 18, <hi>Orat. Inaug, Aequum enim non eſt, ut vitae Humanae quam curioſitati minus consulatur</hi>) and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ought to be at leaſt as exact in making obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions anent Diſeaſes, &amp;c. as the others are in making theirs anent the motions or irregularities of the Celeſtial Bodies. This, is it not ſufficiently refuted by telling us, that it is dangerous to ſet up a practical Art, and a ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:180042:18"/>Science upon the ſame foot? That is to ſay, it is very dangerous to make exact obſervations in Medicine (the practical Art) ſince that is the very thing which thoſe ſpeculative men the Aſtronomers do, and ſucceed ſo well by. What improvement can Medicine expect from one that reaſons thus?</p>
            <p>This reaſoning is a demonſtration at leaſt of the hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of vain Philoſophy. Our Author had ſaid indeed he had never got either good or hurt from the Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks: But here he lets us ſee, that he has got hurt enough from his Philoſophy. He had heard at School, a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction made between a practical and ſpeculative know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; he had heard it ſaid by Philoſophers, who were no Phyſicians, that medicine is a practical one, and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicks is a ſpeculative; he had ſince often read it in <hi>Hippocrat</hi> and <hi>Galen,</hi> who ſpend many words in telling us ſtories (very uſeleſs and falſe) anent Medicin's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a practical, and not a ſpeculative knowledge: This he ſwallowed down greedily, becauſe it was like to ſave him the pains of thinking and ſtudying. And ſo great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence has this Jargon of practical and ſpeculative on him, that it hinders him from ſeeing that Medicine is to be built on accurate Obſervations, after he was told that a knowledge (which he was taught to call ſpeculative) is founded upon them. But perhaps it will be charity to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme him better. All that a good Phyſician does, is, that he makes obſervations on plants, minerals, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe Bodies about us; alſo on diſeaſes and the Bodies ſubject to them; and laſtly, adviſes the ſick man to make uſe of ſome of thoſe Plants, &amp;c. if he would be in health. The Aſtronomer obſerves likewiſe, the motions and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:180042:18"/>of ſome Stars in reſpect of one another, and foertels, in what time and place they'll be in Conjunction, or Oppoſition, and ſuch like events. Now what is it in Medicine that makes it more a practical Art than Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy? But our <hi>Tarrugo</hi> knows not what Aſtronomy is for, he confeſſes, he never got good or hurt from the Mathematicks, that is, he never learn'd any part of them: And conſequently, is not capable to judge, whether they be uſeful for a Phyſician, and if Phyſicians ſhould imitate them and follow their methods: and by this it is manifeſt, that he has medled with an affair which he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands not.</p>
            <p>But it is not amiſs to conſider a litile more this Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſical reaſon of our <hi>Tarrugo.</hi> It is of dangerous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, ſays he, to ſet up a practical art and a ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Science upon the ſame foot; and therefore Aſtronomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal and Mathematical methods are dangerous and uſeleſs at the beſt in Medicine. Now Sir, every body knows that Navigation cannot be practiſed to any purpoſe and with ſafety or aſſurrance without the knowledge of Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonometry (a part of Geometry or Mathematicks, and as ſpeculative as the Aſtronomy) yea without making ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations like the Aſtronomers. Muſt Navigators leave off this courſe and method of guiding their voyages, becauſe Navigation is a practical Art (as practical indeed as Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine) and Geometry or Aſtronomy are ſpeculative Sciences?</p>
            <p>Why but the Aſtronomers are divided into Sects, ſays <hi>Tarrugo.</hi> And therefore Navigators muſt not follow their example nor imitat their obſervations, as to their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actneſs. Now I never before heard of different Sects in
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:180042:19"/>regard of obſervations amongſt the Aſtronomers, for this is the affair. But <hi>Tarrugo</hi> hearing the word Sect, found he muſt make ſome uſe of it: And therefore to hinder us from being as exact in ſeeing and hearing or obſerving as the Aſtronomers are, warnes us that they are of different Sects, That is, they ſee and hear after different manners. Now Sir tho I have had the occaſion to converſe with ſome Aſtronomers, of whom ſome though the Earth is the Center, and others thought the place belong'd to the Sun rather, yet they obſerved after one and the ſame manner, and ſaw and heard like one another. They were all alike exact in remarking the circumſtances and conditions of their obſervations, and of what they ſaw or heard. And it is this exactneſs that the Navigators ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsfully imitat, and Phyſicians ought to imitat if they alſo would be ſucceſsful.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Tarrugo</hi> will tell us that Aſtronomy or the Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical Science is of quite another nature than Navigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, even as much as it is of another nature than Medicine: And therefore Navigarors are not to borrow from or imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tat either the Aſtronomers, or other Mathematicians, And therefore your ſhips are to be guided as of old in the days of Hippocrat: they are to creep alongſt the Shoar (for there is no truſting to Aſtronomical obſervations quoth <hi>Tarrugo</hi>) where often on a Rock it will be found that <hi>Ars longa eſt, vita brevis,</hi> the only Aphoriſm of Hippocrat drawn from exact obſervation, but not of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians more than of Seamen.</p>
            <p>If the Seamen of <hi>Europe</hi> can be perſwaded to lay aſide the uſe of Aſtronomy and Mathematicks upon the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons given by <hi>Tarrugo,</hi> I'll ingage for the Phyſicians,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:180042:19"/>that they ſhall imitate the Navigators. And therefore if <hi>Tarrugo</hi> would deſeat Doctor <hi>Pitcairn</hi>'s deſign he muſt addreſs himſelf to the Navigators firſt. But I know not by what ill fate <hi>Huggens</hi> and ſome <hi>French</hi> Mathematiciens have written of late about Navigation and I cannot gueſs how <hi>Tarrugo</hi> will behave before ſuch ſevere fel. lows.</p>
            <p>In the page 56, he is very angry with the Doctor for ſaying that, <hi>Corpus omne in alterius cujuſcunque generis corpus transformari potest.</hi> This, be ſayes, is very falſe, unleſs he mean, pag. 57. That the thing implies no contradiction, from which, ſayes he, nothing at all can be concluded. Now, the Doctor ſaid only, that the thing is poſſible; and our Pamphleteer, after many fine ſayings or Aphoriſms to the contrary, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluds that indeed the thing is not impoſſible, but of no conſequence. Now Sir, the Dr took this ſaying from Mr <hi>Neuton.</hi> who at the entry of his third Book <hi>Princip, Mathematic:</hi> ſetts down the ſame thing in the very ſame words as certainly true, for he had made it his third Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis, by which he means there a Poſtulatum, for Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis aſſum'd by Mathematicians is a Poſtulatum, or <hi>Propoſitio veritats notae.</hi> And accordingly Mr <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> makes uſe of it to prove a very material point in the 6, <hi>prop, lib,</hi> 3. But, ſayes <hi>Tarugo, nothing can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from it.</hi> Has not the Doctor concluded from it, That the parts of all Earthly Bodies are ſubject to the ſame rules of motion, or Mechanicks? And Mr <hi>Neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> uſes the ſame propoſition to the very ſame purpoſe, when the deduces from it, that the <hi>Aether</hi> or <hi>Materia ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi> muſt have weight proportional to the quantity of it's
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:180042:20"/>matter and conſequently comes under the ſame Laws to which the Earth in it's motion, or any part of it is ſubject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. I doe eaſily believe, Mr <hi>Newton</hi> never ſaw the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teria ſubtilis,</hi> yet he adventur'd to prove that it has this property, (if any ſuch matter be) by vertue whereof it is to be treated Mathematically. Where is then the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity, that the Doctor without ſeeing the <hi>Liquidum Nervorum</hi> (much groſſer than the <hi>Fluidum ſubtile</hi> of Mr <hi>Descartes</hi>) has affirm'd the ſame thing to hold in that Liquor, ſince Mr <hi>Newton</hi> has demonſtrated the thing ſo univerſally, that his proof reaches further than the Animal Spirits? Here again we have a proof of our Pamphleteers Ignorance in Mathematical matters, when (pag, 59.) He bid's the Doctor let us ſee the animal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, as if that were neceſſary for demonſtrating their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties by which they Act in our Bodies. Did ever any Mathematician ſee the Diameter of any Body or a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematical right line, and yet how many properties doe theſe men demonſtrate anent thoſe things! We ſee and find the effects of the Animal Spirits; and from ſuch ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, and from the general Laws of motion common to all Bodies we can demonſtrate many things anent them without ſeeing them. But this is a leſſon he ſhould have learn'd at the School. In a word, the Doctor affirms, that any body (under whatſomever form) has weight, and obeys the Laws demonſtrated by the the Mathemati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, or Mechanick Writers, propertionally to the matter it contains: And he concludes from this that as the Aſtronomers have gone a great length in applying theſe rules and propoſitions anent motion, &amp;c. to the Stars and Bodies on this Earth both ſolid and liquid, ſo Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:180042:20"/>may come a greater length than they have yet come, if they apply the ſame, or like propoſitions for determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the motions of the Liquors that run through our Bodies, after that they have made proportionally as many obſervations in their Trade, and as exact, as the Aſtronomers have made.</p>
            <p>But before I leave this ſubject, I muſt examine a paſſage in <hi>Tarrugo</hi>'s Pamphlet which he thinks no body can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperouſly attaque, and which nevertheleſs expoſes his weakneſs, and ignorance moſt ſhamefully.</p>
            <p>It is the 17 <hi>P</hi> pamphlet, where after having rehearſed a few rude &amp; ſilly obſervations, (for he hates all a curat ones becauſe Mathematicians love them) upon which he ſays Medicine depends, he at laſt tells us, <hi>Something, was still a wanting</hi> (to wit after the obſervations had been made) <hi>to finiſh the picture or art of Phyſick and this was reaſon</hi> &amp;c. without any Mathematicks. Now this is juſt ſuch a Ridiculous piece of Nonſenſe, as if one ſhould deſire the Maſter of ſhip to uſe his reaſon without his Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks or what he had learn'd by their help) to find the latitude and longitude <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for would it not be a very eaſy and profitable thing to lay aſide his quadrants, compaſs and pendulum Clocks, and inſtead of them have recourſe to the Quakers ſpirit or reaſon? If a Man would uſe his reaſon to good purpoſe, he muſt informe and fortify it with the knowledge of theſe Truths which belong to the matter he would reaſon about, and therefore ſince Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine is a part of natural Philoſophy and muſt be cultivated with it not after the method of the Sectarians but of the Mathematiciens, it is evident that a phyſician who would reaſon to purpoſe, muſt have ſtrengthned his
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:180042:21"/>mind or reaſon with the Mathematical truths that can be applyed to Medicine: for without this what an inſigunifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant thing is this reaſon? If a Myops and Presbyta: (or one who ſees ill at a diſtance, and another who ſees ill what is at hand) came to ask <hi>Tarrugo,</hi> what are the beſt means of helping the defects of their ſights: are they not like to be mightily helpt by his altogether unaſſiſted rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon? but wee ſhall ſo far help him as to tell him that ſuch people can only be helpt by the uſe of Glaſes, and now I deſire him to tell by this reaſon without the help of (not his own, for he has none, but of other people's) Mathe, maticks what glaſs is fit for the Myops and what for the Presbyta: And that he would give directions for mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing each of them. This would perhaps bring naked rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon (for reaſon not aſſiſted either by Law, Divinity, or Mathematicks is the reaſon of Children before they come to have any knowledge of things that are ſolid) into ſome reputation: For I aſſure you Doctor <hi>Gregory</hi> the Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian Profeſſor Aſtronomy thinks it no ſmall matter to have taught in his <hi>Element a Optica, lentem fabricare date oculo inſervientem,</hi> that is to make a Glaſs fit for any propoſed eye, and that with the help of much Mathem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks.</p>
            <p>If a perſon whoſe ſight or eyes look'd clear and free of any outward or viſible blemiſh, but were diſturbed by the images and appearance of Midges or other ſmall dark objects, ſhall ask <hi>Tarrugo</hi>'s advice, and withal tell him that a giddineſs ſometimes accompany'd that ſymptom, troubleſome even on the high Street, eſpecially afterdrink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too much Brandy, what think ye will be his advice? certainly he muſt uſe his moſt defecat reaſon here, for
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:180042:21"/>for it may be the caſe of his deareſt—for ought I know Well, he has in print told us his advice built on the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations of his Ancients and finiſh'd by his own ſingle and preciſe reaſon or ſpirit in the hat. He tells us with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Mathematicks indeed (for it is plainly againſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation and Mathematical reaſon) that the Diſeaſe is a cataract beginning, and therefore refers the patient to the Cure applied by the vulgar Writers ot eh Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ract. But this will not doe, for it is Mathematically certain that it is a Diſeaſe quite different from a Cataract which the patient complains off. And for this reaſon I fancy the patient finding no effect of his advice, may continue in the old trade and diſtemper too</p>
            <p>When wee ſpeak then of uſing reaſon to finiſh or find out right concluſions in any ſcience, wee muſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand by that reaſon, a mind or faculty endued and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed with ſundry propoſitions of truth anent the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the Art or Science we treat of. And ſince Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine is a part of Natural Philoſophy, and Natural Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy is not right handled by Reaſon not aſſiſted by Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicks as experience tells us daily, it is evident that Medicine requires that ſame help. It is true Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy has been handled by reaſon unaſſiſted with Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks, but this is the Philoſophy of the Sects, Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe and falſehoods joined together, and the very me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tod <hi>Tarrugo</hi> handles Medicine. I would ſain know a reaſon (ſeparat from and not armed with Mathematicks or Mathematical Philoſophy) that <hi>Tarrugo</hi> can give for his indications (as he ſpeaks) which any old wife ſhall not give as well? And this is <hi>Turrugo</hi>'s way of em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving Medicine. In a word, when a perſon has made
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:180042:22"/>obſervations and would know what uſe he is to make of them and would be inſtructed in the ſureſt method of drawing uſeful conſequences from what he has obſerved, To tell him only that he is to follow Reaſon, Is as ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and uſeleſs, as it would be ſilly and impertinently pedantic for one that's asked, Who he is, To anſwer he is a Man.</p>
            <p>But he gives a moſt ſubtile Reaſon why Mathematicks are not to be uſed in Medicine: <hi>The Machine ſays he of our body is of a quite different nature from artificial ones, which can be taken down and ſet up again at ones plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</hi> There could be nothing ſaid in fewer words ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely oppoſit to common ſenſe. Do wee not open and diſſect and view the parts of humane Bodies, by doing which wee learn their Fabric, uſe and actions of their parts, and what hurt they can or uſe to ſuſtain from the operations of other Bodies? Now theſe other Bodies ſuch as Druggs, Air, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in their actings on our Machines do not conſider that they can not be ſet up again (tho I hope they ſhall) nor do the parts and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors of our Machines conſider any ſuch matter, but both the one and the other act according to the Laws of motion found out and demonſtrated by the Mathemati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciens, and is not then the Mathematical Knowledge uſeful for underſtanding the properties. Symptoms good or bad and Diſeaſes of our Bodies, ſince theſe are the actions or their effects of other Bodies upon out Machines or of the Liquors <hi>&amp;c,</hi> in our Machines acting ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Laws of Motion and Mechanics: for tho the <hi>man may be a Rope-dancer or Stage-player,</hi> yet the parts of our Bodies are void of that cunning. But wee
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:180042:22"/>muſt conſider a little, What <hi>Tarrugo</hi> ſays that Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks are uſeleſs in unfolding the Myſteries of our Machines, becauſe, ſays he, our Machines cannot be taken down and ſet up again as artificial ones. Now one of the moſt noble parts of our Machine, or rather one of the nobleſt Machines that compoſe our Body is the Eye, which cannot be ſet up again after its taken down, no more than our Bodies can. Yet this Eye is ſo well known as to its ſtructure, action and uſe, that it is the ſubject of a moſt conſiderable part of the Mathematicks or Mathematical Philoſophy: and ſo great a length have the Mathematiciens come in explaining the ſight and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſects of it and their remedies. That if Phyſicians would apply Mathematicks as diſcreetly to the other parts of our Bodies, wee ſhould have a Medicine incredibly im<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>proven. Yet the Eye cannot be ſet up again after being taken down, a thing that the Writers of <hi>Optics</hi> have not found any hindrance from in their Mathematical atche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vements. So that tho a Machine cannot be eaſily ſet up again it ceaſes not to be ſubject to the Laws of Mechanics and conſequently to Mathematical reaſoning. But this <hi>Tarrugo</hi> was loath ſhould be true becauſe he underſtands not Mathematicks.</p>
            <p>There is yet one advantage that the uſe of Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks brings ot Medicine, which wee have not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd, but it is a very great one, and ſerves to abridge and facilirat that redious work of making obſervations. The Phyſicians have made very many obſervations, but few good ones. I do not now call moſt of them ſo, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are not exact; but taking them all to be exact, yet very ſew of them are of uſe or ſerve to any good pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe:
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:180042:23"/>And it is very hard for a man that has no Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks to perceive which are thoſe few that can be made uſe of in building a right Theory or advancing the practiſe of Medicine. If once we can by a Mathematical Eye diſcern what obſervation is neceſſary to draw ſuch a concluſion from (for it were needleſs to warn you that the Mathematiciens muſt be moſt skilful in drawing right concluſions ſince they are moſt uſed to it) then we ſhall abſtain from making or taking notice of the greateſt part of obſervations that wee read or ſee others heap up to no purpoſe. And this would abridge wonderfully the work of obſerving. That you may underſtand this a little better, be pleaſed to take notice of what <hi>Tarrugo</hi> ſays page 16. <hi>When in Feavers, or violent Head aches</hi> &amp;c. <hi>the Noſe fell a Bleeding, the Feaver abated and the pain evaniſhed. And thence they</hi> (the Ancients) <hi>learn'd the uſe of Blooding.</hi> Now this is the very fault in Medicine and defect which Doctor <hi>Pitcairne</hi> would have mended and ſupply'd, and which Mathematicks only can ſupply. Wee ſee by our Pamphleteers confeſſion, That the uſe of Blooding was firſt introduced becauſe they obſerved that the loſs of Blood was ſometimes fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed with recovery out of the Diſeaſe. To make us then able to order Blooding ſeaſonably and to purpoſe, wee muſt have made many obſervations on peoples Blooding in all Diſeaſes, caſes and times of them, in all climats and in all the different circumſtances and conditions in which it is poſſible for mens Bodies to be. Now this is not, nor ever ſhall or can be done; and therefore by this method of obſerving without Matha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical diſcretion, Medicine ſhall be always a baſe mean
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:180042:23"/>conjectural Trade, fit only to be followed by ſuch Juglers as <hi>Tarugo</hi> and <hi>Kerkringius</hi> (this <hi>Kerkringius</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not read Latin, but his wife who is a School maſters Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter writes and copies for him, for the Fool will be in print) and by them called <hi>arsproeſtantiſſima</hi> and the noble Art, I ſuppoſe they mean of gueſſing and cheating, for it is no other as they practiſe it.</p>
            <p>But the Doctor has in his Oration and elſswhere pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed methods, by which Medicine ſhall or may be brought from the low and abject ſtate of conjecture to a degree of certainty which can juſtly bear the Title of uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and therefore noble. Inſtead of thanking the Doctor for his propoſal and for the progreſs he has made in the method propoſed, <hi>Taruge</hi> tells us, pag, 18. <hi>That no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be more extravagant than to imagine that a speculative Science that goes all by demonſtration can be of use in a practical Art founded on experience; and in which there are no infallible concluſions:</hi> but I tell him and the thing is evident, that we ſhould have abundance of infallible concluſions in Medicine as to Cures as well as theorie if Mathematicks be uſed. For Tarugo's diſcourſs implyes no more than this. <hi>All that I</hi> Tarugo <hi>underſtand about Medicine is conjectural and I cannot make uſe of Mathematicks, therefore they are not of uſe to me.</hi> But this does not hinder a ſpeculative Science which goes by demonſtration that is a Science that carries certainty with it, from being of uſe to bring a conjectural uncertain Art (as <hi>Tarugo</hi> and ſuch like handle it) to a ſtate of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, as we ſee the Mathematicians have done by A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtronomy, Navigation. &amp;c. and parts of Medicine that treat on the Eye, motion of the Members, motion of the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:180042:24"/>Heart: And the cure of diſeaſes by blooding. For tho there neither are nor can be ſufficient numbers of good Obſervations made, for ordering blooding. after the manner it was firſt introduced and which <hi>Tarugo</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents himſelf with, yet a good Mathematician has diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd one good and exact obſervation (unknown to <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rugo's</hi> ancients, and indeed uſeleſs to <hi>Tarugo</hi> tho he knew it, ſince he has not Mathematicks enough to make the right uſe of it) from which he accuratly has deduced all that can be learn'd from any infinite number of ſuch obſervations as <hi>Tarugo</hi> builds the Doctrine of blooding upon, and much more than <hi>Tarugo</hi> can underſtand. It is <hi>Laurentius Bellini</hi> who aſſumes no other Obſervation, nor any <hi>poſtulatum</hi> except the circulation of the blood, for to uſe his own words, <hi>doctrina mittendi ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinem pendet ex toto a naturali ejus fluxu ſeu circuitu in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra corpus.</hi> From the circulation obſerved by Dr <hi>William Harvey</hi> has <hi>Bellini</hi> taught when, where, and in what caſe or diſeaſe blood is to be let, and how much of it at a time, and what are the effects and conſequences of letting blood. And all this he performs demonſtratively, that is, he forms infallible concluſions in a practical Art and anent cures and diſeaſes, by help of a ſpeculative, that is, a certain and Mathematical one. And by this <hi>Bellini</hi> explains and confirmes what Mr <hi>Newton</hi> in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face ſays thus. <hi>Omnis Philoſophiae (adde etiam Medicinae quae Philoſophiae pars eſt) difficuitas in eo verſari videtur, ut a Phaens menis motuum inveſtigemus vires naturae, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inde ab his viribus demonſtremus Phaenomena reliqua.</hi> For <hi>Bellini</hi> has made uſe of the <hi>Phaenomina</hi> of the Bloods motion, to find what force and laws it had or obſerv'd,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:180042:24"/>and having found theſe he inveſtigats and deduces its ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects when its paſſage is made free in one place than in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, that is, the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of Blooding in any caſe or diſeaſe. And yet this Block head <hi>Tarugo</hi> has the face to ſay there are no infallible concluſions in Medicine. But he means it is like, Medicine as he underſtands and practiſes it.</p>
            <p>I come now to the page, 65. Where our Pamphleteer, to his own coſt, teaches the World how abſurd it is and fooliſh, to write anent matters that one underſtands not. He ſhows there (and over all his Pamphlet) that he comes to diſwade men from uſing in their trades as right methods as the Mathematicians have done, and in the mean time proves himſelf altogether ignorant of all Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicks, or methods fit to be uſed for improving Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine. The Doctor had in his firſt diſcourſe explain'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right the Nature (ſo to ſpeak) or <hi>ratio</hi> of ſome diſeaſes of the Eye that are of the greateſt conſequence, hitherto unknown to all the writers of Phyſick; and upon good ground had affirm'd, that bodies ſwiming within the <hi>Cornea</hi> made no image on the <hi>Retina;</hi> (this he could have demonſtrated, but it would hâve ſeem'd, perhaps, very odd in an Inaugural Oration to propoſe Geometrical Arguments) Now, ſays our Pamphleteer, I <hi>Tarugo</hi> affirm the contrary. He may as well looking on any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition demouſtrated by <hi>Euclide</hi> or <hi>Archimedes,</hi> ſay, I affirm the contrary; for he'l. underſtand the demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of what the Doctor affirms, (and which is ſet down in a paper ſubjoin'd to this) as little as he does <hi>Arcihmedes</hi> Works, or Dr <hi>Gregory's</hi> method of Quadratures.</p>
            <p>But it is perhaps pleaſant to conſider, what a noiſe he
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:180042:25"/>makes that he may be thought learn'd. He crys out on the Doctor, for not telling him what are the Laws of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraction he ſpeaks of and is very glad to be free of them; for it they had been ſet down, he would not have known what to have ſaid of them. This is juſt ſuch a ſhift as it would be to deny the truth of a proportion plainly flowing from the 47 of the firſt of <hi>Euclià,</hi> becauſe the Demonſtrator had not told what that 47 prop, contains, and ſo had not prom ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated it. The univerſal Law of refraction is as well known as any propoſition in <hi>Euclid,</hi> amongſt Mathematicians; and ſince all the Science about the Eye is built upon this Law, what an able man in the Opticks and in diſcovery of the defects in Viſion is our Pamphleteer like to prove, while he is ſo groſly ignorant of it? He adventur's to ſay, <hi>pag.</hi> 66. That, of things on, or in the <hi>Cornea</hi> there is an Image made in the <hi>Retina</hi> if he try'd it not, he is too bold to impoſe his bad Philoſophy &amp; vain conjecture on men of Senſe; and if he try'd it, he lies moſt abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly. For, beſides experience, the demonſtration after this ſet down, puts it out of queſtion. That in the <hi>Retina</hi> or bottom of the Eye there is no image painted of any thing that is not without the <hi>Cornea,</hi> and conſequently we have no Image of (that is, we do not ſee) theſe things that ſwim within the <hi>Cornea.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now let us ſee what a marvellous reaſoner this Fellow is, that without skill in Mathematicks is ſo bold as to meddle in them. He tells us, that if what is here demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated be true, then a man may ſee perfectly well through his Eye lids, or through a Mil-ſtone apply'd to the <hi>Cornea</hi> as the lids can he. For, ſays he (<hi>page,</hi> 66.) according to the Doctor, a thing ſo near the <hi>Cornea</hi>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:180042:25"/>will make no impreſſion on the Eye, and ſo no ways ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct the ſight: But the Doctor ſaid and demonſtrated, that a thing ſufficiently nigh, or within the <hi>Cornea,</hi> makes no Image on the bottom of the Eye and is not ſeen. This fellow, by his fooliſh philoſophy infers, O then it will not obſtruct the ſight. It will certainly if apply'd over all the <hi>Cornea,</hi> for by its opacity it hinders the rayes to paſs from other Bodies. But this he knew not, to wit, that the rayes of the Sun do not eaſily paſs through Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtones. Then he infers, that if what the Doctor ſays be true. Perſons who have a Cataract growing in their Eyes, would not ſee Midges, as it were, that is, the Images of the little Bodies which float within the <hi>Cornea,</hi> and join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing make up the Cataract. Here is a great inſtance of our Pamphleteers prying Judgement. The Doctor to ſhow that in a Cataract there are no <hi>muſcae obvolitantes &amp; obver ſantes oculis,</hi> ariſing from the Images made on the <hi>Retina</hi> by <hi>Corpuſculs</hi> floating within the <hi>Cornea,</hi> Taught, that <hi>Corpuſculs</hi> ſo plac' d would imprint no Image: O then, ſays the Fool, there would be no Images of Midges before the Eyes of thoſe in whom a Cataract is growing. It is indeed ſo, there are none; and Experience as well as Demonſtration prove it to be as the Doctor affirm'd long agoe. Ye ſee how fundamentally he refures the Doctor: For, ſays he, if what the Doctor ſays (and demonſtrates) be true, then the contrary is falſe. And who can help it?</p>
            <p>However, he makes a wonderful ſhift in the pages 67 and 68. to make a ſilly Reader believe he (the Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phleteer) underſtood the matter he's treating of: for he very impudently comes off with laughing at an Axiome,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:180042:26"/>the Doctor had adduced from the Opticks. Let him laugh ſo long as he will, it is an Axiome, and admitted for ſuch by all the Writers of <hi>Opticks,</hi> and confirm'd by conſtant experience; That from every point of a viſible object (that is, an object illuſtrated and at a due diſtance from the eye) Rayes of light come to all the parts of the <hi>Cornea.</hi> And therefore (ſaid the Doctor) tho ſome parts of the <hi>Cornea</hi> were cover'd with Opacous Bodies, the eye would ſee all the parts of the object. Now this I can let any perſon ſee, by putting Bodies not tranſparent on the <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nea</hi> of an eye, or by looking on the opack marks which ſome perſons have on their <hi>Cornea;</hi> For they'l not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der you from ſeing the whole object, except the whole <hi>Cornea</hi> be covered with them. But ſays our Pamphle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teer, If Rays fall on theſe opack Bodies laid to the <hi>Cornea,</hi> or on the Opack Corpuſculs within it, will not theſe hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the paſſage of thoſe Rays? Yes certainly But in the mean time, other Rays from the ſame point of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject fall on all the other points (and ſome are not covered, but give a free paſſage) of the <hi>Cornea,</hi> or Aqueous hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour; and by help of ſuch Rays we ſee that point of the Object, as experience does teach us. And this alſo ſhews us the truth of the <hi>Optick maxime</hi> adduc'd by Doctor <hi>Pitcairne.</hi> But this fellow is impregnable againſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſe.</p>
            <p>The pages 72 and 73, are taken up in letting us ſee; That he underſtands not one ſentence of what the Doctor had ſaid, nor of what can be ſaid in this point; which he needed not have been at the pains to do, having ſo effectually done it before. And he very rightfully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes, That the Doctor's Oration is ſtark Non ſenſe;
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:180042:26"/>for indeed the Doctor is a Barbarian to our Pamphleteer, and not to be underſtood by a Fellow of ſo mean un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding.</p>
            <p>We come now to the page 76. Where our Pamphle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teer falls a defying of <hi>Archimedes,</hi> who ſaid, that if he were plac'd near the earth (not ſuſtain'd by it) on a firm point, he could move the earth. This our Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion was not concern'd in; but it ſeems, he would needs make himſelf famous by having defy'd <hi>Archimedes.</hi> Yet he ſhall be foil'd by a leſſer one than he. For it is demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated by the Writers of Mechanicks, that any body how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever great can be moved from its place or way, by any other tho never ſo ſmall, and never ſo ſlowly or weakly making impreſſion on it, <hi>In medio minime reſiſtente vel uniformi;</hi> and Mr <hi>Newton</hi> has demonſtrated, that the earth and the reſt of the planets are in ſuch a Medium, and <hi>Archimedes</hi> knew the medium to be ſuch. <hi>Archime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> then had reaſon, which our Pamphleteer ſhould have learn'd of him, or of Mathematicians who are like him.</p>
            <p>We advance then to his page 77. where he ſays, that the Doctors principal deſign in the diſcourſe, <hi>de circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latione per vaſa minima,</hi> was to explain how Secretion is made in mens Bodies: Which is falſe. For his great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign there was to refute two opinions anent that affair, which are very much talked of where he then was; But this he could not do without explaining Secretion as to ſome of its properties: for neither he, nor any man elſe has yet explain'd all of them publickly. But let us ſee what he ſays, page 79, &amp; 80. There he very bravely affirms, that ſome bodies, tho every way leſs than the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:180042:27"/>hole they are offered to, yet will not paſs through that hole. Which is a further teſtimony of his impudent ſtupidity: He had before told us of <hi>Two ſcrew-nails e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual, but contrary wayes turn'd, which will not enter the one where the other does.</hi> This Blockhead does not underſtand what the Doctor had taught, to wit, that theſe two Nails are not <hi>figurae ſimiliter poſitae,</hi> and that as the one is offered, it is not of an equal Diameter with the other as it is propoſed to the paſſage. I am convinc'd now, that this Fellow knows not what a Diameter is: elſe he would not, I think, with all his impudence deny, that a body whoſe ſides every way are nearer to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, than are to one another the ſides of a certain hole, may enter that hole; or, that a body whoſe greateſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent is leſt than the leaſt extent of a hole, may enter and paſt through it: for thus I have worded the Doctors pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, that I might not terrify our Pamphleteer with Diameters that he underſtands ſo little; for it's plain, that what is leſs than the leaſt Diameter of an orifice can be contain'd in it, ſince the Diameter is contain'd in it, and ſo I leave him to ſpeak non-ſenſe about his Screws, while I in a few words deliver the ſubſtance of what the Doctor alledges; and then I ſhall leave it to the Reader to judge if he had reaſon on his ſide. All the Secretions that are made in our bodies are liquid, and liquors; and all liquors can accomodate themſelves to the figure of any veſſel; whatſoever be the figure of the parts of the fluid or liquors, yet the liquor it ſelf yeelds to the figure of its veſſel. And if any liquor by reaſon of its viſcouſnes does not readily enter a ſmall orifice, when the force impel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling it is not able to divide it into ſmaller portions, that
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:180042:27"/>liquor is excluded, not by reaſon of its figure, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is too great a portion of parts, (in reſpect of the impelling force) cohaerent. Now this is a demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the uſefulneſs of the diverſity of Figures in pores or Secretory veſſels; and no more was needful to convince men of their errour in this affair. But this is paſt over by our Champion, becauſe it was too plain, and gave him no room to play with his Screws.</p>
            <p>Therefor we muſt follow him to the page 84. The Doctor had demonſtrated, that a ſolid carried in a liquor, and driven by its current to an orifice, (not circular) if its Diameter be every way ſmaller than the ſmalleſt of the orifice, then it would enter and paſs tho it were of never ſo different a figure from the orifice: But if it be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therways, the Doctor did demonſtrat that there would be an infinite number of turns and times in which it could not paſs, for one in which it might, that is to ſay, (for I ſee our Pamphleteer has aſpight at any way of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion which forces him to underſtand what he reads) in all eternity it would paſs at moſt but once. To this our Champion Anſwers; O then it may paſs, and that is enough to ſpoil the demonſtration. And indeed it was enough for him to make this Anſwer to a demonſtration he underſtood nothing of. He falls (after this ſhortand ſubſtantious Anſwer) upon a Rope-dancer, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares him with a corpuſcule carried by the current: And becauſe the Rope dancer can ballance himſelf and do many things as the liſts, he wiſely concluds, that an inanimat particle carried down by an unthinking liquor, can doe the like, and ballance itſelf ſo as to be in the wiſh'd for ſituation, juſt when it is at theentry of a canal.
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:180042:28"/>This might have paſt when Trees ſpoke. But I muſt here againt put you in mind of the neceſſity and uſefulneſs of that advice the Doctor gave, to beware of the Sects of Philoſophy. Our Pamphleteer needed this advice more than any man alive: For his whole Pamphlet (except where he plays the Comedian) is an inſignificant diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe buil on the ſilly opinions and falſhoods taught by ſome ſects of Philoſophy. And in this place he manful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attempts to ſpoil a Demonſtration, by ſuppoſing, forſooth, that every part of our Blood is a rational and thinking Rope-dancer, he ſhould have added, and a Comedian too.</p>
            <p>Let us goe on to his 88 page. The Doctor had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that either there would be no Secretion, or entry of ſmall-bodies into the ſecretory veſſels, or, the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles muſt change the orifice to a circular figure, ſince no other figure could give them entry more than once in an infinite time. Now let us here what anſwer our Champion makes. <hi>There is not (ſays he)the leaſt ſhadow of probability, that pores will become circular by corpuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culs of different figures ſtriving to enter, and forcing their way: for a Cube applying it ſelf to a ſquare orifice will never make the orifice round, for it cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and will ſomer be made round than the pore</hi> The Doctor ahd demonſtrated firſt, that the corpuſculs of different figures, and not having all their Diameters leſs than the leaſt one of the orifice, would not enter. And there our Champion very gravely (but without reaſon) pronounce, that they might enter, notwithſtanding of what was ſaid. In the next place; The Doctor told, that if they ſhould enter, then they'd make the Orifice
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:180042:28"/>round. Hold, ſayes the Champion, they cannot enter at all. And indeed, he is in the right on't, for they'll not enter in ones lifetime, and what then becomes of Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion mannag'd by diverſity of Pores? It is ſtrange tho, to ſee the dice ſo much at this fellow's command, that they are in what humour he pleaſes of entring or not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring.</p>
            <p>But it is very pleaſant to ſee, how gingerly he paſſes over the Doctor's Demonſtration of the Orifices of all our Veſſels being Circular. The Demonſtration is ſhortly this. All Liquors running through a Canal whoſe ſides are mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branous, &amp; eaſily yeild (tho at firſt the Orifice of it be not circular-ways diſpoſ'd) do equally on all ſides tend from the Center to the Circumference, and conſequently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the containing Membrane equally on all ſides; and ſo its Orifice becomes Circular, ſince a Circle is nothing elſe but a figure, whoſe ſides every where are equally diſtant from a point within them, which we call the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. What do you think is his anſwer? Forſooth, Sir, it is a queſtion. How comes it then to paſs, ſays he, page 90, That the Valvuls at the Heart, and the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>vula</hi> are not worn away? And why has not the Air made our Noſtrils round ere now? I cannot gueſs, what propoſe it ſerves for to ſpeak of the <hi>Valvuls</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>vula</hi>'s being not worn away, unleſs it be to prove that he'll always have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to ſay, tho never ſo little to the purpoſe; for here the Doctor is ſpeaking only of extending thin membra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Orifices: And it is very plain that the Valvuls by the force of the entring Blood are apply'd to the ſides of tha Arteries <hi>ex. gr.</hi> and conſequently become circular, as every ſection of the Artery is. As to our Noſtrils; Our Pamphleteer for the favour I have done him in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:180042:29"/>his firſt queſtion, is to prove that our Noſtrils are thin and very yeilding Membranes, juſt as the capil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary Veſſels are; Yea as thin and yeilding in reſpect of of the Air, as the capillary Veſſels are in reſpect of the Blood; and here we have preſcinded from the impetus that the Blood has from the Heart, the like whereof the Air has not.</p>
            <p>Our Champion finding, that in ſpite of his Anſwers &amp; queſtions, too the diverſity of Pores would fall; is reſolv'd (page 92) to comply, but is not able to overcome that great difficulty, (great to Block heads and Dunces) How it comes, that either Urine does not paſs with the Bile, if the paſſage for the Bile be greater than that for the Urine, or that the Bile does not go alongſt with the Urine, if the paſſage for this be wideſt? Now this is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd already by the Doctor int he 18 paragraph of his diſcourſe <hi>de circulatione per vaſaminima:</hi> But this man underſtood it not, tho the account of the Phaenomenon there given be very plain. Yet to pleaſe him, I'll let him make the paſſage for the Bile wider than that for the Urine, (tho it he make it narrower, it will not avail him) O then, ſays he, All the Urine will goe through the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to the Inteſtines. Youare hugely in the wrong, Sir, with your Metaphyſicks. For, to tell you in plain Scotch, what you could not underſtand when the Doctor told it in plain Lain; There is no ſincere and homogeneous Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion in the Body of Man: And the Bile when it is ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd in the Liver, has driven alongſt with it ſome parts of Urine, and ſome parts like thoſe ſecern'd in many other places. For when the Blood comes at the ſame time by different portions to the Liver and Kidneys,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:180042:29"/>it is plain, that there will paſs through the Kidneys all that can paſs, (in which company there will be a little Bile, if the paſſage there be narrower than in the Liver) and in the Liver at the ſame time, out o fthe blood that comes thither will be ſecern'd whatever is looſe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceavalbe by the paſſage of the Bile: and here we'll find ſome part of Urine (which, becauſe the Bile flows ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and for the moſt part ſtagnats in its ſecretory veſſels, unites by time with the fat like parts of the Bile) and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther excretions too; all which join'd together make what commonly is call'd Bile. Now, there is no fear that all the Urine come this way, for the Bile muſt come this way (ſince to pleaſe our Pamphleteer, we have made the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage in the Kidneys too narrow for the Bile) and the Urine has ſufficient paſſage in the Kidneys to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the greateſt part of it; the paſſges through the Liver being too few for both. But there are other reaſons that can be brought, were it not a folly to caſt a Pearle before ſuch a beaſt as this is, that underſtands nothing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept to kick. For it was not the Doctors deſign to explain every Secretion in the Body, but only ſecretion in general, that is, ſome properties common to all Secretions; ſuch as, that all ſecretion is done without any Ferment, and all ſecretion is performed in pores of a circular figure. But the particular ſecretions depend upon ſomething beſides, better known to Doctor <hi>Pitciarne</hi> than to <hi>Tarugo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is time now to follow him to the page 97, 98, and 99, where he is Angry (or not pleas'd) with the Doctor, for ſaying, that Mercury (the Doctor is ſpeaking of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon quick ſilver) acts in our Bodies by its weight C, then, ſays the Pamphleteer, <hi>Gold would raiſe a Sali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and cure the French. Pox better than Mercury;</hi>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:180042:30"/>which, ſays he, <hi>the meaneſt Surgeon knows to be ſalfe.</hi> Here is a mighty inſtance of the ignorance of this Fellow. The Doctor had ſaid, that if Gold were as fluid as Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuty, it would doe greater Feats. And this is the ſame as to have ſaid, that Mercury would doe greater fears than it now does, if it were heavier or as heavy as gold Now, which the Surgeons that are the Pamphleteers friends has told him, that Gold reduc'd to a ſtate of fluidity, like Mercury, would not cure the French Pox; I cannot tell this I know, it would be kindly done in a Surgion to tell him how to write a Receit or bill for his patient, but he has yet a quarrel with the Doctor, for ſaying, that baths wrought only by their weight on our bodies. He adduces <hi>Bellini's</hi> authority to prove that they work otherways than by their weight, ſince <hi>Bellini</hi> thinks it probable that they penetrat through the Skin to the liquors, &amp;c. But pray good <hi>Tarugo</hi> does <hi>Bellini</hi> ſays that they penetrate by any other force than their weight? It is their weight that produces the effects attributed to them, and it is the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward preſſure that (as an effect of weight) is the moſt certain operation of Baths. The effects that may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd by penetrating, are not ſo certain; the penetration being more dubious thatn the preſſure tho both are the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of weight. But theſe things are too clear.</p>
            <p>And I therefore paſs to the page 102: which, and to the page 110, he ſpends, as he would have one think. In refuting what the Doctor advances in a Diſcourſe about Reſpiration. But he touches not, nor medles with any thing ſaid thereanent. Only in the page 105. He leaps to another Diſcourſe, in which the Doctor <hi>en paſſant</hi> had Anſwered an Objection made againſt his Opinion
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:180042:30"/>about Reſpiration, ſome time after it had been printed. The Objection was How it comes to paſs, That if a Whelp <hi>ex. gr.</hi> once breath, and then be ſtop'd from breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before the old Canals (through which much of the blood paſt before breathing) be ſtopt, yet will dye in a little time. The Doctor gives two anſwers to it. The firſt made it plain (from what he had proven in his <hi>de Reſpiratione</hi>) that the expanded Air ſtopt the paſſage of the Lungs, which had never been ſtopt before, the whole Blood never having paſt thro the old Canals with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out touching at the Lungs: And ſo the Whelp muſt in a little time dye; a part of the Blood being ſtopt in the right Ventricle of the Heart. Here our Champion firſt makes a great noiſe, by calling this a lame Demonſtration whereas the Block head might have ſeen that it is an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to an Objection. But he had been ſo harraſied with Demonſtrations, &amp; put by them to ſuch pitiful ſhifts, that the Terrour of them was not gone; and therefore when he fell into a place where the Doctor was giving out his Anſwers, he took them for Demonſtrations too. Next, he cry's out that a Clown may laugh at the Doctor who ſays, That tho the old Canals be open, yet the Blood will not all go that way, becauſe it never all went that way. Now this Fellow lye's. For the Dotor had ſaid, That the Blood could not all go thro the old Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals; and this, I think, is a reaſon for its not going all thro them. The old Canals are not capacious enough to give paſſage to the whole Blood, ſo as to mautain the neceſſary Circulation, and Life depending on it. That this Fellow lyes on the Doctor it appears both from what he tranſlates out of the Doctors Anſwer, in the beginning
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:180042:31"/>of the the page 105, and from what he acknowledges in the two laſt lines, page 106, and the two firſt of page 107. But he was neceſſitated to make a Lye, for elſe he had nothing at all to ſay. Yet after he has acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged himſelf to have ly'd, and that the Doctor had told plainly, That the Blood could not all paſs thro the old Canals, but ſome of it at every <hi>Syſtole Cordis</hi> would be left in the right Ventricle of the Heart; he very Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterially ſays, <hi>Let it e'en ſtep on ſlowly, and take the more time, and it will come to its journey's end before night.</hi> This Fellow's buſineſs here was to prove, That all the Blood could paſs thro the old Canals. Inſtead of doing this, he gives in his word for it, that it will all paſs, but ſlowly. But he Lyes ſo often, that I am not reſolv'd to take any thing upon his bare Authority. In the mean time, I'll advertiſe him, that in a very few Syſtoles the right Ventricle of the Heart will be ſo fill'd with Blood (which ſhould have paſt thro the Lungs, and cannot yet paſs thro the old Canals timeouſly) that no more Blood can be receiv'dd into that Ventricle; And ſo the Circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ceaſes at the Fountain. But after our Champion had acknowledged that he had ly'd, finding no advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage againſt the Doctor by being ingenuous, he Repents himſef, and falls back into his former Lye, and through almoſt two pages makes a fine Dialogue with a Child, (It would ſeem to have been his Trade) founded on no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but his own Lye.</p>
            <p>He comes next page 111, To cavil at the account gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by the Doctor of one Thunder-ſtroke ſome years agoe, whoſe Lungs were clapt together in an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary manner and degree: This is matter of fact. Here
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:180042:31"/>our Champion cry's out againſt the Doctor for having faid, That the Lungs too much blown up with Air, hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Circulation throw themſelves; And yet now, ſays he, he makes their not being blown at all to ſtop that ſame Circulation. If he had any ſenſe or ingenuity he'd ſee both to be true. If the Lungs be too much blown, the Blood-veſſells are too much ſtraitned: If they are entirely flaccid, there wants the weight of the Air, and elaſticity to ſqueeſe the blood by turnes into the left Ventricle of the Heart, and ſo it cannot paſs ſufficiently in One (whoſe old Canals are ſtopt) to entertain Life: Now, it when One is puting forth the Air out of his Lungs it ſhall happen (as it happened to the Perſon kill'd by the Thunder) that the Air is ratified, and ſo made much and ſuddenly lighter, It will come to paſs That firſt, a ſmall part of that maſs of Air which he put forth will returne to the Lungs, becauſe a ſmall part now takes up the room of the whole; And therefore, there will be wanting that weight which the whole maſs before exerted for continuing the Circulation thro the Lungs: And Secondly, The Man muſt dye, if the Air continue in this ſtate of rare fraction made by the Lightning, longer than he can live without Air, as the event ſheu'd it had done in this Man's caſe And here we have a new proof of the hurt that Metaphyſicks doe in Reaſoning; For our Champion by vertue of them has found out, <hi>That in Liquors the parts by rare fraction grow leſs than before; Whereas, ſay's he, they might indeed grow larger, if they were like the parts of braſs or malleable matter.</hi> Now every body knows that the portions of Air are Elaſtick, and that when they are libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:180042:32"/>rated from compreſſion, they like wool (for to this they are by Mr. <hi>Royl</hi> and others likned) exolve and expand themſelves without having their parts made Leſſer, but only by having ſome of them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd farther from ſome others than before, and ſo acquire a greater ſuperfice, or volume. But out Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion muſt be excuſed for his miſtake; for the Metaphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicks make no mention of Elaſtick Fluids. Before I leave him, I muſt take notice how he wreſts and mangles the Doctors words. The Doctor had ſaid, That (in the caſe of him that was kill'd with Thunder) <hi>The air being ſuddenly and much expanded (the air which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viron'd the Man) could not blow up the Lungs, its weight being diminiſhed, neither could it enter, its ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfice being enlarged.</hi> And this fellow makes the Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or ſay. <hi>That the particles of the Air become larger and lighter.</hi> Now his Metaphyſicks would not have furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him with any quible againſt the Airs growing lighter and more expanded; but he had a quible about parts growing leſſer, which I leave him to purſue: Only, ſince the Air may be expanded, and any portion of it fill a larger ſpace; I would know, if then its parts do not proportionally grow larger? For, <hi>Totum faciunt partes</hi> I come now to his page. 117.</p>
            <p>In this and ſome following pages he makes all the uſe he can of his <hi>Art</hi> Metaphiſical, which ſeems to be the ſame with <hi>Lullius's,</hi> that is, the Art of raving and pratling of things he knows nothing of at all.</p>
            <p>The Doctor in a diſcourſe had made it manifeſt, That no ferment in the Stomach diſſolves our meats. This was his main deſign; and his reaſon was, that the ſame
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:180042:32"/>Ferment would diſſolve our Stomachs and Guts. In place of this Ferment he ſubſtituted the attrition that the meat ſuffers in the ſtomach, by the which its parts are ſeparated, after that by the heat of the Invironing parts and moiſture, it is made tender and eaſie to be divided into ſmall par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles He rejected therefore Doctor <hi>Liſters</hi> Opinion, not as falſe, but in ſo far as he attributed too much to Putrification; and becauſe it is plain, that the efficient cauſe (which is mainly requir'd) is the ſtomach (help'd by other parts) by its motion. But becauſe the Doctor knew it would be objected, that the ſame attrition might wear off parts of the ſtomach, he thought fit to furniſh his Reader with an Anſwer to it, taken out of many that could be made, and it is this; that the ſame parts and ſides of a bit of meat are expoſed to the action of the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, whereas this action is not performed by the ſame parts of the ſtomach, but by diverſe parts of it apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one after another. This Anſwer the Pamphleteer takes no notice off; for he had nothing to ſay againſt it. Now, it is plain, that the ſerment is applyed always to the ſame part of the ſtomach, eſpecially it being deriv'd from the blood in <hi>Glanduls</hi> which contain it, and furniſh the ſtomach with it: For I make uſe of the word <hi>Glandule,</hi> to pleaſe and comply with the Adverſaries.</p>
            <p>We are then to conſider what the Pamphleter ſays pag 124. There he is very angry at the Doctor for ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, That the Circulation of the Blood is the ground and foundation of all Medicine. For beſides that One might infer from it. That a good friend of the Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phleters knew nothing of Medicine, becauſe when he was examin'd, he told very gravely, as one who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:180042:33"/>what he ſays, That the blood went out by the Veins from the Heart, and return'd to it by Arteries from all parts of the Body; I ſay, beſids this, it ſpoils his pretences of being a learn'd Phyſician by reading ſcraps of <hi>Hippocrate</hi> and <hi>Galen,</hi> who were ignorant of it; as the Doctor has prov'd beyond any poſſibility of being refuted. But there is great reaſon of ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the Pamphleteer himſelf does not underſtand the Circulation, and then he had but reaſon to be angry with the Doctor for extolling it ſo farr. In the ſame page the Pamphleteer endeavours to ſhew that the Circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not the ground of Medicine, ſince after its inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Phyſicians practiſe after the old method, by Deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, Revulſions, and Bloodings at different parts of the Body. Where he means (elſe he ſpeaks arrant nonſenſe) that Derivations &amp;c. are inconſiſtant with the Circulation; Which proves him ignorant of the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation altogether, for theſe agree exactly,</p>
            <p>Let him to this purpoſe read the ſixth prop of <hi>Bellini de Miſſione Sanguinis.</hi> But ſince he underſtands not Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicks, he'll not underſtand the demonſtration of that propoſition.</p>
            <p>In the pag 125. He ſhows himſelf a notable Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putant. For the Doctor had taught, That if any obſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhould happen in the Conduits, it would, <hi>ceteris paribus,</hi> more readily happen in the Arteries than in the Veins, &amp;c becauſe the blood, which carries the cauſes of obſtructions, runs from the wider towards the narrower part of the Artery; ſo that the ſides of the Arteries doe oppoſe the motion of the blood, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary whereof happens in the Veins: And the thing
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:180042:33"/>that could make an Obſtruction in a Vein, muſt make it firſt an Artery; for it muſt firſt by the law of the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation come to the ſmalleſt part of the Artery and paſs it, before it can come to ſtop in the Vein. Now, the Artery being as ſmall (or ſmallet) as the Vein, if it could obſtruct the laſt, it muſt obſtruct the firſt. The Pamphleteer finds here a brave way to eſcape, and raiſe, as he thought, a great diſput. The ſides, ſays he, of the Arteries are yeelding, and ſo cannot ſupport the ends or Arches, as it were, of the obſtructing Body. But are not the ſides of the Arteries as ſtiff as the ſides of the Veins, &amp;c. But it is to be remarked, that obſtructions happen in the places where the motion of the Blood is ſloweſt, and where there is very litle dilatation of the Arteries; ſo that all our Pamphleteer's quibles ſerve to no purpoſe, unleſs to prove, That the is no ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction at all: For the Doctor in the 22 paragraph of that Diſcourſe ſhews, That the Obſtructing of Viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cous ſticking matter is to be found rather in the <hi>Arteriae Evaneſcentes</hi> than in the Veins: Now, the <hi>Arteriae Evaneſcentes</hi> retain nothing of an Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. ſave the figure. This was told by the Doctor in that paragraph in mathematical termes, that the thing might be leſs ſubject to ambiguity, and the more comprehenſively expreſt. <hi>AEqualis eſt velocitas in evaneſcente</hi> Arteria <hi>&amp; naſcente Vena,</hi> ſaid the Doctor; and therefore no more motion in the One than in the Other. This is manifeſt, by the Vein's being a continued conduit with the Artery, as the Doctor prov'd, and Microſcopes let us ſee. And thus our Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler's pitiful ſhifts are diſcovered; which depend upon
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:180042:34"/>groſs ignorance of Anatomy and Mathematicks, and every thing that is accurately expreſt, that is, put in a Mathematical form of words.</p>
            <p>Let us now come up to his page 129. The Doctor had taught that <hi>Willis</hi> and <hi>Sylvius,</hi> and a great many others were in the wrong to place the cauſe of Apoplexies, &amp;c, In the Nerves, ſince by what is ſaid in that diſcourſe <hi>de Circulatione in Genitis &amp; non Genitis,</hi> the ſaid cauſe muſt principally be found in the Arteries. And becauſe the Doctor knew it was the common doctrine of the place he then was in, That Apoplexies were produc'd ſometimes by a Coagulation of the Blood, in which caſe they reckon'd that Rupturs and Extravaſations follow'd; and ſometimes (this was the opinion of <hi>Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lvius</hi> a man famous there) by a kind of Coagulation of the ſpirits, by the force or infection of <hi>Opium</hi> or other bodies having the like quality. Now in this caſe they reckoned no extravaſations of Blood, ſince the fault is in the Spirits and not in the Blood. The Doctor made no doubt of the truth of what is alledged in the firſt place; ſince obſervations teach, that Apoplexies often fall out by the Coagulation of the Blood in the Arteries, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently its extravaſation: And therefore he ſpeaks no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of it, but in general that whatever it be, it muſt make the firſt obſtruction in the Arteries. And then he falls to examine the ſecond opinion, anent Apoplexie's being produc'd by the immobility and Coagulation of the Animal Spirits; which <hi>Willis</hi> tollowed too. To doe this aright, he explains the way of <hi>Opiums</hi> working; which is not by killing or coagulating the Spirits: But by rari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the blood, which compreſſes the Nerves in the head
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:180042:34"/>where there is leaſt reſiſtance. Now, this is ſo manifeſt, that there is no rarifier of the blood of any force, that is, no efficacious ſudorifick, that does not bring ſleep on the Perſon that is put a ſweating. Here our Pamphleteer objects; that then, <hi>Spirit of Hart-horn</hi> &amp;c: And ſuch like rarifiers of the Blood, would bring men into Apoplexies, which nevertheleſs cure that diſeaſe. This fellow has never ſeen an Apoplexy that talks of curing it by the rarifying force of Spirit of Hart-horn and the like. The Volatile Salts and Spirits given in good quantities to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poplectick perſons, work neither by their rarifying qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, nor by their coagulating one, but by their ſtimulat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and irritating force (as the Doctor taught us when he treated about Apoplexy) or the force and power they have of raiſing pain: For it's plain, that the foame of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar from a red hot-iron has as much vertue to recover one from an Apoplectick fit, as the ſpirit of Hart-horn, tho Vineger be no great rarifier of the blood. <hi>As</hi> for giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſpirit of Hart-horn or volatile Salts inwardly, (a thing not to be done in the fit of an Apoplexy) If they be given in a good and ſufficient quantity, they'l bring eaſe of pain, and ſleep, juſt as doth <hi>Opium,</hi> which I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire our Pamphleteer to learn, But it is not poſſible to ſee ſuch effects of the Volatile Spirit or Salts, if they be given by one gutt or grain for a Doſe, as he and his learn'd friend do order them. Now I leave it to a diſcreet Reader to judge, what an excellent argument this of the Pamphleteer is againſt the Doctor. If (ſays the Pamphleteer page 130) Wyne or any thing that rarifies the Blood bring a fit of an Apoplexy, then another Doſe of the ſame will cure you of the fit. I leave this cure to his Friend and Comatade. But I proceed.</p>
            <pb n="51" facs="tcp:180042:35"/>
            <p>The Doctor teaches; That every thing which rarifies the blood ſo much, that the Arteries in the Brain contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, are dilated to a degree ſufficient for compreſſing the Nerves there, and ſo hindering the Efflux of Spirits, will bring Sleep; and perhaps a fit of ſleepy Diſeaſe. Now this is evident.</p>
            <p>O but, ſays our Pamphleteer, Then all Sudoriſicks <hi>&amp;c.</hi> will make us ſleep. And I tell him, they'll certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do ſo, when either their quantity or force is ſuch as to produce a dilatation of the Arteries ſufficient to compreſs the Nerves in the Brain.</p>
            <p>What he ſays farther in this affair, is arrant nonſenſe; as is what he talks about the Heart's having an Antagoniſt Muſcle, than which nothing could have been ſaid ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Anatomy, and ſo proper to make our Pamphle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teer's groſs Ignorance appear to the meaneſt Apprentice. The Doctor had taught, That the reaſon of the Heart's motion not ceaſing was, that the Heart had not an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite Muſcle: For at all times all the Muſcles have an equal quantity of Spirits flowing to them, and keeping them in <hi>Aequilibrio;</hi> elſe one Muſcle would move the Member, while the other being deſtitute of Spirits to blow it and contract it, remain'd idle and uſeleſs. Now if Muſcles for bowing the Arm <hi>ex gr.</hi> prevail, it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have, over and above the quantity of Spirits and Blood which they got to keep them in ballance with thoſe Muſcles which ſerve to hindet it from bowing, a new quantity ſent to caſt the ballance, and to make the contraction ſtronger on their ſide. Now, the Heart hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no Muſcle to act againſt it, or to how a Member to the contrary ſide, needs fewer Spirits and Nerves leſs
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:180042:35"/>free from compreſſion; and ſo can be in motion when other Muſcles are not, which require a quantity of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits to overcome the quantity of their oppoſite Muſcles, over and above what is requiſite to keep them in <hi>Aequili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brio,</hi> Whereas the Heart requires no more than what would keep in <hi>Aequilibrio</hi> with its oppoſite, if it had any; and much leſs. To this our Pamphleteer Anſwers, That tho the Heart has not an oppoſite or Antagoniſt Muſcle, yet it has firſt, <hi>the Motus Reſtitutionis</hi> to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount; and ſo have all Muſcles, Sir, (and this is our Pamphleteers depth of Anatomy) as much as the Heart. Next, ſays he, it has the Blood to ſquirt out, and no ſmall force is requiſit to that. And, Sir, other Muſcles have a heavy bone to lift up, a Leg or Arm; and no ſmall force is requiſite to this; Yea over and above, they have the force of a contrary and equal Muſcle to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, which the Heart is not incumbered with. And this is the ſhallowneſs of our Pamphleteer, who has all along ſpoke nonſenſe, becauſe he did not underſtand what it is to have or want an oppoſite or Antagoniſt Muſcle Yet he would needs quible about it, that he might ſeem to underſtand it. He has had the like impudence over all the Pamphlet in medling with Mathematicks of which he is moſt groſly Ignorant; ſo monſtruouſly Ignorant, that he (<hi>page</hi> 85) brings in Bodies, ſome Triangular, ſome Square, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All which are Impoſſibilities, but De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations of the Fellows intollerable Ignorance in an affair in which he pretended to give Judgement. I refer him therefore to his Studies, and to the Mathematick-Profeſſor, who can teach him (if teachable) as much Geometry as will ſerve to let him ſee that the Muſcles
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:180042:36"/>which dilate the Breaſt are ſtronger than theſe which conſtrict it; And that the Muſcles which he has muſter'd up as conſtrictors of it perform a very different office, whatever <hi>Galen</hi> has ſaid to the contrary:</p>
