            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>Good Counſel here's for you, if you will it take,</l>
               <l>In thy Pockets may ſave thee many a Town,</l>
               <l>Where ever thou walkeſt in City, or Town:</l>
               <l>It's known a Good fellow I've been many a year,</l>
               <l>And much have I ſpent in wine and ſtrong heer:</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>For ſo long as I had money, my kind Hoſteſs ſhe,</hi>
               </l>

               <l>For ſhe knew, late or early, a-pace I would call,</l>
               <l>And whoever drink it, yet I'd pay for all;</l>
               <l>Which made her take delight much in my compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny;</l>
               <l>But t'was more for the love of my money, then me:</l>
               <l>And ſo long as my credit and ſtock it would hold,</l>
               <l>Come early or late, I might have what I would:</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>For ſo long as I had money, my kind Hoſteſs ſhe,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Would cry, Come when thou wilt, Boy, thou art welcome to me.</hi>
               </l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But when I had maſted and conſum'd my ſtore,</l>
               <l>And had nothing to mortgage, or ſell to make more,</l>
               <l>Unto my fine Hoſteſs I then told me my tale,</l>
               <l>She muſt lend me ſome money, or I go to'th' Goal:</l>
               <l>Nay tarry, ſaid ſhe, I don't ſee it ſo rife,</l>
               <l>I'ſt not lend you a penny, if 'twould ſave your life:</l>
               <l>This was all the comfort that I got from ſhe</l>

               <l>Therefore it is good to ſave ſomething in ſtore,</l>
               <l>Make much of a little, and 'twill encreaſe more;</l>
               <l>For the times they are hard, and money is ſcant,</l>
               <l>And by drinking there many a man comes to want:</l>
               <l>Then whilſt you have goods, either houſe or yet land,</l>
               <l>Beſure to be careful, and keep't in your hand.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>For ſo long as I had money, my kind Hoſteſs ſhe,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Would cry, Come when thou wilt, Boy, thou art welcome to me.</hi>

            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Let a Man come to to an Alehouſe tho' Cloaths they be poor,</l>
               <l>And if that ſhe ſees you have ſilver good ſtore,</l>
               <l>She'll bid you ſit down, and you're welcome beſide,</l>
               <l>And whatever you tall for, you are not deny'd;</l>
               <l>But when you have waſted, and conſum'd your ſtore,</l>
               <l>Away with this fellow, thruſt him out of door:</l>
               <l>

               <l>This by experience there's many finds true,</l>
               <l>Which makes both their backs, and their bellies to ruc,</l>
               <l>Whilſt they have a penny, or credit will go,</l>
               <l>They ne'er will give o'er, tho' it brings them to woe,</l>
               <l>But there ſit &amp; tipple whilſt a drop will go down:</l>
               <l>Come ſill us more Liquor, tho' it coſt me a Crown:</l>
               <l>Thus his Money doth fly, and he waſteth his Pelf,</l>
               <l>The next day he is ready to hang himſelf.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Then let me adviſe all Good Fellows that be,</l>
               <l>Once learn to be wiſer in e'er degree;</l>
               <l>In your youthful days keen ſomething in ſtore,</l>
               <l>Leſt you're fort'd when you're old, to beg at the door:</l>
               <l>Don't ſpend all thou get, to make others brave,</l>
               <l>When thy Wife &amp; thy Children, ne'er a rag have.</l>

               <l>But when thou haſt good Monty make much of the ſame,</l>
               <l>Don't drink it, and ſpend it in an unlawful Game:</l>
               <l>And 'tis good for all young men to be well advis'd;</l>
               <l>You ſee a good Husband to fortune doth riſe;</l>
               <l>But a Spendthrift you ſee is regarded by none,</l>
               <l>His Word will not go, let him be ne'er ſo young.</l>
               <l>

               <l>Though a Man he has Means, he may ſpend all he have,</l>
               <l>Then he unto others muſt be a bond ſlave;</l>
               <l>Then he ſighs, and he grieves when it is too late,</l>
               <l>He ſhould be ſuch a fool to part with his Eſtate:</l>
               <l>But while he uv'd bravely, O then day and night</l>
               <l>Drinking and Ranting it was his delight;</l>
               <l>But now all is conſumed waſted and gone,</l>
               <l>He may look o'th bare walls, &amp; make his ſad moan.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>For now he is ſlighted, becauſe he's grown poor,</l>
               <l>Nor none will him pitty, nor encreaſe his ſtore,</l>
               <l>But mock him, and ſear him, in his Poverty;</l>
               <l>You might have been wiſer they'll to him reply:</l>
               <l>So he is a Fool that will rant to make others brave,</l>
               <l>And all his liſe after, to live like a ſlave;</l>
               <l>But he is a Wiſe Man, the which doth take pains,</l>
               <l>And then lets his Family taſt of the Gains.</l>
