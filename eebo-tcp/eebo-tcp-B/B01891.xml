            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE CASE OF Sir WILLIAM PORTMAN, and JOHN SANDFORD, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> BURGESSES for the <hi>Burrough</hi> of <hi>TA<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>NTON.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THE ſaid <hi>Burrough</hi> is but a part of one of the Pariſhes of <hi>Taunton,</hi> to which Three other Pariſhes lie contiguous, by Reaſon whereof the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants (being more numerous than the Potwallers (the Name by which the Electors are known) uſe to be the Occaſion of Diſturbances at the Poll: And therefore before, and at the Election, Sir <hi>William Portman,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Sandford</hi> took what care they could to prevent ſuch Diſturbances.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Friday</hi> the <hi>11th,</hi> of <hi>January,</hi> the Mayor (having made a place for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and the Officers with Mr. <hi>Roe</hi> and Mr. <hi>Purchaſe</hi> for Sir <hi>William Portman,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Sandford:</hi> And Mr. <hi>Baker</hi> and Mr. <hi>Wey</hi> for Mr. <hi>Trenchard,</hi> &amp;c. to take the Poll, and alſo a Bar to let in the Potwallers, and to keep out thoſe who had no Voices) proceeded quietly for ſome time; at length, after ſome Diſturbances begun, upon Mr. <hi>Trenchards</hi> deſire the Mayor adjourned for an hour, and then returned and continued the Poll peaceably, polling on both ſides, till almoſt night, and then adjourned till next morning, ſtayed two hours on the place, and by open Proclamations, called for Mr. <hi>Trenchards</hi> Friends to Vote, but none coming, ſhut up the Poll, and Proclaimed Sir <hi>William Portman</hi> and Mr. <hi>Sandford</hi> to be the Burgeſſes.</p>
            <p>As to the Complaint by the Petition concerning the Diſturbance and Souldiers, the Truth is.</p>
            <p>That ſome Leading Men of Mr. <hi>Trenchard's</hi> party, that were diſſatisfied with this Election, and their Abettors, having invited Mr. <hi>Trenchard</hi> to ſtand; and having not Votes enough to carry it for him, were the occaſion of the Diſturbances; in this manner.</p>
            <p>Firſt within the Bar, by fighting without Sticks, and then without the Bar, by provoking and railing Speeches, and by fighting with Sticks, and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Mayor and Gentlemen as they went home towards his Houſe after the Adjournment, that if Mr. <hi>Trenchard</hi> was not choſen, they would have the blood of ſome of them. Which Diſturbances they alſo repeated, after the Mayors return to the Poll.</p>
            <p>Alſo by untrue Allegations of pretended dangers, they diſſwaded Mr. <hi>Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard</hi> from returning to the Poll, or ſending his Voters thither, both after the firſt Adjournment and the next Morning, when all was quiet.</p>
            <p>And by many other unfair practiſes; as before the Poll, by threatning to ſend in people to get it for Mr. <hi>Trenchard,</hi> if not by fair means by force: And ſince the Poll, by offering mony to perſwade people to come to <hi>London</hi> to be Witneſſes againſt Sir <hi>William</hi> and Mr. <hi>Sandford,</hi> of things they never knew; and by threatning ſeveral poor people, to turn them out of work, only in caſe they Voted for Sir <hi>William Portman</hi> and Mr. <hi>Sandford,</hi> which ſince they have done accordingly.</p>
            <p>As to the pretence of any thing done by Souldiers, the Truth is; about twelve Inhabitants Potwallers of <hi>Taunton,</hi> who had taken up Arms for the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> in Collonel <hi>Lutterells</hi> Regiment, having left their Wives and Families in <hi>Taunton,</hi> by leave from their Officers, came without their Arms, in peaceable manner to the Election, and gave their Votes for Sir <hi>William Port<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> and Mr. <hi>Sandford,</hi> as they had done, at other Elections.</p>
