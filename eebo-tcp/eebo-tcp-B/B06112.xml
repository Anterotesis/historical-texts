            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To his Royal Highneſs the Duke.</head>
            <lg>
               <l>THey who oppoſe your Right unto the Crown,</l>
               <l>Would, had they pow'r, pull Monarchy quite down:</l>
               <l>'Tis not, ſo qualifi'd they would have one</l>
               <l>Of this, or that Religion, on the Throne;</l>
               <l>No, no, we know their minds, they would have none.</l>
               <l>The men that lately kept from <hi>Charles</hi> his due,</l>
               <l>Now promiſe fair to dis-inherit you;</l>
               <l>They who explode your Right, to make us ſlaves,</l>
               <l>Are not Preſumptive, but Apparent Knaves:</l>
               <l>By our Diſſentions they would ſmooth their way,</l>
               <l>And from Contenders hope to ſnatch the Prey.</l>
               <l>But ſuch men ſeldom in the end can boaſt,</l>
               <l>They threaten loud, but ſtill their Cauſe is loſt</l>
               <l>In ſuch affairs, they'll find it to their coſt.</l>
               <l>Still the old Cheat, Religion is the cry,</l>
               <l>And made the Ram to batter Monarchy;</l>
               <l>Cauſe they deſerve, they fear the ſmarting Rod,</l>
               <l>And moſt Religiouſly diſtruſt their God.</l>
               <l>Envy at Regal Sway, (Ah it is ſad)</l>
               <l>And Zeal mis-guided made thoſe Bill-men mad:</l>
               <l>Theſe took raſh meaſures, and did ill adviſe;</l>
               <l>But without jealouſie or wrong ſurmiſe,</l>
               <l>The future will prove Loyal, Calm, and Wiſe.</l>
               <l>To us it cannot but aſſurance bring,</l>
               <l>That a good Man can make as good a King.</l>
               <l>Factious deſign, and damn'd Plebeian rage,</l>
               <l>Does to no mean degree diſtract the Age,</l>
               <l>And watch the tott'ring of our ſettled State.</l>
               <l>But can we be ſuch Sheep, ſuch careleſs Elves,</l>
               <l>Not to beware the Wolves among our ſelves?</l>
               <l>Thoſe Beaſts of Prey, that lurk in a diſguiſe,</l>
               <l>That wear our skins; 'tis there our danger lies:</l>
               <l>Againſt their Brother-Wolves they raiſe the cry,</l>
               <l>'Cauſe their Addreſſes are not half ſo ſlie.</l>
               <l>A Papiſt ſeems a Papiſt to our ſight,</l>
               <l>But our Fanatick, 'cauſe he would not fright,</l>
               <l>Daubs o'er the Devil like a Child of Light.</l>
               <l>But Ah! great Sir, where you ſhould ſtill Command,</l>
               <l>You, like a Stranger, viſit your own Land;</l>
               <l>You for a moment Tantalize our ſight,</l>
               <l>Then, like the abſent <hi>Sun,</hi> you give us night:</l>
               <l>But 'tis the ready way, we muſt confeſs,</l>
               <l>To make us know and prize our happineſs;</l>
               <l>Whilſt all do ſuffer, for the faulty few,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>England</hi> muſt loſe it ſelf in loſing you.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But to <hi>Great Britain</hi> come —</l>
               <l>May you in higheſt ſplendor live, and be</l>
               <l>Happy and ſafe, Great Sir, in One of Three.</l>
               <l>Sir, may your Right no otherwiſe prove vain,</l>
               <l>Than by the length of our Great CHARLES his Reign.</l>
               <l>We cannot, Sir, but prove a happy Nation;</l>
               <l>One bliſs enjoy'd, another in expectation.</l>
               <l>There but remains this great Truth in the cloſe,</l>
               <l>Your Virtue 'nd Courage, Sir, the whole World knows,</l>
               <l>And y' are born, for Conqueſt o'er your Foes.</l>
