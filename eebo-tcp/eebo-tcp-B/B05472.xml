            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Forſomuch as by an Act of Our late Parliament, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled, <hi>Act aſſerting Our Prerogative in the ordering and diſpoſal of Trade with For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigners;</hi> It is declared, that the laying on of Reſtraints and Impoſitions upon forraign imported Commodities, doth belong to Us and Our Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, as an undoubted Priviledge and Prerogative of Our Crown; And that by vertue thereof We may ſo order and diſpoſe upon foraign Trade, as We ſhall judge moſt fit for the good of that Our Kingdom. And whereas many humble addreſſes have been made to Us by the Convention of Our Eſtates, in <hi>Auguſt,</hi> 1665. And by the Lords of Our Privy Council, for reſtraining of Iriſh Cattle, Corn, and ſome other Commodities, from coming in to this Kingdom, as being moſt prejudicial there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, by reaſon that Our Subjects are more then ſufficiently provided within themſelves; And incaſe of Trade with forraign Kingdoms and States (which is now for the moſt part ſtopped) are able to ſpare and export conſiderable quantities of all theſe Commodities, and We being moſt willing to grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the Subjects of that Our ancient Kingdom: Therefore, and in teſtimony of Our juſt reſentment of their loyalty and affection to Our ſervice, We, with advice of the Lords of Our Privy Council, have diſcharged; and by theſe preſents diſcharges the importation of all Iriſh Cattle (except Horſes) as alſo, Iriſh Salt Beef, and Corns of whatſoever Grain, or Meal made thereof, to any Town, Port, or Harbour, or any other place of that Our ancient Kingdom, in any Ship or Veſſel whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, after the firſt day of <hi>March</hi> next to come. As alſo, diſcharges all perſons whatſoever to receive or Paſture any of the ſaids Cattle upon their Lands or Paſturage, or to ſell and diſpone thereupon, or to reſet or receive any quantities of the Victual ſo prohibited, or to conceal the ſame within their Houſes or Cellers: And do hereby authorize and command all Magiſtrates of Our Burghs Royal, Sheriffs, or Iuſtices of Peace in all Shires where the Goods or Veſſels ſhall arrive, to prohibit the unloading thereof: And incaſe of contravention, to ſeize, or cauſe ſeize upon the ſamine, to be confiſcat, the one half thereof for Our uſe, and the other half for the uſe of theſe who ſhall attach and ſeize upon the ſame. And further, requires the ſaids Magiſtrates, or either of them, to apprehend the perſons of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traveeners, and to ſecure them by impriſonment till they advertiſe the Lords of Our Privy Council, that order may be given to proceed againſt them as contemners of Our Royal Authority, that all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dign puniſhment may be inflicted upon them without mercy.
