            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>Tune is, <hi>O man in deſperation.</hi>
            </opener>
            <lg>
               <l>IT was a Ladies Daughter,</l>
               <l>of <hi>Paris</hi> properly,</l>
               <l>Her Mother her commanded</l>
               <l>to Maſs that ſhe ſhould hie</l>
               <l>O pardon me dear mother</l>
               <l>her Daughter dear did ſay;</l>
               <l>Unto that filthy Idol,</l>
               <l>I never can obey.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>With weeping and with wailing,</l>
               <l>her mother then did go,</l>
               <l>To aſſemble her kinsfolks,</l>
               <l>that they the truth may know;</l>
               <l>Who being then aſſembled,</l>
               <l>they did this Maiden call,</l>
               <l>And put her into priſon,</l>
               <l>to fear her there withal,</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But where they thought to fear her,</l>
               <l>she did moſt ſtrong endure:</l>
               <l>Although her years were tender</l>
               <l>her faith was firm and ſure:</l>
               <l>She weigh'd not their allurements</l>
               <l>ſhe fear'd no fiery flame:</l>
               <l>ſhe hop'd though Chriſt her Saviour,</l>
               <l>to have immortal fame.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Before the Iudge they brought her,</l>
               <l>thinking that ſhe would turn,</l>
               <l>And there ſhe was condemned</l>
               <l>in fire for to burn:</l>
               <l>Inſtead of golden Bracelets,</l>
               <l>with cords they bound her faſt:</l>
               <l>By God grant me with patience</l>
               <l>(quoth ſhe) to die at laſt.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>And on the morrow after,</l>
               <l>which was her dying day;</l>
               <l>They ſtript this ſilly Dantoſel</l>
               <l>out of her rich array:</l>
               <l>Her chain of gold ſo coſtly</l>
               <l>away from her they take,</l>
               <l>And ſhe again moſt joyfully</l>
               <l>did all the world forſake.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Unto the place of torment</l>
               <l>they brought her ſpeedily,</l>
               <l>With heart and mind moſt conſtant,</l>
               <l>ſhe willing was to dye:</l>
               <l>But ſeeing many Ladies</l>
               <l>aſſembled in that place:</l>
               <l>Theſe words ſhe then pronounced,</l>
               <l>ſamenting then their caſe.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>You Ladies of this City,</l>
               <l>mark well my woros (quoth ſhe)</l>
               <l>Although I ſhall be burned,</l>
               <l>yet do not pitty me.</l>
               <l>Your ſelves I rather pitty,</l>
               <l>I weep for your decay,</l>
               <l>Amend your time fair Ladies,</l>
               <l>and do no time delay.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Then came her Mother weeping,</l>
               <l>her Daughter to behold:</l>
               <l>And in her hand ſhe brought her</l>
               <l>a book covered with gold.</l>
               <l>Throw hence (quoth ſhe) that Idol,</l>
               <l>convey it from my ſight,</l>
               <l>And bring me hit her my Bible,</l>
               <l>wherein I moſt delight.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But my diſtreſſed Mother</l>
               <l>why weep you? be content,</l>
               <l>You have to death delivered me,</l>
               <l>moſt like an innocent:</l>
               <l>Tormenter do thine office</l>
               <l>on me when thou think'ſt beſt,</l>
               <l>But God my heavenly father</l>
               <l>will bring my ſoul to reſt.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But, D my aged Father,</l>
               <l>where ever thou doſt lie,</l>
               <l>Thou knowſt not thy poor daughter.</l>
               <l>is ready for to dye:</l>
               <l>But yet amongſt the Angels,</l>
               <l>in heaven I hope to dwell,</l>
               <l>Therefore my loving Father</l>
               <l>I bid thee now farewel.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Farewel likewiſe my mother,</l>
               <l>adieu my friends alſo,</l>
               <l>God grant that you by others,</l>
               <l>may never feel ſuch woe:</l>
               <l>Forſake your ſuperſtition</l>
