            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap>  Macers of Our Privy Council, Meſſengers at Arms, Our Sheriffs in that Part, Conjunctly and Severally, ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially Conſtitute, Greeting; FOR AS MUCH AS, in Proſecution of the ſeventh Act of the fourth Seſſion of this Our current Parliament, cheerfully offering to Us, a preſent Levy of two thouſand nine hundred and ſeventy nine Foot, to be Levyed off the ſeveral Shires and Burghs of this Kingdom, effeiring to the Proportions and Numbers ſet down in the foreſaid Act. The Lords of Our Privy Council, conform to the Power given to them in the foreſaid Act of Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament, by their Inſtructions to the Commiſſioners of Supply within the ſeveral Shires of this Kingdom, of the Date the eighth day of <hi>February</hi> laſt by paſt: appointed the ſaids Commiſſioners furthwith, to make exact Liſts of the Heretors and Lands lyable in the ſaid Levy, that ſo it might be perfectly known who were lyable. And in caſe any men were to be put out by Fractions, and that they could not agree who ſhould furniſh the body of the man, the ſaids Commiſſioners ſhould order the Fractions to meet at a certain day and place, and there determine it by an equal Lot, effeiring to their reſpective Numbers of Men, or the quantities of their reſpective Valuations, as the uſe was in every Shire; ſo that every Lotter was to have as many Lots, as he had Numbers of Men, or quantities of valued Rent ſufficient for the Outreik of a man: And in caſe any of the ſaids Fractions ſhould not meet, or ſhould refuſe to Lot, the ſaids Commiſſioners were authorized to appoint ſuch as they ſhould think fit, to meet and Lot for them. And in caſe the perſon upon whom the Lot fell to put out a man for himſelf and his Fraction, ſhould fail in furniſhing the man, or ſhould furniſh an inſufficient man; then the Tennents and Poſſeſſors of the Lands and Ground belonging to the ſaids perſons who ſhould have put out the man, ſhould be lyable; and the perſon upon whom the Lot did fall, and who failȝied to put out the man in manner foreſaid, ſhould be decerned in the Sum of two hundred Merks. To which Act of Parliament and Inſtructions foreſaid, We expected punctual and exact Complyance and Obedience. Yet, not only a great many outreicked and furniſhed to ſerve as Souldiers in the ſaid new Levy, are rejected and ſent home as Inſufficient; but likewiſe, many lyable to outreick and furniſh men for the ſaid Levy, are deficient and altogether wanting, in ſending out the Numbers of men wherein they are lyable, conform to the ſaid Act of Parliament and Inſtructions foreſaids, and thereby have Incurred the Penalties contained in the ſaids Inſtructions, by and attour their being ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for the perſons of the men whom they were to have outreiked, conform to the ſaid Act of Parliament and Inſtructions. Therefore, and for the more effectual providing the ſaid men, and compleating the number of Souldiers offered to Us by the foreſaid Act of Parliament, and exacting the Penalties Conſtitute in the foreſaids Inſtructions; We, with Advice of the Lords of Our Privy Council, peremptorly Require and Command the Sheriff, of the ſeveral Shires, and their Deputs, Stewarts of Sewartries, Baillies of Regalities, and their reſpective Deputs, and Magiſtrats of Burghs Royal, within this Our antient Kingdom, as they wil be anſwerable, each of them within their own reſpective Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, preſently upon ſight hereof, to call for a Liſt of the deficient men within their reſpective Bounds, and of the Perſons who ſhould have put out the ſame and upon recept thereof, where no Lotting hath been made for Fractions, that he immediatly caſt Lots amongſt the ſaids Fracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, who ſhall put out the man one or more, and then ſhall paſs to the Ground of his Lands upon whom the Lot ſhall happen to fall, and there immedialy pitch upon, take and apprehend a ſufficient man out of his ſaid men, able to ſerve Us as a Souldier, and commit them Priſoners to the Priſon of the head Burgh of the Shire, there to be keeped at four ſhillig <hi>Scots per diem,</hi> upon the Expenſes of the Officer who is to receive him upon advertiſement from the Sheriff, or other Judge foreſaid who cauſes apprehend and commit him to the ſaid Priſon: and which Allowance is to be refounded to the ſaid Officer, by the Pay of the ſaid Souldier, which is to be allowed to him for the ſaid perſon, from the day of his being committed, as if he had been Liſted and Inrolled as a Souldier in Our Service; and in like manner, ſhall apprehend ſufficient men upon the Ground of the Lands of theſe who are deficient, according to the numbers they have not put out, and are lyable to, whether by the Rule of the Militia ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified in the Act of Parliament, or other ways; and deliver them to the next Commanding Officers, in manner, and to the end above mentioned: and likewiſe, that they cauſe exact the Penallies mentioned in the ſaids Inſtructions, from all who have incurred the ſame, by and attour the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending and delivering the man, in manner foreſaid. OUR WILL IS HEREFORE, and We Charge you ſtrictly, and Command, that in continent theſe Our Letters ſeen, ye paſs to the Mercat-Croſs of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and to the Mercat-Croſſes of the Remanent Burghs of the whole Shires of this Kingdom, and there in Our Name and Authority, make publick Intimation of the Premiſſes, that none may pretend Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>
