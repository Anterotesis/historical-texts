            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE Watermen and Lightermen's CASE, In Relation to the BILL before this Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Houſe, <hi>For the Explanation of former Laws made, touching</hi> Wherrymen <hi>and</hi> Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, <hi>and Joyning the</hi> Lightermen <hi>to them, and providing one Good Government for both.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>BY which Laws the Lord Mayor and Aldermen (amongſt other things) were to Elect and Appoint Eight Watermen, Yearly, to be called Overſeers and Rulers; and they were to make ſuch further Rules and Orders, as ſhould to them ſeem neceſſary for the Government of the whole, but have no Power by the ſame Laws, to enforce due Obedience to ſuch Rules and Orders, by which means the Intent of thoſe Laws are rendred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual, by Rude and Diſorderly Watermen, taking Advantage there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and daily committing Notorious Abuſes, to the hazarding Perſons Lives and Goods upon the River of <hi>Thames.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For Remedy whereof, the ſaid Bill makes the Watermen and Ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termen one Society and Company, and Impowers the ſaid Lord Mayor, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yearly to Elect Eight Watermen and Three Lightermen to be called Rulers and Overſeers, who together with Aſſiſtants, (by the Watermen and Lightermen reſpectively to be choſen) are to make good Rules, Orders, and Conſtitutions, for the better and more ſafe conveying Paſſengers and Goods by Water, and to annex reaſonable Penalties thereto; which ſaid Rules are to be approved of, or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered by the Lord Chief Juſtices, Lord Mayor, and Court of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermen.</p>
            <p>And the ſaid Court of Aldermen having peruſed the ſaid Bill, and finding the ſame intended only for a Publick Good, have approved there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and ſignified the ſame by their Order dated the <hi>27th</hi> of <hi>Feb.</hi> 1699.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note,</hi> For want of Power to make good Orders , and to enforce due Obedience thereto, the poor Watermen who have been Maimed in the Wars, as well as the Aged and Decayed, are deprived of their Work and Labour, and Paſſengers diſturbed in taking Boat and Landing , by the Rude and Ungovernable Watermen, notwithſtanding all that the Rulers of the ſaid Company could do to the contrary; and for want of Power to inforce due Obedience, as aforeſaid, a moſt ſad and deplorable Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after of late happened, in that near Fifty Paſſengers were drowned in coming from <hi>Graveſend</hi> in the Tilt-Boat, and ſmaller Accidents fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently happen; as alſo for want of Order and Government amongſt Lightermen, His Majeſty's Cuſtoms and other Duties from Coals are leſſened, and Owners of Ships, Maſters, Seamen, and Labourers, as frequently damnified; in as much as they often quarrel concerning ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king their Turns in unlivering Coals and Merchandize from Ships, and refuſe to work, to the great Hindrance and ſtaying of Ships from pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding in their reſpective Voyages.</p>
