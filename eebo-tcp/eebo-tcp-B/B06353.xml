            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>Suppoſe it were enquired, What weight of Coined Money of Standart fineneſs one is to receive when he gives in to the Mint a Pound weight of Bulzeon 9 Deniers fine. In the firſt Table in the Column marked at the top, Pound weight of Silver, and over-againſt 9 in the Margent you find 12 Ounces 15 Drops 31 66/100 Grains the weight deſired; The ſame way for an Ounce of Silver 12 Deniers fine one is to receive one Ounce one Drop 11 63/100 Grains of Coyned Money of Standart fineneſs, and ſo of the reſt: and for two Pound weight of Silver of 10 Deniers fine, one is to receive one Pound 12 Ounces 13 Drops 34 26/100 Grains.</p>
            <p>But if the Bulzeon given in to the Mint be of a fineneſs conſiſting of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niers and Grains, for Example, a Pound weight of Silver 10 Deniers 8 Grains fine, add the weight of Standart Silver equivalent to that of a Pound weight 10 Deniers fine, to wit, 14 Ounces 6 Drops 35 18/100 Grains to the weight of Standart Silver equivalent to a Pound weight of Silver 8 Grains fine (found in the ſecond Table,) to wit, 7 Drops 25 17/100 Grains the Sum, which is 14 Ounces 14 Drops 24 35/100 Grains is the weight of Standart Silver, of equal value with a Pound weight of Silver 10 Deniers 8 Grains fine. The ſame method is to be obſerved in enquiring the weight of Silver of Standart fineneſs of the ſame value with any number of Pounds, Ounces, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of Bulzeon of any fineneſs.</p>
            <p>Since there are no ordinary Denominations of Weights below Grains, the hundreth parts of a Grain are ſubjoyned for the more exactneſs.</p>
