            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>AN ELEGY On the Death of His Grace the Duke of Grafton.</head>
            <l>WHen firſt around our Iſle the News was ſpread</l>
            <l>(Ah, diſmal News!) the Noble Duke was dead.</l>
            <l>Such was the ſudden Tranſport of our Fears,</l>
            <l>We were unwilling to believe our Ears;</l>
            <l>But when the Confirmation of it came,</l>
            <l>Ah, doleful News! Ah, diſmal Word of Fame!</l>
            <l>Like Men intranc'd we ſtood, and in amaze,</l>
            <l>With ghaſtly Eyes did on each other gaze.</l>
            <l>But he is gone—</l>
            <l>And he whoſe Eyes bedew his ſacred Urn,</l>
            <l>Each pious drop into a Pearl will turn</l>
            <l>To adorn his Hearſe: But he who none can vent</l>
            <l>Doth bring more Marble to his Monument.</l>
            <l>Him Heav'n a Pattern did for Heroes form,</l>
            <l>Quick in Advice and eager to perform.</l>
            <l>In Councel calm, fierce as a Storm in Fight;</l>
            <l>Danger his Sport, and Labour his Delight:</l>
            <l>To him the Fleet, and Camp, the Sea, and Field,</l>
            <l>Did equal Harveſts of bright glory yield.</l>
            <l>Who can forget how Valliantly, how Free,</l>
            <l>He did aſſert the Empire of the Sea.</l>
            <l>The <hi>Gallick</hi> Fleet endeavour'd but in vain</l>
            <l>The Tempeſt of his Fury to ſuſtain;</l>
            <l>Shatter'd and torn before his Flag they flew,</l>
            <l>Like Doves that the exalted Eagle view,</l>
            <l>Ready to ſtoop and ſeize them from on high,</l>
            <l>With all the Wings of fear and haſte do fly.</l>
            <l>The glorious Feats this Valliant Duke hath done,</l>
            <l>Hath <hi>Englands</hi> higheſt Admiration won:</l>
            <l>And though in deepeſt Grief we mourn him gon,</l>
            <l>We may rejoyce that he was ours ſo long.</l>
            <l>And if the Immortal dead do ſee, or know,</l>
            <l>The various Actions of Mankind below,</l>
            <l>Sure his bright Soul with kind concern looks down,</l>
            <l>And breaths auſpicious Wiſhes to the Crown.</l>
            <l>How bleſt were we, had we the Bleſſing known,</l>
            <l>When we had Princely <hi>GRAFTON</hi> for our own;</l>
            <l>But Heaven, that we our mighty Happineſs</l>
            <l>Might truly underſtand, did make it leſs,</l>
            <l>And did his Noble Soul from us remove</l>
            <l>To encreaſe the Number of the Bleſs'd above:</l>
            <l>Ye partial Heavens muſt Princely Heroes thus,</l>
            <l>Though they have liv'd like Gods, yet die like us.</l>
            <l>Patience in ſmaller Evils may be ſhown,</l>
            <l>But oh! ſuch Grief as this admits of none.</l>
            <l>In vain we Hope and Sigh, in vain we Pray,</l>
            <l>If what we Love muſt thus be torn away:</l>
            <l>But we confeſs with Grief, that Princes Breath</l>
            <l>Is frail like ours, like us they ſtoop to Death.</l>
            <l>And we muſt own how fondly we began</l>
            <l>To fancy <hi>GRAFTON</hi> ſomewhat more than Man:</l>
            <l>'Twas he whoſe flaming Courage did diſdain</l>
            <l>The ſlow Advances of a vulgar Man.</l>
            <l>His early Years in bloody Wars did ſhow</l>
            <l>What riper Age might for his Country do.</l>
            <l>'Twas he who did in raging Fire and Storms</l>
            <l>Defend the Crown our gracious King Adorns.</l>
            <l>'Twas he who made the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Rebels Quake,</l>
            <l>And trembling <hi>French</hi> their Trenches to forſake;</l>
            <l>But ah, he's gone!—</l>
            <l>Excelling Prince, oh! once our Joy and Care,</l>
            <l>Now our eternal Grief and deep Diſpair:</l>
            <l>Whether were all thoſe careful Angels fled,</l>
            <l>That were intruſted with thy ſacred Head?</l>
            <l>Where were they then! how did they miſemploy</l>
            <l>There Time, when thou didſt on thy Death-bed ly,</l>
            <l>And bow'd thy Head to awful Deſtiny!</l>
            <l>Impartial Death, like <hi>Tarquin</hi>'s Wand,</l>
            <l>The ſooneſt reaches thoſe that higheſt ſtand,</l>
            <l>Letting Ignoble, Uſeleſs, Shrubs alone,</l>
            <l>And ſtrikes the ſtately full grown Poppy down.</l>
            <l>But when a Noble Heroe yields to Fate,</l>
            <l>Then Sorrow riſes in the greateſt State.</l>
            <l>The ſullen'ſt Mortal then will ſhed a Tear,</l>
            <l>And Death in all its grandure doth appear.</l>
            <l>But oh! I've done, for whilſt to mind I call</l>
            <l>His God-like Worth, the Tears like Rivers fall</l>
            <l>From my ſwell'd Eyes, half languiſh'd now with Cares,</l>
            <l>Shaded with Grief, and almoſt quench'd in Tears.</l>
