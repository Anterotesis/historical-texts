            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>The</hi> CASE <hi>of the</hi> Salt-Refiners <hi>in</hi> Suffolk, Eſſex, <hi>and</hi> Norfolk.</head>
            <p>BY the Late Act of <hi>Parliament,</hi> for the Granting certain Rates and Duties upon <hi>Salt,</hi> amongſt other things, it is Enacted, That</p>
            <p>For every Gallon of <hi>Salt,</hi> and <hi>Rock-Salt</hi> made at the <hi>Salt-Works,</hi> or taken out of any Pits within the Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> Dominion of <hi>Wales,</hi> or Town of <hi>Berwick</hi> upon <hi>Tweed,</hi> the Sum of one Peny half Peny <hi>per</hi> Gallon, and after that Rate, for a greater or leſſer quantity.</p>
            <p>By which Clauſe, all <hi>Engliſh Salt</hi> is Charg'd only Three half-pence <hi>per</hi> Gallon: And afterwards the Statute ſaith—</p>
            <p>And to the intent, That <hi>Salt</hi> made by Melting and Refining of <hi>Rock-Salt,</hi> may not, contrary to the true Intent and Meaning of this Act, be Charg'd more than other <hi>Engliſh Salt.</hi>
            </p>
            <div type="text_of_case">
               <head>The CASE.</head>
               <p>A <hi>Salt-Maker</hi> of <hi>New-Caſtle</hi> upon <hi>Tyne</hi> after the 24th. of <hi>March,</hi> 1694. makes an Hundred Weighs of <hi>Salt,</hi> and fells the ſame to ſome of the above Refiners, who pay the Duty, and ſend the <hi>Salt</hi> to <hi>Woodbridge</hi> with a Certificate, that the above Duty is paid at <hi>New-Caſtle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Salt-Refiner</hi> at <hi>Woodbridge</hi> melts this <hi>Salt</hi> in River-Water, and then boyles the Liquor in order to the Refining thereof; which having done to ſuch a degree of Fineneſs as he thinks convenient, it's Reduced into <hi>Salt</hi> again, much the ſame in quality it was before, only in Cleanneſs differing from <hi>New-Caſtle Salt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Salt</hi> being as above-mentioned Refined, lyes ſome time till the Brine is well drained from it, and in time becomes fit for Sale; and doth not advance in Weight or Meaſure any quantity, if any, to Intitle a Second Duty for ſuch <hi>Salt</hi> as hath paid His Majeſty Duty, as the Act Directs.</p>
               <p>The Exciſe-Officers upon the before firſt mentioned Clauſe in the Statute demand a new Duty of Three half-pence in the Gallon from this Refined <hi>Salt,</hi> which the Refiner humbly conceives himſelf not liable to pay, either from the Letter, or Intention of the Statute.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Not from the Letter, which ſaith, That for every Gallon of <hi>Salt</hi> made at the <hi>Salt-Works, &amp;c.</hi> the Sum of One peny half-peny <hi>per</hi> Gallon.</p>
               <p>The Refiner of <hi>Salt,</hi> in Common Speech, is not called a Maker of <hi>Salt,</hi> nor in any Writing doth he ſo ſtile himſelf; but is alwayes Call'd, and Writ, <hi>A Refiner of Salt;</hi> neither indeed is he any otherwiſe a Maker of <hi>Salt,</hi> than a Refiner of <hi>Sugar</hi> can be call'd a Maker of <hi>Sugar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And it ſeems moſt plain, That it was never the Intention of this Statute, that this ſecond Duty ſhould be paid by the Refiner: Becauſe the Statute to Encourage the <hi>Engliſh</hi> made <hi>Salt</hi> Impos'd only Three half-pence <hi>per</hi> Gallon on <hi>Engliſh Salt,</hi> but laid a double Duty of Three pence <hi>per</hi> Gallon on all Foreign <hi>Salt</hi> Imported, whereas this New Duty demanded of the Refiner for this Refin'd <hi>Salt</hi> (which before Refin'd, had paid the Legal Duty) is (as is humbly conceiv'd) a Diſcouragement, rather than an Incouragement, which the Statute deſign'd to give to all ſorts of <hi>Engliſh Salt,</hi> of what Nature or Kind ſoever: For if this Second Duty be Payable by the Refiner, then doth <hi>Engliſh</hi> Refin'd <hi>Salt</hi> become Charg'd with as great an Impoſition as the Foreign <hi>Salt</hi> is ſubjected to, and ſo theſe Refiners Trade will be utterly Ruined, (ſeeing the Profit that ariſeth from the Refining of <hi>Salt</hi> will not bear the Charge of this double Impoſition) and conſequently His Majeſties Intereſt be ſo far from being promoted by this Second Duty, that it will rather be much Leſſened; inaſmuch as theſe Refiners, who now buy great Quantities of <hi>Salt</hi> from <hi>Shields, Sunderland,</hi> or <hi>Lemington</hi> (where the <hi>Salt</hi> pays the Duty) muſt deſiſt from their Trade, and ſo there will not be ſuch Quantities bought at thoſe Places as now are; and conſequently His Majeſties Revenue therein be conſiderably diminiſhed.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Object.</label> 
                  <hi>But this Refin'd <hi>Salt</hi> is of another Species from that  <hi>Salt</hi> from which it was Refin'd, and which had paid the Duty; and conſequently this Refin'd <hi>Salt</hi> is ſubjected to the ſame ſingle Duty that all other <hi>Engliſh Salts</hi>are lyable to pay.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <label>Anſw.</label> This Refin'd <hi>Salt</hi> cannot properly be ſaid to be <hi>Salt</hi> of another Species from that out of which it was Refin'd, becauſe it differs not in the Salt Quality, but only in the Cleanneſs from Dirt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This being cleanſed from that Filth and Dirt, which all <hi>New-Caſtle Salt</hi> is ſubject to; and (it's humbly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived) a difference only in this reſpect can't truly be ſaid to make a New Species.</p>
               <p>By the before-recited Clauſe, with Relation to <hi>Rock-Salt,</hi> it's particularly expreſt, That <hi>Rock Salt</hi> Refin'd ſhould not pay as <hi>Rock Salt,</hi> and therefore Twelve Pence in the Buſhel is allowed to the Refiner for every Buſhel of <hi>Rock Salt</hi> by him Refined; And the reaſon of this Allowance that the before-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited Clauſe gives, (<hi>viz.</hi>) to the Intent, That <hi>Salt</hi> made by Melting and Refining of <hi>Rock Salt,</hi> may not, contrary to the true Intent and Meaning of this Act, be Charged more than any other <hi>Engliſh Salt.</hi> Now, Although the Refiner of <hi>New Caſtle Salt</hi> be not within the Letter of this Clauſe, yet (it's humbly conceiv'd) he is within the Equitable Intention thereof: For what reaſon is there to imagine, that the Parliament deſign'd to be ſo partially favourable to the Refiners of <hi>Rock Salt,</hi> as to Exempt them from a double Duty, and at the ſame time ſubject the Refiners of all ſorts of other <hi>Engliſh Salt</hi> to this Second Impoſition, wherein they would (with Submiſſion)Act againſt the Declared Intent and Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Statute, which (in ſubſtance) ſaith, that it is contrary to the true Intent and Meaning of the Act, That <hi>Engliſh Salt,</hi> (whether Refined or Unrefined) ſhould pay more than Three half-pence <hi>per Gallon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Refin'd Salt</hi> is Experimentally found to be far exceeding all other <hi>Salt</hi> in preſerving our <hi>Butter;</hi> for which Cauſe, <hi>Suffolk Butter</hi> preſerved with this <hi>Salt,</hi> keeps ſweeter than any other ſort of <hi>Salt Butter</hi> not ſalted therewith: For Unrefin'd <hi>Salt</hi> hath ſome mixture of Filth, which ſoon taints the <hi>Butter,</hi> and renders it very Unpalatable: So that the loſs of this Refin'd <hi>Salt</hi> (which can't poſſibly bear the Charge of Three pence <hi>per Gallon,</hi> conſidering what great Expences the Refiners are at in their Refining) will be a great prejudice to the Publick, eſpecially to the City of <hi>London,</hi> which is every Year ſupplyed with many Thouſand Firkins of this Wholeſome and Well-Preſerv'd <hi>Salt-Butter.</hi>
