            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <lg>
               <l>How fickle is the State of all Mankind?</l>
               <l>And how are all our Joys with Grief combin'd?</l>
               <l>Scarce can one ſay he lives, and doth enjoy</l>
               <l>The Bleſſings of this World, without allay,</l>
               <l>But ſome unhappy Chance diſturbs our Peace,</l>
               <l>And all our Pleaſures in a moment ceaſe.</l>
               <l>The truth of which, Great Captain <hi>Bedloe</hi>'s Fate</l>
               <l>Confirms more than a thouſand Inſtances of late.</l>
               <l>He who through various ways hath boldly ran,</l>
               <l>Boggled at nothing cou'd be done by Man:</l>
               <l>At firſt miſguided by his Popiſh Zeal,</l>
               <l>To ſerve his <hi>Holineſs</hi> in any ill;</l>
               <l>On which the Jeſuits put a Gloſs of good,</l>
               <l>And whoſe Perniciouſneſs wan't underſtood.</l>
               <l>How eager was his bold Endeavour ſtill,</l>
               <l>By any means the Proteſtants to kill?</l>
               <l>Until at laſt, being by Heav'n inſpir'd,</l>
               <l>He wiſely from his former ills retir'd,</l>
               <l>And as a Second <hi>Saul</hi> he fiercely ſtrove,</l>
               <l>As once his Hate, to manifeſt his Love</l>
               <l>To's Native Country and Religion too,</l>
               <l>Which former Miſts wou'd never let him do;</l>
               <l>And when Converted, All that e're he knew,</l>
               <l>He boldly told, and nought but what was true.</l>
               <l>To him our Engliſh Nation much does owe,</l>
               <l>Who vent'ring all he had at one great throw,</l>
               <l>Valued not his Dear Life, ſo he might ſave</l>
               <l>The Kingdom's Ruine, and the King from's Grave.</l>
               <l>He was the Man, who many Plots reveal'd</l>
               <l>Gainſt the King's Life, which elſe had been conceal'd;</l>
               <l>He was the Man 'Gainſt Bribes ſo Armour proof,</l>
               <l>That to be Falſe thought no Price great enough.</l>
               <l>In vain the Romiſh Zealots 'gainſt him ſay,</l>
               <l>That hopes of Wealth made him their Plots betray;</l>
               <l>For cou'd he have been tempted by them to prove</l>
               <l>Falſe to his King, and 'gainſt his Country move:</l>
               <l>Their proffers large wou'd not have been in vain,</l>
               <l>If he wou'd for ſome Perſon's ſake refrain</l>
               <l>To give in Evidence, but he withſtood</l>
               <l>All the Temptations, to a ſeeming Good.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Having at laſt been bleſt with a kind Wife,</l>
               <l>The only ſolid Comfort of Man's Life:</l>
               <l>And hoping now to live at Peace and Reſt,</l>
               <l>And be for ever by his Country bleſt;</l>
               <l>Was ſtrangely ſeiz'd with a dire Malady,</l>
               <l>And by a ſtrange unheard of Propheſy,</l>
               <l>He fanci'd all along, that he ſhould dye</l>
               <l>By that Diſeaſe, yet then he perſever'd</l>
               <l>In what he had ſaid, and not one Tittle err'd,</l>
               <l>As he was then even in a dying State,</l>
               <l>From what he ever did oth' Plot relate;</l>
               <l>And before Witneſſes at's parting Breath,</l>
               <l>The Truth of 's Depoſitions ſeal'd with Death:</l>
               <l>Now at his Loſs, let this ſad Nation mourn,</l>
               <l>And drop with Grief ſome Tears upon his Urn:</l>
               <l>Let us his ſudden Death juſtly bemoan,</l>
               <l>Had he liv'd longer, he had more made known.</l>
            </lg>
