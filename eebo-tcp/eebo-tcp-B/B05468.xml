            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap>  Macers of Our Privy Council, Meſſengers at Arms, Our Sheriffs in that part, conjunctly and ſeverally, ſpecially conſtitute, greeting: Foraſmuch as by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Acts of Parliament, the keeping of Victual to a dearth, is ſtrictly prohibited; and particularly, it is Statute by the Acts <hi>James</hi> the Second, Parliament Sixth, <hi>Caput</hi> Twenty two and Twenty three, that for the eſchewing of Dearth, Sheriffs, Baillies, and other Officers, both to Burgh and to Land, inquire what perſons buys Victual, and holds it to a Dearth, and that the ſaids Sheriffs and Officers make ſuch known, that in caſe they hold more than will ſuſtain them and their Meinȝie to new Corn, they may be puniſhed and demeaned as Ockerers and Uſurers, and the Victual eſcheated to Us, and that the ſame be preſented to Mercats, and ſold as the price goes: And by the Act <hi>James</hi> the Second, Parliament Ninth, <hi>Caput</hi> Thirty eighth and Thirty ninth, It is ordained that no manner of Victual be holden in Girnels by any man to a dearth, but allennarly what is needful for their own Perſons, and ſuſtentation of their Houſholds; and that the ſaids Perſons preſent all that they have more to the Mercar, under the pain of Eſcheat thereof: And Searchers are appointed in <hi>Edinburgh</hi> and <hi>Leith</hi> to make the ſaids Acts effectual. As likewiſe, the Crime of Fore-ſtalling is forbidden by ſeveral Acts and Statutes, and particularly by the Act <hi>James</hi> the Sixth, Parliament Twelfth, <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>put</hi> One hundred and fourty eight, It is declared, that who buys any Merchandiſe or Victual coming to Fair or Mercat, or makes any Contract or Promiſe for the buying of the ſame before the ſaid Merchandice or Victual ſhall be in the Fair or Mercat-place ready to be Sold, or ſhall make any motion by Word, Writ, or Meſſage, for raiſing of the Prices, or dearer ſelling of the ſaid Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice and Victual, or who ſhall diſſwade any from coming and bringing the foreſaid Merchandice and Victual to Fair or Mercat, ſhall be eſteemed and judged a Fore-ſtaller: And it is ordained that all ſuch Fore-ſtallers may be purſued before the Juſtices or Magiſtrats of Burghs, and that without a ſpecial Libel, but only upon Fore ſtalling in general, and the perſons convict to be Fined for the firſt fault in Fourty Pounds, for the ſecond in One hundred Merks, and for the third to incur the tinſell of Moveables. And ſeing that through the not due obſervance, and the execution of the foreſaids Acts, the calamity of the Countrey by the preſent ſcarcity and dearth is greatly increaſed: Therefore We advice of the Lords of Our Privy Council, have thought fit to revive the ſame, and ordain them to be put to ſtrict execution; and for that effect to impower and require all Sheriffs of Shires, Stewarts of Stewartries, Lords and Baillies of Regalities and their Deputs, and Magiſtrats of Burghs, as likewiſe all Commiſſioners of Supply, and Juſtices of Peace, to cauſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry and ſearch to be made who holds up, or Girnels Victual, or keeps Stacks contrary to the foreſaids Laws, and to command and charge the keepers up of the ſaid Victual in Girnels, Stacks, or otherways, contrary to the ſaids Statutes, either to Threſh out, bring and expoſe the ſame for Sale in open and ordinary Mercats, or otherwiſe to open their Girnels, and other Houſes where the Victual is kept, and there ſell the ſame, as the ſaids Sheriffs, Stewarts of Stewartries, Lords and Baillies of Regalities and their Deputs, and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrats of Burghs, or any two of the ſaids Commiſſioners ſhal find the ordinary price to rule for the time in the Countrey, not below the laſt <hi>Candleſmaſs</hi> Fiers; with certification if they failȝie therein, they ſhall be proceeded againſt, and the pains of the foreſaid Acts of Parliament execute upon them with all rigor: And in the mean time the Victual Girnelled, and unlawfully kept up as ſaid is, Arreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and Sequeſtrat by the foreſaids Sheriffs and others, as Eſcheat. And further, We with Advice foreſaid, Command and Charge all Magiſtrats of Burghs, and other Officers of the Law, to take care that all Mercats and Fairs be duly regulat conform to the Laws, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out extortion, and to cauſe put the foreſaids Acts of Parliament againſt Fore-ſtallers to due and vigorous execution, certifying the ſaids Sheriffs, Magiſtrats and others, who ſhall fail in their duty in the premiſſes, that upon information given to the Lords of Our Privy Council, they ſhall be therefore ſeverely puniſhed as the Lords of Our Privy Council ſhall ſee cauſe. And further, for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter relief of the Country under the preſent great ſcarcity, whereby the prices of Victual are ariſen above the rates mentioned in the Act of Parliament for prohibiting the Import of Forraign Victual: We with Advice foreſaid, do hereby grant licenſe and full liberty to all perſons to Import Victual, and Corns of all ſorts, from any Forraign Kingdom or Countrey, and that free of Cuſtom, Exciſe, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Impoſition; And for that effect recommends it to the Commiſſioners of Our Theſaury, to diſcharge the exacting thereof for the ſaid Victual to be Imported as ſaid is, after the day and date hereof: And that notwithſtanding of any Act of Parliament, or Book of Rates impoſing the ſame, declaring that this licenſe and liberty is to endure till the firſt day of <hi>October</hi> next to come. OUR WILL IS HEREFORE, and We Charge you ſtrictly, and Command, that incontinent theſe Our Letters ſeen, ye paſs to the Mercat-Croſs of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and remanent Mercat-Croſſes of the Head-Burghs of the ſeveral Shires and Stewartries within this Kingdom, and thereat in Our Name and Authority, make Publication of the Premiſſes, that none pretend ignorance: And ordains theſe preſents to be Printed.</p>
