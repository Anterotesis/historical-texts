         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Miſerable CASE OF THE <hi>Poor</hi> GLASS-MAKERS, Artificers, <hi>and ſeveral Hundred Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies that were Imployed in the ſaid Manufacture; Humbly Offered in reference to the Duty on Glaſs.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THAT the ſaid Art of Glaſs-making being ſo much Improved in this Kingdom, hath cauſed great encreaſe of Workmen and Artificers, and ſeveral Hundred of Families were Imployed and Maintained in the ſaid Art.</p>
            <p>That the Poor Workmen, Artificers and Families, have been great Sufferers by the preſent War, not having near ſo much Work as formerly; and the preſent Duty on Glaſs makes our Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries and Hardſhips much greater.</p>
            <p>That ſince the Duty, eſpecially on the Bottle-houſes, from whence it is ſuppoſed the chief part of the Duty comes, is ſo great, <hi>viz.</hi> One Penny each Bottle, being Sixty <hi>per Cent.</hi> here, and in ſome parts of the Kingdom above 90 <hi>per Cent.</hi> of what the Goods was before Sold for; and indeed on all ſorts of Glaſs ſo great, as makes the vent ſo ſmall, that many of us the Artificers, have not had any Work this ſeven or Eight Months, nor like to have for ſeveral Months longer; the Maſters having great Quantities on their Hands, and made ſince the Duty: And we the poor Artificers, being always uſed to Work in the Fire, are unſuitable for other Callings, are reduced to that Extremity, that excepting thoſe whom ſome Maſters lend Money to, ſome are ſorced to Pawn their Goods, others to Sell their very Beds, and muſt come to the Pariſhes for Relief, if the Duty be continued.</p>
            <p>That there is already, ſince the Duty Commenced, ſeveral of the greateſt, oldeſt, and beſt ſcituated Glaſs-houſes in <hi>England</hi> laid down, and offered to Sale; and it is ſuppoſed that moſt of the Glaſs-houſes in <hi>England</hi> will be forced to do the ſame, if the Duty be continued.</p>
            <p>And we hear there is two Glaſs-houſes already going to be ſet on Work in <hi>Holland,</hi> which if once they get the Art, we may in effect looſe it.</p>
            <p>To prevent the Evils whereof, and to take off the Burthen of this great Duty, which chiefly lyes upon poor Men's Labours, which we preſume will appear to be very inconſiderable when the Accounts of the ſaid Duty are ſtated, the charge of Collecting and Debentures, for w<gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">
