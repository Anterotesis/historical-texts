            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>That the ſaid <hi>Dorothy</hi> and <hi>Gregory Morgan,</hi> by the advice of Sir <hi>Robert Napper,</hi> Knight, for the preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſale thereof, the ſaid <hi>Gregory</hi> being profuſe, and an ill Husband, about Michaelmas Tearme, in the foure and thirtieth yeare of the raigne of Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> did levy a Fine thereof to the ſaid Sir <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Knapper, John Fitzjames,</hi> and <hi>John Coward,</hi> Gent. in truſt, to, and for the uſe of the Cognizers and their Heires.</p>

            <p>That notwithſtanding the ſaid Sir <hi>Robert Napper</hi> did well know of the ſaid Fine and Deed was levied, and made only in truſt, yet intending thereby to obtaine the premiſſes to himſelfe, upon the deaths of the ſaid <hi>Gregory</hi> and <hi>Dorothy,</hi> refuſed to grant the premiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to <hi>John Biddlecomb,</hi> your Petitioners Grandfather, who was next Heire to the ſaid <hi>Dorothy,</hi> but entred and poſſeſſed himſelfe of the ſame, as though there had beene no truſt in him repoſed by the ſaid Cognizers, although there was never any conſideration paid by the ſaid Sir <hi>Robert Napper</hi> for the ſame, and although the ſaid <hi>Dorothy</hi> was ever untill her death reputed owner of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſes.</p>

            <p>That he having now by ſubtilty obtained his ends, he ſtill refuſed to grant the Premiſſes to your Petitioners Grandfather, and to be relieved in Equity, your Petitioners ſaid Grandfather preferr'd his Bill in Chancery, and thereupon by the power and procure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ſaid Sir <hi>Robert Napper,</hi> it was decreed in <hi>May,</hi> the firſt yeare of the late Majeſty King <hi>James</hi> (although much equity is expreſſed in the Decree it ſelfe for your Petitioners Grandfather and although no ſufficient ground is therein ſet forth to warrant a Diſmiſſion) that the Plaintiffs Bill ſhould be diſmiſt, and that the Plaintiffe ſhould have 200 l. onely from Mr. <hi>Fitzjames</hi> out of the 700 l. which Mr. <hi>Fitzjames</hi> had received for his releaſe aforeſaid.</p>
            <p>That the ſaid Sir <hi>Robert Napper</hi> being a powerfull man, and your Petitioners Grandfather being much weakened in his Eſtate, by reaſon of the ſaid Suit, and not longer able to ſtrive with them in his life time, your Petitioners Grandfather never as yet received the 200 l. or had any conſideration for the ſaid Premiſſes, but ſhortly after died.</p>
            <p>That after his death, your poore Petitioners Father was diſabled to proſecute his right yet occaſioned your Petitioners Father through griefe, to fall into a lunacy and diſtraction of minde, which he continued untill his death, ſo that he was uncapable in his life time to proſecute his right, by means thereof, and having no friends that durſt take upon them to queſtion your Petitioners fathers right, being awed by the power of the ſaid Sir <hi>Robert Napper,</hi> and <hi>Nathaniel Napper</hi> his Sonne, and Sir <hi>Gerard Napper</hi> his Son, and Sir <hi>Gerard Napper</hi> hath ſucceſſively kept, and injoyed from your Petitioner the ſaid Mannor and Premiſes, and the ſaid Sir <hi>Gerard Napper</hi> doth moſt unconſcionably keepe and injoy the ſame, and refuſeth to grant the Premiſſes to your Petitioner, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the truſt in the ſaid Sir <hi>Robert Napper</hi> repoſed by the ſaid <hi>Gregory Morgan,</hi> and <hi>Dorothy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now foraſmuch as the ſaid Fine was levied, and the ſaid Deed of uſes made to the ſaid Sir <hi>Robert Napper</hi> the ſaid <hi>Fitzjames</hi> and <hi>Coward,</hi> but onely in truſt, and for that it appeareth by Sir <hi>Roberts</hi> owne Anſwer in the ſaid ſuit, that he never gave any conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as purchaſe money, for the Premiſſes, but that he only lent her, or laid out for her 400 l. which cannot be any valuable conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, the Premiſes being at leaſt 500 l. <hi>per annum.</hi> And for that ſome ſhort time before the ſaid <hi>Dorothy's</hi> death, when ſhe would have tendred a paire of Gloves to the ſaid Sir <hi>Robert Napper</hi> to revoke the ſaid Deed of uſes, the ſaid Sir <hi>Robert Napper</hi> was in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and there continued till her death, and for that by the ſaid Decree it ſelfe much equity doth appeare for your Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioners Grandfather, yet his Bill was unjuſtly diſmiſt, onely allowing him 200 l. And foraſmuch as the ſaid Sir <hi>Gerard Napper</hi> hath gotten into his cuſtody all the Evidences concerning the Premiſes, ſo that your Petitioner cannot evidence his right.
