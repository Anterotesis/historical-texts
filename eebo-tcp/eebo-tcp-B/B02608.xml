            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The CASE of ſeveral Italian Merchants ſettled in <hi>London.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THE Trade to <hi>Italy,</hi> and all other Places is equally free to Natives and Aliens, only with this Difference, that the Aliens pay greater Duties to their Majeſties.</p>
            <p>Thrown Silks being very ſcarce in <hi>England,</hi> by reaſon of the Difficulty of bringing them out of <hi>Italy</hi> at this time of War with <hi>France,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Weavers petitioned the Honourable Houſe of Commons, for Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of importing fine <hi>Italian, Sicilian</hi> and <hi>Naples</hi> Thrown Silk over Land. Whereupon a Bill was brought in, and paſs'd that Honourable Houſe, and lies now before your Honours.</p>
            <p>There is a Clauſe in the ſaid Bill, which reſtrains the ſaid Importation over Land to the Subjects of this Kingdom only, and for their proper Accounts, and no other whatſoever.</p>
            <p>'Tis humbly hoped that your Honours will take this Matter into your ſerious Conſideration, and be of Opinion, that if this Clauſe paſſes, it will be a kind of monopolizing that Silk Trade in the Hands of two or three Engliſh Merchants dealing therein, who procured this Clauſe. Whereas it has always been taken for a certain Rule, That Trade ſhould not be reſtrained, but Traders encouraged; for the more of a Commodity comes in, the cheaper it muſt be ſold to the Subject, and the more Cuſtoms will accrue thereby.</p>
            <p>Beſides that it is moſt humbly conceived, that your Honours will not think it reaſonable, That theſe Merchants, who are by Law at liberty to import Goods directly over Sea from <hi>Italy,</hi> ſhould not be ſuffer'd to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the ſame Goods over Land.</p>
            <p>There are ſeveral Engliſh Merchants ſettled in divers Ports of <hi>Italy,</hi> who may reaſonably fear in caſe this Clauſe paſſes into a Law, that thoſe Governments may return it upon them, by forbidding all but their own Subjects to import the Engliſh Manufactures into <hi>Italy,</hi> inſtead of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of the kind Treatment which the Engliſh Merchants meet with there, as is notoriouſly known to all that ever travelled into thoſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries. <hi>Joſeph Cagnony, Angelo Corticelly, Joſeph Como,</hi> and <hi>Anthony Francis Magnony</hi> are <hi>Italians,</hi> who have lived in <hi>England,</hi> and traded as Merchants ſeveral Years; their chief Trade has been with their Country, and have from time to time exported great Quantities of the Woollen Manufactures of this Kingdom in return of the Goods they imported out of their own Countries.</p>
            <p>They moſt humbly hope your Honours will think fit to reject the ſaid Clauſe, that Trade may have its free Courſe, conformable to the reſpective Treaties of Commerce between this and all other Trading Nations.</p>
