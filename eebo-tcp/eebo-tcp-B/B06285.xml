            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The firſt who diſcover'd it, was an Actor in it, ſent hither from <hi>Rome,</hi> by Cardinal <hi>Barbarini,</hi> to aſſiſt <hi>Con,</hi> the Pope's Legat, in the purſuit of it, and privy to all the particulars; who being touch'd with remorſe of Conſcience, for being guilty of ſo deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a Crime, reveal'd the whole Myſtery to Sir <hi>William Boſwell,</hi> the King's Leiger Embaſſador at the <hi>Hague,</hi> who gave private notice of the ſame to the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> by whom it was declar'd to the King himſelf.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>May it pleaſe your Grace,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THe Offers (whereof your Grace will find a Copy) here en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clos'd toward a farther and more particular Diſcovery, were firſt made to me at the ſecond hand, and by word of mouth by a Friend of good Quality and Worth in this place. But ſoon after, as ſoon as they could be put into order, were avowd by the principal party, and deliver'd me in writing by both together, upon promiſe and Oath, which I was required to give, and gave accordingly, not to reveal the ſame to any other Man living, but your Grace, and by your Grace's hand to his Majeſtie.</p>
            <p>In like manner they have tied themſelves not to declare theſe things to any other but my ſelf, untill they ſhould know how His Majeſtie, and your Grace would diſpoſe thereof. The Principal giving me withall to know, that he puts himſelf and this Secret into your Grace's power, as well becauſe it concerns your Grace ſo nearly after his Majeſtie, as that he knows your wiſdom to guide the ſame aright, and is alſo aſſur'd of your Grace's fidelity to His Majeſties Perſon, to our State and to our Church.</p>
            <p>Firſt, your Grace is earneſtly pray'd to ſignifie His Majeſties pleaſure, with all ſpeed, together with your Grace's diſpoſition herein, and purpoſe to carry all with ſilence from all but his Majeſtie, until due time.</p>
            <p>Secondly, when your Grace ſhall think ſit to ſhew theſe things to His Majeſtie, to do it immediately, and not truſting Letters, nor permitting any other Perſon to be by, or within hearing, and to intreat and counſel His Majeſtie as in a caſe of Conſcience, to keep the ſame wholly and ſolely in his own boſom from 
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:179165:2"/>
the knowledge of all other Creatures living, but your Grace, until the buſineſs ſhall be clear'd out.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, not to enquire or demand the Names of the Parties from whom theſe Overtures do come, or any farther diſcoveries or advertiſements in purſuit of them, which ſhall come hereafter until ſatisfaction ſhall be given to every part of them. Nor to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> to any Perſon but His Majeſtie, that any thing of this Nature <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> come from me.</p>
            <p>For as I may believe theſe Overtures are veryfiable in the way they will be laid, and that the parties will not ſhrink; ſo I may ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, that if never ſo little glimpſe or ſhadow of theſe Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſhall appear by His Majeſties or your Grace's words or carriage unto others, the means whereby the buſineſs may be brought beſt unto Tryal, will be utterly diſappointed. And the parties who have in Conſcience toward God, Devotion to His Majeſtie, Affection toward your Grace, and Compaſſion to our Country diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clos'd theſe things, will run a preſent and extream hazard of their Perſons and Lives. So eaſily it will be conjectur'd upon the leaſt occaſion given either by His Majeſtie or your Grace, who is the Diſcoverer.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the Points and Offers which they have preſt me to repreſent more eſpecially to his Grace.</p>
            <p>For my own particular, having already moſt humbly crav'd Pardon of any Errour or Omiſſions that have befallen me in the managing this buſineſs, I do beſeech your Grace to let me know,</p>
            <p>Firſt, whether, and in what order I ſhall proceed with the Parties.</p>
            <p>Secondly, what points of theſe Offers I ſhall firſt put them upon to enlarge and clear?</p>
            <p>Thirdly, what other Points and Queries I ſhall propoſe to them, and in what manner?</p>
            <p>Fourthly, how far further I ſhall ſuffers my ſelf to hear and know theſe things.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, whether I ſhall not rather take the parties anſwers and diſcoveries ſealed up by themſelves, and having likewiſe put my own Seal upon them, without queſtioning or ſeeing what they contain, ſo to tranſmit them to your Grace or His Majeſtie.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, whether I may not inſinuate upon ſome fair occaſion, that there will be a due regard had of them and their ſervice by His Majeſtie and your Grace; when all particulars undertaken in theſe general Offers, and neceſſary for perfecting the diſcovery, and work intended, ſhall effectually be delivered to His Majeſtie and your Grace.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:179165:3"/>
Upon theſe Heads, and ſuch other as His Majeſty and your Grace ſhall think proper in the Buſineſs, I muſt with all humility beſeech your Grace to furniſh me with Inſtructions, and Warrant for my proceedings, under His Majeſties Hand, with your Grace's atteſtation, as by His Majeſties Goodneſs and Royal diſpoſition is uſual in like Caſes.</p>
            <p>May it pleaſe your Grace to entertain a Cipher with me upon this Occaſion; I have ſent the Counterpart of one here inclos'd.</p>
            <p>If theſe Overtures happily ſort with His Majeſties and your Grace's mind, and ſhall accordingly prove effectual in their Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, I ſhall think my ſelf a moſt happy man, to have any Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation in ſo pious a Work for my moſt Gracious Soveraign and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter. More particularly in that your Grace under His Majeſty ſhall be <hi>Opiſex rerum &amp; mundi melioris Origo.</hi> Which I ſhall inceſſantly beg in my Prayers at his Hands, who is the giver of all good things, and will never forſake or fail them, who do not firſt fail and fall from him, the God of Mercy and Peace, with which I remain ever more,</p>

            <p>ALL my ſenſes are ſhaken together as often as I revolve the preſent buſineſs, neither doth my Underſtanding ſuffice, to conceive what Wind hath brought ſuch horrid things, that they ſhould ſee the Sun-ſhine by me: for unexpectedly this good Man became known unto me, who when he had heard me diſcourſing of theſe <hi>Scotch</hi> ſtirs, ſaid, that I knew not the Nerve of the buſineſs, that thoſe things which are commonly ſcattered abroad are ſuperficial. From that hour he every day became more familiar to me, who acknowledging my dexterity herein, with a full breaſt poured forth the burdens of his heart into my boſom, ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing that he had diſcharged a burden of Conſcience wherewith he was preſſed. Hence he related to me the Factions of the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> with which the whole earthly World was aſſaulted; and ſhewed, that I might behold how through their Poiſon, <hi>Bohemia</hi> and <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi> were devoured, and both of them maimed with an irrepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble wound; that the ſame Plague did creep through the Realms of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> the matter whereof, revealed in the adjacent writing, he diſcovered to me: Which things having heard, my Bowels were contracted together, my Loyns trembled with horrour, that a pernicious Gulf ſhould be prepared for ſo many thouſands of Souls: With words moving the conſcience, I inflamed the mind of the Man; he had ſcarce one hour concocted my admonitions, but he diſcloſed all the ſecrets, and he gave free liberty that I ſhould treat with thoſe whom it concerned, that they might be informed hereof. I thought no delay was to be made about the things: The ſame hour I went to Sir <hi>William Boſwell,</hi> the King's Leiger, at the <hi>Hague,</hi> who being tied with an Oath of Secrecy to me, I commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated the buſineſs to him, I admoniſhed him to weigh theſe things by the Ballance, neither to defer, but act, that thoſe who were in danger might be ſpeedily ſuccoured: He, as becomes an honeſt Man, mindful of his Duty, and having nearer looked into the buſineſs, refuſed not to obey the Monitions. Moreover, he forthwith cauſed that an Expreſs ſhould be diſpatched, and ſent word back again what a moſt acceptable Oblation this had been to 
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:179165:4"/>
the King and your Grace; for which we rejoyced from the heart, and we judged, that a ſafe and favourable Deity had interpoſed it ſelf in this buſineſs, whereby you might be perſerved.</p>
            <p>Now that the verity of the things related might be confirmed, ſome principal heads of the conſpiracy were purpoſely pretermitted, that the knowledge of them might be extorted from the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented Society of the Conſpirators.</p>
            <p>Now the things will be ſpeedily and ſafely promoted into act, if they be warily proceeded in at <hi>Bruxels.</hi> By my advice, that day ſhould be obſerved wherein the Packet of Letters are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch'd, which under the Title of, <hi>To Monſieur Strario Arch-Deacon of Cambray,</hi> tyed with one cover, are delivered to the Poſt-Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter; ſuch a Packet may be ſecretly brought back from him, yet it will be unprofitable, becauſe all the incloſed Letters are written Characteriſtically. Likewiſe another Packet coming weekly from <hi>Rome,</hi> which is brought under this ſuperſcription, <hi>To the moſt Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious Lord Count Roſſetti,</hi> Legat for the time; theſe are not to be neglected: To whom likewiſe Letters writ in the ſame Characters are included.

            <p>WE have willingly and cordially perceived, that our offers have been acceptable both to his <hi>Royal Majeſty,</hi> and likewiſe to your <hi>Grace.</hi> This is the only Index to us, That the bleſſing of God is preſent with you, whereby a ſpur is given, that we ſhould ſo much the more chearfully and freely utter and deteſt thoſe things whereby the hazard of both your lives, the ſubverſion of the Realm and State both of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> the tumbling down of his Excellent Majeſty from his Throne, is intended. Now leſt the diſcourſe ſhould be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged with ſuperfluous circumſtances, we will only premiſe ſome things which are meerly neceſſary to the buſineſs.</p>
            <p>You may firſt of all know, that this good man, by whom the enſuing things are detected, was born and bred in the Popiſh Religion, who ſpent many years in Eccleſiaſtical dignities. At length being found fit for the expedition of the preſent Deſign, by the counſel and mandate of the Lord Cardinal <hi>Barbarini,</hi> he was adjoyned to the aſſiſtance of Maſter <hi>Cuneus (Con)</hi> by whom he was found ſo diligent and ſedulous in his Office, that hope of great promotion was given to him. Yet he, led by the inſtinct of the good Spirit, hath, howſoever it be, contemned ſweet promiſes, and having known the vanities of the Pontifician Religion (of which he had ſometime been a moſt ſevere defender) having <hi>likewiſe noted the malice of thoſe who fight under the Popiſh banner, felt his Conſcience to be burdened; which burden that he might eaſe himſelf of, he converted his mind to the Orthodox Religion.</hi> Soon after, that he might exonerate his Conſcience, he thought fit, that a deſperate Treaſon, machinated againſt ſo many ſouls, was to be revealed, and that he ſhould receive eaſe if he vented ſuch things in the boſom of a friend: which done, he was ſeriouſly admoniſhed by the ſaid friend, that he ſhould ſhew an example of his converſion and charity, and free ſo many innocent ſouls from imminent, danger To whoſe monitions he willingly conſented, 
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:179165:8"/>
and delivered the following things to be put in writing, out of which the Articles not long ſince tendered to your Grace, may be clearly explicated and demonſtrated.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt of all, that the hinge of the buſineſs may be rightly diſcerned, it is to be known, that all thoſe factions with which Chriſtendom is at this day ſhaken, do ariſe from the Jeſuitical Off-ſpring of <hi>Cham,</hi> of which four Orders abound throughout the World.</p>
            <p>Of the firſt Order are Eccleſiaſticks, whoſe Office it is to take care of things promoting Religion.</p>
            <p>Of the ſecond Order are Politicians, whoſe Office it is by any means to ſhake, trouble, and reform the ſtate of Kingdoms and Republicks.</p>
            <p>Of the third Order are Seculars, whoſe property it is to obtrude themſelves into Offices with Kings and Princes, to inſinuate and immix themſelves in Court buſineſſes, bargains and ſales, and to be buſied in civil affairs.</p>
            <p>Of the fourth Order are Intelligencers, <hi>(or Spies)</hi> men of inſeriour condition, who ſubmit themſelves to the ſervices of great men, Princes, Barons, Noble-men, Citizens, to deceive (<hi>or corrupt</hi>) the minds of their maſters.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A Society of ſo many Orders, the Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> nouriſheth: for ſcarce all <hi>Spain, France,</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> can yield ſo great a multitude of <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> as <hi>London</hi> alone; where are found more than 50 <hi>Scotiſh Jeſuits.</hi> There the ſaid ſociety hath elected to it ſelf a Seat of iniquity, and hath conſpired againſt the King, and the moſt faithful to the King, eſpecially the Lord Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and likewiſe againſt both Kingdoms.</p>
            <p n="3">3. For it is more certain than certainty it ſelf, that the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named ſociety hath determined to effect an univerſal reformation of the Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland.</hi> Therefore the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the end, neceſſarily infers a determination of means to the end.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Therefore to promote the undertaken Villany, the ſaid ſociety dubbed it ſelf with the Title of, <hi>The Congregation of propagating the Faith</hi>; which acknowlegeth the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> the Head of the College, and Cardinal <hi>Barbarini</hi> his ſubſtitute and Executor.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The chief Patron of the ſociety at <hi>London,</hi> is the Popes Legat, who takes care of the buſineſs; into whoſe boſom, theſe dregs of Traytors weekly depoſite all their Intelligences. Now the reſidence of this Legation was obtained at <hi>London</hi> in the name 
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:179165:8"/>
of the <hi>Roman</hi> Pontiff, by whoſe mediation it might be lawful for Cardinal <hi>Barbarini</hi> to work ſo much the more eaſily and ſafely upon the King and Kingdom. For none elſe could ſo freely circumvent the King, as he who ſhould be palliated with the Popes Authority.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Maſter <hi>Cuneus</hi> did at that time enjoy the Office of the Popes Legat, an Univerſal Inſtrument of the conjured ſociety, and a ſerious Promoter of the buſineſs, whoſe ſecrets, as likewiſe thoſe of all other Intelligencers, the preſent good man, the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicator of all theſe things, did revive and expedite whither the buſineſs required.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cuneus</hi> ſet upon the chief men of the Kingdom, and left nothing unattempted, by what means he might corrupt them all, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline them to the pontifician party: he inticed many with various incitements, yea, he ſought to delude the King himſelf with gifts of Pictures, Antiquities, Idols, and of other vanities brought from <hi>Rome,</hi> which yet would prevail nothing with the King.</p>
            <p>Having entred familiarity with the King, he is often requeſted at <hi>Hampton</hi> Court, likewiſe at <hi>London,</hi> to undertake the Cauſe of the <hi>Palatine,</hi> and that he would interpoſe his Authority, and by his interceſſion perſwade the <hi>Legat</hi> of <hi>Colen,</hi> that the <hi>Palatine,</hi> in the next Diet to treat of peace, might be inſerted into the Conditions; which verily he promiſed, but performed the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. He writ indeed, that he had been ſo deſired by the King concerning ſuch things, yet he adviſed that they ſhould not be conſented to, left peradventure it might be ſaid by the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> that the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> had patronized an heretical Prince.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, <hi>Cuneus</hi> ſmelling from the Archbiſhop, moſt truſty to the King, that the Kings mind was wholly pendulous (or doubt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ul,) Reſolved, That he would move every ſtone, and apply his forces, that he might gain him to his party: Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly conſiding, that he had a means prepared. For he had a command to offer a Cardinals Cap to the Lord Archbiſhop in the name of the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> and that he ſhould allure him alſo with higher promiſes, that he might corrupt his ſincere mind. Yet a ſitting occaſion was never given, whereby he might inſinuate himſelf into the Lord Archbiſhop. Free acceſs was to be gained by the Earl and Counteſs of <hi>A</hi>— likewiſe Secretary <hi>W</hi>—<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>The interceſſion of all which being neglected, he did flie the company or familiarity of <hi>Cuneus,</hi> worſe than the plague: He was likewiſe perſwaded by others of no mean rank, well known to him, neither yet was he moved.</p>
            <p n="7">
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:179165:9"/>
7. Another alſo was aſſayed, who hindred acceſs to the deteſtable wickedneſs, Secretary <hi>Cook,</hi> he was a moſt bitter hater of the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> whom he intercepted from acceſs to the King, he entertained many (of them) according to their deſerts, he diligently enquired into their factions; by which means every incitement, breathing a magnetical (attractive) power to the Popiſh party, was ineffectual with him; for nothing was ſo dear unto him, that might incline him to wickedneſs. Hereupon being made odious to the Patrons of the Conſpiracy, he was endangered to be diſcharged from his Office; it was laboured for three years ſpace, and at laſt obtained.</p>
            <p>Yet notwithſtanding there remained on the Kings part a knot hard to be untied, for the Lord Arch-Biſhop, by his conſtancy, interpoſed himſelf as a moſt hard rock.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Cuneus</hi> had underſtood from the Lord Arch-Biſhops part, that he had laboured in vain, his malice and the whole Societies waxed boyling hot: ſoon after ambuſhes began to be prepared, wherewith the Lord Arch-Biſhop together with the King ſhould be taken.</p>
            <p>Likewiſe a ſentence is paſſed againſt the King (for whoſe ſake all this buſineſs is diſpoſed) becauſe nothing is hoped from him which might ſeem to promote the Popiſh Religion; but eſpecially when he had opened his mind, that he was of this opinion, That every one might be ſaved in his own Religion, ſo as he be an honeſt and pious man.</p>
            <p n="8">8. To perpetrate the Treaſon undertaken, the criminal Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> cauſed by ſome Writings of <hi>Puritans,</hi> gave occaſion of the firſt Fire: which thing was ſo much exaſperated and exaggerated by the <hi>Papiſts</hi> to the <hi>Puritans,</hi> that if it remained un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>revenged, it would be thought a blemiſh to their Religion; The Flames of which Fire, the <hi>Scotch</hi> Book of <hi>Prayers</hi> increaſes, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by it's alterations.</p>
            <p n="9">9. In this heat, a certain <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Earl, called <hi>Maxſield,</hi> if I miſtake not, was expedited to the <hi>Scots</hi> by the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Party; with whom two other <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Earls, <hi>Papiſts,</hi> held correſpondency: He was to ſtir up the People to Commotion, and rub over the injury afreſh, that he might enſlame their minds, precipitate them to Arms, by which the hurtful diſturber of the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Liberty might be ſlain.</p>
            <p n="10">10. By this one labour, ſnares are prepared for the King; for this purpoſe the preſent buſineſs was ſo ordered, That very many of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſhould adhere to the <hi>Scots</hi>; That the King ſhould remain inſeriour in Arms, who (thereupon) ſhould be compelled 
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:179165:9"/>
to crave aſſiſtance from the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> which yet he ſhould not obtain, unleſs he would deſcend unto conditions, by which he ſhould per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit Univerſal liberty of the exerciſe of the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Religion; for ſo the affairs of the <hi>Papiſts</hi> would ſucceed according to their deſire. To which conſent, if he ſhould ſhew himſelf more difficult, there ſhould be a preſent remedy at hand. The King is to be diſpatched: For an <hi>Indian</hi> Nut, ſtuffed with moſt ſharp Poyſon, is kept in the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety (which <hi>Cuneus</hi> at that time ſhewed often to me in a boaſting manner) wherein a Poyſon was prepared for the King; after the Example of his Father.</p>
            <p n="11">11. In this <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Commotion, the Marqueſs of <hi>Hamilton,</hi> often diſpatched to the <hi>Scots</hi> in the Name of the King, to interpoſe the Royal Authority, whereby the heat of minds might be mittigated, returned notwithſtanding as often without fruit, and without ending the Buſineſs: His Chaplain at that time repaired to us, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated ſome things ſecretly with <hi>Cuneus.</hi> Being demanded of me in jeſt, Whether alſo the <hi>Jews</hi> agreed with the <hi>Samaritans? Cuneus</hi> thereunto anſwered; Would to God all Miniſters were ſuch as he: What you will may be hence conjectured.</p>
            <p n="12">12. Things ſtanding thus, there arrived at <hi>London</hi> from Cardinal <hi>Richelieu,</hi> Mr. <hi>Thomas Chamberlaine,</hi> his Chaplain and Almoner, a <hi>Scot</hi> by Nation, who was to aſſiſt the College of the confederate Society, and ſeriouſly to ſet forward the Buſineſs, to leave nothing unattempted, whereby the firſt heat might be exaſperated. For which ſervice he was promiſed the reward of a Biſhoprick; He cohabited with the Society four Months ſpace; neither was it lawful for him firſt to depart, until things ſucceeding according to his wiſh, he might be able to return back again with good news.</p>
            <p n="13">13. Sir <hi>Toby Matthew,</hi> a Jeſuited Prieſt, of the Order of <hi>Politici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> a moſt vigilant man of the chief heads, to whom a Bed was never ſo dear, that he would reſt his head thereon, refreſhing his Body with ſleep in a Chair for an hour, or two, neither day nor night ſpared his Machinations; a Man principally noxious, and himſelf the Plague of the King and Kingdom of <hi>England</hi>; a moſt impudent man, who flies to all Banquets and Feaſts, called or not called; never quiet, always in action and perpetual motion; thruſting himſelf into all Converſations of Superiours; he urgeth Conferences familiarly, that he may fiſh out the minds of Men; What ever he obſerveth thence, which may bring any commodity, or diſcommodity to the part of the Conſpirators, he communicates to the Pope's <hi>Legat</hi>; the more ſecret things he himſelf writes to the Pope, or to Cardinal <hi>Barbarini.</hi> In ſum, he adjoins himſelf to 
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:179165:10"/>
any mans company; no word can be ſpoken, that he will not lay hold on, and accommodate to his Party. In the mean time, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he hath fiſhed out, he reduceth into a Catalogue, and every Summer carrieth it to the general Conſiſtory of the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> Politicks, which ſecretly meets together in the Province of <hi>Wales,</hi> where he is an acceptable gueſt. There Counſels are ſecretly hammered, which are moſt meet for the Convulſion of the Eccleſiaſtic, and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litic Eſtate of both Kingdoms.</p>
            <p n="14">14. Captain <hi>Read,</hi> a <hi>Scot,</hi> dwelling in <hi>Long-acre-ſtreet,</hi> near the <hi>Angel</hi> Tavern, a ſecular <hi>Jeſuit,</hi> who for his deteſtable office performed (whereby he had perverted a certain Miniſter of the Church, with ſecret incitements to the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Religion, with all his Family, taking his Daughter to Wife) for a recompence, obtained a Rent, or Impoſt upon Butter, which the Country People are bound to render to him, procured for him by ſome chief men of the Society, who never want a ſpur, whereby he may be conſtantly detained in his Office. In his Houſe the buſineſs of the whole Plot is concluded, where the Society, which hath conſpired againſt the King, the Lord Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Biſhop, and both Kingdoms, meet together, for the moſt part every day: But on the day of the <hi>Carriers</hi> (or Poſts) diſpatch, which is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily <hi>Friday,</hi> they meet in greater numbers; for then all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligencers aſſemble, and conſer in common, what things every of them hath fiſhed out that Week; who, that they may be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuſpition, ſend their ſecrets by Sir <hi>Toby Matthew,</hi> or <hi>Read</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, to the Pope's <hi>Legat</hi>; he tranſmits the compacted Packet, which he hath purchaſed from the Intelligencers, to <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>With the ſame <hi>Read,</hi> the Letters brought from <hi>Rome</hi> are depoſited, under ſained Titles and Names, and by him are delivered to all to whom they appertain: For all and every of their Names are known to him.</p>
            <p>Upon the very ſame occaſion, Letters alſo are brought hither un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the covert of Father <hi>Philip</hi>; (he notwithſtanding, being igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of things) from whom they are diſtributed to the Conſpirators.</p>
            <p>There is in that very Houſe, a publick Chappel, wherein an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary <hi>Jeſuit</hi> Conſecrates, and dwells there. In the ſaid Chappel Maſſes are daily celebrated by the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> and it ſerves for the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing of the Children of the Houſe, and of ſome of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators.</p>
            <p>Thoſe who aſſemble in the forenamed Houſe, come frequently in Coaches, or on Horſe-back in Lay-mens Habit, and with a great Train, wherewith they are diſguiſed, that they may not be known, yet they are <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> and conjured members of the Society.</p>
            <p n="15">

15. All the <hi>Papiſts</hi> of <hi>England</hi> contribute to this Aſſembly, lest any thing ſhould be wanting to promote the undertaken Deſign. Out of whoſe Treaſury, a Widow, owner of the Houſes, wherein Secretary <hi>W.</hi> now dwelleth, dead above three Years ſince, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed forty Thouſand <hi>Engliſh</hi> Pounds; ſo likewiſe others contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted above their abilities, ſo as the buſineſs may be promoted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to its deſired end.</p>
            <p n="16">16. Beſides the foreſaid Houſes, there are Conventicles alſo kept in other more ſecret places, of which they dare not conſide, even among themſelves, for fear leſt they ſhould be diſcovered. Firſt, every of them are called to certain Inns, (one not knowing of the other;) hence they are ſeverally led by Spies to the place where they ought to meet; otherwiſe ignorant where they ought to aſſemble, left peradventure they ſhould be ſurpriſed at unawares.</p>
            <p n="17">17. The Counteſs of <hi>A</hi>— a ſtrenuous She-Champion of the <hi>Popiſh Religion,</hi> bends all her Nerves to the Univerſal Reformation; whatſoever ſhe hears at the King's Court, that is done ſecretly, or openly, in words or deeds, ſhe preſently imparts to the <hi>Pope's</hi> Legat, with whom ſhe meets thrice a day. Sometimes in <hi>A</hi>—<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Houſe, now at the Court, then at <hi>Tarthal.</hi> He ſearce ſucks ſuch things by the Claw.</p>
            <p>The Earl himſelf, called now about three years ſince, this year ought to go to <hi>Rome,</hi> without doubt to conſult there of ſerious things concerning the Deſign.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Greenwich,</hi> at the Earls coſt, a Feminine School is maintained, which otherwiſe is a Monaſtery of Nuns; for the young Girls there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, are ſent forth hither and thither, into Foreign Monaſteries beyond the Seas.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>P</hi>— of the King's Bed-Chamber, moſt addicted to the <hi>Popiſh Religion,</hi> is a bitter enemy of the King, he reveals all his greateſt Secrets to the <hi>Pope's</hi> Legat; although he very rarely meets with him, yet his Wife meets him ſo much the oſtner, who being informed by her Husband, conveys ſecrets to the Legat. In all his actions, he is nothing inſeriour to Sir <hi>Toby Matthew</hi>; it cannot be ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, how diligently he watcheth on the buſineſs.</p>
            <p>His Sons are ſecretly inſtructed in the <hi>Popiſh Religion</hi>; openly, they proſeſs the Reformed. The eldeſt is now to receive his Fathers Office, under the King which ſhall be. A Cardinal's Hat is provided for the other, if the Deſign ſhall ſucceed well.</p>
            <p>Above three Years paſt, the ſaid Mr. <hi>P</hi>—was to be ſent away by the King to <hi>Marocco</hi>; but he was prohibited by the Society, leſt the buſineſs ſhould ſuffer delay thereby.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:179165:11"/>
He is a Patron of the Jeſuits, for whom, for the exerciſe of Religion, he provides Chappels both at home and abroad.</p>
            <p>Secretary <hi>W</hi>— a moſt fierce <hi>Papiſt,</hi> is the moſt unfaithful to the King of all men, who not only betrays and reveals even the King's greateſt ſecrets, but likewiſe communicates Counſels, by which the Deſign may be beſt advanced. He, at leaſt thrice every Week, converſeth with the Legat in Nocturnal Conventicles, and reveals thoſe things which he thinks fit to be known; for which end, he hired a Houſe near to the Legats Houſe, whom he often reſorts to, through the Garden door; for by this vicinity, the meeting is fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitated.</p>
            <p>The ſaid Secretary is bribed with Gifts to the Party of that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured Society, by whom he is ſuſtained, that he may the more ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly execute his Office.</p>
            <p>He ſent his Son expreſly to <hi>Rome,</hi> who was to inſinuate himſelf into the <hi>Roman</hi> Pontif.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>D</hi>— Sir <hi>W</hi>— Mr. <hi>M</hi>— the younger, who hath been at <hi>Rome</hi>; my Lord <hi>S</hi>— a Couſen of the Earl of <hi>A</hi>— the Counteſs of <hi>N</hi>— the Durcheſs of <hi>B</hi>— and many others, who have ſworn into this Conſpiracy, are all moſt vigilant in the Deſign. Some of theſe are inticed with the hope of Court, others of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical Offices; Others attend to the ſixteen Cardinals Caps that are vacant, which are therefore detained idle for ſome years, that they may impoſe a vain hope on thoſe who expect them.</p>
            <p>The Preſident of the aforeſaid Society was my Lord <hi>Gage,</hi> a Jeſuit Prieſt, dead above three years ſince. He had a Palace ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with laſcivious Pictures, which counterfeited Profaneneſs in the Houſe, but with them was palliated a Monaſtery, wherein forty Nuns were maintained, hid in ſo great a Palace: It is ſituated in <hi>Queen-ſtreet,</hi> which the Statue of a Golden Queen adorns. The ſecular Jeſuits have bought all this Street, and have deſign'd it into a Quadrangle, where a Jeſuitical College is built in private, with this hope, that it might be openly finiſhed, as ſoon as the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal reformation was begun.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Pope's</hi> Legat uſeth a threefold Character or Cipher; one of which he communicates with all <hi>Nuncioes</hi>; another, with Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Barbarini</hi> only; with a third, he covers ſome greater ſecrets to be communicated.</p>
            <p>Whatſoever things he either receiveth from the Society, or other Spies, thoſe he packs up together in one bundle, dedicated under this Inſcription; <hi>To Monſieur</hi> Stravio, <hi>Arch-deacon of</hi> Cambray: From whom at laſt they are promoted to <hi>Rome.</hi>

               <hi>Hiſtorical Remarks</hi> ON THE JESUITS.</head>
            <p>WHoever ſhall Compare the before-recited PLOT againſt King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, of Glorious Memory, with that againſt His moſt Sacred Majeſty now Reigning; ſhall find them ſo like in all the Parts and Circumſtances, that never were two Brothers more: the <hi>Deſign</hi> the ſame, the <hi>Contrivance</hi> the ſame, the <hi>Working</hi> and <hi>Machi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi> all moving upon the ſame Wheels of <hi>KING-killing,</hi> and <hi>State-deſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi>; and in reference to Condition, Quality, Religion, and Motive, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators the very ſame. From whence it follows, that there is no ſuch Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probability of the <hi>Late diſcoverd PLOT,</hi> as the <hi>Papiſts</hi> would have us believe. An ill Name is half a Conviction; <hi>Quo ſemel eſt imbuta recens, &amp; natur am ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellas furcalicet,</hi> are the <hi>Jeſuits Merals</hi>: Plot, Contrivance, and Cruelty are ſo much the Eſſential Attributes of <hi>Jeſuitiſm,</hi> as if like ſo many <hi>Romuluſſes</hi> and <hi>Remuſſes</hi> they had ſuckt the Milk of Wolves rather than of Chriſtian Mothers, that when you hear of <hi>Plot's</hi> and <hi>Deſigns</hi> againſt Kings and Princes, you may be aſſur'd what ſort of <hi>Cyclops</hi> were the Forgers of ſuch Conſpiracies.</p>
            <p>Neither is this bare <hi>Allegation,</hi> but <hi>Matter of Fact,</hi> there being nothing more frequently taught, nor more frequantly practis'd, than the rebellious Principles of the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> and their Adherents. How abominably the Reigns of ſeveral of our Princes here in <hi>England</hi> has been peſter'd with this Generation of <hi>Vipers</hi> and <hi>Blood-ſuckers,</hi> the Penal Statutes of the Kingdom, and the utter Expulſion of the <hi>Popiſh Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Jeſuits</hi> out of the Nation, are convincing Evidences. And as to their Behaviour in other Countries, take this following Account.</p>
            <p>Firſt then it is a <hi>Maxim</hi> moſt true and undoubted, That a <hi>Vacuum</hi> in Nature may be as ſoon allow'd, as that there is any Court of King or Prince where theſe <hi>Jeſuits</hi> do not ſwarm and abound, if they can but creep in at the leaſt Creviſs. To come to particulars, we will begin with <hi>Portugal,</hi> a Kingdom altogether acknowledging the <hi>Papal Juriſdiction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Year 1578. the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> perſwaded <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> King of that Kingdom, to undertake that Fatal Expedition into <hi>Africa,</hi> to the end that by his ruin they night transfer the Kingdom to the Dominion of the <hi>Spaniard.</hi> The Succeſs an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd their Expectation, for <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> being cut off, together with his Son, and the greateſt part of the Portugal Nobility, preſently <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Spain</hi> prepares to invade <hi>Portugal</hi> with two powerful Armies: But well knowing how little Right he had on his ſide, and how much he ſhould be cenſur'd as well in <hi>Italy</hi> as in <hi>Portugal</hi> for ſuch an Action, he began to make it a Point of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and referr'd his Scruples to be diſcuſs'd by the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> and <hi>Franciſcans</hi> in the Colledge of <hi>Alcana de Henares,</hi> and of them he deſires to know, Whether if it were apparent that he had a Right to the Crown of <hi>Portugal</hi> by the Death of <hi>Henry,</hi> he were not oblig'd in Conſcience to ſubmit himſelf to ſome <hi>Tribunal,</hi> that ſhould adjudge the Kingdom to him. Secondly, Whether if the <hi>Portugals</hi> 
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:179165:12"/>
ſhould refuſe to admit him for their King before the difference were decided be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Competitors, he might not by force of Arms Inveſt himſelf in the Kingdom by his own Authority. To which the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> and <hi>Franciſcans</hi> made anſwer, That <hi>Philip</hi> was bound by no tye of Conſcience to ſubject himſelf to the Will of another, but might act as he ſaw fitting by his own Authority. Which flattering Sentence of thoſe irreligious <hi>Cuſuiſts</hi> being approved by <hi>Philip,</hi> he preſently began the War. In the heat of which War, the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> were they that would have betray'd the chiefeſt of the <hi>Azores</hi> Iſlands to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> which ſo incens'd the People, that ſome would have had them try'd for their lives, others would have had them and their Colledge burnt together.</p>
            <p>In <hi>France, Joane Albret</hi> Queen of <hi>Navarr,</hi> was poyſoned with a pair of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumed Gloves, at the procurement of the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> for being the Patroneſs of thoſe of the Reformed Religion.</p>
            <p>That Rebellious League of the <hi>Guizes</hi> againſt <hi>Henry</hi> the Third of <hi>France,</hi> was carried on and promoted by the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> both at <hi>Paris</hi> and other places: Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, that when the League got ſtrength and began to appear, the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> making a wrong uſe of their Power of Confeſſing and Abſolving, would Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve none that profeſſed themſelves obedient Subjects to the King. This un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate Prince was not only harraſs'd and tormented by this Villanous and Jeſuitical League, not only driven out of his chief City, but at length at the Inſtigation of the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> ſtabb'd and murder'd by a <hi>Dominican Monk,</hi> by them procur'd. The Murder was alſo applauded by <hi>Pope Sixtus</hi> the Fifth, in a long Oration ſpoke in a full Conſiſtory of Cardinals in theſe words: <hi>That a Monk</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſhould kill the unfortunate King of</hi> France <hi>in the midſt of his Army, was a rare, noble, and memorable Act.</hi> And a little further; <hi>This Act,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>was done by the Providence of God, deſign'd by the Inſpiration of the Holy Ghost; a far greater Act than that of</hi> Judith, <hi>who ſlew</hi> Holofernes. Expreſſions rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming the Mouth of a Devil, than of a Vicar of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>After him <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth was firſt attempted by <hi>Barrier,</hi> exhorted and confirm'd in the lawfulneſs of the Fact by <hi>Varada</hi> the <hi>Jeſuit,</hi> and others of the ſame Gang. Secondly by <hi>John Caſtell,</hi> at the Inſtigation of <hi>Gueret</hi> and <hi>Guig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard,</hi> both <hi>Jeſuits</hi>: And <hi>Francis Verona</hi> the <hi>Jeſuit,</hi> publiſht an Apology in vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and juſtification of the Fact: And laſtly, murder'd out-right by <hi>Francis Ravaillac</hi> a great Diſciple of the <hi>Jeſuits.</hi> And for no worſe Pranks than theſe, they were baniſhed out of <hi>France</hi> by Decree of Parliament, <hi>As Corrupters of Youth, Diſturbers of the public Peace, and Enemies to the King and Kingdom.</hi> Truly very honourable Characters for thoſe that pretend to be of the Society of Jeſus.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Venetians</hi> expell'd them upon this occaſion: The Senate obſerving that the Eccleſiaſtics, eſpecially the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> began to engroſs Lands and Houſes of their Territories under the pretence of Legacies, to the great damage of the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Income, thought it convenient to put a ſtop to this Jeſuitical Engroſſment; and provide by Law that Eccleſiaſtical Perſons ſhould not poſſeſs all the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Eſtates in their Territories to themſelves, but give leave for others to ſhare with them, it being poſitively againſt the Conſtitution of their Order, and the Inſtitution of Chriſt their Founder. The <hi>Jeſuits</hi> took this in great dudgeon, and wrote to Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the Fifth about it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Venetians</hi> being ſummon'd to anſwer, would not relinquiſh their Right, Proteſting withal, that they had the Supreme Juriſdiction in their own Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories, and conſequently to make Laws; and that the Pope had nothing to do with them in thoſe Matters. Upon which Anſwer, the Pope thunders out his Excommunication. The Duke and Senate by public Decree condemn the 
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:179165:13"/>
Excommunication as unjuſt and invalid; which done, they call the whole Body of their Clergy, and to them declare how Affairs ſtood. The elder ſort take part with the Commonwealth, and maintain the Argument againſt the Pope in writing, among whom <hi>Paulus Venetus</hi> was moſt eminently Signal: The <hi>Jeſuits</hi> not enduring the kneeneſs of his Reaſons, hire two <hi>Ruffians,</hi> and upon the fifth of <hi>October,</hi> 1607. ſet them to aſſaſſinate <hi>Paulus Venetus,</hi> who thinking they had done his work, left him for dead, and fled away. This was ſomething near Sir <hi>Edmundbury Godfreys</hi> Caſe. The Senate hearing this, by a new Law baniſh the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> for ever out of their Territories, and cut them off from all hope of ever returning: And this was their Fortune in <hi>Venice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the year 1609. the <hi>Bohemians</hi> made a Complaint to the Emperour againſt the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> for the ſame Encroachments of which the <hi>Venetians</hi> had accuſed them before, deſiring of <hi>Caſar</hi> that they might no longer be permitted to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer and tranſlate into their own poſſeſſion ſuch ample Patrimonies, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Donations and Legacies, as they did continually. Of which when the Emperour took little notice, they were by the <hi>Bohemian</hi> States themſelves in the year 1618. utterly expelled out of that Nation for ever, with theſe Characters: 1. That they were laviſh Waſters of the Public Peace and Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility of the Nation. 2. That they endeavour'd to ſubject all Kingdoms and Nations to the Power of the <hi>Pope.</hi> 3. That they did nothing but ſet the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates together by the Ears. 4. That they made particular Advantage of Confeſſions, to the deſtruction of the people: with many other Crimes of the ſame nature.</p>
            <p>The ſame year they were expell'd out of <hi>Moravia</hi> for the ſame Reaſons; and the next year out of <hi>Hungaria</hi> for the ſame Cauſes. In <hi>Sileſia</hi> alſo a Decree was made, That the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> ſhould not enter that Province upon pain of Death, as being the onely means to preſerve peace in the Nation.</p>
            <p>As to other <hi>Villanies</hi> in <hi>Poland,</hi> a <hi>Polonian</hi> Knight, himſelf a Papiſt, in an O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration by him made in a full Aſſembly of the <hi>Polonian</hi> Nobility, declares, That <hi>Cracow</hi> the moſt Famous City of <hi>Poland,</hi> and Ornament of the Kingdom, was ſo plagu'd by the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> that ſeveral good men, though <hi>Catholicks,</hi> affirmed, That they would rather live in the Woods among wild Beaſts, than abide in the City. One time among the reſt, theſe <hi>Jeſuits</hi> having brought their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy to perfection, brake into the moſt ancient Monument of Antiquity in the City, and to the great danger of the whole City, ſet it on Fire, as being granted to the <hi>Evangelics</hi> by Conſent of the King, and States of the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Poſnania</hi> another great City of the ſame Kingdom, they ſet Fire on the Church belonging to thoſe of the <hi>Auguſtan</hi> Confeſſion, and committed ſo many Inſolencies without Controul, that the Nobility refus'd to meet at the <hi>Dyet</hi> ſhortly after to be held at <hi>Warſaw,</hi> reſolving to repair further off to <hi>Lublin,</hi> for the redreſs of theſe Miſdemeanours. Neither indeed was there any thing more grievouſly burdenſom to that Kingdom than the Pride and Avarice of thoſe <hi>Miſcreants.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> upon the Death of the Great Duke <hi>Baſilowich,</hi> the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> ſet up one <hi>Demetrius</hi> againſt the lawful Heir, who had made them large Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, if he obtain'd the Dukedom. Thereupon by the help of theſe <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> the ſaid <hi>Demetrius</hi> gets Aid from the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> which was not onely the Occaſion of a great War in <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> but had like to have coſt them the Alteration of their Laws, and loſs of their ancient Cuſtoms and Priviledges, had they not prevented it by a deſperate Attempt upon the Impoſtor, and put him to Death; ſurrounded with Impoſtors and Jeſuits.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Tranſilvanians</hi> publicly and with one Conſent laid all the Cauſe of their 
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:179165:13"/>
Miſeries and Calamities, upon the Subtilties and Contrivances of the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> for which reaſon by a Public Decree of the States of that Province, they were Ejected out of the limits of their Territories. Nevertheleſs they ſecretly fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented the Ruin of that Country, and were the reaſon that <hi>Sigiſmund Bathor</hi> involv'd himſelf in War and Trouble, and at length died an inglorious and miſerable Death.</p>
            <p>By their Contrivance alſo <hi>Stephen Potski,</hi> Prince of <hi>Tranſilvania,</hi> oppoſing their Bloody Sect, was put out of the way, as they call it, by Poyſon, in the year 1607.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Styria</hi> and <hi>Carinthia,</hi> Provinces of <hi>Germany,</hi> they never left till they had voided thoſe Provinees of all the Inhabitants of the Reformed Religion.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Holland,</hi> they never left till they ſaw the Blood of <hi>William</hi> Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> ſpilt by the trayterous Hand of <hi>Balthaſar Gerard,</hi> a Burgundian and Diſciple of their own.</p>
            <p>The ſame Attempts did <hi>Peter de Tour,</hi> and other <hi>Ruffians</hi> make upon the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of <hi>Maurice</hi> his Son, a brave and Martial Prince, and all at the Inſtigation of the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> thoſe <hi>Inſatiable Sons of BLOOD and PERDITION.</hi>

            <p>From being <hi>Authors</hi> of the REBELLION againſt the late KING, and <hi>Plotters</hi> of <hi>Treaſon</hi> againſt His MAJESTY now Reigning.</p>
            <p>SEeing then no Corner of <hi>Europe</hi> has been free from the Plots and Conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of theſe Jeſuitical Fiends, it would be a kind of Crime and ſleepy Deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our own Safety, to ſuffer our ſelves to be charm'd by the Deluſions of inſinuating Libels and Rumors of <hi>Presbyterian Plots,</hi> to miſtruſt the Truth of the continu'd Jeſuitical Contrivances againſt the Kingdom. Neither can they be thought the beſt Subjects of <hi>England,</hi> who are ſo willing to Gratifie the <hi>Popiſh Party,</hi> by giving Credence to ſuch idle Surmizes which they can have ſo little ground to believe. The <hi>Jeſuits</hi> have committed a great piece of <hi>Villany</hi> in this Nation; they have attempted the Life of the King, and have been Plotting to ſubvert the Eſtabliſhed Religion of the Kingdom, and now they would throw it upon the <hi>Presbyterians</hi>: Which is a Fourbery ſo plain, that common Senſe and Policy may eaſily diſcover the full intent and meaning of it! And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is fairly to be hop'd, that neither <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> nor any other <hi>Protestant Diſſenters</hi> will be ſo Unchriſtian-like Diſloyal, as to receive any Exaſperation 
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:179165:14"/>
from theſe Calumnies; but rather unite againſt the <hi>Common Enemy,</hi> from whom they can expect no more Mercy, than the ſevereſt Champion of <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> can hope for.</p>
            <p>But you will ſay, the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> are not accus'd of any Deſign to bring in <hi>Popery,</hi> but miraculouſly diſcover'd, as the Authors of a Plot to ſet up the <hi>Claſſes</hi> of their own Eccleſiaſtical Government. Well! if it were ſo, they were the arranteſt Bunglers of Plotters that ever plotted Miſchief in this World: For I do not find their Plot to be above a years ſtanding; And it was a Plot that was driven on out of pure Kindneſs to the <hi>Papiſts.</hi> For the <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians</hi> underſtanding that the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> (their <hi>Incarnate Enemies</hi>) were under a Premunire, as being accuſed of <hi>Treaſon</hi> and <hi>Conſpiracy</hi> againſt the KING and Kingdom; They therefore would needs enter into a Plot, which they would ſo order as to be diſcover'd a Twelve-month after, to eaſe the <hi>Papiſts</hi> of the Load they groan'd under. So that as conſidering the time, it fell out moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundedly unluckily, that the <hi>Presbyteriaus</hi> ſhould conceal this Plot from the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> till ſo many good, honeſt, pious and loyal <hi>Prieſts</hi> of <hi>Baal,</hi> and Sons of <hi>Belial</hi> were hang'd, which would never have been done, had there been the leaſt Inkling given of the <hi>Meal-Tub</hi> in ſeaſon. But when the Names of the Perſons came to be ſeen that were to be Actors in this <hi>Presbyterian Tragedy,</hi> then to the Laughter of the whole World, there never appear'd ſuch a Dow-bak'd Plot out of a Meal-Tub ſince the Creation, to bring ſo many Great Men plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting againſt their own proſperity and enjoyments; ſo many wiſe and politic States-men, by whom the Nation has been ſo long ſteer'd, to be Plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and Conſpirers againſt their own Preſervation. Theſe are Plots of ſuch a ſtrange Nature, that if they could be thought reall, they would occaſion the unhinging of the whole Frame of Order and Government, while it were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for Honour, Probity, and Reputation to remain upon the Earth. Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and Allegiance to Government are grounded either upon Religion, or Moral Vertue; or if theſe two fail, there is a neceſſity which obliges the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary fore-ſight of Prudence.</p>
            <p>Againſt theſe Ambition or Revenge are the only Combatants; but neither Ambition nor Revenge can bear ſo great a ſway in perſons that underſtand the Intrigues of Policy, or the more myſterious management of Prudence, as to delude them into Plots and Conſpiracies where there is no proſpect of a ſecure Change. The <hi>Presbyterians</hi> are a ſort of people wary and deliberate: Neither are their Tenents, which had their riſe and beginnings from men whom the <hi>Papiſts</hi> themſelves confeſs to have been men of great Learning, Eloquence, and Exemplary Lives, of that Crimſon Conſtitution, as to prompt them to lay the Foundations of their Hierarchy in Blood and Maſſacre; or ſo deeply to wound the Reputation of the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> by the clandeſtine Treachery and ſecret Contrivances of Diſloyalty. For as for that Deſign of the <hi>Huguenots</hi> under <hi>Francis the Second,</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> of which the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> and the Admiral <hi>Coligni</hi> were ſaid to be Chief; that was no Deſign againſt the Life or Perſon of the King, but againſt the exorbitant Pride of the <hi>Guiſes, Duke</hi> and <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal,</hi> who were at the ſame time P<hi>apiſts,</hi> and were themſelves contriving to take away the Life of the young King, and tranſlate the Royal Dignity into their own Family. Neither could the Civil Wars of <hi>France</hi> be ſaid to be the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion of the <hi>Hugonets</hi>: But a War of the Queen <hi>Regents,</hi> and the two <hi>Guiſes</hi> own weaving, while they all ſtrove to preſerve their own Authority. And the Queen <hi>Regent</hi> her ſelf was the firſt that caus'd the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> to take Arms, as fearing the <hi>Guiſes</hi> would wreſt the Government out of her hands, by recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending to his Protection the young King <hi>Charles</hi> the Ninth her Son, her Self, 
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:179165:14"/>
and the Kingdom. Nay they were ſo far from being Rebels to their King, that they joyn'd with the <hi>Catholiques</hi> for the Recovery of <hi>Haure</hi> out of the hands of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> who had been their Friend: And though the Admiral and <hi>Dandelot</hi> were not at the Siege, for fear of being taxed by the Queen of Ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, yet they ſent both their Forces and Friends. Some indeed juſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to be blamed for the violence of their Conduct in the late Wars; but it is a Queſtion, of which ſome make no doubt, whether thoſe Violences were not occaſion'd by the <hi>Papiſts</hi> in Maſquerade, who well knew how to intermix them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves both in their Counſels and Actions; whether they did not ſtand behind the Scene and prompt thoſe Sons of <hi>Jehu?</hi> Whether they did not pour Oyl up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe Flames? For it appears that the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> (if Names of diſtinction may be us'd among people of the ſame Religion) were the firſt that relented, as is evident by Votes of Addreſſes, and their Treaty at the <hi>Iſle of Wight,</hi> not broke off by them, but by One that was playing his own Game, and medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the deſtruction both of his Sovereign and them too: Who having made his <hi>Exit,</hi> they then conſidered what ill <hi>Phaetons</hi> they had been before, and return'd the more skilful <hi>Phoebus</hi> the Reins of his Chariot again. But that you may know that 'tis an old Dog-trick of the <hi>Papiſts</hi> to play the <hi>Devils Incarnate,</hi> and lay their moſt wicked Actions upon the Innocent; I will repeat this ſhort Story out of one of the choiceſt <hi>French Hiſtorians,</hi> and a <hi>Catholique</hi> to boot. The <hi>Queen Regent</hi> of <hi>France</hi> having long deſign'd the Deſtruction of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> and of all the chief Heads of the reformed Religion; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the reſt of Admiral <hi>Coligni,</hi> the Life and Soul of the whole Party, projects the Execution, with the Affiſtance of the Duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi> the Counts of <hi>Tavanes</hi> and <hi>Raix,</hi> and the Chancellor <hi>Birague,</hi> and eaſily drew in the young King, whom they made believe that there was no ſafety ſo long as thoſe perſons were alive, and they young <hi>Guiſes</hi> were as ready as ſhe to revenge their Fathers Death. As for the King of <hi>Navar,</hi> they had ſo order'd it, that he was to be marry'd at <hi>Paris</hi> at that time, and that brought the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> to the City. But the Admiral more wary kept aloof, till the King had begun the War with <hi>Spain</hi> in the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> which the Admiral had ſo paſſionately deſir'd, and of which the King and Queen <hi>Regent,</hi> had aſſur'd him the Management. Then he came an end, ſeeing the War begun, and two of his own Favourites, <hi>Noue</hi> and <hi>Genlis,</hi> at the Head of ſome thouſands in <hi>Flanders.</hi> And theſe three Great Perſonages, the King of <hi>Navarr,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> and the Admiral <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligni,</hi> brought ſuch Trains after them, as throng'd all <hi>Paris</hi> with the Flower of all the Proteſtant Nobility and Gentry of <hi>France</hi>: Who being all thus with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Net, Orders were given to make a general Slaughter of all without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction, excepting the King of <hi>Navarr,</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Conde.</hi> Hence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded that Horrible Maſſacre in the Year 1572. which laſted for ſeven Days together, to the deſtruction of above 5000 perſons of all Ages and Sexes; and among theſe above 600 Perſons of Quality.</p>
            <p>After this Deluge of Blood, and that the Queen had ſent the Head of <hi>Coligny</hi> Embalm'd as a Preſent to the Pope, the <hi>Queen Regent</hi> had contriv'd to lay the Load of all the committed Impiety upon the <hi>Guiſes,</hi> who were Captains of the Maſſacre, believing that the <hi>Monmor ancies</hi> would certainly ſeek to revenge the Admirals Death upon them: So that while thoſe two Factions ruin'd and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd one another, ſhe might have all the Power in her own hands, and rule according to her own Will. But the <hi>Guiſes</hi> being aware of this Deſign, and having the Catholique Nobility, the Duke of <hi>Montpenſier,</hi> and the <hi>Pariſians</hi> on their ſide, caus'd the Queen to change her Note; and thereupon ſhe caus'd the King to write abroad, That all was done to prevent the deteſtable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy

Thereupon there was a Court of Juſtice erected, wherein the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral was Condemn'd, and after they had murder'd him, Executed again in <hi>Effigies,</hi> his Goods Confiſctated, and his Children degraded: And the better to colour this, two poor innocent Gentlemen that had eſcaped the Maſſacre, were apprehended for ſaving their Lives, <hi>Briquemaut,</hi> and <hi>Arnand de Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagnes,</hi> as his Accomplices, condemn'd to the ſame puniſhment, and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted accordingly.</p>

            <head>A Compleat HITSTORY OF THE LAST PLOT OF THE PAPISTS, <hi>UPON THE</hi> Diſſenting Proteſtants.</head>
            <p>THe late PLOT of the <hi>Romiſh Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Jeſuits</hi> for murdering His Majeſty, ſubverting the Government and Proteſtant Religion, and introducing <hi>Popery,</hi> being proved by undeniable Evidences and Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances; the cunning <hi>Jeſuits</hi> thought it their beſt way (ſince peoples Eyes were too open to be made believe <hi>there was no PLOT</hi>) to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs there was a Plot, and to aggravate it too; but withal to uſe their utmoſt skill to prove, That this <hi>Plot</hi> was not a <hi>Popiſh-Plot,</hi> as was generally believed, but a pure Deſign of the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> and other <hi>Diſſenters</hi> from the Proteſtant Church of <hi>England,</hi> to ruin the <hi>Loyal Roman Chatholiques,</hi> whilſt indeed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves were the <hi>Conſpirators</hi>; who (whereas they gave out that the <hi>Papiſts</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by murdering the King, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to bring in <hi>Popery</hi>) really intended by killing His Majeſty, to Introduce <hi>Presbytery</hi> and a <hi>Commonwealth,</hi> and ſo at one Blow ſubvert the Government both in Church and State, and then to ſet up a new one of their own under the Name of <hi>Conſervators of the Liberties of England</hi>: And for this purpoſe they had ſecretly given out Commiſſions for raiſing an Army, the principal Officers whereof were ſuch Perſons who ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have the greateſt ſhare in the Peoples Affections.</p>
            <p>This Deſign being agreed to by theſe <hi>Helliſh Miſcreants,</hi> all poſſible Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence was uſed to bring it to Execution; and for this purpoſe they drew up the Scheme of a Government they intended to Impeach ſeveral of the truly 
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:179165:16"/>
Loyal Nobility and Gentry, and the whole Body of Diſſenting Proteſtants, of conſpiring. This being done, they began to form <hi>Letters of Intelligence</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this <hi>Presbyterian Plot,</hi> and alſo to provide themſelves with Perſons to Swear for the Truth of their Allegations. To this end Mrs. <hi>Cellier</hi> (a zealous Papiſt, and Midwife to the Lady <hi>Powis,</hi> and other Roman Catholic Ladies) procures the Enlargement of one <hi>Willonghby,</hi> aliàs <hi>Dangerfield,</hi> aliàs <hi>Thomas,</hi> aliàs <hi>Day,</hi> who had been a Priſoner in <hi>Newgate</hi> about ſix Weeks, and had been Convicted once at <hi>Salisbury</hi> Aſſizes, (where he was fined Five pounds, and ſentenced to ſtand Three ſeveral times in the Pillory, which he did twice, and then brake Priſon and eſcaped;) and twice at the <hi>Old Bailey,</hi> for uttering falſe Guineys, (where for the firſt Offence he was fined Fifty pounds, and for the ſecond he got His Majeſties Pardon.) He was no ſooner releaſed from <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate,</hi> but he was Arreſted and thrown into the <hi>Counter,</hi> from whence by the means of <hi>Banniſter</hi> and <hi>Scarlet</hi> ſhe got him removed to the <hi>King's-Bench,</hi> where (after ſome fruitleſs attempts to get ſome Papers relating to Captain <hi>Bedlow</hi> from one <hi>Strode</hi> a Priſoner there) he was furniſhed with Money by the five Lords in the Tower, <hi>viz.</hi> the Lord <hi>Bellaſis,</hi> the Lord <hi>Powis,</hi> the Lord <hi>Petre,</hi> the Lord <hi>Arundel,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Stafford,</hi> (Mrs. <hi>Cellier</hi> alſo giving him 5 <hi>l.</hi>) to Compound all his Debts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Before Mrs. <hi>Cellier</hi> would diſcharge him from <hi>Newgate,</hi> ſhe made tryal of his Wit, by ordering him to draw up Articles ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as ſhe directed, againſt Captain <hi>Richardſon,</hi> which he perform'd to her liking, and confirm'd her in the Choice ſhe had made of his being a fit perſon to carry on the <hi>Deſigned Plot.</hi> The general Eſteem the Conſpirators had of him is evident by the Truſt they repoſed in him; for though they had ſeveral Others to carry on their <hi>New Plot,</hi> yet he appears to have the chief Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it.</p>
            <p>Being now fuſticiently provided with Inſtruments to execute their <hi>Damnable Deſigns,</hi> this <hi>Dangerfield</hi> was recommended to His Majeſty by a Great Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as one who was much concerned in a Plot of the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> againſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> His Life and Government, and that from time to time he would make diſcovery thereof. Thus they endeavoured to inſinuate into His Majeſties Mind a belief of the Plot, that he might not be ſurpriz'd at the Diſcovery they intended to make.</p>
            <p>Another of the intended Actors in this Tragedy, was <hi>Thomas Courtees,</hi> once a Clerk to Sir <hi>William Bucknal,</hi> one of the Exciſe Farmers, then a Servant to Mr. <hi>Henry Nevil,</hi> and after to a worthy Member of Parliament; from whoſe Service, he fell into a lewd courſe of life: But being thought a Man fit for the Deſign in hand, he was entertained for one of the Witneſſes. This Perſon was very induſtrious in promoting a Belief of this <hi>Presbyterian Plot</hi>; for being well acquainted with Mrs. <hi>Bradley,</hi> who keeps the Houſe called <hi>Heaven</hi> in <hi>Old Palace-Yard</hi>; and there being a Club of ſeveral honeſt Gentlemen kept at her Houſe, he deſired her to bring him into their Company, which ſhe promiſed to endeavour. Diſcourſing with her about the late Plot, he told her, that it would ſhortly appear to be a Plot of the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> and that they were pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately giving out Commiſſions for raiſing an Army: Whereupon ſhe demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, who gave out the Commiſſions; to which he replyed, it was Mr. <hi>Blood</hi>; and added further, That if ſhe would uſe her Intereſt with Mr. <hi>Blood,</hi> to get a Commiſſion for him, though it were but for an Enſign, he would give her 100 <hi>l.</hi> and told her alſo that he ſhould get 5000 <hi>l.</hi> by it. Mrs. <hi>Bradley</hi> told this to Mr. <hi>Blood,</hi> who fearing the Conſequence, acquainted His Majeſty there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, and from Him received Encouragement to make a further Inquiry into this Matter. Mr. <hi>Blood</hi> hereupon deſired the Woman to keep ſtill her Correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondency 
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:179165:16"/>
with <hi>Courtees,</hi> and if poſſible to find out the Myſtery of this Buſineſs. <hi>Courtees</hi> came ſeveral times afterwards to the Houſe, and diſcourſed freely with her about the before-mentioned Matter, and told her, that he knew ſeven or eight perſons who were employed upon the ſame account as he was.</p>
            <p>But that which follows put a ſtop to his proceedings, and made theſe wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Agents carry themſelves more warily.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Jeſuits</hi> thought it not ſufficient to throw the Plot upon the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> unleſs they could likewiſe bring off the Evidence that had ſworn againſt them, and by getting them to recant, put their Innocency out of Queſtion. For this purpoſe Mr. <hi>Dugdale,</hi> one of the Kings Evidence, is attempted by one Mrs. <hi>Price,</hi> (for whom it is ſaid Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> had formerly ſome kindneſs;) ſhe warily diſcovers her Deſign, and he as warily entertains it; and after ſome Treaty, one Mr. <hi>Tesborough</hi> appears in the Caſe. They promis'd Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> a great Sum of Money, upon condition that he would Recant what he had Sworn, and Sign a Paper, which they had ready drawn up to this effect.</p>
            <q>Being touched with a True Remorſe of Conſcience, and an hearty Sorrow for the Great Evil I have done, in appearing as a Witneſs againſt the Catholicks, and there ſpeaking that which in my own Conſcience I know to be far from the Truth; I think my ſelf bound in Duty to God, to Man, and for the ſafety of my own Soul, to make a true Acknowledgment, how I was drawn into theſe wicked Actions; but being well ſatisfied that I ſhall create my ſelf many powerful Enemies upon this account, I have retired my ſelf to a place of Safety, where I will with my own hand diſcover the great Wrong that has been done the Catholicks, and hope it may gain Belief: I do likewiſe Protest before Almighty God, that I have no Motive to Induce me to this Confeſſion, but a True Repentance for the Miſchiefs that I have done, and do hope that God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty will forgive me.</q>
            <p>Having done this, they told him he might immediately withdraw himſelf beyond the Seas into <hi>Spain,</hi> where he ſhould be honourably entertained, during his ſtay there, which ſhould be no longer than till they had brought their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns to their deſired End, and then he ſhould be recalled, and have both Riches and Honour conferr'd upon him as a Reward for faithfully ſerving the <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Intereſt.</hi> Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> ſeemed willing to agree to their Propoſals, (though at the ſame time he acquainted ſeveral honeſt Gentlemen of every particular that paſſed) if the Reward could be aſcertained to him; but as for the two Propoſers he would not take their Security for it; whereupon they offered the Security of a Forein Ambaſſador, but he told them that he thought him a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon not fit for Security, becauſe he might ſuddenly be commanded home, and then he could have no remedy againſt him. Then they propoſed ſeveral others, whoſe Security they ſaid he need not queſtion; but ſtill he found a plauſible Excuſe; his Deſign being onely to gain time, that he might make a further Diſcovery who ſet them on work. His Delays created a Jealouſie in them, that he never intended to anſwer their Deſires; wherefore leaſt he ſhould diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover this Treaty, and render them liable to puniſhment, (as it happened in Mr. <hi>Readings</hi> Caſe) they were reſolved to begin with him firſt; and by the aſſiſtance of a great Perſon, a Complaint was made againſt Mr. <hi>Dugdale,</hi> That he offered for a Sum of Money to Recant his Evidence, and that he would have Signed ſuch a Paper as before-mentioned; adding withal, that it was a lamentable thing to conſider how much Blood had been ſhed upon ſuch Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. Upon this Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> was ſummoned before the King and Council, where giving a full Relation of the Affair, and having thoſe Gentlemen ready, 
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:179165:17"/>
whom he had all along acquainted with the Intrigue to prove what he ſaid; and it plainly appearing, that Mrs. <hi>Price</hi> and Mr. <hi>Tesbrough</hi> had endeavoured to take off the Kings Evidence, they were both committed to ſafe Cuſtody. This it was that alarm'd <hi>Courtees.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Dangerfield</hi> in this time had been employed to murder the Earl of <hi>Shafts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> which he twice attempted, but could not meet with an opportunity, the Earl refuſing to ſpeak in private with him; which he urged, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence that he had ſomething to reveal to his Lordſhip of great Concern to his Lordſhips Perſon. He waited on his Lordſhip by the Name of <hi>Day,</hi> and went armed with a Dagger, which he received from Mrs. <hi>Cellier,</hi> to whom three or four were brought by Mr. <hi>Rigaut.</hi> To perform this Murther, he was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed 500 <hi>l.</hi> by the Lords <hi>Powis</hi> and <hi>Arundel,</hi> (the Lord <hi>Arundel</hi> giving him then 10 Guineys) and encouraged by the Lady <hi>Abergaveny,</hi> Lady <hi>Powis,</hi> Mrs. <hi>Cellier,</hi> and others, and his Confeſſor <hi>Sharp</hi> conjur'd him to ſtab him with all poſſible ſpeed. After his firſt diſappointment, they adviſed him to tell the Earl that he was in danger of being Impeached for <hi>High Treaſon,</hi> and that from Letters under his own hand; and that when he ſhould find himſelf in the <hi>Tower,</hi> he would have cauſe to repent that he had refuſed to hear what he had to tell him. Theſe Inſtructions he followed, and told his Lordſhip that his Servants had Copied out his Letters, from whence would be drawn Matter to form an Impeachment: But the Earl would not be Wheadled by this to give him a private Audience, and thereby adminiſter to him an opportunity of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away his Life; but askt him which of his Servants they were that had Copied out his Letters: To which <hi>Dangerfield</hi> replyed, That he knew not. Then the Earl anſwered, That he knew that all he ſaid was falſe, for that if his Letters were made known to all the World, there would not be found Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſufficient to endanger the leaſt Hair of his Head, much leſs to form an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment. Whereupon <hi>Dangerfield</hi> told him, That if that was his Lordſhips Opinion, he would take his leave; and ſo departed, leaving his Lordſhip a little jealous of his Intentions.</p>
            <p>The Lady <hi>Powis</hi> would have perſwaded him upon a Third Attempt, which he refuſing, ſhe ſtruck him gently on the Hand with her Fan, calling him Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted Fellow, telling him, ſhe would do it her ſelf; but Mrs. <hi>Cellier</hi> told her, that ſhould not be, for She would perform it. In order to which, the very next day ſhe went armed with a Dagger, to wait upon his Lordſhip, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived her very civilly; but being made more wary than formerly, by <hi>Danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fields</hi> laſt carriage, he ſtrictly obſerv'd her, and perceiving her fumbling about her Pocket, betwixt Jeſt and Earneſt, he clapt his hands upon hers, and there held them, pleaſantly drolling with her till ſhe was ready to depart; but ſhe was not gone ſo far as the Door, before ſhe offer'd to return, which his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip obſerving, ſtept to her again, and clapping his hands upon hers, quite daſht her out of Countenance; ſo that ſhe departed without attempting further. Thus was his Lordſhip thrice, by Divine Providence, miraculouſly preſerved from the bloody hands of <hi>Papiſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Plot being now ripe for Execution, and Treaſonable Letters ready written, to be conveyed into the Cuſtody of ſuch Perſons they intended to Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, and two or more Witneſſes prepared to ſwear the Delivery and Receit of ſuch Letters or Commiſſions againſt every man in their black Liſt; <hi>Danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field</hi> under the Name of <hi>Thomas,</hi> takes a Lodging in <hi>Ax-Yard</hi> in <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> (pretending himſelf a Country-Gentleman) where lay one Colonel <hi>Manſel,</hi> whoſe Chamber he ſoon made himſelf acquainted with, and therein conveyed about Nine or Ten of the aforeſaid Treaſonable Letters, ſuperſcribed to ſeveral 
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:179165:17"/>
honeſt Gentlemen and Perſons of Quality, ſome of which were Favourers of the Diſſenting Proteſtants: When he had ſo done, he informed ſome of the Officers belonging to the Cuſtom Houſe, That in that Houſe there was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed great Quantities of French Lace, and other prohibited Goods, deſiring them the next Morning to bring a Warrant with them and ſearch the Houſe, which they promiſed. At Night he brought one Captain <hi>Bedford</hi> to lie with him (as is ſuppoſed) that he might be a Witneſs againſt the Colonel: Next Morning after the Colonel was gone forth, came the Officers to ſearch for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited Goods; <hi>Dangerfield</hi> was very officious in aſſiſting them to ſearch the Colonel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> Chamber, and at length from behind the Bed brings forth the before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Pacquet of Letters; upon which, caſting his Eyes, and ſeeming ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized, he cryed out, <hi>Treaſon, Theſe are all Treaſonable Letters</hi>; Whereupon the Officers carried them away to the Commiſſioners: But the Colonel coming in ſoon after, and being acquainted with all that had paſt in his abſence, found means to retrieve them again; and when he had ſo done, he made ſome En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry after <hi>Dangerfield,</hi> of whoſe Quality being well informed, he carried the Letters to His Majeſty, with Proteſtations of his own Innocency, and <hi>Danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field</hi>'s Villany. Whereupon on the 23. of <hi>October,</hi> the Council ordered <hi>Danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field</hi> to be taken into Cuſtody by a Meſſenger, and after a full hearing of the Buſineſs before them, <hi>Oobct.</hi> 27. they Committed him to <hi>Newgate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When Colonel <hi>Manſel</hi> had thus detected <hi>Dangerfield,</hi> the above-mentioued Captain <hi>Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> came in very generouſly of himſelf, and confeſſed ſeveral things he was privy to, amongſt which, one was, That this '<hi>Dangerfield</hi> would have perſwaded him to ſwear that Sir <hi>Thomas Player</hi> ſpoke Treaſon, thereby to have taken away the Life of that honeſt Gentleman.</p>
            <p>The Letters before mentioned gave Light enough to perceive what the Deſign was the <hi>Papiſts</hi> were then contriving; Whereupon Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> (who has been all along very zealous in diſcovering the <hi>Prieſts,</hi> and their wicked Plots, notwithſtanding their Threats and Attempts to take away his Life) underſtanding that <hi>Dangerfield</hi> uſed to lodge at Mrs. <hi>Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers,</hi> went thither on Wedneſday, <hi>Octob.</hi> 29. to ſearch her Houſe; and that he might leave no place unſearcht, he ordered a Tub of Meal to be emptied, which being done, at the Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom thereof was found a little Paper-bod<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The Earl of <hi>Peterborough</hi> being called in, and having an account of what was laid to his Charge, made a very plauſible Speech in anſwer thereto; and as to the buſineſs of Sir <hi>Robert Peyton,</hi> he ſaid, <hi>That</hi> Mrs. <hi>Cellier</hi> told him that among others which the had brought over to be ſerviceable to His Majeſty and the Duke, Sir <hi>Robert Peyton</hi> was one, who had declared to her, that he would gladly come in, but that he thought the Duke of that temper, that he would never forget an Injury. <hi>That</hi> then he aſſured Mrs. <hi>Cellier,</hi> the Duke was no ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; and then the replyed, that <hi>Sir Robert</hi> would willingly meet him at Mr. <hi>Gadbury</hi>'s. <hi>That</hi> they did meet ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly at Mr. <hi>Gadbury</hi>'s, where <hi>Sir Robert</hi> did ſay, that he would ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Theſe are the principal things that were acted before the King and Council, the Reſult whereof was, that the Earl of <hi>Caſtlemain</hi> (firſt) and (after) the Lady <hi>Powis</hi> was committed to the <hi>Tower,</hi> Mr. <hi>Gadbury</hi> to the <hi>Gate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe,</hi> Mr. <hi>Rigaut</hi> and Mrs. <hi>Cellier</hi> to <hi>Newgate,</hi> and ſeveral others to the Cuſtody of Meſſengers.</p>
            <p>About this time <hi>Sir William Waller</hi> (ſearching a Houſe near the <hi>Arch</hi> in <hi>Lincolns-Inn</hi> Fields, leading to <hi>Duby-ſtreet</hi>) ſeized on ſeveral Habits, Veſtments, Crucifixes, Reliques, and other Popiſh <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="4 letters">

            <p>Among the Relicks was found one great Piece of Antiquity, and by computation of time near 800 years old.
