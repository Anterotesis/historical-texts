            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Doth therefore with Advice and Conſent of the Eſtates of Parliament, Statute and Ordain, that notwithſtanding it be Recommended by the ſaid Act to the Lords of His Majeſties Privy Council, to try by ſome of their Number every Journal of Coyne by itſelf dictinctly, and that twice every year. <hi>viz.</hi> In the moneth of <hi>July</hi> and <hi>December</hi> yearly: yet ſeeing the forſaid diſtinct tryal of every Journal hath been found both a Tedious and Superfluous Labour, and is not practiſed any where elſe; It ſhal be Leiſome for the ſaids Lords of His Majeſties Privy Council to make the ſaid Tryal by ſuch of their Number as they ſhal think fit, not of every Journal of Coyne by itſelf diſtinctly; but by taking and mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Tryal of any one or more ſingle Journals as they ſhal think fit: And then to cauſe Melt down in one Maſſe or Lignat the reſt of the Journals to be at that time Tried, and to take an Eſſay of the Maſs ſo Melted down as ſaid is which ſhal ſtand for the whole, but Prejudice always to the ſaids Lords of Council, to make diſtinct Tryals of the haill forſaid Journals as they ſhal ſee cauſe: As alſo ſtill Recommending to them the exact Tryal of all matters relating to the Coynage at the for ſaid two times above ſpecified in manner mentioned in the ſaid Act. And farder, for the better aſcertaining of the Fineneſs of the Coyne, His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty with Advice and Conſent for ſaid, doth hereby Ordain, that not only the Principal or Counter-warden be preſent at the taking off all Eſſays: but that there be a Plate of Silver of the true Standard fineneſs made by the, Eſſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Maſter at the ſight of ſuch as the Lords of Privy Council ſhal think fit to Appoint, which Plate duely made and Marked, one half thereof ſhal be put in the hands of the Clerk of Exchequer for a Proof of the general Eſſay, and the other half in the hands of the Principal or Counter-warden: that all the Pott and Pix Eſſays may be thereby Made and Examined.</p>
