            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>UNTO HIS GRACE. HIS MAJESTY'S HIGH COMMISSIONER And the Right Honourable, The ESTATES of PARLIAMENT. <hi>The OWNERS and MASTERS of the SHIPS belonging in the Town of</hi> BORROWSTOUNNESS, GRANGE-PANNS, <hi>and</hi> QUEENSFERRIE.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>Sheweth,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THAT whereas in the Year 1695, there was an unprinted Act paſt, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing Four Shilling <hi>Scots</hi> yearly upon the Tunn of all Ships belonging to this Kingdom, and Sixteen Shilling <hi>Scots</hi> upon the Tun of Forraign Ships, coming within the Rivers and Harbours belonging to this Nation; and that in order to the defraying of of Mr. <hi>Adair</hi>'s Charges in making up of Maps of the Coaſts, and Mr. <hi>Slezer</hi>'s Charges for making Maps and Proſpects of the Caſtles and Forts within this Kingdom; which Four Shilling of Tunnage has been ſtrictly exacted off us, for all Years preceeding <hi>Auguſt</hi> laſt. As to which we humbly Repreſent, That the exacting of the ſaid Tunnage is a very heavy Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den upon us, and if continued, will abſolutely deſtroy our Trade and Shipping: And whatever is in uſe to be exacted from Forraign Ships, yet it is the Practice of all Nations to free their own Ships of ſuch Tunnage, for encouraging of their Shipping. And therefore it is, that albeit in <hi>France</hi> they exact <hi>50 Souce per</hi> Tun; in <hi>Denmark</hi> a Rix Dollar and ſix Stivers, in <hi>Holland</hi> fifteen Stivers <hi>per</hi> Laſte of all Forraign Ships, and ſo in many other Places; yet they exact no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing upon the account of Tunnage of their own Ships. And our Loſs and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice by the ſaid Tunnage is ſo much the greater, that our Ships being pretty large, our principal Trade being to carry Coals, and ſuch other bulkiſh Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities Abroad; a good part of our Profit is exhauſted by the ſaid Tunnage, and Tunnage and Laſt-money which is exacted from us Abroad, which is very conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable. And we having had great Loſs of our Shipping the time of the War, and rather than made any Gain, have brought a Debt upon our Ships: And now in the time of Peace when we may expect to have ſome Trade, if the ſaid Tunnage be not taken off, we will be neceſſitate to lay up our Ships, or other ways diſpoſe of them. And ſeing there nothing tends more to the Thriving and Promoting of Trade in a Nation, than the encouraging of Shipping, without which Forraign Trade, which is that, That principally enriches a Kingdom, cannot be carried on.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is therefore humbly craved, That his Grace His Majeſty's High Commiſſioner, and the Right Honourable the Eſtates of Parliament, may take the Premiſſes to their Conſideration, and altogether to Diſcharge the foreſaid Impoſition of</hi> 4 ſh <hi>upon the Tun of</hi> Scots <hi>Ships ſince</hi> Auguſt <hi>laſt, and in time-comming, and to lay the ſamen wholy upon Forraign Ships, for whoſe uſe principally the Maps of the Coaſts are Deſigned to be made for their Trade and Security; the</hi> Scots <hi>Maſters and Mariners being ſufficiently acquainted with their own Coaſt, and having Maps thereof whereby they have directed their Courſes of a longtime, and as yet have none other: So that the ſaids Maps can be of litle or no uſe or benefit to them; and it ſeems Reaſonable, that ſeing Forraigners, who are not acquaint with our Coaſt, does principally reap the Benefit of theſe Maps, whereof the Expences were to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frayed by that Impoſition, that they ſhould only bear the Burden, and they cannot complain that it is too high, ſeing it is a third part leſs than the</hi> Scots <hi>Ships pays in any place abroad.</hi> And Your Petitioners ſhall ever pray.</p>
