            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>To the Right Honorable, the LORD CHAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CELLOR, the humble Petition of</hi> COVENT-GARDEN.</head>
            <opener>Sheweth,</opener>
            <p>THat having for many years paſt lived under great Oppreſſions, by the pretence of raiſing great ſums of money for the paying of a <hi>Miniſter,</hi> and the <hi>People</hi> being divided in <hi>Opinion,</hi> commonly called <hi>Religion,</hi> where the <hi>Godly</hi> have alwayes perſecuted the <hi>Loyal,</hi> Upon the coming of His <hi>Sacred Majeſty</hi> (who ſeemed rather to be deſcended from <hi>above,</hi> then returned from the <hi>Low Countreys</hi>) they were in great hope to be relieved; yet ſo it is, that the ſame Perſons that did formerly torment them, being continued ſtill in Authority, they are ſtil trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled by vexatious <hi>Suits</hi> at the <hi>Common Law,</hi> by which means they are much hindered from following their <hi>lawful Callings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wherefore we do humbly deſire, that one Dr.</hi> Babre, <hi>who hath been a</hi> chief In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument <hi>in troubling the Pariſh ever ſince he came into it, and hath often threatned that we ſhould have no</hi> QUIET <hi>as long as he continued in Commiſſion of</hi> PEACE, <hi>may be removed out for theſe following Reaſons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. He was a <hi>Phyſician</hi> to <hi>Cromwel</hi> in <hi>Scotland</hi> againſt the <hi>King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. He was employed by <hi>Cromwel</hi> for the taking away the Life of <hi>Panta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leon Sa,</hi> and had been hanged himſelf if he had not got <hi>Cromwell</hi>'s Pardon, to whom he was a <hi>Pentionary Spye.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. He indicted a very goodly <hi>Captain</hi> of the Parliament for treaſonable words againſt <hi>Cromwell,</hi> and endangered his Life without giving him any Phyſick.</p>
            <p n="4">4. He was indicted <hi>himſelf</hi> by the Pariſh for <hi>Forgery,</hi> the Indictment found, and his Ears like to have been loſt.</p>
            <p n="5">5. He is a general <hi>Solicitor</hi> practicing to ſet Man and Wife together by the Ears, as in Mris. <hi>Juyes</hi> Caſe it was plainly ſeen, when her Council told him, that if he had ſtudied the <hi>Law</hi> he would have been an excellent <hi>Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> becauſe ſtudying <hi>Phyſick</hi> he was become ſo excellent a Lawyer.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Being <hi>Phyſician</hi> to his <hi>Sacred Majeſty,</hi> if he were an honeſt man, he would ſtudy his <hi>Profeſsion,</hi> and leave his Law-Suits, and broking in other mens affairs.</p>
            <p n="7">7. 'Tis a great diſcouragement to the <hi>Bench</hi> of <hi>Juſtices,</hi> that when they ſhould ſend a Vagabond to be whipped, His Majeſty ſhould ſend His Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian to cure them.</p>
            <p n="8">8. He is a Knight of the <hi>P.</hi> a common <hi>Affidavit. Man.</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="9">9. He is a Phyſician at the Court, a <hi>Doctor</hi> at the Colledge, a Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee-man, a Militia-man, <hi>John Babre,</hi> and <hi>Jack of all Trades,</hi> Spye to all ſides, a <hi>Plague</hi> to all his Neighbours, and a <hi>Peſtilence</hi> to the whole Town; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we come unto your Honor in the words of <hi>Robert Wiſdom:</hi>
