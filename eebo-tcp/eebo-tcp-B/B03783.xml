            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <p>THe Complainers deſigning to get themſelves in to the Magiſtracy of <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi> and to get Mr. <hi>David Dalrymple</hi> made Conjunct-Clerk with <hi>Aenea' M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>leod,</hi> have raiſed a Reduction before your Lordſhips, of the three laſt ſucceſſive Elections, upon ſeveral pretended Violations of the Set, and concluding further, that the Defenders may be puniſhed in their Perſons and Goods; The which Complaint being given in, and read before your Lordſhips, It was alledged for the Defenders, that there could be no Proceſs for annulling the laſt Election, becauſe all Parties therein concerned were not called, <hi>viz.</hi> Baillie <hi>Chartres,</hi> Baillie <hi>Baird, Michael Allan, George Warrander, Andrew Bruce, John Robertſon, Hugh Blair,</hi> Mr. <hi>Henry Ferguſon, Samuel M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>lellan, Archibald Rule, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander Thomſon, John Pringle, James Crafurd, William Livingſtoun, William Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drum, George Dalgleiſh,</hi> Members of the Counſel of twenty five, whoſe Election cannot ſtand, if the Defenders Election be annulled.</p>
            <p>To which it was Replyed for the Complainers, that the Defenders who are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, are the principal Parties concerned in the Irregularities lybelled, ſo that there was no neceſſity to call any others.</p>
            <p>To which it was Duplyed for the Defenders, that theſe of the Magiſtrats and Council who are not called, tho they cannot be prejudged by any puniſhment, concluded againſt the Defenders in their Perſons or Goods, becauſe it is poſſible they have been leſs active in the late Elections than ſome of the Defenders have been, yet it is impoſſible that the Defenders Election can be reduced, and the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:175704:2"/>
of the other Magiſtrats and Members of Council ſtand in force, tho leſs guilty of Irregularities, ſince all the Informalities lybelled againſt the Election of any of the Defenders, ſtrike likeways at the Election of theſe who are not called, and it is <hi>inauditum,</hi> that parties Rights were ever annulled by a Proceſs to which they were not called, and therefore there can be no Proceſs ſuſtained on the firſt Member of the Concluſion, <hi>viz.</hi> to annul the Defenders Election, till the reſt be called, unleſs the Complainers deſign, that the Election ſhould fall <hi>quoad</hi> theſe who will not vote for them, and ſhould ſtand good <hi>quoad</hi> theſe from whom they expect Friendſhip; And as there can be no proceſs <hi>quoad</hi> the firſt Concluſion againſt the Defenders till the laſt be called, neither can there be any Proceſs <hi>quoad</hi> the ſecond Concluſion of puniſhing the Defenders in their Perſons and Goods, for that is conſequent from, and dependent on the firſt Concluſion, for as long as the Elections are not annulled, the Defenders cannot be puniſhed for their acceſſion thereto.</p>
            <p>Upon this Debate, your Lordſhips before Anſwer thereto, Ordained the hail Cauſe to be debate before your Lordſhips. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon which, the Defenders An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers to the whole pretended Violations lybelled, were read in your Lordſhips preſence.</p>
            <p>After which the Purſuers inſiſted on this head, That albeit your Lordſhips had appointed the two Merchant-Counſellors to vote <hi>proprio jure,</hi> upon a bold and impudent Aſſertion made by the Defenders Advocats, yet theſe two Counſellors were only allowed to Vote as Proxies, ſo that Sir <hi>Archibald Muir's</hi> firſt Election to be Provoſt was unwarrantable, being contrair to your Lordſhips Command, and if theſe two old Counſellors had no Right to Vote <hi>proprio jure,</hi> then the former Election of eight Proxies could not be quarreled by the Defenders on that ground.</p>
            <p>To which it was anſwered for the Defenders, That they opponed their former Anſwers, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>quoad</hi> the two firſt Elections which are now paſt, and the perſons thereby choſen gone out of their Office by courſe, there can be no Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs for annulling theſe Elections, or turning the Magiſtrats out thereof, but the Complainers, if they deſign to prevent any of theſe Informalities in time to come, ought to inſiſt in their Declarator before the Judge competent, which they raiſed an year and a half ago, ſince all the Complainers miſtakes ariſes from their Miſ-interpretation of ſome obſcure paſſages in the Set, which are competent to be explained by the Lords of the Seſſion. 2. Any pretended Informalities in the two laſt Elections, cannot be inſiſted on as grounds to annul the laſt Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, otherways the Magiſtracies of Burghs would be very unſecure for fourty years ſpace, if there were any Errour in the preceeding Elections during that time. 3. As to the pretence inſiſted on, as to the two old Counſellors, which is the Complainers <hi>Achilleum Argumentum,</hi> choſen out by them of the many Informali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties lybelled againſt Sir <hi>Archibald Muir</hi>'s two Elections.</p>
            <p>To this it was Anſwered, That tho the Complainers, according to their wonted modeſty, do ſay, that it was a bold and impudent aſſertion to affirm the old Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant-counſellors had right to Vote <hi>proprio jure,</hi> yet the Defenders do ſtill aſſert, that the old Merchant-counſellors are a part of the Council of 30, which Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of 30 is appointed for Leeting, and which Council of 30 conſiſts of 18 of the new Council and 12 of the old, which 12 conſiſts of the 7 old Magiſtrats, 3 old Merchant-counſellors, and 2 old Tradeſ-counſellors, as appears by the Set <hi>pag.</hi> 5. ſo that in order to the Leeting, no Proxies can be choſen in place of the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:175704:2"/>
old Merchant-counſellors, unleſs they be abſent after they are required to come, and therefore ſince theſe that were old Counſellors were received, and Proxies choſen for the reſt, the Election cannot be quarrelled upon that Informality. 4. By the Books it is clear, that Captain <hi>Baillie</hi> was admitted <hi>proprio jure,</hi> he being deſigned an old Counſellor, &amp; not a Proxie, &amp; that <hi>Patrick Johnſtoun</hi> was admitted as a Proxie, which was done becauſe he had not been an old Merchant-counſellor for the year preceeding, but had been choſen a Merchant-counſellor for that current year, and ſhortly after his being made a Counſellor, he was choſen Baillie of <hi>Leith,</hi> whereby he became to be no Member of the Town Council, and ſo was capable to be choſen a Proxie.</p>
            <p>To this it was Replyed, That the Complainers inſiſt on the Nullities of the firſt two Elections, only in order to annul the laſt, as being done by theſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who had been themſelves illegally elected, and that of all theſe Nullities in the firſt two Elections, they now inſiſted on that anent the two old Merchant-counſellors, who (the Defenders ſay) had right to Vote <hi>jure proprio,</hi> and which was ſo appointed by your Lordſhips, and yet one of them is admitted as a Proxie, for albeit <hi>Patrick Johnstoun</hi> (who according to the Defenders own alledgance the laſt year before your Lordſhips, was an old Counſellor) was allowed to Vote, yet it was <hi>qua</hi> Proxie, and not <hi>proprio jure,</hi> and which the Defenders did of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that he might not have a Vote in the electing of the reſt of the Proxies, which he would have had if he had voted <hi>proprio jure,</hi> &amp; yet neither Captain <hi>Baillie,</hi> nor he did Vote in the Election of Proxies, for the Books bear no ſuch thing.</p>
            <p>To which it was Duplyed for the Defenders, that they Oppone their former Anſwers, bearing, that no informality in the two firſt Elections can be grounds to annul the laſt Election, it being legally carried on. And as to the Article now inſiſted on, the Defenders oppone the expreſs words of the Set, and the uncontroverted cuſtom of the Burgh, to the Complainers ſhameleſs clamour, in calling it a bold and impudent Aſſertion, for this Aſſertion <hi>in jure,</hi> viz. that old Counſellors <hi>jure proprio,</hi> have right to Vote in the Leeting, as being a part of the old Counſel of 12, which with the new Council of 18, makes up the number of 30, no man but the Complainers will controvert, And as to the Aſſertion <hi>in facto,</hi> that Captain <hi>Baillie</hi> and <hi>Patrick Johnſtoun</hi> were both old Counſellors, it was a miſtake in the Lawyers, without any deſign, for Captain <hi>Baillie</hi>'s right <hi>proprio jure</hi> to Vote, had the ſame weight in Law to hinder the Election of Proxies for him, as both Captain <hi>Baillie</hi> and <hi>Patrick Johnſtoun,</hi> being old Counſellors would have had to have hindered Proxies to be choſen for them, for one or two, does not alter the caſe in Law, for there is <hi>idem juris quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ad partem,</hi> as <hi>quoad totum;</hi> and therefore Sir <hi>Archibalds Muirs</hi> Election cannot be quarrelled, becauſe the two old Merchant-Counſellors did not Vote <hi>proprio jure,</hi> ſince <hi>de facto</hi> there was but one of them an old Counſellor, who is preſumed to have Voted accordingly, and the other was choſen as a Proxy, becauſe he was Elected a Counſellor only for that current year, which Counſellors place did vaick ſhortly thereafter, by his being made Baillie of <hi>Leith.</hi> Neither can the Complainers pretend any prejudice, by not admitting the ſaids two perſons to Vote <hi>proprio jure,</hi> ſince the Complainers cannot deny but both their Votes were againſt them in the Leeting &amp; Election; ſo that the Complainers could have no advantage by their Voting in the Proxies, like as <hi>de facto, James Baillie</hi> who was the only old Merchant-Counſellor, is preſumed to have Voted in the Election of Proxies, if he came in before the Proxies were Elected, and if he came not in till
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:175704:3"/>
after the Proxies were Elected, then he had no right to Vote, for Votes of Courts are not reſcinded upon the Incoming of Members thereafter that were not preſent thereat: and it is ſtrange to pretend that Captain <hi>Baillie</hi> did not Vote in the Election of Proxies, becauſe the Books do not bear him to have Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thereto, and that he is not marked in the <hi>Sederunt</hi> of twenty two, ſince he could not be marked in the <hi>Sederunt,</hi> he not being preſent when they ſate down, but being called in thereafter by them, and allowed to Vote as an old Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, in Obedience to your Lordſhips Order, and ſince there is nothing marked in the Books that he deſired a Vote, and was refuſed, it muſt be preſumed that he did Vote to all the Votes that were Voted after he came in, for there is nothing marked expreſly that the twenty two did Vote, and not he.</p>
            <p>Upon this, your Lordſhips appointed the Complainers to inſiſt upon the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olations of the Set Libelled, to have been made at the laſt Election.</p>
            <p>After which the Purſuers inſiſted on this Ground, that <hi>George Stirling</hi> and <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Meinzies</hi> did Vote in the laſt Election, tho they had been more than two years on the Council, without being Office-men, or by vertue of their Office thereon.</p>
            <p>To which it was Anſwered, that <hi>William Meinzies</hi> was choſen Theſaurer at the popular Election, in which he continued till <hi>Martinmaſs</hi> 1690, after which he continued on the Council as old Theſaurer till <hi>June</hi> 1691, at which time he was Elected one of the four old Baillies, in which Station he continued till <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaelmaſs</hi> laſt, and was then choſen old Dean of Guild, and it cannot be denied, but that Theſaurer, old Theſaurer, old Baillie, and old Dean of Guild are Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: And for <hi>George Stirling,</hi> he was by the popular Election choſen Trades-coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellor, wherein he continued till <hi>Michaelmaſs</hi> 1689, and was then choſen Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con of the Chirurgions by his Trade, and Deacon-Conveener by the <hi>Magdalen</hi> Chappel, and a Counſellor by vertue of his Office, as Deacon, by the Town Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, wherein he continued till <hi>Michaelmaſs</hi> 1691, and then was choſen a Trades-Counſellor, whereof there is only one year yet run out; and it is clear by the Set, that a Deacon-Counſellor and a Trades-Counſellor are diſtinct, and that the Set forbids only a Counſellor to continue longer on the Council than two years, unleſs he be an Office-man, or there, by vertue of his Office, and therefore <hi>George Stirling</hi> being there two years by vertue of his Office, as Deacon, and one year as Trades-Counſellor, he has not contraveened that part of the Set, ſince it has been the conſtant Cuſtom for Trades-men to be upon the Council two years as Trades-Counſellors, and two years as Deacon-Counſellors, as appears by the Inſtances given in the Anſwers, and may be given in ſeveral others.</p>
            <p>To which it was Replyed, that it appears by the Set, that there is nothing underſtood by Offices thereby, but Provoſt, Baillies, Dean of Guild, and The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaurer, as appears by the 15 page of the Set, where none are named as Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice-men but the ſeven Magiſtrats, and the words (or by vertue of their Office) is only underſtood of the old Magiſtrats, and therefore <hi>William Meinzies &amp; George Stirling,</hi> who were never preſent Magiſtrats, cannot continue longer than two years on the Council by vertue thereof, for a Deacon is not an Office, and an old Magiſtrat is not an Office, unleſs in the perſon of him who was once a preſent Magiſtrat, and no reſpect can be had to any former Practice which was a Violation of the Set, the Act of the Convention of States appointing all Elections after the popular Election to be according to the Set.</p>

               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:175704:3"/>To which it was duplyed, that it is a groſs miſtake to alledge that by the Set the preſent Magiſtracy is only called an Office, for albeit in the 15 page of the Set the words are (to proceed to the Chooſing of the Leets to the Magiſtrats and Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice-men, ſuch as Provoſt, Baillies, Dean of Gild, and Treaſurer) yet that does not inferr that a Deacon-ſhip is not an Office, for the ſubject treated there is not all Office-men, but Magiſtrats and Office-men who are taxatively expreſt to be by the ſubjoyned Exegeſis, Provoſt, Baillies, Dean of Gild, and Treaſurer; and the Defenders acknowledge that there is a difference betwixt Office-men Simply, and them that are Magiſtrats and Office-men Joyntly: But to take off this Quible as the 10 <hi>page</hi> of the Set appoints none to be more than two years on the Council, except they be Office-men, or by Vertue of their Office; So the 11 <hi>page,</hi> in that ſame Chapter, appoints that none be continued in their <hi>Office</hi> of Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſhip above two years together, ſo that it is undenyable that by the Set, a Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſhip is reckoned an Office, in oppoſition to a ſimple Counſellor, and in Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſtinction to a Magiſtrat; who is both a Magiſtrat and an Office-man Complex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, unleſs the Complainers would have a priviledge to expound the word <hi>Office</hi> other wayes in the 10 <hi>page,</hi> then in the 11 <hi>page;</hi> Becauſe it ſerves their Turn: Likeas their Fancy in expounding (Office to be preſent Magiſtracy, and be vertue of their Office to be old Magiſtracies) is extravagant, for theſe words are exegetick and ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie the ſame thing, ſince an Office-man is on the Council be vertue of his Office, and he that is on the Council by vertue of his Office, muſt be an Office-man; and it is certain that theſe words comprehend the Old and New Magiſtrats, and the Six ordinary Deacons, and excludes only the members of Council New and Old, who are there only as ſingle Counſellors; and it is ridiculous to pretend that one Choſen in place of an old <hi>Baillie,</hi> or an old Dean of Gild, is not als much an Office-man, as he who ſerved the year preceeding in whoſe place he is choſen, an evident in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance whereof is, that a Perſon choſen to be old Dean of Gild, who was never preſent Dean of <hi>Gild,</hi> Judges in the Dean of Gild Court, in abſence of the preſent Dean of Gild, which he could not do, if the old Dean of Gild, as ſuch, were not an Office-man, and therefore <hi>William Meinzies,</hi> his continuing more then three years under four diſtinct ſucceſſive Characters, and <hi>George Stirling</hi> his continuing that Space under two diſtinct Characters, can be conſtructed no violation of the Set, it having been practiſed in the caſes of <hi>William Hamiltoun, Alexander Reid, Thomas Sandilands, John Cunningham, Thomas Kinkaid, James Borthwick, John Miln; Thomas Somervel; Alexander Thomſon, James Cockburn, Michael Gibſon, John Scot,</hi> and others. And which inſtances are adduced to inſtruct a conſtant Cuſtom not contrair to the Set<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but agreeable thereunto, and which Cuſtom ought to expound the Set, if there were any Ambiguity therein as to this point as there is none; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther does the Act of Convention cut off all former Immemorial Cuſtoms, incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the Set; and far leſs theſe Cuſtoms that do Explain and Interpret the meaning threof: for the Act of Convention of Eſtates, was only to regulat the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular Election at that time, which was Judged the only Remedy againſt encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, made by the late Governments upon the priviledge of this Burgh, but no wayes deſigned to Regulat ſubſequent Elections, which the Convention left to be according to Law, without the leaſt thought of Rectifying any Immemorial Cuſtoms, prior to the Incroachments made by the late Governments, which Cuſtoms are indeed a part of the Sett, and conſtitution of the Burgh.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The purſuers inſiſted on that pretence that <hi>William Carſs,</hi> who was one of the eight extraordinary Deacons, was choſen to be one of the Council of Twenty Five, whereby the number of Thirtie Eight Electors, was Abridged, which forc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:175704:4"/>
the Defenders to this abſurdity, that they behoved to Elect <hi>Thomas Campbel</hi> as a Proxie to Vote for <hi>William Carſe</hi> (who was preſent) to make up the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Thirtie Eight.</p>
            <p>To this it was Anſwered. That the Defenders admire how the Complainers In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity allows them to inſiſt on ſo frivolous a Pretence, which is ſo fully taken taken off by the Defenders Anſwers, for the Set putting no Limitation on the Council, to chuſe any free Trades-man to be a Trades-Counſellor, to make up the ordinary Council of twenty five, that a preſent Deacon without doors ſhould be incapable to be advanced from one of the extraordinary Deacons, to be one of the ordinary Council, paſſes the Defenders underſtanding: for ſince all the twenty five of the ordinar Council are conſtituent Members of the Council of thirty eight, what can hinder one of the thirty eight to be advanced to be one of the twenty five; for albeit thereby there be a Vacancy <hi>quoad</hi> one of the thirty eight, that Vacancy has eaſily and frequently been ſupplied, by calling him who was formerly Deacon to Vote in his place, conform to the 19. page of the Set; for it cannot be denied, but that a Perſon who is a Member of a Court by his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice as a Deacon, when he gets an higher Character in that Court, to wit, to be a Trades-Counſellor, his place is Vacant, and he as in the firſt Character of a Deacon is abſent, ſo that his Room muſt be ſupplied, but there is no Proxie to to be choſen for a Deacon Abſent or Dead, only by the Set, the preceeding Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con ſupplies the room that was his, and therefore <hi>Thomas Campbel</hi> did not Vote as Proxie for <hi>William Carſe,</hi> who was preſent, but did ſupply the room of the Deacon of the Fleſhers in the Council of thirty eight, which was Vacant through <hi>William Carſe</hi> his promotion to be a Trades-Counſellor, in the Council of twen-five; and as there is no ſhadow of reaſon to complain of this as a Breach of the Set, which is ſo agreeable thereunto, and has been the conſtant practice hitherto, ſo it is moſt malitious in the Complainers to urge the ſame as a prejudice done to them, ſince both <hi>William Carſe</hi> and <hi>Thomas Campbel</hi> Voted their way againſt the Defenders. And it is admired how the Complainers juſtifie ſome practiſes, <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ho contrair to the Set, becauſe of a long Cuſtom, and yet quarrel theſe practices of the Town Council, which are agreeable both to the Set and Cuſtom: becauſe they fear that they may Obſtruct their preſent Deſign.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Complainers did inſiſt on this pretence, that the Proxies who were cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen the day before to Leet, were thrown out the day of Election, though by the Set, theſe that Leet are to Elect; and as the Parties for whom they are Proxies for Leeting, could not be removed the day of Election, no more could their Proxies be removed that day.</p>
            <p>To which the Defenders oppons their former Anſwers, and the Set, which does not appoint the thirty that Voted to the Leeting, to Vote at the Election with the eight extraordinarie Deacons, but appoints only the thirty of the Old and New Council to Vote with the eight extraordinarie Deacons; and it is ſtrange to pretend, that becauſe an ordinar Member cannot be changed, therefore his Proxie cannot be changed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for Proxies are only choſen to ſupply the abſence of Perſons for that Diet they are called to, and are alterable at the Councils Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as is clear by immemorial Cuſtom: and ſince Leeting and Electing are different things, it is not neceſſarie that he who was Proxie to the firſt, ſhould be Proxie to the ſecond: for then a Perſon who is once a Proxie for a Man, behoved to continue as Proxie for him during all the time of his Office &amp; Abſence. So that if a Baillie ſhould go out of the Country the firſt Month of his Election, and be abſent all that Year, he that were then choſen Proxie for him, behoved to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:175704:4"/>
till the end of that year, which were abſurd, and inconſiſtent with the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorial Cuſtom of changing of Proxies every Diet, and in this particular caſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained on, there were only three Proxies called in the day of Leeting, <hi>viz. George Home</hi> for the old Provoſt, <hi>Alexander Baird</hi> for <hi>Samuel M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>clellan</hi> who was a Merchant-counſellor, and <hi>James Bowdoun</hi> for <hi>George Fullertoun</hi> another Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant-counſellor, which <hi>George Fullertoun</hi> returning the night before the Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, upon the the morrow he Voted <hi>jure proprio</hi> to the Election: Likewayes <hi>George Home</hi> Voted as Proxie for the old Provoſt, ſo that there were none of the Proxies altered but <hi>Alexander Baird,</hi> to whom the then Provoſt ſent an Officer the night before the Election, to intimate to him, that he needed not come the next day to the Council; at which time the Council chuſed <hi>James Bowdoun</hi> Proxie for <hi>Samuel M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>clellan,</hi> ſo that <hi>Alexander Baird</hi> having got intimation the night before, that he was not to be a Proxie to the Election, he could complain of no Incivility, being that day Elected a Baillie.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Complainers inſiſted on this pretence, that the extraordinary Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons were not allowed to Vote at the Election of Proxies, for making up the number of thirty eight Electors, though they were preſent and demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it.</p>
            <p>To which it was anſwered, That the Defenders oppone their former Anſwers and the Set, which appoints, page 19. <hi>That if any of the Provoſt, Baillies and Council be abſent, the rest who are preſent, ſhall chooſe another in their room:</hi> by which word, <hi>Council,</hi> is meaned, the Council of thirty for Leeting, and not the Council of thirty eight for Electing, as appears unanſwerably from this, that that Chapter concerns two diſtinct Points, <hi>viz.</hi> The ſupplying of abſent Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons not of the Council, and the ſupplying the room of the Provoſt, Baillies, and Council: And as to the firſt Point, anent a Deacon not of the Council, his being abſent, it appoints the laſt Deacon, or he that was in the Leet with him, to ſupply his room; So that the Set determines who ſhall ſupply the place of an abſent extraordinary Deacon, without allowing a Proxie to be choſen for him, either by the extraordinary Deacons, or by the ordinar Council, or both: And then it ſays, <hi>If any of the Provoſt, Baillies, or Council be abſent, the rest who are preſent ſhall chooſe;</hi> which <hi>Reſt,</hi> muſt be the reſt of that number, whereof any are abſent, which is of the Provoſt, Baillies and Council in contra-diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to the extraordinary Deacons; and it were unreaſonable, that when there are no Proxies to be choſen for extraordinary Deacons, (and ſo the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Council can have no Vote in chooſing of them) that yet the extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Deacons ſhould have Vote in the Election of Proxies, for repreſenting the Leeters, and which is ſo ſtrange, that it was never heard of till now, that the Complainers zeal has made them find that in the Set, which was never dreamed of before.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The Complainers inſiſted on this Ground, that albeit by the Set it be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, that before they proceed to Elect, there ſhall be an Oath Adminiſtrat to the Electors, that they ſhall chooſe the perſons moſt meet, without Favour, Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, or Colluſion, yet that was refuſed, though it was demanded by <hi>Robert Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood,</hi> and Inſtruments taken thereon.</p>
            <p>To this it was anſwered, That the Defenders oppone their former Anſwers, <hi>viz.</hi> That the pretence is falſe and calumnious, for upon <hi>Robert Blackwoods</hi> making, and inſiſting in that motion, the then Provoſt told the Council, that by their Oath <hi>de fideli,</hi> they were bound to give the Votes of their Conſciences, and that they were to give the ſaids Votes as in the preſence of God; to which they
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:175704:5"/>
all gave their aſſent, and in particular <hi>Robert Blackwood,</hi> who acknowledged, that he was ſatisfied therewith, which is ſufficient to ſatisfie the Set, unleſs there were a difference betwixt aſſenting to give their Votes of their Conſciences in the preſence of God, and ſolemnly proteſting before God; which difference is a niceity more ſuitable to Jeſuitical Philoſophy, than to ſolid Divinity and Law, and that they did aſſent to give the Votes of their Conſciences, as in the preſence of God, it is hoped, is ſufficiently proven by the Inſtrument, and Depoſitions of the Witneſſes adduced.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The Complainers inſiſted on this Ground, That <hi>George Stirling,</hi> and the other perſons mentioned in that Article of the Libel, did enter into a Conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, by ſigning a Paper under their hand, to adhere to Sir <hi>John Hall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which the Defenders repeated their former Anſwer, <hi>viz.</hi> That the ſame was falſe and calumnious.</p>
            <p>After this Debate the Complainers pretending with a great deal of confidence, that all the matters of Fact aſſerted by them, were ſufficiently proven by the Books and Regiſters produced, did Judicially paſs from all Probation by Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes; But there being a Committee appointed by your Lordſhips, for Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining the Defenders Witneſſes, adduced for proving their Libel of Reconven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Complainers did refile, and preſſed to have Witneſſes examined upon ſeveral Points of their Libel, and among the reſt, they urged before the Lords of the Committee, that Witneſſes might be received for proving the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Conſpiracy for adhering to Sir <hi>John Hall,</hi> and contended that the ſame was probable <hi>prout de jure,</hi> by Writ, Witneſſes, or Oath of Party.</p>
            <p>To which it was anſwered, for the Defenders before the Committee, 1. That the Libel being a Combination in Writ, by the Defenders alledged ſigning a Paper to adhere to Sir <hi>John Hall,</hi> is only probable <hi>ſcripto,</hi> becauſe ſuch a Combination without Writ to that purpoſe is no Crime, it being ordinary in the <hi>Magdalen</hi> Chappel, for the Leſſer Part to be concluded by the Major, and to promiſe to Vote in the Council as the Pluralitie did in the Chappel; eſpecially ſeing if any ſuch Paper were produced, it might be a null Paper not probative a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Defenders. 2. That the Combination libelled, was not probable <hi>ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramento partis,</hi> becauſe it is a contravention of the 78. Act of the 14. Parliament <hi>King James</hi> the ſecond, diſcharging any Leagues or Bonds to be made within Burgh, but at the Commandment of the Head-officer, under the pain of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſcation of their Goods, and their Lives to be at the Kings Will: So that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination libelled, being a Capital Crime, or at leaſt Infamie, the Defenders are not holden to Depone thereupon. To which it being Replied before the Committee, 1. That Crimes are probable <hi>prout de jure</hi> eſpeciallie done before many Witneſſes, as this which was done in the <hi>Magdalen</hi> Chappel before the whole Deacons. 2. The Complainers not inſiſting for the Defenders Life and Limb, they are oblig'd to Depone upon the Combination, eſpeciallie Their <hi>Majeſties</hi> Privy Council reſtricting the ſame to an Arbitrary Puniſhment.</p>
            <p>To which it was duplied for the Defenders, to the firſt, That a Crime whereof the Nature is to be in Writ, and without which it will not be a Crime, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be proven but by the Writ, againſt the Nullities whereof the Defenders might object, if it were produced. 2. Perſons by the Claim of Right are not oblig'd to Depone againſt themſelves in Capital Crimes, howſoever the Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be reſtricted; beſides, that Their <hi>Majesties</hi> Privy Council have no ways reſtricted the Puniſhment here, nor would their Declaration prejudge His <hi>Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties</hi> Intereſt, but that his Advocat might thereafter inſiſt before the Juſtices for the ſame Crime.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:175704:5"/>This Debate being reported to your Lordſhips by the Lords of the Committee, your Lordſhips found it probable by Witneſſes. Writ, or Oath of Party, in the Complainers option, whereupon the Complainers paſt from any Probation by Witneſſes of the pretended Combination, and offered to prove the ſame <hi>ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pto, vel juramento partis;</hi> and in order to get the ſame proven <hi>ſcripto,</hi> by production of the pretended Paper, they urged ſix or ſeven of the Defenders, to depone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent the having of the Writ, and fraud fully away-puting the ſame, and theſe Defenders having deponed Negatively, the Complainers urged that they might depone upon the Tenor and Import of the Paper lybelled on, and it being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged for them before the Lords of the Committee, that the Complainers could not make uſe of two manners of Probation, <hi>viz. ſcripto, &amp; juramento partis;</hi> And therefore ſince they had taken themſelves to Probation <hi>ſcripto,</hi> by production of the Paper it ſelf, and in order thereto had forced the Defenders to depone anent their having the ſame, or knowing where it was, they could not now make uſe of the Defenders Oaths for proving of the Tenor of the Paper, which was to prove that Article <hi>juramento partis,</hi> after they had attempted to prove the ſame <hi>ſcripto,</hi> And the Complainers Replying, that this Combination was <hi>peſſimi exempli,</hi> and therefore it ſhould be narrowly lookt into, and ſhould not go uncenſured, tho the Paper cannot be produced, and therefore the Defenders could not refuſe to depone upon the Tenor, ſince every one of their Oaths can only be probative againſt themſelves.</p>
            <p>Upon this the Lords of the Committee appointed the ſaids Defenders to depone upon the Tenor and Import of the Paper libelled. And it being alledged that they were content to depone in the preciſe terms of the Libel, <hi>viz.</hi> that they had ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed no Paper obliging them to adhere to Sir <hi>John Hall,</hi> and the complainers replying that they ought to depone upon the whole Tenor and Import of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Paper, what it was, if it was not oblidgment to adhere to Sir <hi>John Hall,</hi> that the Lords might thereupon Judge what the Paper imported, whereupon the Lords of the Committee appointed ſeveral of the Defenders to depone anent the whole Matter, relating to the ſaid pretended Combination; by whoſe Depoſitions it clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appears, that there was no Paper ſubſcribed by them obliging them, or promiſing that they ſhould adhere to Sir <hi>John Hall,</hi> which they deny in formal terms; but all they depone is, that the <hi>Magdalen</hi>-Chappel having ſplit Votes, the major part being for <hi>James M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>lurg,</hi> the Deponers having voted for Sir <hi>John Hall</hi> were preſt by ſome of the Complainers not to break the Unity of the Chappel, but to be concluded with the Plurality, and to Vote for <hi>James M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>lurg,</hi> whereupon the Deponers then declared, that they had voted according to their Conſciences, and that they were not to blame for the breaking the Unity of the Chappel, becauſe the Deacon-Conveener occaſioned the ſame, by his declaring to them ſome days before, that he would Vote for Sir <hi>John Hall,</hi> encouraging them thereto, by declaring that the Chappel would be equal, and he would give his caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Vote, which Anſwer did not ſatisfie ſome of the Complainers, but they ſtill preſt that the Deponers might either be concluded by the Vote of the Plurality, or elſe that they ſhould be extruded the Chappel, which forced the Depones to ſign a Declaration in their own Vindication, be<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ring, that the Deacon-Conveener decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to them he would be for Sir <hi>John Hall,</hi> and that he himſelf had altered his mind, and now blamed them for Voting for Sir <hi>John,</hi> in which Paper there was no engagement on them to adhere to Sir <hi>John Hall,</hi> nor ſo much as a Declaration of their deſign for whom they would Vote, except their deſign were inferred
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:175704:6"/>
from this, that they had already Voted for Sir <hi>John Hall:</hi> ſo that it is evident and undenyable, that this calumnious Article of the Bond of Combination was libelled on, of deſign to get ſome Shadow and Pretence to make this a Council Proceſs before your Lordſhips, there being no other Article, but what was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent to have been purſued before the Judge ordinar:</p>
            <p>In Reſpect of all which, the Defenders ought to be aſſoilzied from this groundleſs and calumnious Purſuit: and if the leaſt Scruple there anent remain with your Lordſhips, (as is hoped there can be none,) It is humbly deſired, that your Lordſhips would remit the ſame to be diſcuſt ſummarly before the Lords of Seſſion, as was done by your Lordſhips Predeceſſors in the like caſe purſued by ſome of the Neighbours againſt Sir <hi>Andrew Ramſay,</hi> and that in reſpect that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Difficulties ariſing here, are occaſioned by the Complainers Nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Quiblings upon ſome Paſſages of the Set, for detorting the true meaning thereof, and which being Debates anent the point of Right will eaſily be cleared by the Lords of Seſſion.
