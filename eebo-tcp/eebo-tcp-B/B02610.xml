         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE CASE Of Several Thouſands <hi>Concerned and employed in and about the</hi> Importation <hi>and</hi> Working <hi>of</hi> IRON WIRE.</head>
            <p>BY the Statute of 3 <hi>Edw.</hi> 4 <hi>Cap.</hi> 4. Amongſt divers other things, the Importation and Vending of foreign White Iron Thread, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called White-Wire, is prohibited under the Forfeiture thereof. And by the Statute 1 <hi>Rich.</hi> 3. <hi>Cap.</hi> 12. the Importation of all Iron-Wire by Aliens, is prohibited under the like Penalty.</p>
            <p>There are, and always have been ſeveral ſorts of foreign Iron-Wire, known by ſeveral diſtinct Names, which are not Card-Wire, nor called White-Wire; which in all times ever ſince the Statute of 3 <hi>Edw.</hi> 4. have been imported by Denizens, and paid the Duties required by Law, and was never looked upon to be prohibited by the ſaid Statute, as Card-Wire and ſorts finer were.</p>
            <p>The ſeveral ſorts of Iron-Wire, which were larger than Card-Wire, being always imported without Reſtraint, a further Duty therefore was laid upon the ſame, as appears by the Book of Rates, 12 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. and the old Duty of 5 <hi>s. per c.</hi> weight, was advanced to 7 <hi>s.</hi> 6 <hi>d.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Parliament taking notice, that notwithſtanding the ſaid Statute, 3 <hi>Edw.</hi> 4. great Quantities of Card-Wire was imported to the prejudice of the Woolen Manufacture, did by an Act, made the 14th <hi>Car.</hi> 2. <hi>Cap.</hi> 19. reſtrain the importation of any foreign Wool, Cards, or foreign Card-Wire, or Wire for making Cards.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs, the Importation of all other foreign Wire by Denizens, was allowed and practiſed, as appears by the Cuſtom-Houſe-Books, till about Twelve years ſince, one <hi>Conen</hi> a <hi>Dutch</hi>-man (but naturalized) importing ſome ſort of Iron-Wire larger than Card-Wire, under the ſuppoſition that it was imported by an Alien, it was ſeized after the Duty paid; and under Colour of a Verdict: upon the ſaid Seizure, no foreign Wire hath been ſuffered to be imported, to the great impoveriſhment and almoſt ruine, of many Families; the then Proſecutor pretending to furniſh the Traders concerned therein with ſufficient Iron-Wire of his own Manufacture, which he has in no ſort performed: Therefore the Traders and Dealers in Iron-Wire, do humbly offer the Reaſons following, for the Importation of all Wire, except Card-Wire, or Wire of a leſſer ſize.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. Becauſe many neceſſary Trades and Manufactures cannot be carried on, or ſupported without the <hi>Foreign Wire;</hi> the <hi>Engliſh Wire</hi> being of a ſoft, hollow nature, and apt to cleave, is not ſo ſerviceable as the Foreign Wire; the Traders who are chiefly concerned herein, being Tin-Plate-workers, Wire-drawers, Hetchel-makers, for dreſſing Hemp and Flax, Skreen makers for Corn, Braziers, Wire-workers, Hook and Eye-makers, Ship-Lanthorn-makers, Box-makers, Tobacco-Pipe-makers, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others.</item>
               <item>2. Becauſe they have not, nor indeed cannot be in any meaſure ſupplied with Engliſh Wire ſufficient for the ſeveral Artificers concerned therein.</item>
               <item>3. Becauſe, as the Engliſh Wire is not ſo good, nor fit for many Uſes, ſo it is far dearer; the Foreign Wire called Fine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be afforded at 4 <hi>s.</hi> notwithſtanding it pays a fourth peny Cuſtom; when for the Engliſh is exacted 6 <hi>s.</hi> 8 <hi>d.</hi> for the like Size and Quantity. Beſides, thoſe Perſons in whoſe hands the ſole making of all Engliſh Wire remains, taking the advantage of the great neceſſities the poor Handicrafts are in at this time, for want of Wire, have within theſe few days advanced their Engliſh, Wire 5 <hi>l. per Cent.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>4. Becauſe if this Prohibition be continued, their Majeſties will greatly loſe in their Cuſtoms; the Duty upon Foreign Wire, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving formerly yielded about 5000 <hi>l.per annum</hi> Cuſtom, when the Duty was but at 7 <hi>s.</hi> 6 <hi>d. per Cent.</hi> weight.</item>
            </list>
            <list>
               <item>I. <hi>But it may be Objected,</hi> How has this Nation been ſupplied ſince the late Verdict?
<list>
                     <item>
                        <hi>Reſp.</hi> 1. Very great quantities were clandeſtinely imported;  much of which was ſeized and condemned in the Exchequer, and ſold pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly, as may appear by the Cuſtom-Houſe-Officers.</item>
                     <item>2. Great quantities were imported under the Denomination of Steel-Wire, and paid the Duty as ſuch; but theſe private Practices being ſuppreſt, it is now fully evident that the Iron-Wire made in <hi>England,</hi> is not ſufficient to ſupply the Markets.</item>
                  </list>
               </item>
               <item>II. <hi>It may be Objected,</hi> That a large Impoſition will encourage clandeſtine Importations. <list>
                     <item>
                        <hi>Reſp.</hi> The height of the Price of the Engliſh Iron Wire,  above the Foreign Wire, and that being under a Prohibition, and not a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Quantity of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Wire being made, will doubtleſs more encourage, and almoſt neceſſitate Clandeſtine Importa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</item>
                  </list>
               </item>
               <item>III. <hi>It may be Objected,</hi> That if this ſort of Wire be permitted to be imported, it will ruine very many Families, who are ſolely em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd in the making of Wire here in <hi>England.</hi>
                  <list>
                     <item>
                        <hi>Reſp.</hi> 1. There are but about an hundred Perſons in <hi>England</hi> that are employ'd therein, who nevertheleſs cannot want Work, though this Permiſſion be granted.</item>
                     <item>2. Whereas there are now employ'd not above 100 Men in manufacturing the rough <hi>Engliſh</hi> Wire <hi>(it being made by Water Engines)</hi> there are at leaſt an hundred times the Number employed in drawing Card-Wire by hand, and other neceſſary Uſes of Iron-Wire, who will equally be employ'd by the foreign rough Iron-Wire, as by the <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
                     </item>
                  </list>
               </item>
               <item>IV. <hi>It may be Objected,</hi> That it will extremely lower the Price of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Wire, to the great diſencouragement of the Dealers therein.<list>
                     <item>
                        <hi>Reſp.</hi> If a Duty of 15 <hi>s. per cent.</hi> or more be impoſed upon it(as generally all dealers in Wire would be very well contented with, rather than be without it) it will keep up the Price of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Wire, and thereby gratifie the Dealers therein: As alſo be a great Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation to all the Manufactors and Traders in that Comodity. Beſides that it will advance their Majeſties Cuſtoms at leaſt 10 or 12000 <hi>l. per Annum.</hi>
