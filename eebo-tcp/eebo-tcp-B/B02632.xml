            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Deplorable CASE OF THE Poor Sufferers, by that Army Disbanded by the Four Commiſſioners, in the Year <date>1679</date>.</head>
            <p>WHich is the ſad Caſe, Condition and Cry of many Fatherleſs and Widows, and many who are ſadly diſtreſſed in Priſon; with many others who are in great Miſery, and under very commiſerating Circumſtances, being ready to periſh for want of that Money which is due unto them, upon Disbanding the Army, which was Raiſed by Act of Parliament in 1677, for an Actual War (as by the Act appears) againſt the <hi>French</hi> King; And after the Treaty at <hi>Nimeguen,</hi> (being ſent for Over) was Disbanded by another Act of Parliament in 1679, by Colonel <hi>John Birch,</hi> Colonel <hi>Roger Whitley,</hi> and others, Commiſſioners, who (upon ſtating the Accompts) gave Debentures, and (thereby) the Lords Commiſſioners of His Majeſties Treaſury gave Orders on the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer (being enjoined thereunto by the ſaid laſt Act) for Payment thereof: But the Money given by Act of Parliament (by reaſon of paying Intereſt and Gratuities to the Soldiers according to the ſaid Act) falling ſhort what was due, ſome were paid, and others who had as much Right were not paid.</p>
            <p>It is humbly offered to Conſideration as followeth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That this is a Debt occaſioned by Act of Parliament, and had there been Money enough raiſed by the Disbanding Act, it had been paid; and it is not to be doubted in the leaſt, but the Honour and Wiſdom of Parliament will pay what is the Kingdoms Debt, that ſo for the future there may be Encouragement given for Credit on the like Account if Occaſion ſhall require.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Being ſome have been paid already, it's humbly hoped it will be eſteemed but equal Juſtice to pay others who have as much Right, and have had Debentures, and Orders given them, by the ſame Authority as others received their Principal and Intereſt, upon the Credit of that Act for Disbanding.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> If a way was endeavoured the laſt Parliament to pay Widows and Orphans what is due to them from the <hi>Chamber of London,</hi> It is humbly hoped that this Honourable Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament will not be leſs kind to the Concerned in this Caſe, but firſt to find out ſome way (in this ſad and direful Condition) to pay what is the Kingdoms Debt, for want whereof ſeveral have already, and many more are like to periſh.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> And in regard the Money upon the Disbanding Act was raiſed by a Land Tax, and fell ſhort to anſwer the End thereof, It is moſt humbly ſubmitted to Conſideration, Whether it may not be raiſed ſo again; And then it's certain (by the Report made by a Committee the firſt Seſſion of laſt Parliament, there being but <hi>108588 l.</hi> due, and a Reſolve of the Houſe, <hi>(Nemine Contradicente)</hi> upon reading the Report, to take it into Conſideration next Sitting after the Receſs) that <hi>4 d. per Pound</hi> for a Year on Land, to be paid <hi>1 d.</hi> Quarterly; and <hi>2 s.</hi>on <hi>100 l.</hi> Stock to be paid <hi>6 d.</hi> Quarterly, will pay it. But if it be not thought conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient to raiſe it this way, Then a reaſonable Impoſition on <hi>Foreign Iron, Salt, Oils, Sope, Drugs, Raiſins, Indico,</hi> and <hi> Dying Wood,</hi> for two Tears will do it; and if any thing be over, it may be paid to the KING.</p>
            <p>And now, with grief of Heart, having ſhewed the miſery of the Concerned herein; the Cauſe of it, for want of raiſing Money enough on the Disbanding Act, and the means (with all humble Submiſſion) how to help them:</p>
            <p>Your Compaſſion, and utmoſt Aſſiſtance herein, Is humbly prayed by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, that thereby they may be Relieved, and kept from utter Ruin;</p>
            <closer>And ſo they ſhall be ever bound to pray for your Honours Health and Proſperity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
