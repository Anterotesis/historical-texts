            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <p>THE ſaid <hi>Alexander Hamiltoun</hi> of <hi>Kinkel</hi> having given in two Petitions to his Grace, and the Honourable Eſtates of Parliament, the one whereof was General, and the other Special condeſcending upon the Right and perſon, in relation to which the clauſe in the General act anent preſcriptions is craved to be extended. <hi>Kinnal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die</hi> gives in a Petition by way of anſwer, wherein he repreſents, that the Right of Woodſet condeſcended upon in <hi>Kinkels</hi> ſecond Information was Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed; But that not being <hi>hujus loci,</hi> all that I ſhall ſay, is, that it was no other wayes Redeemed than by elicting upon Death-bed, the Diſcharge and rennonciation condeſcended upon in my ſecond Petition, and that for no Oner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous cauſe, as ſhall be made appear in due time.</p>
            <p>In the nixt place, he gives particular reaſons why the deſire of my Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſhould be refuſed; And 1 <hi>mo.</hi> Becauſe there being a Reduction of the ſaid Right depending before the Lords of Seſſion, who are Judges competent. It is impracticable to anticipat their Deciſions when the parties concerned are not called.</p>
            <p>To which it is Anſwered, that the Authority of King and Parliament is Soveraign, and cannot be declined, nether is it impracticable or unuſual for that Honourable Court to re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ing conſequences thereof<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that either by General, or ſpecial Acts, and without any regard, whither the ſame by conſequence, may be prejudicial to cauſes depending before the Lords of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion or not; And even without Citation, or hearing of parties, which was impoſible by reaſons of the vaſt number of Donators, and ſuch others, and alſo was needleſs, in regard that by ſuch a Reſtitution againſt the Injuſtice of Arbitrary Power, no particular perſons Right was directly impugned; And it is clear by the General Act anent Fines and Forefaulturs, and ſeveral par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Acts in favours of Forefaulted perſons, for repetition of the bygone Rents of their Lands; And the King and Parliament are the only competent Judges in many ſuch caſes, in reſpect the Lords of Seſſion, and other inferior Judges being more ſtrictly oblidged to the Letter of Law, are not capable to give perſons oppreſſed a Juſt and full redreſs.</p>
            <p>Although it is humbly conceived, that in this caſe, the Grounds of Comon Law would ſtop the courſe of preſcription while <hi>Kinkel</hi> was <hi>non valens agere,</hi> if the mentioning of ſhorter preſcriptions only in the foreſaid clauſe of the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral act did not make the caſe more doubtful, although it is very probable that there being the ſame reaſon of equity for diſcounting the foreſaid years of oppreſſion in long preſcriptions, that the mentioning of ſhorter preſcriptions was not intended by way of Reſtriction; But becauſe there was greater ground to doubt as to them, or becauſe theſe ſhort Preſcriptions were only under the Parliaments view, as a caſe wherein greater numbers of people might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, and therefore <hi>Kinkel</hi> has good ground to apply to the Parliament for explaining, &amp; extending the ſaid Clauſe; and alſo <hi>Kenaldies</hi> complaint of this
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:175406:2"/>
method as ſingular as groundleſs, eſpecially ſeeing the ſame was actually done in a caſe betwixt the Earl of <hi>Airly</hi> and Sir <hi>John Damſter,</hi> and that there is the ſame Reaſon in long and ſhort preſcriptions, as ſaid is; As alſo, ſeeing <hi>Kinkel</hi> was obliedged to make a particular Condeſcendance, to the effect <hi>Kinaldy</hi> might give in his Anſwers, which he has accordingly done, and which ſupplies the want of a Citation.</p>
            <p>To the ſecond Reaſon it is anſwered; It is moſt groundleſs for <hi>Kinaldy</hi> to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadge, <hi>That Kinkel delayed to inſiſt in this Proceſs, until he was ſure of the Death of his Witneſſes inſert in the Renounciation.</hi> Seeing 1<hi>mo.</hi> The true Reaſons of delay, were his bad Circumſtances the time, and becauſe <hi>Kinkels</hi> papers, when his houſe was Gariſoned were robbed, and he could not have acceſs to them, until a little before the intenting of the ſaid Reduction, as alſo he is clear to depone that he never ſaw the ſaid Renounciation, nor knew any manner of way who were the witneſses inſert therein. 2<hi>do. Kinkel</hi> has proven his reaſon of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction, <hi>ex capite Lecti</hi> by witneſses yet living, &amp; beyond all exception. 3<hi>tio.</hi> As <hi>Kinkel</hi> could not then foreſee ſuch a happy Change by which he might Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect more impartial Juſtice. So no man can imagine, he would have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered preſcripion to run againſt him, If he had been in the leaſt Meaſure <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lens agere;</hi> And where it is alledged there was nothing to hinder <hi>Kinkel</hi> from intenting this Reduction dureing the Lifetime of his brother in Law, Judge <hi>Kerr.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is Anſwered, that as <hi>Kinkel</hi> was then ſtated with <hi>Kinaldy</hi> inſtigat the Arch-Biſhop to perſecute him, and took from the Biſhop the gift of his Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheat about the time he was under an Proceſs of excumunication, and <hi>Kinkel</hi> being ingadged to <hi>Kinaldy</hi> upon the account of Cautionrie, and under ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar execution for ſeveral ſumms, and further his affairs being otherwiſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed: It is a frivolus inference from <hi>Kinkels</hi> for bearing in ſuch an unfavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Junctur to ingadge in a tedious and expenſive purſuit to conclude that he was conſcious of the injuſtice of the Plea, Eſpecially conſidering that he knew there were 20 Years of the Preſcription then to run during which ſpace, and at any time therein he might have purſued as certainly he would have done, If he had not been Debared by the Legal incapacity the violence of the time brought him under.</p>
            <p>To <hi>Kinaldies</hi> 3d reaſon, it is Anſwered, he thereby clearly Inſinuats which he expteſly confeſſes in other parts of his Petition, That he has no other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence to appone to <hi>Kinkels</hi> juſt claime: But that of preſcription which being in it ſelf a little not very favourable, is in this particular caſe wherein a great number of theſe years ran againſt <hi>Kinkel</hi> when he was <hi>non valens agere,</hi> as ſaid is moſt odious and unjuſt, and therefore no regard ought to be had to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation he makes of the great loſs he will ſuſtain by reponing of <hi>Kinkel,</hi> Seing on the other hand <hi>Kinkel</hi> has lyen under the preſſure of the ſaid loſs ever ſince the granting of that renounciation, and if <hi>Kinaldy</hi> be involved in 60 Thouſand Merks becauſe he is forced to teſtore to <hi>Kinkel</hi> a part of his own which he has ſo long Poſſeſſed upon an invalid tittle neither <hi>Kinkel</hi> nor the judges are to blaime.</p>
            <p>And as to his alledgance, That if there had been any Juſt grounds for <hi>Kinkels</hi> claming this Summs he would have objected it by way of compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation in ſeveral purſuits at <hi>Kinaldies</hi> Inſtance againſt him, and would certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have mentioned it when he diſponed his other lands to <hi>Kinaldy</hi> in ſatisfact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion of theſe Debts; as alſo when <hi>Kenaldy</hi> obtained Decreets of General and ſpeciall Declarator of <hi>Kenkels</hi> ſingle and Lifere<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t Eſcheat.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:175406:2"/>It is anſwered. That theſe purſuits were for liquid debts and could not be compenced by the ſumms contained in this Woodſet, until <hi>Kinkel</hi> had firſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a Reduction of the foreſaid Renunciation, and after that he had intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a proceſs of Compt and Reckoning, and thereby ſtated a Liquid ſumm due by <hi>Kinaldy</hi> upon the account of the Woodſet; which being a long and expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive proceſs: It is clear the ſame could not be ſoon diſcuſſed as to furniſh <hi>Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kel</hi> with a defence of Compenſation againſt <hi>Kinaldies</hi> more ſummar purſuits, as alſo theſe very purſutes which <hi>Kinaldy</hi> did rigorouſly and unmercifully pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute againſt <hi>Kinkel</hi> with the bad circumſtances he was under the time by the Biſhop of St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> his perſecution did reduce <hi>Kinkel</hi> to ſo great Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity: That he was hardly able to maintain his Family with Bread, and no wonder if at that time <hi>Kinkel</hi> thought it not fit to engadge in tedious and expenſive proceſſes, Eſpecially conſidering that at that ſame time under a proceſs of Excommunication at the Arch-Biſhop <hi>Sharp</hi>'s inſtance, at which time <hi>Kinkels</hi> Eſcheat was gifted to <hi>Kinaldy,</hi> who joined with the Biſhop in perſecuting <hi>Kinkel,</hi> in the redeeming whereof it was upwards of 3500 Merks, during which ſeverities <hi>Kinkel</hi> was forced to remove from his own houſe to live at a great diſtance from the Biſhop, and was ſhortly after denunced fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive by the Lords of His Majeſties Privy Council for not compearing when ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for Eccleſiaſtick Non-Conformity, and it is eaſie to judge if <hi>Kinkel</hi> under ſuch circumſtances had great Encouragement to enter into an expenſive pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs againſt one ſo well ſtated as <hi>Kinaldy</hi> was at that time, for the ſtories <hi>Kinal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die</hi> tells of his own ſufferings, I ſhall not trouble His Grace and this Honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Court with the true account of the Matter of fact, which would be little to <hi>Kinaldies</hi> Credit, only it is clear he was not fined for refuſing to be a <hi>Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia</hi> Captain; But on the contrar did accept and exerciſe that Imployment though indeed he was fined ſome time after for having cowardly deſerted when there was Appearance of Action.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Kinaldies</hi> fourth Reaſon for refuſing the deſire of my Bill is, That during the time of <hi>Kinkels</hi> Confinement to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and when he was ſo much as under a Denounciation or intercomuning, he might have raiſed a Summonds &amp; given a Citation, which would have ſtopped Preſcription, and that in the year 1684 the time of <hi>Kinkels</hi> pretended intercommuning, he did advocat a Cauſe at <hi>Kinaldies</hi> inſtance againſt him, and did ſeveral other Acts.</p>
            <p>It is anſwered, 1<hi>mo.</hi> I am not ſeeking Deduction of any years wherein I was only confined, but only during my intetcommuning and Inditement. 2<hi>do:</hi> It is denyed that in the year 1684. I was <hi>valens agere,</hi> it is true indeed that <hi>Kinaldy</hi> having at that time raiſed a Proceſs againſt me &amp; my Tenents, an Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation was exped in their Name, which could not have been in my own, ſeeing being denounced and intercommuned, no Lawyers could at my inſtance have mannadged that, or any other Proceſs, as alſo I had not <hi>perſonam ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di in Judicio</hi> upon the accounts foreſaid.</p>
            <p>It is further repreſented for me, that <hi>Kinaldie</hi> is ungenerous, ſo frequently to mention my debts, ſeeing the other Eſtate belonging to my brother who granted that renounciation in favours of <hi>Kennaldy</hi> was tranſmitted to me with the Burden of the ſaid debts.</p>
            <p>And ſeeing by the grounds of the common Law, and upon the ſame reaſon that his Majeſties Commiſſioner for the time, and the Honourable Eſtates of Parliament, reponed perſons leſed againſt ſhorter preſcriptions, they ought alſo to be reponed againſt long preſcriptions; And ſeeing <hi>Kinkel</hi> is able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pone<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
