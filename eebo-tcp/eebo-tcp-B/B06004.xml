            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <lg>
               <l>A Miſs who near <hi>London</hi> did ſet up her Trade,</l>
               <l>And whilſt ſhe did uſe it, ſome projects ſhe play'd,</l>
               <l>Amongſt all the reſt, here is one I declare,</l>
               <l>The like of this humour you ſeldom did hear.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>As ſhe was a ranging along in the ſtreet</l>
               <l>I Ganting brave Gallant the chanced to meet;</l>
               <l>His Coat was of Velvet, a Sword by his ſide,</l>
               <l>He feared no dangers, whatever betide.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>This Gallant no ſooner had fired his Eyes</l>
               <l>Open her fair Beauty, but ſtraight he replyes,</l>
               <l>She give thee a <hi>Guinea,</hi> ſo I man enjoy</l>
               <l>Thoſe tender embraces; ſweet Love be not cay.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>To ſeal this kind promiſe, he gave her a kiſs;</l>
               <l>O fie, fie, forbeat Sir, what mean you by this?</l>
               <l>Your words are ſo winning, I grant your demand,</l>
               <l>That Damſel is able your force to withſtand.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>They ſtraight ſtruck a'bargain and made no delay,</l>
               <l>To her habitation they poſted away,</l>
               <l>Where with her old Mother this Miſs ſhe did dwell;</l>
               <l>Now liſten, i'le tell you what after befel.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>A Dinner of Dainties then ſtraight did prepare,</l>
               <l>For their jovial paſtime, no charges they'd ſpare;</l>
               <l>But yet I muſt tell you, it ſoon came to paſs,</l>
               <l>Tho' they found the meat, yet he paid for the ſawce.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>For Claret, Canary, he freely did call,</l>
               <l>To ſhow himſelf noble, he'd pay for it all;</l>
               <l>And thus he appeared moſt jovial and free,</l>
               <l>They all were as merry as merry might be.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>They ply'd him with Bumpers, which he ne'r deny'd</l>
               <l>And likewiſe with other ingredients beſide,</l>
               <l>They gave him in order, his courage to rool,</l>
               <l>Which quickly did make him as wiſe as a tool,</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>This Liquor up into his Doddle did creep,</l>
               <l>So that in ſhort time they had laid him to ſleep;</l>
               <l>His Reaſon and Senſes was perfectly fled,</l>
               <l>With their ſubtile Doſes, as if he were dead.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Then, then they went on with their riſling trade,</l>
               <l>And of this brave Gallant a Booty then made,</l>
               <l>He had ſtore of Silver, both Guineas and Kings,</l>
               <l>His Watch and Broad-Pieces, and other rich things.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Thus while he was ſleeping they ſtript off his Cloaths</l>
               <l>His Hat, Wigg and Cravat, his Shirt Shoes &amp; Doſe;</l>
               <l>Then being as naked as e're he was born,</l>
               <l>In other Apparrel they did him adorn.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>A courſe Nempen Smock they did put him on there,</l>
               <l>One which the old Woman was uſed to wear;</l>
               <l>A red Petticoat, with a Coif on his Pate,</l>
               <l>Then he was array'd at a not able rate.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>They put him into a great Cheſt that ſtood there,</l>
               <l>And made a ſmall hole for to let in the air;</l>
               <l>So great was the kindneſs which to him they ſhow'd,</l>
               <l>They called a Porter to take up this load.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>This Gallant had told them he had at <hi>Graveſend,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>An Uncle who was his particular Friend;</l>
               <l>And therefore to <hi>Billingſgate</hi> they did repair,</l>
               <l>And hir'd a Boat-man to carry him there.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>As ſoon as the Cheſt was ſet ſafe in the Boat,</l>
               <l>To the Waterman they delivered a Note,</l>
               <l>And bid him be careful his truſt to diſcharge,</l>
               <l>He vow'd he wou'd do it, their pay being large.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But now at the laſt comes the cream of the jeſt,</l>
               <l>He knew not what treaſure he had in the Cheſt,</l>
               <l>Until at <hi>Graveſend</hi> he had ſet him on thoſe,</l>
               <l>Then, then he awaken'd and never before.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>It was about twelve of the Clock in the night,</l>
               <l>They call'd up his Uncle to ſee this ſtrange fight;</l>
               <l>Thered Petticoat, with a Copf on his Crown,</l>
               <l>With wonder and laughter did fill the whole town.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>With grief, ſhame and ſorrow his Heart it did bleed,</l>
               <l>Next day up to <hi>London</hi> he rid with all ſpeed;</l>
               <l>His Cloaths, Watch and Guineas, in hopes to obtain,</l>
               <l>For tho' he did ſeek her, it was but in bain.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The Miſs had no ſooner committed this Crime,</l>
               <l>She ſhifted her Lodging, it being high time;</l>
               <l>Therefore this young Gallant muſt patiently bear</l>
               <l>His loſs, for'to find her he could not tell where.</l>
