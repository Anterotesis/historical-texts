            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Copy of a LETTER FROM THE FRENCH KING TO KING JAMES In Anſwer to one from him.</head>
            <head type="sub">Tranſlated from the <hi>French</hi> Copy.</head>
            <p>YOUR Majeſty ſeems to be too ſenſibly Afflicted with the late Diſaſter of our Fleet; the Diſappointment we muſt confeſs was unexpected and Surprizing, &amp; has occaſion'd no ſmall Interruption in the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures we had taken: But however the ſevere Application that you have made, by imputing that unhappy Accident to the ill Fortune that attends your Affairs ſince you betook your ſelf to our Protection, we cannot admit of, much leſs can we allow the Conſequence which you ſeem to imply, and which your Friends are apprehenſive of, that the Blame of that Diſappointment ſhould, in our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, any wayes affect your Majeſty.</p>
            <p>The Miſtaken Informations you receiv'd from your Dependents in great <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,</hi> we are ſenſible were no otherwiſe repreſented to us by your Majeſty, than as they were firſt communicated to you; the ill Succeſs whereof ſhall be ſo far from obliging us to withdraw our Protection from you, that it has only added Vigor to our Endeavours, to repair by Land the Misfortune we have ſuſtain'd at Sea. The Glory and Grandure of the <hi>French</hi> Nation has been too well eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, to be ſhaken by one Storm.</p>
            <p>The Succeſs we may reaſonably expect from the Siege of <hi>Namur,</hi> will be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient at leaſt to Ballance the Inſulting Hopes of our Enemies: We are already Maſters of the Town, and have no reaſon to deſpair (if the Aſſurances given us by <hi>Vauban</hi> may be rely'd upon) of a Proſperous Progreſs from ſo formidable Forces as are now employ'd in that Service.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, the Account of the Surrender of Great <hi>Waradin</hi> comes ſomething un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonable, but we hope the Conſequence is too remote, to affect the Enterpriz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of our Summers Campaign on this ſide, upon which the Fortune of the War ſeems to depend.</p>
            <p>We hope to perſwade our People, that the Deſcent which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſeem to threaten upon our Coaſt, is rather an Ammuſement than any awayes Practica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. There are ſome about us (and with whom our moſt Important Councils are concenred) who appear apprehenſive in caſe of a Deſcent, or any other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rode into our Kingdom of <hi>France,</hi> that it may occaſion a Revolt amongſt our Subjects. But we preſume the <hi>Diſcipline</hi> we have <hi>uſed,</hi> has not been ſo ill beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as to admit of any ſuch Rebellious Practice. Our Subjects are <hi>French men,</hi> and we have taken care <hi>to make them Catholicks,</hi> who will not eaſily learn the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticall Diſtinction between Revolt and Rebellion.</p>
            <p>The Requeſt which you make of retiring from our Kingdom, we cannot at this time hearken to. The late Obſticles in our Affairs, upon which you ſeem to ground your Propoſal, is an irrefragable Argument for our with-holding our Conſent: Foraſmuch as it would be looked upon by all the World, as well Friends as Enemies, that we want either Inclination or power to protect you, which would be unſuitable to our Character, and inconvenient for the preſent poſture of Affairs.</p>
