            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>Nor did the way of Banking better ſpeed,</l>
               <l>To them who did with Paper-Credit meet;</l>
               <l>Their Bags were made their Moneys Winding-ſheet.</l>

               <l>If by Complaint they thought their grief t' aſſwage,</l>
               <l>'Twas but increas'd, and often laught at too;</l>
               <l>Nor did their loſs and miſery ſtop here,</l>
               <l>They'r Jail'd at laſt for buying Wit ſo dear.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>This made the Money-monger hide his Gold,</l>

               <l>Leſt he might ſhare in others fate, when old;</l>
               <l>Therefore reſolves it ſhall not ſee the Sun.</l>
               <l>This quickly brought Conſumption to all Trade</l>
               <l>And many a thouſand Bankerupt was made.</l>

               <l>Anticipate their Life, the Gallows ſome:</l>
               <l>Nor could you ſtep without your Doors but ſee</l>

               <l>What's the Obſtruction 'tis not ſo elſewhere?</l>
               <l>Is it becauſe Men love to do amiſs,</l>

               <l>Then be perſwaded, try for once Concluſion,</l>
               <l>Dare to be honeſt, 'tis beſt Policy;</l>
               <l>All other Projects have but wrought Confuſion,</l>
               <l>Affix your Lands but in a Regiſtry:</l>
               <l>This honeſt Credit anſwer will your End,</l>
               <l>Sooner, and cheaper than the Scriblers Friend.</l>
            </lg>

               <l>This brings out all the Money un-imployed,</l>

               <l>For none will keep his Money in his Cheſt</l>
               <l>When 'twill be ſafer here, with Intereſt.</l>

            <lg>
               <l>The very Servants will their Wages bring,</l>
               <l>Which they moſt dearly earn, but can't augment;</l>
               <l>And 'midſt their greateſt drudgery will ſing,</l>
               <l>When they have Lodg'd it to their hearts content.</l>
               <l>Both <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Joan</hi> will lay up all they may,</l>
               <l>Where't may be doubled 'gainſt a Rainy-day.</l>

               <l>Whence they may pick and chuſe, and Husbands take,</l>
               <l>Will love them dearly for their Moneys ſake.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But above all, from hence will flow a Bank</l>

            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>This they pretend, becauſe they bear a ſtock,</l>
               <l>Which the poor Trades-man can by no means do,</l>
               <l>Nor never ſhall he by your bit and knock,</l>
               <l>When all his profit doth redound to you.</l>
               <l>But here's a Salve that cure will this Sore,</l>
               <l>He ſhall have Money on't to pay his Score.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The honeſt Farmer alſo here will find</l>

               <l>His Landlord may be needy, or unkind,</l>
               <l>His Rent is wanting, though his Barns are full.</l>

               <l>Ingage it here, and ſo 'twill anſwer both.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>This will prevent the Law-leſs Maſſie Bill,</l>
               <l>Pretending Law, though in a Tyrants hand,</l>
               <l>And keep us quiet ſore againſt their will,</l>
               <l>Who ſwarm like Fleſh-Flies all about the Land:</l>
               <l>A ſort of Vermin haunting every Village,</l>
               <l>That do their Food from Country People pillage.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The Widow alſo, and the Fatherleſs,</l>
               <l>Whoſe Fortune's often left i'th hands of truſt,</l>
               <l>By his default are oft made Penny-leſs;</l>
               <l>And then poor Souls they all a-begging muſt.</l>
               <l>Thus e're the good Man's cold within his Grave,</l>
               <l>His Children's ruin'd by this Truſtee Knave.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The Regiſtry will hinder this abuſe</l>
               <l>Done to poor Infants when their Friends are gone,</l>
               <l>If but incerted here unto their uſe,</l>
               <l>'Twill be ſecured unto every one.</l>
               <l>Hark, and be wiſe, ye tender Fathers all,</l>
               <l>Prevent the Cheats may on your Children fall.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Here could I add above an hundred more</l>
               <l>That would be happy by this honeſt Deed;</l>
               <l>For every one I named there's a ſcore</l>
               <l>Would find relief and comfort at their need:</l>
               <l>Defending thouſands from the Priſons ill,</l>
               <l>And with cheap Bread the hungry Bellies fill.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Therefore in brief acquit your ſelves like thoſe</l>
               <l>True <hi>Engliſh-men</hi> who Vertue did imbrance,</l>
               <l>No longer be a Prey unto your Foes,</l>
               <l>But let them know you'r of that Noble Race</l>
               <l>That ſcorn ſuch Actions might diſhonour bring</l>
               <l>Unto themſelves, their Country, or their King.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Now to conclude, let all of loyal mind</l>
               <l>Humbly beſeech the King and Parliament,</l>
               <l>That of their goodneſs they would be ſo kind</l>
               <l>To paſs this Act our Ruines may prevent,</l>
               <l>Grant <hi>England</hi> may a Regiſtry but have,</l>
               <l>None need to fear the double-dealing Knave.</l>
