            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>ANSWERS for Colonel Sir JOHN HILL, Leiutenent Colonel JOHN FORBES, and JOHN FORBES Writer in <hi>Edinburgh.</hi> TO <hi>The Petition preſented be</hi> Allan Cathcart, James Meinzies, <hi>and</hi> Thomas Hamiltonn, <hi>late Captains of the ſaid Colonel</hi> Hill's Regiment.</head>
            <p>WHereas the Petitioners alledge, That the ſaids Colonel his Leiutenant Colonel, and <hi>John Forbes</hi> as Agent for the Regiment, uplifted the Regiments full Pay, and as yet has not compted for a great part thereof, as to the Petitioners proportions, <hi>qua</hi> Captains for themſelves and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies; And therefore craving Compt and Payment of what is juſtly due to them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Anſwerd, That <hi>1mo.</hi> The Petition and Deſire thereof is unintelligible, and impracticable to give Obedience to what is thereby craved; In reſpect that the Petitioners their Claim is altogether indefinit and illiquid, not condeſcending upon the Commencement of their Service, and Endurance thereof, nor upon the particular Summs due to them, and yet unpayed. So that <hi>eſto</hi> The Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons Complained of, were charged with Horning in the Terms of this Petition, they ſhould not know what Summ to pay, or how to give Obedience. And that therefore the Petitioners <hi>ante omnia</hi> ought to be ſpecial in their Claims, whereby it would appear, that they have no ground to creat your Lordſhips or Others this Trouble, ſummarly by ſuch a Clamorous Bill.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2do. Eſto</hi> the Petitioners were Special in their Claim, and the Colonel and Others, duely Cited, yet neither he nor his Leiutenent Colonel. or Agent would be found Lyable to the Petitioners. For <hi>1mo. John Forbes</hi> the Agent is Comptable only to the Colonel; By whoſe Orders, he Diſpenſes the Regiments Money, and makes payment to the Reſpective Companies, and other uſes of the Regiment, and accordingly he has ſo done, as <hi>per</hi> the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonels laſt Diſcharge in <hi>April</hi> by paſt, for all the ſaid <hi>John</hi> his Intromiſſions with the Regiments Money, preceeding <hi>March</hi> 1698. <hi>2do.</hi> As to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel, he oppones theſe very Petitioners, their Diſcharges of their full pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for themſelves, Subalterns and Companies to the ſaid <hi>John Forbes,</hi> for the Moneth of <hi>February</hi> laſt, and all proceedings. In contemplation where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and of the like Diſcharge from every Captain and perſon elſe Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Collonel did give him the ſaid General Diſcharge; So that the Petitioners having Acknowledged their full payment, as ſaid is, they were in the wrong to preſent any ſuch Petition.</p>
            <p>And <hi>3tio. Quoad</hi> the Leiutenent Collonel, the Petitioners doe moſt Injuriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Acclaime any thing of him; Not only becauſe of their ſaids Generall Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charges that outerly preclude them every manner of way, But likewiſe that the Lieutenent Collonel medles not farder then to Receive what is due to himſelf, from the Agent by the Collonels order, and accordingly he has Acknowledged himſelf payed, as <hi>per</hi> his Generall Diſcharge, alſo to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent for all by gones preceeding the beginning of <hi>March</hi> laſt. And ſeeing there can be no nothing more Injurious then to Load Mens Reputations with your Lordſhips, as alledged Guilty of keeping up the Petitioners Pay, while the Contrair Appears, by the Evident Demonſtration aforeſaid.</p>

            <postscript>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is Humbly Hopt your Lordſhips will Refuſe the deſire of the Petitioners Bill with a Repremand, for not better minding their ſaids Diſcharges, and good Offices done them by ſo Obliging a Colonel, as they knew from ther Experience; Sir</hi> John Hill <hi>was to all his Officers and them in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.</hi>
