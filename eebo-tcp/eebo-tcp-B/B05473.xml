         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Foraſmuch, as We and Our Eſtates of Parliament, by ſeveral Acts, have (upon diverſe weighty conſiderations,) diſcharged the Importation of all <hi>Iriſh</hi> Victual and Cattel into this Kingdom, under the pains, and certifications therein contained: And whereas the Lords of Our Privy Council have emitted ſeveral Acts and Proclamations in purſuance of the ſaids Acts of Parliament, notwithſtanding where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and of all the care and endeavours taken, to hinder and prevent the importing of <hi>Iriſh</hi> Victuall and Cattel, finding the ſame is imported into this Kingdom: And conſidering the beſt and firteſt way for preventing thereof, might be to commiſſionat ſome perſons of Power and Authority in the ſeveral places of the Countrey where the ſaid Victual and Cattel is ordinarly brought in and landed. We therefore, with advice of the Lords of Our Privy Council have thought fit, to grant full Power, Authority, and Commiſſion to Our Right truſtie and well beloved Couſins and Councellors, <hi>Archibald,</hi> Earl of <hi>Argyle,</hi> and <hi>George,</hi> Lord <hi>Roſſe,</hi> and to Our well beloved, <hi>Richard Murray</hi> of <hi>Brughtoun,</hi> by themſelves, their Deputs, Servants, and ſuch as they ſhall think fit to appoint (for whom they will be anſwerable) to ſearch for, ſeize, and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend all <hi>Iriſh</hi> Victual and Cattel, and Salt-beef made thereof, that ſhall happen to be imported from <hi>Ireland</hi> unto this Kingdom in the particular places after-ſpecified, <hi>viz.</hi> The ſaid Earl of <hi>Argyle</hi> in all places, from <hi>Lechlung</hi> to the <hi>Mule</hi> of <hi>Kintyre,</hi> and round about the ſame. The ſaid Lord <hi>Roſs</hi> in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, from the Burgh of <hi>Glaſgow,</hi> to the March of <hi>Galloway</hi> on the South, and from <hi>Glaſgow,</hi> to <hi>Lochlung</hi> on the North: and the Iſles of <hi>Arran, Bute</hi> and <hi>Comray:</hi> and the ſaid <hi>Richard Murray,</hi> from the March of <hi>Galloway,</hi> to the March of <hi>Nithſdale.</hi> And for the more ready and effectual proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſaid Commiſſion, have granted full Power and Authority to the ſaids Earl of <hi>Argyle,</hi> Lord <hi>Roſs</hi> and <hi>Richard Murray</hi> by themſelves, their Deputs, ſervants, and ſuch as they ſhall think fit to entruſt in the reſpective bounds foreſaids, to ſecure all Barks, or travelling Boats whether <hi>Scots</hi> or <hi>Iriſh,</hi> until the Skippers or Owners ſhall find Caution that they ſhall import no <hi>Iriſh</hi> Victual or Cattel hereafter. The ſaids Commiſſioners or their foreſaids are thereby authorized to ſearch all Barks, Boats, or other Veſſels, wherein any <hi>Iriſh</hi> Victual or Cattel are ſuſpected to be; and to ſeize and ſecure the ſame, incaſe they find the ſaids prohibited Goods therein; And for better diſcovery thereof, all Merchants, Skippers, or Owners of Boats, Barks, or other Veſſels travelling to and from the places foreſaids, are thereby ordered before they break bulk, or liver any goods, to advertiſe the ſaids Commiſſioners, or theſe entruſted by them at one or other of the Ports following, <hi>viz.</hi> at the Point of Garvel near <hi>Greenock,</hi> the Towns of <hi>Largs, Irving, Turnberry, Dumbarton, Rotheſay, Brodick, Dinnon, Tarbet, Campbletoun, Innerarey, Portpatrick, Glenluce</hi> and <hi>Kirkudbright</hi> (at which Ports, Offices are ſtabliſhed to receive theſe Advertiſements;) under the pain of Confiſcation of the ſaids veſſels and goods, and being holden as confeſt Importers of <hi>Iriſh</hi> Victual: Provided that the Skippers or Owners, ſhall not upon ſuch occaſion be obliged to wait longer then one Tydes water. If upon pregnant preſumptions the ſaids Commiſſioners, or theſe entruſted by them ſhall ſuſpect any perſon or perſons guilty of importing <hi>Iriſh</hi> Victual or Cattel, they are thereby authorized to conveen any ſuch perſon or perſons before the neareſt Magiſtrat in Burgh or Landwart, and to lead all manner of probation againſt them for proving thereof: whereupon the ſaids Magiſtrats are to give preſent and ready juſtice. All Sheriffs, Stewarts, Bailyes of Royalties, Regalities, and Baronies, and all Heretors are thereby ordered to give their ſpeedy and ready aſſiſtance to the ſaids Commiſſioners, or theſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted by them, when ever they ſhall be required, either as to the ſearching of veſſels by night or day, making open and patent doors, ſearching of ſellars, or other ſuſpect places for <hi>Iriſh</hi> Victual or Cattel, which they are thereby authorized to do. As alſo the Officers of any Garriſon are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to concurr, and aſſiſt them with a Party of ſouldiers as they ſhal be deſired upon any extraordinary occaſion. In caſe any ſeizure be made by the ſaids Commiſſioners, or theſe entruſted by them; The Heretors next adjacent to the ſaid place are thereby required to cauſe carry the Victual to ſome convenient place neareſt, untill Our Council ſhall give order thereanent: And theſe ſo employed ſhall be payed by the perſon who makes the ſeizure for each horſe carriage; not exceeding two ſhilling <hi>ſcots</hi> the mile. The ſaids Commiſſioners, or theſe entruſted by them are thereby empowered with conſent of the Magiſtrat of the place to ſend any perſon or perſons to priſon who ſhall be found guilty of contraveening the ſaids Laws, or ſhall be contumaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in refuſing to depone; The Magiſtrats of the place being alwayes free of the priſoners charges: In which caſe, the Magiſtrats are to ſecure the priſoners and their veſſels, and to be comptable for them: And in caſe any perſon or perſons ſhall make open reſiſtance againſt the ſaids Commiſſioners, or theſe entruſted by them in the execution of Our ſaid Commiſſion, and that there ſhall happen blood-ſhed, mutilation or ſlaughter to follow, through the ſaid reſiſtance; It is declared that the ſaids Commiſſioners, and theſe entruſted by, or giving aſſiſtance to them, ſhal never be called in queſtion, or purſued therefore civily or criminally in time coming. And further, by the ſaid Commiſſion, it is declared, that the ſame ſhall no wayes free or liberat the Importers or reſetters of <hi>Iriſh</hi> victual or cattel, or Heretors upon whoſe ground the ſame ſhall be imported, but that they ſhall continue ſtill lyable to the pains and penalties appointed by the ſaids Acts of Parliament and Council; As if the ſaid Commiſſion had never been granted: Which Commiſſion is to begin and take effect, from, and after the firſt day of <hi>January</hi> next, and to continue until the firſt day of <hi>January,</hi> 1678 years. And to the effect, all Our Leidges and others concerned, may have due and timeous notice thereof, We have thought fit, that theſe Our Letters of publication of the ſame ſhould be direct in manner under-written. Our Will is herefore; and We charge you ſtraitly, and command, that incontinent theſe Our Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſeen ye paſſe, to the Mercat-croſſes of <hi>Edinburgh, Glaſgors Dumbariours,</hi> and other places needful: And thereat, in Our Name and Authority, by open Proclamation, make publication of the Premiſſes; to the effect, that all Our Leiges, and others concerned, may have due and timous notice of Our pleaſure in the Premiſſes, and may give ready obedience to Our Commands therein, as they will be anſwerable at their higheſt peril.</p>
