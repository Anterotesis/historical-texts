         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <l>A True <hi>Phanatick</hi> to Anatomize,</l>
            <l>Requires the Head and Brains of one more wiſe</l>
            <l>Then I; Yet ſince that I am ſet upon't,</l>
            <l>I'le go through-ſtitch with it what e're comes on't.</l>
            <l>His Extract's Ancient, having for its riſe,</l>
            <l>Our Grand Fore-Fathers firſt in <hi>Paradiſe;</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> were <hi>Nonconformiſts,</hi> They</l>
            <l>The ſtrict command of God did diſobey,</l>
            <l>He is ſo Fruitful, and loves Propagation,</l>
            <l>That's Tribe (like hated <hi>Jews</hi>) fills ev'ry Nation.</l>
            <l>To ſee him in his Cloaths you might well ſwear,</l>
            <l>That he ſome Clothier, or Weaver were:</l>
            <l>They are not black, but of a Medly hue,</l>
            <l>Not much unlike to Ruſſet, or <hi>Coventrey-blue.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>About Eight years he hath been dumb, but now</l>
            <l>By the Benigne Aſpect of Princely brow,</l>
            <l>His Speech's reſtor'd again, I wiſh that He,</l>
            <l>For ſuch a Miracle may thankful be.</l>
            <l>His Hair is ſhort, and ſtands almoſt upright,</l>
            <l>As if but newly reſcu'd from a fright:</l>
            <l>But ſome of them are White, and Gray again,</l>
            <l>Not caus'd by age, but violent heat of brain;</l>
            <l>Which being reſtleſs, drives them forth to action,</l>
            <l>Which ends moſt commonly in dang'rous Faction.</l>
            <l>His Head and Crown is round, and balld behind,</l>
            <l>And to <hi>Vertigoes</hi> very much inclin'd;</l>
            <l>His forehead high, and hard beyond all Story:</l>
            <l>His Chin is an extended Promontory.</l>
            <l>His Eyes are ſmall, yet one bigger then t'other,</l>
            <l>The great one views himſelf, the leſs his Brother.</l>
            <l>His Noſe is ſharp, and very quick of ſcent,</l>
            <l>To ſmell out Belly-chear in ſtarving Lent.</l>
            <l>His Ears are long, one always hanging down,</l>
            <l>To liſten after News that ſtirs in Town:</l>
            <l>The other tending upward 'bove his Chin,</l>
            <l>For <hi>Mah'mets</hi> Pidgeon to whiſper in.</l>
            <l>His Beard in length is almoſt half a Span,</l>

            <l>As for his Speech, ſeeing he hath been dumb,</l>
            <l>I know not what 'twill be, but muſt ſay Mum.</l>
            <l>His Chops are lean through envy, and his Face,</l>
            <l>Is th' ſeat of Impudence, and not of Grace.</l>
            <l>His Mouth, and Gullet's large, whereby he's able,</l>

            </l>
            <l>His Arms and Hands are long, but ſtrong withal,</l>
            <l>And gripeth hard who under them doth fall.</l>
            <l>His breath is tainted both with Rage and Spight,</l>
            <l>His Neck is ſtiff, and cannot turn to th' right.</l>
            <l>His Breaſt (having no Window to't) I ſpare</l>
