         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>REASONS FOR THE Taking off the Q—s and R—s in the <hi>Navy</hi> Books; together with Propoſals humbly Offered to the Honourable Houſe of Commons for the expeditious Payment of Saylors.</head>
            <p>I Doubt not but the Greivences of Saylors, touching Q—s and R—s have (In di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe Modes and Formes) been already repreſented to this Honourable Houſe, ſo that I ſhall touch very Slightly upon the ſame, I will only add that.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> No Q—s nor R—s can be taken off to advantage of the whole, unleſs they are all taken off in General by Act of Parliament.</p>
            <p>For if the Matter be referred to be Examined, by the <hi>Admiralty,</hi> or <hi>Navy,</hi> or any other Perſon, or Perſons, the Saylors are ſtill in the ſame Condition, being to be Judged, by the ſame Judges; or others, that may be Equally Prejudiced, or By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſed, and can have no other remedy then what they have already.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> With humble Submiſſion I propoſe, that the taking off all the Q—s and R—s in General, will be an Encouragement to all Saylors, Encouragement for all Perſons to truſt them, when in Neceſſity, and will be for the Honour and Credit, of the Nation.</p>
            <p>And that the Saylors may with Eaſe be paid, their Creditors ſatisfyed, and the Money due from His Majeſty in Arrears to Saylors with Eaſe paid, I with all Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>millity propoſe.</p>
            <p>That Tickets be made out (if there be none made out already) for the Saylors who are Q—d and R—d and alſo for the future, that at any time, or times, when His Majeſty's Fleet ſhall have ended their Summers Expedition, and ſhall put into Harbour; the Captain of each Ship ſhall there together with other Officers on Board, make out Tickets for Saylors then on Board, and alſo for ſuch Dead, Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged, Wounded, or Sick Men ſet on Shore, or ſent to Hoſpitals, for their Wages reſpectively due to them; as alſo Tickets for themſelves from time to time, at the end of every reſpective Expedition, and their coming into Harbour.</p>
            <p>That thoſe Tickets ſo made out, or hereafter to be made out, be ſent up to <hi>Lon, don,</hi> or elſe where, (according to the direction of this Honourable Houſe) to an Office, or Offices, to be Erected for that purpoſe, where each Individual Ticket ſhall receive a Stamp, and Indorſement, of the Vallue of each Ticket, with an Allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Intereſts thereon, (that theſe Tickets be returned to the Parties in whoſe Cuſtody they now are,) or to the ſaid Ship, to whom they belong, and paid to the Saylor as ready Mony, that an Act paſs to make the ſame Current as Specie, between Subject, and Subject, and be adjudged a good tender in Law for any Debt by any Perſons due, and that theſe Tickets be paid in payments for duties to His Majeſty, and that a Fund be appointed for the taking of them in; is moſt humbly propoſed, will make the Saylors Eaſie, all Perſons dealing with them happy, the King quiet, the Nation out of Debt (in this Affaire) Funds thereby will be converted to the uſe deſigned (procure a Circulation of Mony) and ſtop the Mouths of abundance of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who being ready to Starve for their Money due to them (their Poverty being ſo preſſing) Make Continual Exclamations and Murmors againſt the Government, will bring our Saylors home from Abroad; And I hope make this a Flourſhing and Happy Kingdom.</p>
            <closer>Which is the Prayers of <signed>your Honours moſt obedient Servant, <hi>William Eccles.</hi>
