            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>My Sefaution, art thou Deceaſed,</l>
               <l>and left thy Silvia in ſorrow behind?</l>
               <l>From my Torments let me be releaſed,</l>
               <l>for in this World I no Comfort can find:</l>
               <l>By Loving Swain, for thee I Complain,</l>
               <l>O that I was able to call thee again;</l>
               <l>Then ſhould I be, happy in thee,</l>
               <l>But this is a Blesſing I never more ſhall ſee.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Didd'ſt thou Dote ſo much on my Beauty,</l>
               <l>and yet I would not thy Favours regard;</l>
               <l>For that cruel neglea of my Duty,</l>
               <l>theſe pains I bear is a legal Reward.</l>
               <l>Here in this Breaſt, my Soul is oppreſt,</l>
               <l>With ſad ſighs and anguiſh, O where ſhall I reſt;</l>
               <l>Here in diſpair, theſe Robes I tear,</l>
               <l>The heighth of my pasſion is more than I can hear.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>IN this Tomb now lies my Sefautians,</l>
               <l>while my poor heart is ready to brake;</l>
               <l>For I ſuffer the pains of my pasſion,</l>
               <l>I with, my Dear, I had dy'd for thy ſake.</l>
               <l>Nothing appears, but troops of new fears,</l>
               <l>And here do I water thy Tomb with my Tears:</l>
               <l>Never did one, make greater moan,</l>
               <l>For thou art departed, and I am left alone.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>We by Death are parted aſunder,</l>
               <l>and I am left to bemoan my hard Fate;</l>
               <l>O what ſorrow of heart I lye under,</l>
               <l>I weep for thee; but alas 'tis too late.</l>
               <l>He's gone before, whom I did adore,</l>
               <l>The thoughts of his Sayings does trouble me ſore;</l>
               <l>From Miſery, Death ſet me free,</l>
               <l>For why ſhould I live any longer here, than he.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>While thy dying tears they were vented,</l>
               <l>thou ſaid'ſt, fair Silvia, I bid thee adieu;</l>
               <l>But when gone, I ſhall then be lamented,</l>
               <l>and now I find that thy ſayings are true;</l>
               <l>Why did a frown, ſo ſoon caſt thee down,</l>
               <l>Thy ſorrows with favours I promis'd to crown:</l>
               <l>But firſt I try, thy Conſtancy,</l>
               <l>Not thinking that Death wou'd have been thy deſtiny.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>While I on my Pillows am lying,</l>
               <l>methinks I hear then his hovering Ghoſt,</l>
               <l>With ſhrill trembling voice he is trying,</l>
               <l>make haſte, fair Silvia, whom I loved moſt.</l>
               <l>This would he ſay, Love, make haſte away,</l>
               <l>And do not endeavour no longer delay:</l>
               <l>He is, I know, in Shades below,</l>
               <l>And therefore I now will to the Elizium go.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Scorching-Love ſoon turn'd to a Feaver,</l>
               <l>make haſte, kind Charon, ſhe often did try;</l>
               <l>All her beautiful Charms they did leave her,</l>
               <l>as in Deaths power ſhe panting did lye.</l>
               <l>Then with a groan, and ſorrowful moan,</l>
               <l>Fair Silvia ſaid thus to her Lover alone:</l>
               <l>I'll no more be, in Chains, but free,</l>
               <l>For my dear Sefautian, I came, I come to the.</l>
