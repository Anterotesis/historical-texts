            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE CASE OF Robert Blackburne.</head>
            <p>
               <date>
                  <hi>APril</hi> 2d. 1696,</date>
the ſaid <hi>Blackburne</hi> was Committed to <hi>Newgate,</hi> and the <hi>Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> following, putting in his Prayer, was admitted to Bail at the Seſſions Houſe in the <hi>Old Baily,</hi> and no Information coming againſt him, he was at the enſuing Seſſions diſcharg'd from his Bail, and abſolutely Acquitted. By this his Chargeable Confinement having Contracted ſeveral Debts, and his Creditors being very preſſing upon him, he reſolv'd to go for <hi>Flanders,</hi> where he had ſome Relations, from whom he might reaſonably expect ſome Aſſiſtance; and in order thereunto, he put himſelf on Board an <hi>Oftend</hi> Man of War, but not being able, for want of Money, to procure a Paſs, he was by Capt. <hi>Naſh,</hi> His Majeſty's Searcher, brought back to <hi>London,</hi> as a Suſpicious Perſon, and Committed to the Cuſtody of one <hi>Davis,</hi> a Meſſenger; where, when he had remain'd for 3 or 4 Days, he, by his Sollicitor, repreſented his Caſe to Sir <hi>William Trumball,</hi> then Secretary of State; upon the Conſideration of which, Sir <hi>William,</hi> as the ſaid <hi>Blackburne</hi> was inform'd by his Sollicitor, was inclin'd to diſcharge him; but he was ſtill delay'd, till the Parliament being about to paſs a Bill for continuing the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment of one <hi>Counter,</hi> and others, which Bill having paſs'd the Houſe of Commons, and the ſad <hi>Blackburne</hi>'s Name not mention'd therein, <hi>Davis,</hi> the Meſſenger, knowing that he had formerly been Confin'd with the ſaid <hi>Counter,</hi> and (altho' legally Acquitted, as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid,) made it his Buſineſs to get his Priſoner, the ſaid <hi>Blackburne,</hi> alſo included in the ſaid Bill, that he might be Recommitted, and continued in Priſon with the ſaid <hi>Counter,</hi> &amp;c. by the Act that was then ready to paſs the Houſe: And accordingly, tho' no farther In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation appear'd againſt him, when the Bill paſs'd the Lords Houſe, they, in their A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendments, incerted the ſaid <hi>Blackburne;</hi> whereupon, he was Recommitted to <hi>Newgate</hi> without ever being Examin'd; where he was kept two Years under ſo Strict and Rigorous a Confinement, that no Friend was ſuffered to ſpeak to him, nor could he take any Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures to ſet forth the Hardſhip of his Caſe, or obtain any Redreſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He humbly believes his Caſe to be Particular, in that he was never Acquainted with any one of thoſe Perſons who have been put to Death for the late Conſpiracy; nor did he ſo much as ever know any, or either of thoſe whom he is in Priſon with, until their Confinement. And beſides, he deſires it may be obſerv'd, That he is not one of thoſe Perſons for whom a Thouſand Pounds was paid for the Apprehending.</hi>
