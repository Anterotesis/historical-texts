            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Upon the Right of Succeſsion to the Crown of England.</head>
            <l>THat precious Gem call'd Loyalty grows ſcarce,</l>
            <l>Faction would turn it to diſgraceful Farce.</l>
            <l>When <hi>England</hi>'s great Prerogative does grow</l>
            <l>Into contempt by Tumult, Monarch's foe.</l>
            <l>Whoſe ſubril ſecret <hi>Jeſuitick</hi> Gins,</l>
            <l>Would turn the frame of Nature off its Pins.</l>
            <l>A painted zeal muſt back what they decree,</l>
            <l>Heav'n muſt be mock'd t'uphold their treachery.</l>
            <l>As if they judg'd That would maintain their Cauſe,</l>
            <l>Whoſe beams outſhine it, to ſupport our Laws.</l>
            <l>Bleſs'd in the Hemiſphere of peaceful days,</l>
            <l>Beneath the warm, the bright, and ſacred rays,</l>
            <l>Of glorious Majeſty, by whoſe ſweet care,</l>
            <l>Our Laws and Liberties maintained are.</l>
            <l>Bluſh then diſloyal Mortals, let your ſhame,</l>
            <l>All wild attempts againſt your Reaſon tame.</l>
            <l>Think not your ſelves that are but Subjects, Kings,</l>
            <l>You know Religion teacheth better things.</l>
            <l>Muſt all our ancient Laws then tumble down,</l>
            <l>By turning this to an Elective Crown?</l>
            <l>No lawful Preſident you can diſcloſe,</l>
            <l>Whereby you power have Kings to depoſe,</l>
            <l>Or turn the circulation of the Blood,</l>
            <l>An adverſe way, not to be underſtood.</l>
            <l>But through a byaſs'd odd fantaſtick zeal,</l>
            <l>Which being graſp'd, is ſlippery like an Eel.</l>
            <l>Late reeling Times ſufficiently have ſhown,</l>

            <l>When <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, whoſe memory ſhall live,</l>
            <l>Could not their murtherous Principles ſurvive.</l>
            <l>And our moſt Gracious Soveraign <hi>Charles</hi> that now</l>
            <l>Does rule our Land, from thence did he not grow.</l>
            <l>Immediate Heir to ſway the Scepter here,</l>
            <l>And though-Religion made the Point ſeem clear,</l>
            <l>Yet theirs forſooth could him no Crown afford,</l>
            <l>For by th' divine aſſiſtance of their Sword,</l>
            <l>Their piety forc'd him forth his native Land,</l>
            <l>Againſt both Law, Nature, and Heav'ns Command.</l>
            <l>Are theſe the pious things you'd act again?</l>

            <l>Of States that did the lawful Heir expel.</l>
            <l>The Second <hi>William</hi> govern'd once this Realm</l>
            <l>By Uſurpation, and the mighty Helm</l>
            <l>By <hi>Henry</hi> the Firſt being occupi'd,</l>
            <l>Until their elder Brother <hi>Robert</hi> di'd.</l>
            <l>Who to obtain that Crown that was his due,</l>
            <l>Colour'd this Land of a dread ſcarlet hue.</l>
            <l>It ended with his death; th' imperial Crown</l>
            <l>Then by Deſcent for <hi>Henry</hi>'s was known.</l>

            <l>The only Heir of <hi>Henry</hi> it came.</l>
            <l>When <hi>Stephen</hi> he uſurp'd it as his own,</l>

            <l>Till Juſtice ſeem'd to take that pious care,</l>

            <l>The late unnatural inteſtine War</l>
            <l>Speaks loud enough, the wounds continue green,</l>
            <l>When <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt had been the bloody Scene</l>
            <l>Of their Impiety; this Land was wrack'd,</l>
            <l>Its Bowels torn, Nature's chief Fabrick crack'd,</l>
            <l>As 'twere at ſuch diſorder, till in th' end,</l>
            <l>(As each thing doth unto its Centre tend.)</l>
            <l>The Clouds diſpers'd, and drove away deſpair,</l>
            <l>When in the Throne appear'd the much wrong'd Heir,</l>
            <l>Whom God preſerve, and may he ever be</l>
            <l>From treach'rous and diſloyal Subjects free.</l>
            <l>Princes are God's Anointed, and the Crown</l>
            <l>None can detain, but Heav'ns great Prince alone.</l>
            <l>When Nature's Law hath been impeach'd, ſuch things</l>

            <l>Againſt the Tongue of ev'ry ſenſleſs Brute,</l>
            <l>That dares Succeſſion to the Crown diſpute.</l>
            <l>But may our Good, our Gracious King long raign,</l>
            <l>Whoſe Breaſt all precious <hi>Vertue</hi> doth contain.</l>
            <l>May he raign, and live long enough to find</l>
            <l>His Subjects all united in one mind.</l>
            <l>And may a Gem ſo precious from his Crown,</l>
            <l>Not be defil'd, nor rudely taken down.</l>
            <l>And that Injuſtice ſhou'd it not impair,</l>
            <l>Heav'n hath bequeath'd it to his deareſt Care.</l>
