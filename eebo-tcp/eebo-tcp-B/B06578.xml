            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <lg>
               <l>CLear was the day though it prov'd bluſtring weather</l>
               <l>When the rude Rout in Tumults got together,</l>
               <l>When little Boys would prove the firſt Beginners</l>
               <l>To vend their fury upon poor frail <hi>Sinners.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Moor-fields</hi> the Stage on which they Act their Fury,</l>
               <l>Making themſelves both <hi>Plaintiffes, Judge</hi> and <hi>Jury.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Arriving ſoon unto that deſperate height,</l>
               <l>By crooked ways to ſeek to make things <hi>ſtreight.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Sure little good can on their Actions border,</l>
               <l>Who by <hi>Confuſion</hi> will put things in <hi>Order.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Much harm by ſuch Acts evermore Commences,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Sinners</hi> always will have <hi>Saints</hi> pretences.</l>
               <l>When firſt by hallowing their Miſ-rule was budding,</l>
               <l>They'd play the Fools too as well as <hi>Jack Pudding</hi>:</l>
               <l>Though their deſigns did not together hit,</l>
               <l>The one fool'd for Money, th'others for want of Wit,</l>
               <l>Sad was the <hi>Omen</hi> of their furious hope</l>
               <l>Firſt thing they meddle with to be a <hi>Rope,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>It is bad jeſting with <hi>edge-tools</hi> we ſay,</l>
               <l>A Rope began, a Rope may end the Fray.</l>
               <l>When they had ſpoil'd the <hi>Vaulters</hi> of their Tools,</l>
               <l>They then muſt go to pull down <hi>Vaulting-Schools,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>The Whores <hi>Dark</hi> Actions then muſt come to <hi>Light,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>And by <hi>wrong</hi> doings, they will ſet things <hi>Right.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Houſes by <hi>Moor-fields,</hi> and <hi>Whetſtones Park</hi> them,</l>
               <l>They were not <hi>Noble</hi> to them, ſo to <hi>Mark</hi> them</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Angels</hi> of darkneſs did inhabite in them,</l>
               <l>And they were routed as the <hi>Devil</hi> had been them.</l>
               <l>Thoſe <hi>Feather-beds</hi> which had been inſtrumental</l>
               <l>For acting Luſt, to ruine then were bent all.</l>
               <l>The <hi>Sheets</hi> themſelves did Pennance, <hi>Curtains</hi> and <hi>Valence,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Were <hi>open</hi> ſhown for <hi>hiding</hi> Leacherous Dalliance.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Chairs</hi> and <hi>Windows</hi> broken; work was made</l>
               <l>Both for the <hi>Joyners</hi>; and the <hi>Glaziers</hi> Trade:</l>
               <l>Such alterations did this miſchief bring,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Summer</hi> Houſes were made in time of <hi>Spring.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Thus when the Rout takes on them to bear ſway,</l>
               <l>The weaker muſt perforce the ſtrong obey.</l>
               <l>The <hi>Whores</hi> did to their <hi>Ruiners</hi> yeeld ſubmiſſion,</l>
