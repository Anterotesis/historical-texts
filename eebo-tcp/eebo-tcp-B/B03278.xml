         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <lg>
               <l>CAN a great <hi>Hero</hi>'s Soul and Body part,</l>
               <l>And not foreſhown by Nature, nor by Art!</l>
               <l>Can the Great Princely <hi>R<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>PERT</hi> leave the World,</l>
               <l>And no part of't into diſorder hurl'd!</l>
               <l>No <hi>Blazing-Star!</hi> Eclipſe of <hi>Moon</hi> nor <hi>Sun</hi>
               </l>
               <l>To uſher his depart, or's Death forerun!</l>
               <l>Methinks it ſhould not be! A Soul ſo Great,</l>
               <l>A Soul ſo Noble, every way compleat,</l>
               <l>Should leave us thus in ſilence, and depart,</l>
               <l>And Nature ſhew us that ſhe felt no ſmart!</l>
               <l>In what parts buſied were our <hi>Merlin</hi>'s Eyes?</l>
               <l>Had our Great Prince no Star within the Skies,</l>
               <l>That could before hand the effect relate,</l>
               <l>To have prepar'd us for ſo ſad a fate?</l>
               <l>From all his Warlike toyls he now doth ceaſe,</l>
               <l>He's gone, alas! and left us all in Peace:</l>
               <l>Like other Men he ſilently doth ſleep,</l>
               <l>And left Three Kingdoms the ſad loſs to weep.</l>
               <l>From Earth below, to Heaven above he's gon,</l>
               <l>For the Reward of his Great Actions done,</l>
               <l>For our Two Kings, the Father and the Son.</l>
               <l>He gains by Death, the World alone hath loſt,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Europe</hi> will miſs him, but ſad <hi>England</hi> moſt.</l>
               <l>A Mighty Pillar of the State is broke,</l>
               <l>Three Kingdoms ſeem to tremble at the ſtroke:</l>
               <l>And all who love the King and Kingdom, now,</l>
               <l>For ſuch a loſs no ſmall concern will ſhow.</l>
               <l>With a ſad Heart the King doth entertain</l>
               <l>The heavy news, and can't from tears refrain;</l>
               <l>For <hi>R<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>PERT</hi> lay nigh to His Royal Heart,</l>
               <l>And of His Love deſerv'd no little part:</l>
               <l>But this Great Prince, what is obtain'd by few,</l>
               <l>Had both the Love of King and People too.</l>
               <l>Of others his great merits got the ſtart,</l>
               <l>Compelling to adore him every Heart;</l>
               <l>All ſorts of Men, tho' different in their ways,</l>
               <l>Agreed the Name of <hi>R<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>PERT</hi> ſtill to praiſe:</l>
               <l>His worth they all admired with conſent,</l>
               <l>And now his Death as generally lament.</l>
               <l>The King has loſt a Councellor of State,</l>
               <l>Who knew as well to Act, as to Debate;</l>
               <l>One who had Wiſdom, Courage, Prudence, Wit,</l>
               <l>Things that together one Soul ſeldome ſit.</l>
               <l>The Church in him has loſt no ſmall ſupport,</l>
               <l>For he there ſhin'd as bright as at the Court.</l>
               <l>All <hi>Proteſtants</hi> have loſt a ſure defence,</l>
               <l>He to their Cauſe was true, as to his Prince.</l>
               <l>In him the Kingdom too has loſt a Shield,</l>
               <l>Still ready to defend it in the Field:</l>
               <l>For in the Gap, in danger he did ſtand,</l>
               <l>Freely expoſing Life by Sea and Land.</l>
               <l>His Noble Acts with <hi>Caezars</hi> may compare;</l>
               <l>Like him, as bold, ſucceſsful ſtill in War:</l>
               <l>For Victory ſtill ſeem'd to be his Friend,</l>
               <l>And him where e're he Fought ſhe did attend.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>England</hi> his Courage and great Acts have known,</l>
               <l>When in his Youth he did defend the Throne</l>
               <l>Of his moſt gracious Uncle, then, even then</l>
               <l>He did ſurpaſs the Acts of Famous men;</l>
               <l>Where e're he did his Loyal Force diſplay,</l>
               <l>He made the Conquering Rebel ſtill give way;</l>
               <l>And tho' his ſide to Cruel Fate did yield,</l>
               <l>He was himſelf Victorious ſtill in Field:</l>
               <l>For Victory her ſelf to him gave way,</l>
               <l>Whilſt like a Lion ſtill he ſeiz'd his prey;</l>
               <l>The <hi>French</hi> have ſeen what this great Prince could do,</l>
               <l>The <hi>Dutch</hi> have felt his dreadful Valour too,</l>
               <l>His very Name at laſt a Terror grew.</l>
               <l>Nor did he raſhly fight the Foe, for ſtill</l>
               <l>His forward Courage mixed was with skill;</l>
               <l>So very Dextrous he grew, that He</l>
               <l>Beat them in their own Element, the Sea.</l>
               <l>Among the <hi>Hero</hi>'s of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Land,</l>
               <l>The glorious Name of our great Prince ſhall ſtand;</l>
               <l>His Valiant deeds ſhall never be forgot,</l>
               <l>Nor ſhall among the Common Rubbiſh rot;</l>
               <l>Whilſt Hiſtories live, whilſt there's a Mouth for Fame,</l>
