            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>Vnto a mountain top alſo</l>
               <l>did walk ſome pleaſure for to ſee:</l>
               <l>Where forty Merchants he eſpyed,</l>
               <l>with fifty ſail come towards him,</l>
               <l>Who then no ſooner were arriv'd,</l>
               <l>but on their knees did thus complain:</l>
               <l>An't pleaſe your Grace, we cannot ſail</l>
               <l>to <hi>France</hi> no voyage to be ſure,</l>
               <l>But Sir <hi>Andrew Barton</hi> makes us quail,</l>
               <l>and robs us of our marchant-ware.</l>
               <l>Vext was the King, and turning him</l>
               <l>ſaid to his Lords of high degree,</l>
               <l>Have I ne'r a Lord within my Realm</l>
               <l>dare fetch that Traytor unto me?</l>
               <l>To him reply'd <hi>Charles</hi> Lord <hi>Howard,</hi>
               </l>

               </l>
               <l>I fear, my Lord, you are too young.</l>
               <l>No whit at all, my Leige, quoth he;</l>
               <l>I hope to prove in valour ſtrong:</l>

               <l>in what place ſoever he be,</l>
               <l>And bring aſhore with all his might,</l>
               <l>or into <hi>Scotland</hi> he ſhall carry me,</l>
               <l>A hundred Men, the King then ſaid,</l>

               <l>in all affairs ſhall wait on thee.</l>
               <l>Lord <hi>Howard</hi> call'd a Gunner then,</l>
               <l>who was the beſt in all the Realm,</l>
               <l>His age was threeſcore years and ten,</l>
               <l>and <hi>Peter Simon</hi> was his name:</l>
               <l>My Lord call'd then a Bow-man rare,</l>
               <l>whoſe active hands had gained fame,</l>
               <l>A Gentleman born in <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>and <hi>William Horſely</hi> was his name:</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Horſely,</hi> quoth he, I muſt to Sea</l>
               <l>to ſeek a Traytor with good ſpeed;</l>
               <l>Of a hundred Bow-men brave, quoth he,</l>
               <l>I have choſen thee to be the Head.</l>
               <l>If you, my Lord, have choſen me</l>
               <l>of a hundred Men to be the Head,</l>
               <l>Vpon the main-maſt i'll hanged be,</l>
               <l>if twelveſcore I miſs one ſhillings breadth.</l>
               <l>Lord <hi>Howard</hi> then of courage bold,</l>
               <l>went to the Sea with pleaſant chear,</l>
               <l>Not curh'd with winter's piercing cold,</l>
               <l>though it was the ſtormy time of year,</l>
               <l>Not long he had been on the Sea,</l>
               <l>on more in days than number three,</l>
               <l>But the <hi>Henry Hunt</hi> there he eſpy'd,</l>
               <l>a Merchant of <hi>New-caſtle</hi> was he,</l>
               <l>To him Lord <hi>Howard</hi> call'd out amain,</l>
               <l>and ſtrictly charged him to ſtand,</l>
               <l>Demanding then from whence he came,</l>
               <l>or where he did intend to land:</l>
               <l>The Merchant then made anſwer ſoon,</l>
               <l>with heavy heart and careful mind,</l>
               <l>My Lord, my ſhip it doth belong</l>
               <l>unto <hi>New-caſtle</hi> upon <hi>Tine.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Canſt thou ſhew me, the Lord did ſay,</l>

               <l>his name is <hi>Andrew Barton,</hi> Knight?</l>
               <l>Then the Merchant ſigh'd and ſaid,</l>
               <l>with grieved mind and well-away,</l>
               <l>But over-well I know that Wight,</l>
               <l>I was his Priſoner yeſterday;</l>
               <l>As I, thy Lord, did ſail from <hi>France,</hi>

               <l>a <hi>Burdeaux</hi>-voyage to take ſo far.</l>
               <l>I met with Sir <hi>Andrew Barton</hi> thence,</l>
               <l>who rob'd me of my merchant-ware:</l>
               <l>And mickle debts God knows I owe,</l>
               <l>and every Man doth crave his own;</l>
               <l>And I am bound to <hi>London</hi> now,</l>
               <l>of our gracious King to beg a boon.</l>
               <l>Shew me him, ſaid Lord <hi>Howard</hi> then,</l>

               <l>Now God forbid, the Merchant ſaid,</l>

               <l>Hard news than ſhew'ſt, then ſaid the Lord,</l>

               <l>But as I ſaid i'll bring him aboard,</l>
               <l>or into <hi>Scotland</hi> he ſhall carry me.</l>
               <l>The Merchant ſaid, If you will do ſo,</l>
               <l>take counſel then I pray withal,</l>
               <l>Let no Man to his top-caſtle go,</l>

               <l>The Pirate's head he brought along</l>
               <l>for to preſent unto our King:</l>
               <l>Who briefly then to him did ſay,</l>

               <l>Where is the Knight and Pirate gay,</l>
               <l>that I myſelf may give the doom.</l>
               <l>You may thank God, then ſaid the Lord,</l>
               <l>and four Men in the ſhip, quoth he,</l>

               <l>To the Merchant then the King did ſay,</l>
               <l>In lieu of what he hath from the tune,</l>
