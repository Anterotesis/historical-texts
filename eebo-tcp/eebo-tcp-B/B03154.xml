            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>Gentlemen and Fellow-Soldiers,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Suppoſe it is not unknown to you, and to the whole Chriſtian World, what Glory I have acquired, and how Succeſsful and Fortunate I have been in ſuppreſſing Hereſie in <hi>France,</hi> and propagating the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Catholick Faith; and can without Vanity boaſt my ſelf the happy Inſtrument of bringing over Thouſands of poor deluded Souls from their Errors, who owe their Salvation to the pious Care of my thrice Illuſtrious Maſter, and my own Induſtry, aſſiſted by ſome Holy Members of our Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpotted Church; while great numbers of thoſe incorrigible Hereticks have periſhed, both Soul and Body, by their obſtinacy.</p>
            <p>It was for this reaſon that the moſt Puiſſant King my Maſter, compaſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating the miſeries of this Kingdom, hath choſen me before ſo many worthy Generals to come hither: not doubting but by my wonted Diligence I ſhould eſtabliſh the Church in this Nation on ſuch a Foundation as it ſhould not be in the power of Hell or Hereticks hereafter to diſturb it.</p>
            <p>And for the bringing about of this Great and Glorious Work, next to the Aſſiſtance of Heaven, the unreſiſtible Puiſlance of the King my Maſter, and my own Conduct, the great dependance of all good Catholicks is on your Courage.</p>
            <p>I muſt confeſs that ſince my coming among you things have not anſwered my Wiſhes, but they are ſtill in a poſture to be retrieved, if you will not betray your Religion and Countrey by an unſeaſonable puſilanimity.</p>
            <p>I am aſſured by my Spies, that the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>'s Heretical Army are reſolved to give us Battel; and you ſee them even before you ready to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it. It is now therefore, if ever, that you muſt endeavour to recover your loſt Honour, Priviledges, and Fore-Fathers Eſtates: You are not Mercenary Soldiers, you do not fight for your Pay, but for your Lives, your Wives, your Children, your Liberties, your Countrey, your Eſtates, and to reſtore the moſt Pious of Kings to his Throne; but above all for the propagation of the Holy Faith, and the Subverſion of Hereſie. Stand to it therefore, my Dears, and bear no longer the Reproaches of the Hereticks, who brand you with Cowardice: and you may be aſſured, that King <hi>James</hi> will Love and Reward you, <hi>Louis</hi> the Great will protect you, all good Catholicks will Applaud you, I my ſelf will Command you, the Church will Pray for you, your Poſterity will Bleſs you, Saints and Angels will Careſs you, God will make you all Saints, and His Holy Mother will lay you in Her Boſom.</p>
