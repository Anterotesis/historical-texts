            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>But love did prove her utter overthrow.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>She was of beauteous mold, fair and clear to behold,</l>

               <l>But was too young, we find, as yet fond love to mind;</l>
               <l>Yet little Cupid did her heart enſnare.</l>

            <lg>
               <l>His parents they were all of high degree,</l>

               <l>Of a temper kind and free, ſhe is the girl for me,</l>

            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>And if by us you'll not be ruled or led,</l>

            <lg>
               <l>Was ſhe as poor as Job, and I of royal robe,</l>
               <l>And lord of all the globe ſhe ſhould be mine,</l>
               <l>His mother ſaid in ſcorn, Thou art moſt nobly born,</l>

            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>He hearing of his mother to ſay ſo,</l>
               <l>His eyes did then with tears like fountains flow;</l>
               <l>Saying, a promiſe I have made, and her heart betray'd,</l>
               <l>Therefore no other for my bride I chuſe.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>A cruel ſnare then for her life she laid,</l>
               <l>And for to act this thing, oh! then she did,</l>
               <l>With her Gardener she agreed, to do the bloody deed</l>
               <l>And butcher her forthwith, and dig her grave,</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>To the Bloody Gardener she gave foreſcore pounds.</l>
               <l>To murder her and lay her under ground,</l>
               <l>All in a grave ſo deep, in everlaſting ſleep,</l>
               <l>Hoping her fair body would not be found.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>She wrote a letter, and ſent it with ſpeed:</l>
               <l>Saying, My deareſt, with haſte now proceed.</l>
               <l>Meet me this night, I've ſomething to declare.</l>
               <l>Poor girl, she little thought upon the deed.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The youthful shepherdeſs of this nothing knew,</l>
               <l>But went to meet her true love as ſhe uſed to do;</l>
               <l>She ſearch'd the garden all around, but no true love ſhe found.</l>
               <l>At length the Bloody Gardener did appear.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>What ſiunneſs have you here, madam, I pray?</l>
               <l>Are you come here to rob the garden gay?</l>
               <l>Cries she, No theif I am, but wait for that young-man,</l>
               <l>Who did this night appoint to meet me here.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>He ſpoke no more, but ſtrait a knife he took,</l>
               <l>And pierc'd her heart before one word ſhe ſpoke,</l>
               <l>Then on the ground she fell, crying, Sweet love, farewel.</l>
               <l>O welcome, welcome, Death, thy fatal ſtroke.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Was this done now, my dear; by your deſign?</l>
               <l>Or by your cruel parents moſt unkind,</l>
               <l>My life is thus betray'd?—farewell vain world, she ſaid,</l>
               <l>I hope in heaven I a place shall find</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But when he ſee her life was really gone,</l>
               <l>Immediately he lay'd her in the ground,</l>
               <l>With flowers fine and gay her corpſe did overlay,</l>
               <l>Intending that her body ſhould not be found.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Now all the time this lord he nothing knew,</l>

               <l>He ſearch'd the vallies round, but no true love he found;</l>
               <l>The little lambs went wandering to and fro'</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Lamenting greatly for their ſhepherdeſs</l>
               <l>Then he did lay him down upon the graſs.</l>
               <l>The heavens he did implore, to ſee his love once more,</l>
               <l>Oh! then, ye Gods above, I am ſurely bleſt,</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Oh! whither ſhall I ſeek the angel bright?</l>
               <l>Who is alone my pleaſure and delight:</l>

               <l>Or elſe my ſoul will quickly take its flight.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Whereat the woods and groves began to mourn;</l>
               <l>The ſmall birds they did ſing a mournfull tune,</l>
               <l>Crying, Your love is gone, and you left quite alone,</l>
               <l>Then on a moſſy bank he laid him down.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>He had no ſooner clos'd his eyes to ſleep,</l>
               <l>But a milk-white dove came to his breaſt,</l>
               <l>Her fluttering wings did beat, which wak'd him out of ſleep,</l>
               <l>And then the dove took wing, and he was bleſt,</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>To this mother's garden ſtrait he did repair,</l>
               <l>For to bemoan the loſs of his own dear,</l>

               <l>Have you not loſt your love, as I have done?</l>

               </l>
               <l>Then thus the dove replied, and then flew down.</l>

            <lg>
               <l>Saving it was your mother order'd it ſo.</l>
               <l>Then from her milk white breaſt the blood did flow.</l>
               <l>To the grove he did repair, but found no true love there,</l>
               <l>Homewards then to his mother he did go.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>And ſaid, Mother moſt cruel and ſevere.</l>
               <l>I fear you've kill'd my joy and only dear:</l>
               <l>For a dove, I do declare, did all in blood appear.</l>
               <l>He ſaid, if ſhe is dead, her fate I'll ſhare.</l>

               <l>His mother hearing what the ſon did ſay,</l>
               <l>She turn'd as pale as death and ſwoon'd away:</l>
               <l>Then into diſtraction run, and told what the had done;</l>
