            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>REASONS Humbly Offer'd to the Honourable Houſe of Commons, FOR Continuing the DUTY or ſome Part thereof, formerly granted for Rebuilding St. <hi>PAUL</hi>'s Cathedral and other Churches in <hi>London,</hi> for ſome time longer.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Quarries of the Iſland of <hi>Portland,</hi> are of great Uſe and Publick Conern; having the largeſt Blocks of beautiful Stone, and the moſt proper for magnificent Buildings; and in regard of their Situation upon Sea, ſupply all the Weſt Coaſt, and the City of <hi>London</hi> in the Building of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s and other Churches, and all both Publick and Private Works; much being alſo uſed in the Docks of <hi>Portſmouth, Plimouth,</hi> and the Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications upon the Coaſt, and other His Majeſty's Works.</p>
            <p>The whole Subſiſtance of many Hundreds of Families in <hi>London,</hi> the ſaid Iſland, the Neighbouring Counties and Coaſts de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon theſe Quarries; and the Shipping of <hi>Weymouth, Brighthelmſton,</hi> and divers other Ports, manage this Trade to ſeveral Parts of <hi>England;</hi> and in time of Peace tranſport conſiderable Quantities of this Native Product.</p>
            <p>Upon the Third of this Inſtant <hi>February,</hi> 1695. a prodigious Calamity befel the ſaid Iſland; all the Ground betwixt the Quarry and the Sea extending at leaſt ſixty Acres, moving for three Days together, and ſinking thirty Foot and more, and ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it ſelf farther into the Sea; whereby the Harbours and Peers of Moles (built at great Expence) were ruined and deſtroyed; the Cranes lately built of vaſt Timber, Broke; the Ways and Paſſages, cut through the Rocks to the Peers, ſunk and intercepted; ſo that without great Expence the Quarry is become uſeleſs, and Thouſands of People are depriv'd of their Subſiſtence.</p>
            <p>The Uſe of the King's Quarry there, was granted by King <hi>Charles</hi> II. to the Dean and Chapter of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s, to raiſe Stone for Rebuilding the Church of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s; but the Ways, Cranes and Peers, have been upheld and repaired out of the Coal Duty of Eighteenpence <hi>per</hi> Chaldron, appointed for Rebuilding the Cathedral and Parochial Churches of <hi>London,</hi> by Two Acts of Parliament formerly made for that Purpoſe.</p>
            <p>The ſaid Duty determines at <hi>Michaelmas</hi> in the Year 1700. after which time Sixpence <hi>per</hi> Chaldron is granted to the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phans of <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For ſome Years paſt Fraight of Shipping hath ſo increaſed, that it is become near double to what it was formerly: By reaſon whereof, and the Impoſitions upon Forreign Timber and Iron, and the great Rate of Oak Timber (altho the Works of the Cathedral are very far advanced) it will not be poſſible to compleat the ſame by the Duty aforeſaid within the time allotted. Alſo ſome Parochial Churches tho uſed at preſent for Divine Service are not finiſhed; and it is adjudged convenient, that ſome Houſes which are too near to the North ſide of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s be removed farther, to prevent the danger of Firing that great and expenſieve Fabrick.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>VVherefore it is Humbly deſired, that in order to Compleat the ſaid Cathedral and other Churches, and to recover the Quarries and defray the Charge of Repairing the Peers, Cranes and VVays (without which alſo they cannot be Built) the ſaid Duty upon Coals, or ſuch part thereof as ſhall be thought neceſſary, be continued for <gap reason="blank" extent="1 span">
