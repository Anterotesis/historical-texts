            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The CASE OF THE Right Honourable <hi>William Harbourd,</hi> Eſq; and Sir <hi>Francis Guybon,</hi> Knight, choſen Members for the Burrough of <hi>Thetford,</hi> to ſerve in this preſent Parliament, The Burrough of <hi>Thetford</hi> is an Ancient Burrough; and by Preſcription ſends two Burgeſſes to Repreſent them in Parliament.</head>
            <head type="sub">The Right Honourable <hi>William Harbourd,</hi> Eſq; and Sir <hi>Francis Guybon</hi> are Choſen and Return'd by the Old Corporation AND Sir <hi>Joſeph Williamſon,</hi> Knight, and <hi>Adam Felton,</hi> Eſq; by the New One.</head>
            <p>In the 16th. of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> The Burrough of <hi>Thetford</hi> was incorporated by the name of the Mayor, Ten Principal Burgeſſes and Twenty Commoners.</p>
            <p>It was directed in the ſaid Charter, That the Mayor and Commoners ſhould, the <hi>Wedneſday</hi> next before <hi>Michaelmas</hi> day in every Year, between Nine and Eleven in the Morning, meet in the <hi>Guildhall,</hi> or ſome convenient place in the ſaid Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough, and there name two of the Chief Burgeſſes to the Inhabitants, who are to Elect one of them to be Mayor for the year enſuing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>NOTE,</hi> Under this Conſtitution it continued till 1681. at which time <hi>John Mendham</hi> was Mayor, who having got an Acquaintance with Sir <hi>Lionel Jenkins,</hi> then Principal Secretary of State to King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, did in the ſame time of his Mayoralty, endeavour to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline the Corporation, to chuſe ſuch Men to repreſent them as would ſerve the Deſigns then on foot; but finding he could have no influence over them, and that the time of his Mayoralty was almoſt expired; did on the Election Day, being <hi>Wedneſday</hi> before <hi>Michael<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,</hi> abſent himſelf till he thought the time of Election was over, thinking thereby to make void the Election.</p>
            <p>Yet notwithſtanding, the Commonalty did aſſemble themſelves, and did name two of the Principal Burgeſſes to be Mayor for the year enſuing, of whom <hi>Wormly Hetherſett</hi> (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one) was elected and declared Mayor.</p>
            <p>About Eleven of the Clock, <hi>Mendham</hi> (who had abſconded himſelf) came and appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and being told they had made choiſe of <hi>Hetherſett,</hi> ſeemingly approved of it, and made an excuſe that he did not come ſooner.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs <hi>Mendham</hi> (although <hi>Hetherſett</hi> had often applied himſelf to him) refuſed to ſwear him Mayor as he ought to have done; and although ſeveral <hi>Mandamus's</hi> were ſent to him (out of the <hi>King's Bench</hi>) injoyning him to do the ſame, yet he diſobeyed them all.</p>
            <p>Whereupon he was brought up the next Term by a Tipſtaff to anſwer his contempt, and was committed in Cuſtody to the Tipſtaff, from whom he got away and rid down Poſt to <hi>Thetford,</hi> and there called together ſuch of the Burgeſſes, as were of his Party, who Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>franchized two of the Members that were not of their ſtamp, and ſwore two new ones in their places, the one of whom ſtood at that time Excommunicated, and the other <hi>Mend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s Son, who was not above ſixteen years of age, and who did immediately vote a Surrender of the Charter, which they but juſt before ſwore to maintain, and it was accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly Surrendred and Inrolled in <hi>Chancery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Afterwards <hi>Mendham</hi> Solicites and gets a New Charter, wherein himſelf is made Mayor, and ſuch others added to him, as would ſerve the intent of a Surrender.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>NOTE,</hi> That at thelaſt Seſſion of Parliament, in a hearing before the Committee of Elections, concerning thoſe that were choſen by vertue of the New; and thoſe that were choſen by vertue of the Old Charter: The Committee did declare, that notwithſtanding the Surrender and Inrollment; Thoſe that were returned by vertue of the Old Charter were duly returned.</p>
            <p>And upon Report thereof the Houſe did unanimouſly agree with the Committee.</p>
