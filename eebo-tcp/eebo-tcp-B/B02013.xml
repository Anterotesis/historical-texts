            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Ruſty and Welbeloved, We greet you well. We received lately a Petition from the Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Common-Councell of Our City of <hi>London,</hi> by the hands of Perſons entruſted by them for the delivery, who found ſuch a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception from Vs, as well manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted Our regard to that body which ſent them; Though We well knew by whom that Petition was framed, and where peruſed and examined, before it was approved by thoſe from whom it ſeemed to be ſent, yet We were ſo willing to enter into a correſpondence with that Our Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and to receive any addreſſe and application from them according to that Invitation We had given by Our late Proclamation; And were ſo glad to find that there

was yet ſome hopes they would look to the Peace and happineſſe of that City, and at laſt ſever themſelves from any Faction or dependence, which might inſenſibly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve them in thoſe Calamities they did not foreſee, that We returned ſuch a gracious Anſwer therunto, ſo full of Candor and Affection, that the meaneſt Inhabitant of that Our Citty, if he carefully conſider the ſame, will find himſelfe concerned in it, and that We have had an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeciall care of his particular. With this anſwer of Ours We ſent a ſervant of Our own, in the company of thoſe who had been ſo well uſed here, to require and ſee that it might be communicated to the whole body of that Our City; not doubting but that both it &amp; the Bringer ſhould receive ſuch Entertainment there, as might manifeſt their due regard of Vs, &amp; of Our Affection to them: But to Our great wonder, We finde that after ten dayes Attendance, and ſuffering ridiculous Pamphlets to be publiſhed in Our name, as if We retracted Our former Reſolutions, (which Pamphlet We have cauſed to be burned by the hand of the Hangman, as We alſo require you to ſee don) inſtead of that admiſſion We expected to Our Meſſenger and Meſſage, guards of Armed Men have beene brought to keep Our good Subjects, to whom that Our Anſwer was directed, from being preſent at the reading thereof; and Speeches have been made by Strangers (who have been admitted to the Citty Councells, contrary to the Freedome and Cuſtome of thoſe meetings,) to Blaſt Our ſaid Anſwer, and to Diſhonour and Slander Vs, which if Our good Subjects there ſhall ſuffer, We ſhall be much diſcouraged in Our deſired correſpondence with that Ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:174857:4"/>
&amp; whoſoever ſhall not behave himſelfe like a good Subject in this Our Kingdome, ſhall not (if We can helpe it) receive the benefit and advantage of being Our Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject in any other, but all Forraigne Princes ſhall know, that as ſuch Perſon hath parted with his Loyalty to Us, ſo he muſt not hope for any Security by Us, and to that purpoſe Wee ſhall hence forward have a very inquiſitive Eye upon the Actions of all Our Subjects, that ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample may be made, how eaſie it is for Us to puniſh their diſloyalties abroad, who for a time may avoyd Our Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice at home. And to the end that none of Our good Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of that Our City may thinke themſelves bound to obey any of the Orders or Commands of the pretended Lord Major (whom We have and doe ſtill accuſe of high Treaſon, &amp; conſpiring to take Our life from Vs,) it is well knowne to thoſe Citizens who underſtand the Charter of that City (ſo amply granted by Our Royall Progeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and ſo gratiouſly confirmed by Us, &amp; of which We preſume Our good Subjects there doe ſtill deſire to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the benefit,) that the ſaid <hi>Iſaack Pennington</hi> was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver regularly elected, or lawfully admitted to bee Lord Major of that Our City, that in truth Alderman <hi>Cordwell,</hi> was by the plurality of voyces choſen, and that this Man was never preſented to, or admitted by Us, in ſuch man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as is preſcribed by the ſaid Charter, neither had that Iudge, who preſumed to ſweare him, any more colour of Law or Authority to adminiſter ſuch an Oath to him, then hee hath to doe the ſame to morrow to any other Alderman of the City: And Wee doe therefore hereby Declare the ſaid <hi>Iſaack Pennington</hi> not to bee Major of that Our City of <hi>London,</hi> and to have no lawfull Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to exerciſe the ſame, and that Our good Subjects of that Our City, ought not to ſubmit to any Order, dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:174857:4"/>
or commands which ſhall iſſue from him as Lord Major of that Our City, but that the ſame are void and of none effect. And Wee doe once more require you the Sheriffes of Our ſaid City, and all other the Magiſtrates of the ſame, in which all Our good Subjects of that City will aſſiſt you, that you cauſe the ſaid <hi>Iſaack Pennington, Ven, Fulke,</hi> and <hi>Manwaring,</hi> to bee apprehended and committed to ſafe Cuſtody, that Wee may proceed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them as guilty of high Treaſon, and principall Authours of thoſe Calamities which are now ſo heavy upon Our poore Subjects of that City, and if not ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly remedied, will in a ſhort time utterly confound a Place, and a People lately of ſo flouriſhing an eſtimation in all the parts of Chriſtendome, And where as We are informed that one <hi>Browne</hi> a Wood-monger, <hi>Titchborne</hi> a Linnen-Draper, and one <hi>Harvy</hi> a Silke-man, have exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed great Inſolencies and out rages in that Our City, and when many of Our good Subjects there, have aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled together in a peaceable and modeſt manner, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult about the Peace and welfare of that City, the ſaid mutinous and ſeditious Perſons have preſumed to lead Multitudes of armed Men againſt them, and by ſuch force have beaten, wounded, and killed Our good Subjects; Our Will and Pleaſure is, that if the ſaid <hi>Browne, Titch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne,</hi> and <hi>Harvy,</hi> or either of them, ſhall ſo farre neglect Our gratious offer of Pardon, as ſtill to engage them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in thoſe unwarrantable and ſeditious courſes, That you Our Sheriffes of <hi>London,</hi> rayſe power to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe the ſaid force, and that you and all Our Miniſters of Iuſtice, uſe your utmoſt meanes to apprehend the ſaid Perſons, and to bring them to condigne puniſhment. And We doe here by Declare, That it ſhall be lawfull for any of Our loving Subjects, to reſiſt and oppoſe the ſaid
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:174857:5"/>
Perſons, if they ſhall hereafter, in ſuch a Warlike manner, endeavour to moleſt them as they would doe Rebels and Traytours: And We hope that all Our good Subjects of that Our much injured City of <hi>London,</hi> doe take notice of Our Grace and Favour towards them in our ſo freely paſſing by and pardoning the Offences there committed againſt Us, as Wee have offered by Our Proclamation and Our late Anſwer; and of Our very earneſt deſire to bee with them, and to reſide amongſt them for their Comfort, Support, and Protection, if they ſhall, by firſt providing for their owne ſecurity (in ſuch manner as We have directed them in Our late Anſwer) give Us an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance that We may be ſafe there too; And that they doe likewiſe obſerve, that being by ſuch violence kept from them, Wee have done Our utmoſt endeavour to continue and advance the decayed trading of that Our City, by permitting and encouraging all reſort and traffique thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and therefore if by the ſtopping of Carriages, and ſeizing Commodities by other men, the commerce and correſpondence be broken betweene that place and Our good Subjects of other Counties, they will impute that miſchiefe to the true Authours of it, and looke upon Us onely as not able to helpe them. Doe but your Duties, and this Cloud, which threatens a preſent confuſion, will quickly vaniſh away, and you will enjoy all the Bleſſings of a happy Nation, to the which no endeavour of Ours ſhall bee wanting.</p>
