            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A LETTER <hi>From an Officer belonging to the Ordnance, on Board the Fleet lying in the Bay before the Iſle of Man; Giving an Account of the Duke of</hi> Schomberg's <hi>Arrival, and Landing of the Forces under his Command at</hi> Carrick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fergus <hi>in</hi> Ireland.</head>
            <p>Licenſed <hi>Auguſt</hi> the 19th 1689. <hi>J. F.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>From the</hi> Iſle <hi>of</hi> Man, Auguſt 15th.</p>
            <p>YEſterday ſeventh night we arrived at the Camp that was form'd near <hi>High-lake,</hi> in order to be Tranſported for <hi>Ireland;</hi> and laſt Saturday we Slipt our Stores and Proviſions that we brought with us; As alſo two hundred and fifty draught Horſes belonging to our Train of Artillery, after which we went on Board our ſelves.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Munday</hi> morning very early the Duke of <hi>Schomberg</hi> our General, with Lieutenant General <hi>Solms,</hi> ſet Sail, having Embarked two dayes before, the Wind being fair at Eaſt, with four Frigats, and about 70 or 80 Sail of other Ships, on Board which there were about 12000 Land Souldiers for the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Expedition, having given Orders, That the Veſſels on which the Artillery, Proviſions and Victual were Shipt, ſhould make what haſte they could after them under the Convoy of three Frigats that were left to accompany us, and joyn him in this Bay.</p>
            <p>About Eight a Clock that Morning, which was ſome hours after the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral had been under Sail, we ſet Sail, and the Wind continuing fair, came on <hi>Tueſday</hi> Morning to an Anchor in this place, being about 44. Sail in all. It was no ſmall Surpriſal to us, that after we had ſafely, and with what haſte we could come to the place of Rendevouz, to find no Tidings of our Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, nor meet with any Orders from him, there being no body left to direct us what we ſhould do, or what Courſe we ſhould ſteer; however we were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to ſtay until we heard from his Grace, which we had the good luck to do this Morning, by the <hi>Antelope</hi> Frigat, who Sail'd out of <hi>High-Lake</hi> with the General, and brought us Orders from his Excellency, to Sail with all poſſible ſpeed from hence, and to come and joyn him in the Lough of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rickfergus,</hi> where the Captain ſaid he had left him Landing the Forces in the Countrey on <hi>Antrim</hi> ſide. The Captain tells us, that the General having a fair Wind, did not think it needful to put in and come to an Anchor in this place, being reſolved to make the beſt of it, and proceed on his way: And further tells us, that the Town of <hi>Carrickfergus</hi> was not all burnt down, but only ſome Fort or Caſtle that was on a Rock that was blown up, that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor General <hi>Macarty</hi> was certainly wounded and taken Priſoner by the <hi>Inniskil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi> Men, who had given a very great Defeat to the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Army, as they were endeavouring to retire from the <hi>North</hi> after the Relief of <hi>London-Derry,</hi> and that it was credibly reported in thoſe parts, that there was hardly a Body of 500 <hi>Iriſh</hi> together in all the <hi>North</hi> Counties of that Kingdom.</p>
