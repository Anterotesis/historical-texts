            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         </projectDesc>
         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

So that in the Name and Dread and Authority of the Living and Eternal God, I am to Declare unto you, and yet once more to Warn you, That the dreadful Cup of Vengeance that you are to drink, and muſt drink, and cannot eſcape, can not be meaſured by any thing that is paſt. You are gazing after Changes. As you grow worſe and worſe by all the Changes and Revolutions your eyes have ſeen, and your ears have heard of; So the Changes that ſhall be, ſhall be ſtill <hi>worſe and worſe for you.</hi> Ye who are ſeated in Unrighteouſneſs, who have a Lie in your right hand, in whom the love of the Earth, and Vanity, and the ſenſual ſpirit is ſo ſtrong, that <hi>after your Lovers ye will go</hi>; your minds abroad after a dead Carcaſs of Words, of Forms, of Ordinances (as you call them) and all your ſcope, expectations and deſires, to have theſe reſtored to you and your diſcontents, grudgings and murmurings, becauſe the<gap reason="illegible: bleedthrough" extent="1 letter">

            <p>This is the Day of God, the deſirable bleſſed Day; and this is come, and coming yet more and more abundantly in Power and great Glory! But Wo to the Hypocrite, to the mind that ſaies and does not, filled with ſwelling words and expectatious; and the Life, the Seed of Righteouſneſs, that wherein is the Reſtauration of all things, opppreſſed, bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened in their particulars, above their meaſures exalted; Such ſhall be, ſhall be abundantly filled with the fruit of their own way. Oh! that all herein concerned could read their name, and hear and fear, and conſider, and forbear, ere it be too late, the day of their Viſitation paſt over, night come on wherein none, can work; their Judgment ſealed, God ceaſed to be a Reprover in them, till the Day of Vengeance overtake as a Whirlwind; as in the Name, and Dread, and Power of the living and Eternal God I do declare, it ſhall this hypocritical Generation of Profeſſors, of all Ranks, Forms, Sorts and Sizes, in a way can not be meaſured by any thing that is yet paſt.</p>
            <p>This is the Word of the Lord God to you, whether ye Will yet hear or forbear.</p>
