            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>An Exact ACCOUNT Of the taking by Storm the ENGLISH TOWN OF ATHLONE, <hi>JUNE</hi> the 21ſt.</head>
            <head type="sub">In a Letter from <hi>DUBLIN, June</hi> the 23th.</head>
            <p>ON the Nineteenth, about 3 in the Morning, our Advanc'd Guards began to March from <hi>Balliburno,</hi> toward <hi>Athlone,</hi> and by 9 Beat the Enemy into the Walls of the Town on this ſide of the River, out of ſome Ditches they ſeem'd to diſpute; our Men lodging themſelves in thoſe Ditches: We planted three Guns on the Ford, on that ſide of <hi>Athlone</hi> toward <hi>Lanesborough,</hi> and played all day on a Breaſt work the Enemy had about it: About ſix in the Morning our Cannon came up, and Nine Guns of Eighteen Pounders were drawn to a Battery, raiſed between <hi>Isker</hi> and <hi>Athlone:</hi> This Night came up and joyn'd us the Party ſent from <hi>Balliburno</hi> to <hi>Lanesburough,</hi> under Command of the Lord <hi>Lisburn.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The 20th. at 7 in the Morning, the Battery was finiſh'd, and Nine Eighteen Pounders mounted; at 8 they began furiouſly to play on a Baſtion that defended the Curtain between the <hi>Dublin Gate</hi> and the River, and by 12 made a Breach the whole breadth of the Baſtion, on which they continued to play, to hinder the Enemy from making any work within the Breach: About 3 in the Afternoon, the General gave Orders for all things to be made ready, to Storm that part of the Town on this ſide the River; which was put in Execution about five. He detach'd 500 Granadiers, ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain'd by ſeveral Regiments of Foot, and a good Body of Horſe, a Lieutenant of <hi>Camboon</hi>'s Regiment Headed the firſt party of Granadiers, who from under the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of a Hill, about 400 yards from the Town, advanc'd a good pace, and the Lieutenant with that Party of Granadiers, came to the Breach, the Enemy Firing briskly againſt them, all which hindered our Mens advancing, who without firing one Shot, came up to the Breach, and threw in their Granadoes; which ſo frighted the Enemy, that they quitted their Walls, and fled to the Bridge: Our Men got o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Breach, purſued them bravely, and poſſeſs'd themſelves of the Church. The brave Brigadier <hi>Steward</hi> Commanded the Attacque, as he did the Trenches the Night before, and purſued the Enemy to the Bridge, with his Sword, hewing the Enemy, and the Men throwing Granadoes among them, kill'd a great many; and great numbers to avoid the fury of our Souldiers, leaped into the <hi>Shannon,</hi> and there periſh'd.</p>
            <p>Brigadier <hi>Steward</hi> was ſhot in the Right Arm. We loſt few Men in the Attack, and few wounded. The Enemies loſs is uncertain. We made a Lodgment at the Foot of the Bridge, where we covered our ſelves with Tachines, and made a Work; And this Evening drew off our three Guns from the Ford, and the nine Guns from the Battery, into the Town. This Morning the eleven Guns, and three Mortars, left at <hi>Balliburno,</hi> were ſent for. In this Action all our Men behaved themſelves with great Reſolution and Bravery, to the Gneral's great ſatisfaction. Lieuetenant Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onel <hi>Kirk</hi> of Brigadier <hi>Villiers</hi> his Regiment, was ſhot dead by a Cannon Ball from the Caſtle, as he lay on a Hill to ſee the Action.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Cork,</hi> of the 19th, they write that 1500 of the Army and Militia, with four Field Pieces of Cannon of 24<hi>l.</hi> Ball, under the Command of the Lord Juſtice <hi>Cox,</hi> and Colonel <hi>Haſtings,</hi> Marched towards <hi>Ballicloph,</hi> a Gariſon of the Enemis, and as the Letters came away, ſay, an Account came of ſome Action, and ſome Hundereds of the Enemies being kill'd: But the Particulars do not tell us.</p>
            <p>The Militia has likewiſe been ſcouring the Bog of <hi>Allen,</hi> and have kill'd ſeveral Raparees.</p>
            <p>This is what is worth notice, ſince my laſt has come to the knowledge of.</p>
