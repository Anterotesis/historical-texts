         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Foraſmuch as We, by divers Acts of Parliaments and Proclamations, have expreſſed and declared Our Royal care and reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, to protect the Orthodox and well-affected Clergy and Miniſters: And to that effect and purpoſe, a Proclamation was iſſued by Us upon the fifth of <hi>March</hi> laſt, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding all Heretors and Parochioners within the Weſtern Shires therein mentioned, to protect and defend the perſons, families and goods of their reſpective Miniſters within their ſeveral Paroches, from all affronts and injuries to be committed by inſolent and diſ-affected perſons to the preſent Government, in manner, with, and under the certifications and pains therein contained. And nevertheleſs, the malice and rage of ſuch perſons is ſo implacable againſt loyal Miniſters, upon no other account, but that they are faithful and obedient to Our Laws and Authority, that of late, ſince the ſaid Proclamation, divers outrages have been committed within the ſaids weſtern and other Shires, by invading and wounding the perſons of ſeveral Miniſters, aſſaulting them in their houſes, and plundering and robbing their goods, to the great ſcandal of Religion, contempt of Our Authority, and diſcouragement of the Preachers of the Goſpel, and is a great incouragement to ſuch ſacraligious and wicked perſons, that within the Paroches where ſuch inſolencies are committed and done to Miniſters, there is no wanting perſons of the ſame temper and principles, who do ſecretly favour and comply with them; and they do preſume, that the Actors with-drawing, the Parochioners will not be queſtioned, and that they will not think themſelves concerned to prevent or repair the wrongs done to the Miniſters. Therefore We, with advice of the Lords of Our Privy Council, command and charge all Heretors, Life-renters and others, having any real intereſt and rent within the ſeveral Paroches of the Kingdom, whither they reſide within the ſame or not, their Bailies, Chamberlains and others having truſt under them, and all other Parochioners, to protect, defend, and ſecure the perſons, families and goods of their Miniſters, not only in the exerciſe of their Miniſterial Function, but in their dwelling-houſes, or being elſewhere within the Paroch, from all injuries, affronts and prejudices which they may incur in their perſons and goods, from the violence and invaſion of any phanatick or diſ-affected perſon: and that upon the notice of any attempt of ſuch, they immediately repair to any place where they ſhall beat ſuch injuries are offered, and ſeize upon the perſons of the committers; and in caſe that they flye out of the ſaids bounds, that they give notice to the Sheriff or any Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon or Forces that ſhall be neareſt to theſe places, that they may purſue them till they be apprehended and brought to tryal: With certification, that if any ſuch outrages ſhall be committed, the Actors, and all perſons who ſhall have any acceſsion to the ſame, and ſhall aid, aſſiſt, or any way comply with, or ſhall willingly reſſet and conceal the delinquents, ſhall be proceeded againſt and puniſhed with all ſeverity, as equally guilty with the invadors. And farther, if they be not apprehended and brought to tryal by the means and diligence of the Parochioners, Letters ſhall be directed at the inſtance of Our Advocat, to cite the Parochioners to appear before the Lords of Our Privy Council, at the leaſt to ſend three or four of their number ſpecially authorized for that effect, to hear and ſee the Parochioners decerned to pay to the Miniſter for reparation, damage and intereſt, ſuch a ſum and fine as Our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil ſhall think fit to determine, (ſpecial conſideration being alwayes had of well-affected Heretors and Parochio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, who conſtantly attend the publick Ordinances, and as they are required by the Miniſters, concur with them in the exerciſe of Church-diſcipline, who are to be relieved of the half of the fine to be impoſed, which is to be payed by the diſ-affected, who are to be tryed to be ſuch by the Juſtices of Peace, or other Judge-ordinar) and a citation of Parochioners in general, at the Mercat-croſs of the Shire, being intimate at the Paroch-church upon a Sunday before-noon after divine Service, We declare to be ſufficient; and the ſaid ſum ſo to be modified, ſhall be divided amongſt the Heretors and Life-renters and others, according to their reſpective Valuations, and is to be advanced and payed by them to the Sheriffs, Stewarts, or Bailies of Regalities and Baileries, who are hereby ordained by themſelves or their Deputes, to uplift the ſame for the uſe of the Miniſter, and to uſe all lawful execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for that effect: And for relief of the ſaids Heretors, Life-renters and others foreſaids, their ſeveral Tennents are hereby ordained to pay the third part of the ſeveral proportions payable by their Maſters; and where any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon has more Tennents then one, the third part payable for relief of their Maſter is to be divided and proportioned betwixt their Tennents proportionally, and according to the duty they pay <hi>reſpective:</hi> And if any queſtion ariſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anent, either amongſt the Tennents themſelves, or the Tennents and their Maſters, the ſame is to be determined by the Iuſtices of Peace or Sheriff of the Shires, or other Iudges Ordinar in whoſe jurisdiction they reſide, in the option of the complainers. And ordains theſe preſents to be printed, and publiſhed at the Mercat-croſs of the head Burghs of this Kingdom, and read at all Paroch-churches upon a Sunday before-noon, after divine Service, that none pretend ignorance.</p>
