            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A POEM UPON THE Impriſonment of Mr. Calamy IN NEWGATE.</head>
            <byline>By <hi>Robert Wild,</hi> D. D. Author of the late <hi>Iter Boreale.</hi>
            </byline>
            <lg>
               <l>THis Page I ſend you Sir, your <hi>Newgate</hi> Fate</l>
               <l>Not to condole, but to congratulate.</l>
               <l>I envy not our Mitred men their Places,</l>
               <l>Their rich Preſerments, nor their richer <hi>Faces</hi>:</l>
               <l>To ſee them Steeple upon Steeple ſet,</l>
               <l>As if they meant that way to Heaven get.</l>
               <l>I can behold them take into their Gills</l>
               <l>A doſe of Churches, as men ſwallow Pills,</l>
               <l>And never grieve at it: Let them ſwim in Wine</l>
               <l>While others drown in tears, I'le not repine;</l>
               <l>But my heart truly grudges (I confeſs)</l>
               <l>That you thus loaded are with happineſs;</l>
               <l>For ſo it is: And you more bleſſed are</l>
               <l>In <hi>Peters</hi> Chain, than if you fate in's Chair.</l>
               <l>One Sermon hath preferr'd you to ſuch Honour,</l>
               <l>A man could ſcarce have had from Biſhop <hi>Banner</hi>;</l>
               <l>Whilſt we (your Brethren) poor Erraticks be,</l>
               <l>You are a glorious fixed Star we ſee.</l>
               <l>Hundreds of us turn out of Houſe and Home,</l>
               <l>To a ſafe Habitation you are come.</l>
               <l>What though it be a Goal? Shame and Diſgrace</l>
               <l>Riſe only from the Crime, not from the Place.</l>
               <l>Who thinks reproach or injurie is done.</l>
               <l>By an Eclipſe to the unſpotted <hi>Sun</hi>?</l>
               <l>He only by that black upon his brow</l>
               <l>Allures ſpectators more; and ſo do you.</l>
               <l>Let me find Honey, though upon a Rod,</l>
               <l>And prize the Priſon, where the Keeper's <hi>God</hi>:</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Newgate</hi> or <hi>Hell</hi> were <hi>Heaven</hi> if Chriſt were there,</l>
               <l>He made the Stable ſo, and Sepulchre.</l>
               <l>Indeed the place did for your preſence call;</l>
               <l>Priſons do want perſuming moſt of all.</l>
               <l>Thanks to the Biſhop and his good Lord Mayor,</l>
               <l>Who turn'd the Den, of Thieves into a Houſe of Prayer:</l>
               <l>And may ſome Thief by you converted be,</l>
               <l>Like him who ſuffer'd in Chriſts company.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Now would I had fight of your Mittimus;</l>
               <l>Fain would I know why you are dealt with thus.</l>
               <l>Jaylor, ſet forth your Priſoner at the Bar,</l>
               <l>Sir, you ſhall here what your offences are.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Firſt, It is prov'd that you being dead in Law</l>
               <l>(As if you car'd not for that death a ſtraw)</l>
               <l>Did walk and haunt your Church, as if you'd ſcare</l>
               <l>Away the Reader and his Common-Prayer.</l>
               <l>Nay 'twill be prov'd you did not only walk,</l>
               <l>But like a <hi>Puritan</hi> your <hi>Ghoſt</hi> did talk.</l>
               <l>Dead, and yet Preach! theſe <hi>Presbyterian</hi> ſlaves</l>
               <l>Will not give over Preaching in their Graves.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>
                  <hi>Item,</hi> You playd the Thief, and if't be ſo,</l>
               <l>Good reaſon (Sir) to <hi>Newgate</hi> you ſhall go:</l>
               <l>And now you're there, ſome dare to ſwear you are</l>
               <l>The greateſt Pick-pocket that ere came there:</l>
               <l>Your Wife too, little better than your ſelf you make,</l>
               <l>She's the Receiver of each Purſe you take.</l>
               <l>But your great Theft, you act it in your Church,</l>
               <l>(I do not mean you did your Sermon lurch,</l>
               <l>That's crime <hi>Cononical</hi>) but you did pray</l>
               <l>And preach, ſo that you ſtole mens hearts away.</l>
               <l>So that good man to whom your place doth fall,</l>
               <l>Will find they have no heart for him at all:</l>
               <l>This Felony deſerv'd Impriſonment;</l>
               <l>What can't you <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> be content</l>
               <l>Sermons to make except you preach them too;</l>
               <l>They that your places have, this Work can't do.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Thirdly, 'tis prov'd, when you pray moſt devout</l>
               <l>For all good men, you leave the Biſhops out:</l>
               <l>This makes Seer <hi>Sheldon</hi> by his powerful ſpel</l>
               <l>Conjure and lay you ſafe in <hi>Newgate</hi>-hell:</l>
               <l>Would I were there too, I ſhould like it well.</l>
               <l>I would you durſt ſwaft puniſhment with me;</l>
               <l>Pain makes me fitter for the company</l>
               <l>Of roaring Boyes; and you may lie a bed,</l>
               <l>Now your Name's up; pray do it in my ſtead,</l>
               <l>And if it be deny'd us to change places,</l>
               <l>Let us for ſympathy compare our caſes;</l>
               <l>For if in ſuffering we both agree.</l>
               <l>Sir, I may challenge you to pity me;</l>
               <l>I am the older Goal-bird; my hard fate</l>
               <l>Hath kept me twenty years in <hi>Cripple-gate</hi>;</l>
               <l>Old <hi>Biſhop Gout,</hi> that Lordly proud diſeaſe,</l>
               <l>Took my fat body for his Dioceſs,</l>
               <l>Where he keeps Court, there viſits every L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </l>
               <l>And makes them (<hi>Levite</hi>-like) conform to him,</l>
               <l>Severely he doth Article each joint,</l>
               <l>And makes inquiry into every point:</l>
               <l>A bitter enemy to preaching; he</l>
               <l>Hath half a year ſometimes ſuſpended me:</l>
               <l>And if he find me painful in my ſtation,</l>
               <l>Down I am ſure to go next Viſitation:</l>
               <l>He binds up, looſeth; ſets up and pulls down;</l>
               <l>Pretends he draws ill humours from the Crown:</l>
               <l>But I am ſure he maketh ſuch ado,</l>
               <l>His humors trouble Head and members too:</l>
               <l>He hath me now in hand, and ere he goes,</l>
               <l>I fear for <hi>Hereticks</hi> he'le burn my toes.</l>
               <l>O! I would give all I am worth, a fee,</l>
               <l>That from his juriſdiction I were free.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Now Sir, you find our ſufferings do agree,</l>
               <l>One Biſhop clapt up you, another me:</l>
               <l>But oh! the difference too is very great,</l>
               <l>You are allow'd to walk, to drink and eat,</l>
               <l>I want them all, and never a penny get.</l>
               <l>And though you be debar'd your liberty,</l>
               <l>Yet all your Viſitors I hope are free,</l>
               <l>Good men, good women and good Angels come</l>
               <l>And make your Priſon better than your home.</l>
               <l>Now may it be ſo till your foes repent</l>
               <l>They gave you ſuch a rich Impriſonment.</l>
               <l>May for the greater comfort of your lives,</l>
               <l>Your lying in be better than your Wives.</l>
               <l>May you a thouſand friendly papers ſee,</l>
               <l>And none prove emptie, except this from me.</l>
               <l>And if you ſtay, may I come keep your door,</l>
