            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>I Pray now attend and give ear to the jest,</l>
               <l>A Country-man he came late from the Weſt,</l>
               <l>for he had a mind to ſee my <hi>Lord Mayor,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>And other fine Folk which it ſeems lodged there:</l>
               <l>Then up to the City at length he did range,</l>
               <l>Where ſeeing brave Gallants, in rich golden fringe</l>
               <l>But he above all did admire and ſtrange</l>
               <l>To zee the fine folk at the <hi>Royal Exchange.</hi>
               </l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The Country-man amazed did ſtand,</l>
               <l>And looking about with his Whip in his hand,</l>
               <l>Then come a fine fellow, a <hi>Don</hi> of the Town,</l>
               <l>And called him Bumpkin and Country Clown,</l>
               <l>And asked him how he dare to preſume,</l>
               <l>To Lag here and Loiter, thus fill up the Room,</l>
               <l>Amongſt theſe gay Ladies in Silk and Perfume,</l>
               <l>Be gone and pack off, or the ſtacks is your doom.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>I pray who are you? then the Plow-man reply'd,</l>
               <l>That does ſo ſcornfully here me deride,</l>
               <l>Fine-fellow, ſaid he, ſeeing you are unkind,</l>
               <l>In ſhort I ſhall tell you a piece of my mind,</l>
               <l>I came now to ſee my Lord Fayor his good grace</l>
               <l>I fear not the angry frowns of your face,</l>
               <l>As long as I liſt, I will ſtay in this place,</l>
               <l>Or on your Gay Coat I will lay a long Lace.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>For why ſaid the Plowman, I care not a figg,</l>
               <l>For all your high words, and your looking ſo big,</l>
               <l>This gallant was then in a paſſion indeed,</l>
               <l>And thus in a fury began to proceed,</l>
               <l>As making a proffer to give him a kick,</l>
               <l>The Plow-men perceiving him juſt in the nick,</l>
               <l>He told him his name it was reſolute <hi>Dick,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Then up with his laſh, and he gave him a lick.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>O then this fine Fellow began for to roar,</l>
               <l>Then preſently came in twenty and more,</l>
               <l>Who asked the Plowman, how dare he to d<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>'t,</l>
               <l>Since he was a perſon of worthy repute:</l>
               <l>He firſt did abuſe me in calling me Clown,</l>
               <l>I could not forbear, but I gave him a frown;</l>
               <l>Why ſhould thoſe fine fellows run Husband men down,</l>
               <l>You can't live without us in city or town.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Nay Plowman, i'de have you well underſtand,</l>
               <l>That we have both Silver and Gold at command,</l>
               <l>Rich chains &amp; choice jewels, with diamonds &amp; rings,</l>
               <l>With plenty of ſpices, and other fine things:</l>
               <l>Of many Rich Coffers we carry the Keys,</l>
               <l>We have ſuch Eſtates that we live at our eaſe,</l>
               <l>We eat and we drink and we walk where we pleaſe,</l>
               <l>Then what do you think of ſuch fellows as theſe?</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>For all your rich Iewels, you ſtarving may dye,</l>
               <l>If we do not bring in a daily ſupply,</l>
               <l>We plow and we ſow, and we harrow and mow,</l>
               <l>We have both the Milk, and the Honey you know:</l>
               <l>We ne're are without a good pudding and ſowſe,</l>
               <l>Then what need you <hi>Londoners</hi> make ſuch a touze,</l>
               <l>If we did not labour you could not keep houſe,</l>
               <l>You gallants would ſoon ſh— as ſmall as a Mouſe.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Both Linnen and Woollen what e're we will wear,</l>
               <l>We have of our own by induſtrious care,</l>
               <l>We daily delight in much pleaſure and mirth,</l>
               <l>And always receive the firſt fruit of the Earth:</l>
               <l>To flout us I think you were ſomething too bold,</l>
               <l>You'd ſtarve if you fed upon Silver or Gold,</l>
               <l>We have corn, cattle and ſheep in our Fold,</l>
               <l>With rich beans and bacon, eat hold belly hold.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The <hi>Londoners</hi> preſently laughing out-right,</l>
               <l>For in his diſcourſe they had taken delight,</l>
               <l>They ſaid it was true, and they did him commend,</l>
               <l>And thus the whole quarrel was ſoon at an end:</l>
               <l>The Plow-man they freely began to extal,</l>
               <l>He ſoon got the favour of great men and ſmall,</l>
               <l>And thus there debate did immediately fall,</l>
               <l>The Plow-man in wit was too hard for them all.</l>
