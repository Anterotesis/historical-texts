         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A MENE TEKEL TO FIFTH MONARCHY, WITH The Knavery of the Cloak.</head>
            <lg>
               <l>
                  <hi>ENGLAND'S</hi> a Ship with adverſe weather croſs'd,</l>
               <l>With wind and waves, ſchiſme and ſedition toſs'd.</l>
               <l>The <hi>Chiliaſt,</hi> (heavens, (what a ridle's he?)</l>
               <l>Would hew down Kings, to heave up <hi>Monarchie.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>He would conſider all his Plots as vain,</l>
               <l>Did he remember, but, by whom Kings reign;</l>
               <l>Not hope with idle charmes the Moon to move:</l>
               <l>Nor, for a King croak with the Froggs to <hi>Jove.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>To holy <hi>John</hi> did Heaven hid truths reveal,</l>
               <l>Yet the ſame words to thee, thoſe truths conceal,</l>
               <l>Which, ſhould be preach to thee? He took in hand</l>
               <l>A miracle, to make thee underſtand.</l>
               <l>Think'ſt thou that <hi>Jeſus,</hi> meant he ſuch a thing,</l>
               <l>Would countenance thy treaſon to thy King?</l>
               <l>Or need thy help; ſhall not the ſon of God</l>
               <l>Daſh them in piece, with an iron Rod?</l>
               <l>If he were hungry, would he ask thee bread?</l>
               <l>He cannot want a Crown that made the Head:</l>
               <l>Will he his Kingdome to thy care referre,</l>
               <l>Who is himſelf <hi>the mighty Counceller?</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Doſt thou believe that thou canſt court him down</l>
               <l>From a Caeleſtial to an Earthly Crown?</l>
               <l>Or that hel leave, as one in love with ſcornes,</l>
               <l>A Crown of Glory, for a Crown of Thornes.</l>
               <l>Look in his Word, for he has told thee there</l>
               <l>My Kingdom's not of this World; If it were?</l>
               <l>Then would my Servants fight: Hence therefore yee</l>
               <l>Fight not for Chriſt, but for your ſelves I ſee</l>
               <l>So have I ſeen a Cabbage fair curld head,</l>
               <l>In which a loathſom Toad has made her bed.</l>
               <l>What evil fury has the rout poſſeſs'd</l>
               <l>That like the Spirits, they can take no reſt,</l>
               <l>But even the places, a ſhort Peace has dry'd,</l>
               <l>Muſt flow again with blood for which Chriſt dy'd.</l>
               <l>Come, come, your actions give your words the lie,</l>
               <l>Whom you pretend to crown, you crucifie.</l>
               <l>Chriſt's ſervice does conſiſt in no ſuch thing;</l>
               <l>He's never true to God that's falſe to's King.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>I now ſhould to thoſe numerous Sects proceed</l>
               <l>That do as Vermine crawle about the head,</l>
               <l>And like a ſhoal of Herrins, do reveal</l>
               <l>A flaming mountain from their flaſhy zeal</l>
               <l>But (fry) I wave yee, and convert mine eye</l>
               <l>To that Leviathan Presbytery.</l>
               <l>Not but you are though each at other railes,</l>
               <l>Like <hi>Sampſon</hi>'s Foxes all ty'd by the tayles,</l>
               <l>As if no Devil but a Covenant,</l>
               <l>Could keep the Church in a ſtate militant.</l>
               <l>Do we not know (as much as in you lay)</l>
               <l>You make the Lords Inheritance a prey:</l>
               <l>And ſend to all the Nations round about</l>
               <l>If it be poſſible to root us out?</l>
               <l>To that infernal Bogge, (O conſcience tender)</l>
               <l>To get the Devil for your Faiths defender.</l>
               <l>That treacherous Lake of <hi>Pluto,</hi> den of Thieves,</l>
               <l>That ſynagogue of Satan that receives</l>
               <l>All ſorts of Aſſaſſins that can but bring</l>
               <l>A blaſphemy againſt the name of King.</l>
               <l>That mart of Superſtition, that by odds</l>
               <l>More ſeveral Worſhips hath, then <hi>Rome</hi> had Gods.</l>
               <l>Nor has, then the Religion they abuſe,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Proteus</hi> more ſhapes, or the <hi>Camelion</hi> hues,</l>
               <l>That ſource of ſchiſme, where a man may find</l>
               <l>Religion bag'd up, as a Lapland wind:</l>
               <l>Only they <hi>Papiſts</hi> hate, but that is plain,</l>
               <l>Cauſe the profeſſion of the King of <hi>Spain</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Worſhip to them goes all to ſix and ſeven;</l>
               <l>Gain is their God, and th' <hi>Indies</hi> are their Heaven.</l>
               <l>They fear not Hell, but rather are content;</l>
               <l>For in the deep th' are in their Element.</l>
               <l>I would the Gibbets now were to be ſeen,</l>
               <l>That with <hi>Eraſmus</hi> they might hang between.</l>
               <l>Yet Church and State too, you are hurrying tow'rd</l>
               <l>This filthy <hi>Minotaur</hi> to be devour'd.</l>
               <l>Look but into your ſelves, and tell me (Sirs)</l>
               <l>Does not this ſhow yee <hi>rigid Presbyters?</hi>
               </l>
               <l>This, this too truly tells us faith is fled</l>
               <l>From the <hi>long Cloak,</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> is long ſince dead.</l>
               <l>What do yee, but in a Religious veſt</l>
               <l>Turn Uſurers, and plot for <hi>Intereſt?</hi>
               </l>
               <l>You want a Parliament now to advance</l>
               <l>Your <hi>good Old Cauſe,</hi> with peals of <hi>Ordinance.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>But thanks to Heaven, our wiſe &amp; wary City</l>
               <l>Has order'd ſome into a cloſe Committee;</l>
               <l>And yet, alaſs, they do not <hi>Newgate</hi> fear,</l>
               <l>One of their tribe got a good Living there.</l>
               <l>But that they ſhould deſign our ruine thus,</l>
               <l>When God is viſiting both them and us?</l>
               <l>Is an offence that multiplies their blame,</l>
               <l>And leaves them nothing, but their ſin and ſhame.</l>
