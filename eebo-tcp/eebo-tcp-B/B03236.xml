            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>O Heavy ſtroke! Oh bitter lamentation!</l>
               <l>Scarce will my Tears give way to vent my Paſſion.</l>
               <l>My Tears ſo overflow, I ſcarce can guide</l>
               <l>My trembling Hand. O ſtop, you ſwelling Tide</l>
               <l>Of briniſh Tears! Alas! my Heart doth break<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </l>
               <l>So ſtrong's my Grief, although my Muſe be weak.</l>
               <l>Though to the Mournful Muſes I make ſuit</l>
               <l>For their aſſiſtance, and they all ſtand mute:</l>
               <l>My Grief and Sorrow will my Muſe ſupply,</l>
               <l>And teach me to Indite an ELEGIE.</l>
               <l>My Grief ſufficient Matter will infuſe</l>
               <l>Into my Heart: True Sorrow needs no Muſe.</l>
               <l>Dear <hi>LOVEDAY</hi>'s Dead, that for this many Years</l>
               <l>Has fed the Flock of Chriſt: Let floods of Tears</l>
               <l>Run from the Conduits of your moiſtened Eyes;</l>
               <l>How ſhall the Flocks be fed when th' Shepherd dies?</l>
               <l>When Shepherds die, and cruel Wolves remain,</l>
               <l>The tender Lambs have reaſon to complain.</l>
               <l>Dear <hi>Samuel</hi>'s gone, he's gone that us'd to keep,</l>
               <l>A faithful Watch, when we could take our ſleep.</l>
               <l>He's gone! he's gone! that Sacred Food provided:</l>
               <l>Ah! he is gone, by whom the Flock was guided.</l>
               <l>How careful was he always to provide</l>
               <l>Good Food, and Food convenient beſide,</l>
               <l>For tender Babes, who in the Faith were young,</l>
               <l>Provided Milk, and alſo for the Strong,</l>

               <l>The Ignorant this Holy Man inſtructed</l>
               <l>In paths of Righteouſneſs, and then Conducted</l>
               <l>Into the Fold of Chriſt, where he with care</l>
               <l>Did feed them as Chriſt's Flock, and did not ſpare,</l>
               <l>But ſpent his ſtrength to find good Paſture out;</l>
               <l>Strengthning the Weak, confirming ev'ry Doubt.</l>
               <l>And that which will perpetuate his Name,</l>
               <l>And mount him up upon the Wings of Fame;</l>
               <l>And make him like the Stars of Heaven ſhine;</l>
               <l>Yea, make him to the World appear Divine:</l>
               <l>And make his ever Honour'd Name to live,</l>
               <l>When Death has not another ſtroke to give.</l>
               <l>Oh! 'twas his pious, rare, and vertuous Life,</l>
               <l>The Loſs of whom calls for a world of Grief.</l>
               <l>Had I but skill to paint his Vertues forth,</l>
               <l>Sutable to his Merits, and their worth;</l>
               <l>So many were they, and ſo Excellent,</l>
               <l>I ſhould but leave the World a <hi>Monument</hi>
               </l>
               <l>To be admir'd, rather than believ'd:</l>
               <l>But ah! he's gone; for which my Soul is griev'd.</l>
               <l>Grief in my Heart's impreſſions are ſo deep,</l>
               <l>While <hi>Loveday</hi> with his Vertues falls aſleep,</l>
               <l>There's no Phyſician in the Earth can Cure;</l>
               <l>And ſcarce obtain I patience to endure.</l>
               <l>Were't only I that did this Loſs ſuſtain,</l>
               <l>The Contemplation of dear <hi>Loveday</hi>'s gain</l>
               <l>Would much abate the Grief, that now ſurpriſes</l>
               <l>My Love-ſick Soul: But hence my Grief ariſes,</l>
               <l>His Death's a publick Loſs, and every Eye</l>
               <l>Has cauſe to drop a Tear, as well as I.</l>
               <l>His Life and Doctrine both were excellent,</l>
               <l>His Doctrine ſound, his Life a Preſident.</l>
               <l>Miſts that obſcur'd God's Univerſal Love</l>
               <l>He did diſperſe, and wholly did remove.</l>
               <l>And though the Lord has call'd dear <hi>Samu'l</hi> hence,</l>
               <l>Yet has he left us ſuch an Evidence</l>
               <l>Of God's indeared Love to all Mankind,</l>
               <l>That we who for a time are left behind,</l>
               <l>Have cauſe to turn our Mourning to a Song,</l>
               <l>And bleſs the Lord that lent us him ſo long.</l>
               <l>And they which never yet beheld his Face,</l>
               <l>Have cauſe to give God thanks that gave him ſpace</l>
               <l>To looſe thoſe Snarls, and all thoſe Knots untie</l>
               <l>That in the Ninth of th' <hi>Romans</hi> ſeem'd to lie.</l>
               <l>But ah! He's gone, that never undertook</l>
               <l>To preach from Scripture, God's moſt ſacred Book,</l>
               <l>But he ſo fully op'ned every part</l>
               <l>It ſeldom miſt to ſatisfie the Heart.</l>
               <l>But here my Muſe muſt ſtop, I muſt not dwell</l>
               <l>Upon his Doctrine, leſt my Poem ſwell</l>
               <l>Into ſo large a Volumn, that my Theam</l>
               <l>Will quit her ſingle Sheer, and want a Ream.</l>
               <l>Yet one word more to you whom God did lend</l>
               <l>So ſound a Preacher, and ſo ſweet a Friend;</l>
               <l>Lay up his Doctrine by you now in ſtore</l>
               <l>For <hi>Loveday</hi>'s gone, will never Teach you more.</l>
               <l>And you whoſe itching Ear and wanton Eyes,</l>
               <l>Could reliſh nothing under Novelties;</l>
               <l>Your wandring wanton Eyes now ſees the Day</l>
               <l>Your loathed Manna's taken quite away.</l>
               <l>Ah! that ſweet Oracle no more will rouſe</l>
               <l>Sin-ſlumbring Souls out of their fleſhly Drowſe.</l>
               <l>Oh! he whoſe Doctrine dropt like ſhowers of Rain,</l>
               <l>Who often ſtrove, yea often ſtrove in vain;</l>
               <l>And with endeared Love and Souls-affection</l>
               <l>Beſought you often to make ſure Election:</l>
               <l>Who often told you that you muſt ſuppreſs</l>
               <l>Your ſinful Luſts, your Pride, your vain Exceſs:</l>
               <l>And yet his Doctrine you did not receive,</l>
               <l>For which this good Man's Soul did often grieve.</l>
               <l>Ah! Death has call'd him hence, he's fled, he's gone,</l>
               <l>You've now but half your Food to feed upon.</l>
               <l>O may that half that's left you yet to uſe,</l>
               <l>Be like the Widows Barrel, and her Cruſe!</l>
               <l>O may we never ſee that Cruſe drawn dry,</l>
               <l>Till God be pleas'd to ſend a freſh ſupply,</l>
               <l>And unto ſome a double Portion give,</l>
               <l>In whom our Friend that's Dead again may Live.</l>
               <l>But he's not Dead, he's only fall'n aſleep:</l>
               <l>Let's ceaſe our Mourning, and not always Weep.</l>
               <l>If he has chang'd his Sorrow into Peace,</l>
               <l>Why ſhould not we with him from Sorrow ceaſe?</l>
               <l>Let's moderate our weeping for our Friend:</l>
               <l>Exceſſive hope leſs weeping may offend.</l>
               <l>He's fall'n aſleep, who waking was ſo kind</l>
               <l>To leave ſome Soul-refreſhing Food behind.</l>
               <l>Come, gather up ſome Fragments that remain,</l>
               <l>And freely feed, ſo will he Live again.</l>
               <l>The firſt choice Dainty that I here preſent,</l>
               <l>Highly conducing to Soul-nouriſhment,</l>
               <l>Is our dear <hi>Loveday</hi>'s choice ſelected Gift,</l>
               <l>His Sermon preacht from <hi>Matthew</hi> twenty fift,</l>
               <l>Upon the fooliſh Virgins, and the wiſe;</l>
               <l>Its real Worth thou canſt not over-prize.</l>
               <l>All you that this choice Dainty do poſſeſs,</l>
               <l>Feed of it every Day, or more or leſs.</l>
               <l>And when the ſable Curtains of the Night</l>
               <l>Are cloſly drawn, then feed by Candle-light.</l>
               <l>And you who for its worth would fain enjoy it,</l>
               <l>Let its rich worth invite you all to buy it.</l>
               <l>Thoſe Soul-refreſhing Cordials likewiſe</l>
               <l>Drawn from the Third of <hi>Iſaiah</hi>'s Prophecies,</l>
               <l>By him prepar'd, though not by Humane Art:</l>
               <l>O! that they were engraven in each Heart.</l>
               <l>His Rules for guiding of the Tongue, endeavour</l>
               <l>To keep it as an Antidote for ever:</l>
               <l>Which will reſiſt the Poyſon of the Tongue,</l>
