         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

In theſe great Revolutions which of late have happened in that Our Kingdom, to the wonder and amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all the World, there is none that we have looked upon with more Comfort, than the ſo frequent and publick manifeſtations of their affections to Us in the City of <hi>LONDON,</hi> which hath exceedingly raiſed Our Spirits, and which, no doubt, hath proceeded from the Spirit of GOD, and His extraordinary Mercy to the Nation, which hath been encouraged by you, and your good example, to aſſert that Government un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which it hath ſo many hundred years enjoyed as great felicity as any Nation in <hi>Europe,</hi> and to diſcountenance the imaginations of thoſe, who would ſubject our Subjects to a Government they have not yet deviſed; and to ſatisfie the pride and ambition of a few ill men, would introduce the moſt Arbitrary and Tyrannical Power that was ever yet heard of: How long we have all ſuffered under thoſe and the like devices, all the world takes notice, to the no ſmall reproach of the Engliſh Nation, which we hope is now providing for its own Security and Redemption, and will be no longer bewitched by thoſe Inventions: how deſirous we are to contribute to the obtaining the Peace and Happineſſe of Our Subjects, without further effuſion of blood; and how far we are from deſiring to recover what belongs to Us by a War, if it can be otherwayes done, will appear to you by the encloſed DECLARATION, which, together with this Our LETTER, We have entruſted Our right truſty and welbeloved Coſin the Lord Viſcount <hi>Mordant,</hi> and Our truſty and welbeloved Servant, Sir <hi>John Greenvile</hi> Knight, one of the Gentlemen of Our Bed-chamber, to deliver to you; to the end that you, and all the reſt of Our good Subjects of that Our City of <hi>LONDON</hi> (to whom We deſire it ſhould be publiſhed) may know how far We are from the deſire of Revenge, or that the Peace, Happineſſe, and Security of the Kingdom ſhould be raiſed upon any other foundation than the affection and hearts of Our Subjects, and their own conſents: We have not the leaſt doubt of your juſt ſenſe of thoſe Our Condeſcentions, or of your zeal to advance and promote the ſame good End, by diſpoſing all men to meet Us with the ſame affection and tenderneſſe, in reſtoring the fundamental Laws to that Reverence that is due to them, and upon the preſervation whereof all our happineſſe depends: And you will have no reaſon to doubt of enjoying your full ſhare in that happineſſe, and of the improving it by Our particular affection to you.
