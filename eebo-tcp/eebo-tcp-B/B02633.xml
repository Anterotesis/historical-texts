            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

This hath wrought ſo much on the Charity and Piety of their Majeſties, That they have iſſued out their <hi>Letters Patents</hi> for a <hi>General Collection</hi> over the whole Kingdom, of which a Copy is herewith ſent you. And We who are among many others appointed by the <hi>Brief</hi> to take care of the Execution of it, have thought it incumbent on us to write to you, (No way doubting of your great Zeal for carrying on ſo good and ſo neceſſary a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity) to Move you to uſe all poſſible Care and Diligence for the Advancement of it; Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping you will repreſent to the People, that as theſe our <hi>Diſtreſſed Brethren</hi> are driven from their <hi>Houſes</hi> and <hi>Poſſeſſions</hi> by the Enemies both of our Religion and Country: So if we have any Regard either to the Name of an <hi>Engliſh-man,</hi> or a <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> We muſt be deeply affected with their Miſery. It is not long ſince we our ſelves had the dreadful Proſpect of being forc'd to abandon our Country, and of chooſing a Voluntary Exile. But God of his great Mercy has preſerved us from thoſe Miſeries, into which he has ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd theſe our Brethren and Country-men to fall. We hope therefore you will endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour moſt effectually to perſwade your reſpective Charges, to ſhew that liberal Charity to their diſtreſſed fellow-Chriſtians upon this great occaſion; which they would have wiſhed others would have ſhewn to them, if themſelves had fallen into the like Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and that they will ſtir up all Men to conſider what a grateful Acknowledgment it will be to Almighty God, who has deliver'd us from the Hands of our Enemies, to ſhew a moſt extraordinary Compaſſion to thoſe who are fallen into this great Diſtreſs. And how juſtly ſuch as can harden themſelves againſt ſuch Objects, may expect to fall under Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme Miſery, and to find none to pity them. And in particular We do deſire that every Miniſter after the reading of the <hi>Brief,</hi> will alſo read this Letter to his Congregation. And that on the Sunday before he begins to gather this Charity, he will at the Concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Sermon earneſtly exhort his Pariſhioners to an extraordinary Liberality ſuitable to the preſſing Neceſſities of ſo great a Number, in ſo great a Diſtreſs. And all this We moſt earneſtly recommend to your Care, not doubting but you will ſo far charge your own Conſciences with it, as becomes Men of your Holy Profeſſion. And We think fit to acquaint you, that for the publick Satisfaction there will be Printed and Publiſhed an exact Account of the Monies that are Gather'd in every Arch-deaconry, and every Pariſh thereof, together with an Account of the Diſtribution of all the Monies that are received upon this Brief Atteſted by the Commiſſioners therein mentioned.
