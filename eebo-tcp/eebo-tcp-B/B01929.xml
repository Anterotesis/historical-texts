            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>[Note.]</hi> The place for which Sir <hi>Robert Paſton</hi> deſires this Priveledge conſiſts of Two Farm-houſes at <hi>Great-Yarmouth</hi> Bridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foot, and of certain of his Marſh-grounds lying along the Weſt ſide of the Haven of <hi>Great-Yarmouth;</hi> hath neither Boat nor Fiſher-man, nor had time out of minde; have no Charter, nor are or ever were Incorporated, or capable to take by Charter, or to have their Priveledg go in ſucceſſion, as they deſire.</p>
            <p>Againſt the paſſing of this Bill the Town of <hi>Great-Yarmouth</hi> object and ſay, That the ſole right of diſcharging of all Veſſels, and ſale of all Goods, as well of Fiſh as other Mecrhandiſe coming into the Haven of <hi>Great-Yarmouth,</hi> belong to them only, and ought to be at the Town of <hi>Great-Yarmouth,</hi> and not elſe-where within that Port: And for maintenance hereof they produce,</p>
            <p>Their Charter of King <hi>John</hi> firſt Incorporating them, and reſerving to the Crown a Fee-farm of 55 l. <hi>per Annum.</hi>
            </p>

That all Merchandiſes and Wares, as well of Fiſh as of other things whatſoever, which within the Haven of the Town of <hi>Great-Yarmouth,</hi> in Ships, or Boats, or otherwiſe, ſhould be brought, that the ſame ſhould be there bought and ſold, and not elſe-where within the ſaid Port ſhould be diſcharged, but ſhould be there put to ſale to whom the bringers would, being Freemen, without any Foreſtalment, Abrokerſhip, or other let whatſoever.</p>
            <p>The Proceſs in the Exchequer, 34. <hi>Ed.</hi> 1. and in Chancery, 19. <hi>Ed.</hi> 2. wherein Judgments are given for the Town of <hi>Great-Yarmouth</hi> againſt the Towns of <hi>South-Town</hi> and <hi>Gorleſton,</hi> upon the Point now in queſtion; And the men of thoſe Towns there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by adjudged Fore-ſtallers and Abrokers within the Purview of the aforeſaid Charters, if they Unlade their own Veſſels or Sell their own Goods there.</p>
            <p>Their Charter, 6. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. That <hi>Little-Yarmouth</hi> make no Sale upon the Water. And,</p>
            <p>Their Charter, 7. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3.

            <p>Their Charter, 10. <hi>F.</hi> 3. That the Free Fair be kept, and Buying and Selling of Herrings be at <hi>Great-Yarmouth</hi> only, and not elſewhere within ſeven Miles of the Port or Town of <hi>Great-Yarmouth</hi> during the Fair, which is by the ſpace of forty days from St. <hi>Michael</hi> to St. <hi>Martine</hi> yearly.</p>
            <p>Their Charter, 46. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. Whereby a place in the High Sea called <hi>Kirkeley</hi> Road is granted to the Town of <hi>Great-Yarmouth,</hi> and united unto, and made parcel of their Haven of <hi>Great-Yarmouth,</hi> and that ſuch Duties and Cuſtoms ſhall be paid for the Unlading of Veſſels in that Road, as at <hi>Great-Yarmouth;</hi> And an Additional Fee-Farm of 5. l. <hi>per ann.</hi> therefore reſerved to the Crown.</p>
            <p>The Act of Parliament, 10. <hi>Rich.</hi> 2. Confirming all the former Charters and Liberties of <hi>Great-Yarmouth,</hi> which Act is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent to 35. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. the time of the pretended Charter to <hi>South-Town,</hi> and to other the Printed Acts, 31. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> alledged by them for their rights: And which (notwithſtanding any precedent Repeals of the Charters of <hi>Great-Yarmouth,</hi> if any there were in Parliament, or otherwiſe) hath ſet on foot and confirmed all the afore-mentioned Charters of <hi>Great-Yarmouth;</hi> And the ſame Charters have been ſince confirmed by all ſucceeding Kings and Queens of <hi>England,</hi> and their Liberties enjoyed accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly to this day.</p>
            <p>And particularly their Charter, 6. <hi>Jac.</hi> prohibiting Sale on <hi>Suffolk</hi> ſide, within four Furlong, of the Bridge of <hi>Great-Yarmouth,</hi> (which comprehends the place in queſtion) and that confirmed by His Majeſty that now is.</p>
            <p>And many other Charters for like purpoſes.</p>
            <p>They ſay, That ſuch Unlading on <hi>South-Town ſide</hi> would be a means either of hindring the King in His Cuſtoms, or of putting him to more charge in Officers to look after them.</p>
            <p>They alledge, the ſavings of the Liberties of Great <hi>Yarmouth,</hi> in the <hi>Stat.</hi> 5. <hi>Eliz.</hi> cap. 5. and other Statutes: They alledge di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Statutes for Regulation of the Herring, and other the Fiſhing-Trade, 22. <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 2. 11. <hi>H.</hi> 7. <hi>cap.</hi> 23.13. <hi>Eliz. cap.</hi> 11. and particularly the Act of this preſent Parliament, wherein for prevention of abuſes in the Packing and Ordering of Herrings, and bringing of that Commodity into Credit in Foreign Parts, it is Enacted, That no Herrings of Engliſh-catching ſhall be put to Sale, but what ſhall be Packed in lawful Barrels, in ſuch ſort as <hi>is</hi> there provided, by a ſworn Packer, the Veſſel marked with a Brand, denoting its Gage, the Quantity and Condition of the Herrings, and the Town whence they are Packed; and that the Bayliffs of <hi>Great-Yarmouth</hi> ſhall yearly for their Haven appoint and ſwear able Packers, to view and pack all Herrings brought into that Haven, upon the penalty of 100 l. that by theſe Statutes great Penalties are inflicted upon the Offenders, and ſome of them to be to the Town of <hi>Great-Yarmouth,</hi> and that particularly toward the repair of their Haven; from all which, if this Act paſſes, the Two Men of <hi>South-Town</hi> at preſent, and probably more of them hereafter, will be totally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt, they not being; within the Juriſdiction of <hi>Great-Yarmouth,</hi> and there being no Proviſion made for the regulating of their Fiſheries or Trade, but they to be at large, and priviledged and truſted to be honeſt beyond the whole Kingdom.</p>
            <p>They alledge, as the truth is, their great burthens in maintaining their Poor, 2000 l. <hi>per annum,</hi> their Pier at the mouth of their Haven, a great and coſtly undertaking, ſcarce maintained at 1000 l. <hi>per Ann. Communibus Annis,</hi> and which at firſt making coſt above 30000 l. and that it is not reaſonable others ſhould partake of the benefit, without proportionable ſhare in the Charge; much leſs that by Conſequence of immunity and caſe from theſe common burthens on <hi>South-Town</hi> ſide, they ſhould in time draw away and rob the Men of <hi>Great-Yarmouth</hi> of their Trades and Livelyhoods.</p>
            <p>That without continual Supplies of great quantities of Timber (of which the Town uſeth ſeldom to have leſs then 500 l. worth lying ready by for preſent occaſions and Dangers, but have not now one Tree there, and are indebted at leaſt 2000 l. for Timber already ſpent; and if this Act paſs, will have no further Credit to borrow, nor have any Common-ſtock or Lands) and without daily labour and coſt, their Pier will be ſoon waſht away with the Rage of the Sea, and the Mouth of the Haven ſtopped by the Sands, and conſequently, that Famous Harbour loſt; the Town of <hi>Great-Yarmouth,</hi> one of the moſt conſiderable Ports in his Majeſtie's Dominions, deſtroyed and become deſolate; the Merchants and other Tradeſ-men decaying, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing themſelves, many thouſands of Families periſh, many thouſands of Acres of Marſh and Low Grounds ſurrounded; the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venews of the Lands of all thoſe parts of <hi>Norfolk</hi> and <hi>Suffolk</hi> by thirty miles at leaſt, much leſſend; the Strength and Defence of that part of the Kingdom weakened and indangered, and other inconveniencies follow not to be fore-ſeen, and after not to be prevented.</p>
