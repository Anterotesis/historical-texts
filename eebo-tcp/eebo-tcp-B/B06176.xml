            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <hi>AMintas</hi> on a Summers day</l>
               <l>to ſhun <hi>Apollo's</hi> beams,</l>
               <l>Was driving of his flock away,</l>
               <l>to caſt ſome cooling ſtreams.</l>
               <l>And through a Forreſt as they went</l>
               <l>hard by a rivers ſide,</l>
               <l>A voice which from a grove was ſent</l>
               <l>invited him to bide.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The voyce well ſeem'd for to bewray</l>
               <l>ſome Male-contented mind,</l>
               <l>For oft times did he hear it ſay</l>
               <l>ten thouſand times unkind:</l>
               <l>The remnant of that raging moan</l>
               <l>did all eſcape his ear,</l>
               <l>For every word brought forth a groan</l>
               <l>and every groan a tear.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>

               <l>both face and voice he knew,</l>
               <l>He ſaw that <hi>Phillis</hi> was come there</l>
               <l>her plaints for to renew,</l>
               <l>Thus leaving her unto her plaints</l>
               <l>and ſorrow ſlaking groans,</l>
               <l>He heard her deadly diſcontents</l>

            <lg>
               <l>
                  <hi>Amintas</hi> is thy love to me</l>
               <l>of ſuch a light account,</l>
               <l>That thou diſdainſt to look on me</l>
               <l>or love as thou was wont.</l>
               <l>Were thoſe the Oaths that thou didſt make</l>
               <l>the Vows thou didſt conceive,</l>
               <l>When I for thy contentment ſake</l>
               <l>my hearts delight did leave.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>How oft didſt thou proteſt to me</l>

               <l>The Sun ſhould firſt obſcured be,</l>
               <l>ere thou wouldſt change thy thought.</l>
               <l>Then heaven deſolve without delay</l>
               <l>Sun ſhew thy face no more,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Amintas</hi> love is loſt for aye,</l>
               <l>and wo is me therefore.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Well might I if I had béen wiſe</l>
               <l>foreſéen what now I find,</l>
               <l>But too much love did dull mine eyes</l>
               <l>and made my judgement blind:</l>
               <l>But O alas! the effect doth prove,</l>
               <l>that it was plain deceit,</l>
               <l>For true and undefiled love</l>
               <l>will never turn to hate.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>All thy behaviours were (God knows)</l>
               <l>too ſmooth and too diſcréet,</l>
               <l>Like Sugar which impoyſoned grows,</l>
               <l>ſuſpects becauſe it's ſwéet.</l>
               <l>Thine oaths and vows did promiſe more</l>
               <l>then well thou couldſt perform</l>
               <l>Much like a calm that comes before</l>
               <l>an unexpected ſtorm.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>God knows it would not grieve me much</l>
               <l>for to be kil'd for thee,</l>
               <l>But oh, too near it doth me touch</l>
               <l>that thou ſhouldſt murder me;</l>
               <l>God knows I care not for the pain</l>
               <l>can come for loſs of breath,</l>
               <l>Tis thy unkindneſs cruel Swain</l>

               <l>Hath given thee cauſe for to betray</l>
               <l>mine hearts delight and thine:</l>
               <l>No, no alas it could not be,</l>
               <l>my love to thee was ſuch,</l>
