            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>An Humble PETITION unto the High and moſt Honourable Courts of Parliament, that they would be pleaſed to condiſcend to the peruſing of theſe ſhort Notes, tending to the refining of the Booke of <hi>Common-Prayer,</hi> in a few Things.</head>
            <p>I Do not miſlike the holy <hi>Prayers</hi> of our Church, becauſe ſome things in or about them may be amended: but I deſire an amendment of ſuch things, as do either give ſcandall, or from which weak conſcientious perſons do take ſcandall: that ſo love, peace, and unity may be preſerved in our Church, from which will follow <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity</hi> and <hi>Conformity.</hi> For this end, I ſhall give Inſtances of ſomething to be Added to the Book of Common-prayer; of ſome things to be Altered, and of ſome things to be Removed.</p>

               <head>
                  <hi>1.</hi> Of ſome things to be added.</head>
               <p>I read in the Common-prayer Book of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth, printed 1552. In the 10th. Petition of the holy <hi>Letany,</hi> this prayer: <hi>From the tyranny of the Biſhop of Rome, and all his deteſtable Enormities,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>O good Lord deliver us.</hi> But in our Common-prayer Books in theſe dayes, this Proteſtant prayer is quite left out: as if it were unlawfull for us to pray againſt Romiſh tyranny, and Popiſh deteſtable Doctrines. It is meet therefore that this Prayer ſhould be added, and reſtored to our Books of Common-Prayer, as it was in <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixths time.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="2" type="part">
               <head>
                  <hi>2.</hi> Of ſome things to be altered: <hi>As</hi>
               </head>
               <p n="1">1. As you may ſee in the Kalender for the firſt and ſecond Leſſons, many Chapters of the <hi>Apocrypha</hi> Scriptures are appointed to be read, as well as the <hi>Canonicall</hi> Scriptures. Now it is not meet that <hi>Apocrypha</hi> Scriptures, which are of a doubtful verity, ſhould be made of equall autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity with the Canonicall Scriptures: wherefore it is meet, that there be an alteration, by putting away the Apocrypha Chapters, and putting in their rooms ſo many Canonical Chapters.</p>
               <p n="2">2. After the firſt and ſecond Leſſons for Morning-Prayer, it is ordered, that theſe Leſſons or Chapters <hi>ſhall be ſung in a plain Tune.</hi> Now is this decent, when a man reads a Chapter, to ſing it? Or is it ſo edifying, to ſing it, as it is to read it in a ſober and grave tone of voice? Like as a Judge on the Bench ſpeaks his Charge, or as the Sheriffe reads the Kings Proclamation, or as a School-Maſter reads a Lecture to his Schollars. In the Chapters ſometimes God threatneth us for our ſins, and ſometimes that glorious and fearfull name of the Lord our God is read, which we ought to fear, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.58. And is it decent for a Miniſter to read theſe things merrily, and with a ſinging voice? Is it not meet then, that this ſinging ſhould be altered?</p>
               <p>Beſides in <hi>Cathedrall</hi> Churches, they ſing their Prayers, and is it not meet that this alſo be altered?</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Book of Common-Prayer lacks a good <hi>Method:</hi> for the Miniſter is forced in reading of Service, to turn ſome leaves backward, and then ſome leaves forward, and cannot read on to the next thing following, as he might, if things were methodically diſpoſed; now this would be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The laſt thing in the Book of Common-Prayer, is the forme for <hi>Conſecration</hi> of Biſhops to their office, which gives them their being, &amp; makes them Biſhops. Now as I conceive, this <hi>Conſecration</hi> ought to be in the <hi>Kings</hi> name: For the King is ſupream head of the Church, and next under Chriſt in authority. And therefore Biſhops ought to derive their office and authori<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y therein from the King, as next under the King: but they are conſecrated, not in the name of the King, but in the name of another and higher power, as from Chriſt, the holy Ghoſt, and the Metropolitan, and ſo they make themſelves to be next under Chriſt, and ſo ſhoulder out of place the King, and deny his ſupremacy: Now ought not this <hi>Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration</hi> therefore be altered?</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Prayers of the Church ought to be without <hi>Tautologies,</hi> and unneceſſary repetitions: For Chriſt ſaid, that his Diſciples ſhould not be like the heathen in prayer, uſing <hi>vain repetitions, Mat.</hi> 6.7. But our Common-Prayer Book is full of unneceſſary Repetitions. For 1. the Lords Prayer is uſed in an hours time over and over again, as twice in Morning-prayer, and once in the Pulpit in the Miniſters former Prayer. 2. <hi>Gloria Patri,</hi> or <hi>Glory be to the Father,</hi> is in one hours time appointed to be ſaid and repeated over and over again ſix or ſeven times. I could add other prayers alſo of like kind: Now is it not meet to alter this?</p>
               <p n="6">6. In our <hi>Cathedral</hi> Churches they ſay their <hi>ſecond Service</hi> in the Chancell or on the <hi>High Altar,</hi> not in the body of the Church, where the other ſet Service is ſaid. Now the <hi>high Altar</hi> is no more holy than the body of the Church; nor is it ſo convenient for the peoples edification, becauſe they being afar off in the body of the Church, they can hardly hear what is read: And what reaſon can be rendred, why one part of the Service ſhould be read in the body of the Church, and another part on the <hi>High Altar?</hi> And why ſhould it be ſo in a Cathedral Church, more than in all other Churches? Is it not meet that this be altered? 2. It is appointed in the order for the Communion, that the <hi>Table</hi> ſhall ſtand in the <hi>body</hi> of the Church or Chauncel, where Morning and Evening-Prayers are ſaid: but now in the Cathedral Church, and in many others, the <hi>Table</hi> is hoiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up, and ſtands on the <hi>High Altar:</hi> But this is not the place where Morning and Evening prayers are uſually ſaid, but the place for theſe is the body of the Church, and there uſed in all common on Churches, and why then ſhould it be otherwiſe in Cathedrals.</p>
               <p n="7">7. As touching <hi>Baptiſme,</hi> the Prieſt is appointed to take the child in his arms, and to <hi>dip it into the water,</hi> unleſs the child be weak: ſo then ſtrong children muſt all of them be <hi>dipped</hi> into the water, as <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> do: but this <hi>dipping</hi> is out of uſe in our Church; Is it not meet then to alter this <hi>dipping</hi> unto <hi>ſprinkling</hi> of water?</p>
            </div>
            <div n="3" type="part">
               <head>
                  <hi>3.</hi> Of ſome things to be removed out of the Church: <hi>As</hi>
               </head>
               <p n="1">1. As touching the <hi>Epiſtles</hi> and <hi>Goſpels,</hi> theſe are appointed to be read on <hi>Sundays,</hi> in <hi>Morning</hi> and <hi>Evening-Prayers,</hi> but I ſee no reaſon for it; for on <hi>Sundays</hi> we have an <hi>whole</hi> Chapter read for the ſecond Leſſon, out of the <hi>Epiſtles,</hi> and another out of the <hi>Goſpels:</hi> what neceſſity is there to read a <hi>part</hi> of a Chapter out of them? For we heard the Goſpel out of the four Evangeliſts before, in the ſecond Leſſon, and alſo the <hi>Epiſtle</hi> out of the <hi>Epiſtles</hi> of St. <hi>Paul</hi> and others: Is it neceſſary to read the ſame matter twice in one hour? 2. After the whole Chap. of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> and <hi>Epiſtle</hi> is read, what need is there to read alſo a piece, or a part of a Chapter out of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> and the <hi>Epiſtles?</hi> and both the whole Chapter and a piece of one to be read the ſame day, <hi>viz.</hi> on <hi>Sunday,</hi> I ſee no reaſon for it. The <hi>Epiſtle</hi> and <hi>Goſpel</hi> therefore conſiſting but of a piece of the chapters read before, to me ſeems ſuperfluous, and therefore meet to be removed out of the Church.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As touching <hi>Baptiſme,</hi> 1. of <hi>Godfathers &amp; Godmothers,</hi> who promiſe (what they perform not) that the child ſhall be vertuouſly brought up and learn the <hi>Creed, Lords Prayer,</hi> and the ten <hi>Commandements.</hi> I ſee no need for theſe <hi>Godfathers,</hi> &amp;c. Time was, in days of perſecution, when the Chriſtian parents were ſlaughter'd, and martyr'd, then there was need that other Chriſtians ſhould take care for the Chriſtian education of their Infants left behind: But we have no ſuch perſecution, our parents live with their children, &amp; ought to give them godly education, and ſo there is no need of <hi>Godfathers</hi> to do it. 2. Of the <hi>Croſſe</hi> in <hi>Baptiſme,</hi> it is confeſſed by the Biſhops, that the Infant is fully baptized before it be croſſed: what <gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>d then is there of the croſſe? May not perſons of years have a croſs on their fore-heads made after the Lords Supper, as well as Infants after <hi>Baptiſme?</hi> Theſe things being needleſs, may ſafely be removed out of the Church.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Touching <hi>Matrimonie,</hi> it is appointed, that 1. the man ſhall ſay to the woman, <hi>With my body I thee worſhip.</hi> I leave it to conſideration, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther theſe words be fitting or not; and whether it be meet, that the more honourable perſon ſhould worſhip his inferiour. 2. It is ordered that the man ſhall ſay, <hi>With all my worldly goods I thee endowe.</hi> Now the Law doth not allow the woman but her Thirds, but the Prieſt allows her all. 3. The man muſt ſay, <hi>With this Ring I thee wed.</hi> Now what need of a Ring to teſtifie the Marriage, when they are fully marryed before, by their ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn and mutuall promiſes each to other, made before God and the Congregation?</p>
               <p n="4">4. Of our <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> note, that 1. whilſt we labour to preſerve in honour, the prayers of our Church, theſe Ceremonies caſt dirt on them, and render them odious: for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny do miſlike the Common-Prayer Book, becauſe they ſee where this comes in, it draws after it the Romiſh Ceremonies. 2. Note, they are <hi>Innovations,</hi> being not in uſe in the Primitive Church. 3. Some of them are <hi>Jewiſh,</hi> as the Surplice, Cope, high Altar, Organ-pipes, &amp;c. Now the Temple where they were uſed being down, and the Prieſthood who uſed them, changed; why ſhould we revive them? But others are <hi>Romiſh,</hi> invented at <hi>Rome,</hi> or came thence, as the Croſſe in Baptiſme, kneeling at the Sacrament, holy or Saints dayes, with others. Now being theſe had no good Original, why ſhould we follow Papiſts in them? 4. They have been the cauſe of ſilencing many godly and painfull Miniſters, and a bone of contention in the Church for many years, and one cauſe of the late War. But many ſay, St. <hi>Paul</hi> commanded <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Decency,</hi> 1 Cor. 14.40. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer</hi> 1. St. <hi>Paul</hi> meant it not of our Engliſh Ceremonies, for the Primitive Church uſed none of them; they worſhipped God in their Churches both orderly and decently, without our Ceremonies. 2. Chriſt forbad them, as <hi>Traditions of men,</hi> Mar. 7.2, &amp;c. And St. <hi>Paul</hi> forewarned us againſt them, as Traditions which are not according to Chriſt, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.8. Now Chriſt never appointed any of them: and ſhall ſuch Ceremonies be called indifferent things? and matters of Order and Decency? I wiſh theſe may be all removed, the which would tend to an everlaſting and well grounded Peace. But I leave all to the wiſdome of our moſt Honourable Parliament.</p>
