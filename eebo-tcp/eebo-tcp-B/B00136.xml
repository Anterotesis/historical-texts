            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>IGHT REVEREND, my dutie in moſt humble wiſe remembred, I am to beſeech your good Lordſhippe, to vouchſafe me that fauour, (if not for mine owne ſake, or the worthines of the thing it ſelfe, yet for Cambridge ſake, and that eſpeciall affection, whiche you haue alwayes borne towards Vniuerſitie men, and namely your ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar curteſie toward my brother Gabriel, when he ſhould haue trauailed to Smalcaldie, which curteſie he doth of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten recogniſe) that as it hath pleaſed you alreadie to commit the peruſing of the Aſtrologicall Diſcourſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, to your moſt learned ſonne in lawe, M. Doctor Squire, who can verie well iudge, and hath verie friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly allowed thereof: ſo it may now like your Lordſhippe, to admit of the ſame for the beſt New yeares gift, that
<pb facs="tcp:174075:4"/>
ſuch a ſcholler on ſuch a ſuddaine can beſtow. Which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit in reſpect of the baſe handling, it be nothing wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie either the view, or the handling of ſuch a perſonage, as I can not but know your Lordſhip to be: yet conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the great importance, and conſequence of the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I am both perſwaded by ſome friends, who are to ouerrule me in a greater matter, to aduenture the publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation thereof, (inſomuch that I haue made my good Lord of Rocheſter, and M. Doctor Lewen priuie there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, who like well of the impreſsion) and with all am incouraged to craue your good leaue, that vpon your priuate liking, (which notwithſtanding my ſelfe of my ſelfe can not greatly hope for) you would ſuffer it to paſſe vnder the title of your good Lorſhippes publique maintenaunce, and patronage. I may eaſily preſume too much of your accuſtomed fauour, ſo aſſuredly knowen as well in both the Vniuerſities, as abroad in your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips Dioceſſe, and other parts of the Realme: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (notwithſtanding the importunitie of thoſe my friends, and the grauitie of the argument it ſelfe) being loth to be ouerbold, where I owe ſo much reuerence and dutie, I haue thought good, not to vſe your name without your owne licence, but wholy to commit the publiſhing, or ſuppreſsing of this Diſcourſe to your Lordſhippes li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king or diſliking. You may haply maruell what I meane, either to deale my ſelfe in any ſuch matter of Aſtrologie being ſhortly to profeſſe Diuinity, (ſo ſoone as my place in the College ſhall call me thereunto) or to dedicate a Treatiſe of anie ſuch contents vnto one, that hath both ſo many yeres, euen in King Edwards, &amp; Queene Maries daies, (as appeareth by his owne, and others writings) ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried ſo ſingular credit for his knowledge, and practiſe in Diuinitie, &amp; now by Gods prouidence is in place, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit and countenance thoſe, that being admitted to that vocation, ſhall deſerue to be well accepted therein. But for the one, beſides that I might alleage for my defence,
<pb facs="tcp:174075:4"/>
the examples of Melancthon, Chytraeus, Iunctinus, Maeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyne, our M. Doctor Fulke, your M.

To which effect, that notable ſaying of his, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerueth to be as famous, as your Lordſhip knoweth it to be amongeſt the learned: <gap reason="foreign">

But I can not praetermit that Aſtrologicall conference betwene Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar, and the Aegyptian Prieſt in Lucans Pharſalia, where Caeſars owne confeſsion of him ſelfe is thus deliuered: <hi>media inter praelia ſemper, ſtellarum, coelique plagis, ſuperiſque vacaui: Eudoxi Fastos noster ſuperabit &amp; Annus.</hi> Which he in deede performed, correcting and reforming the Romane yeare by the helpe of Soſigenes, as Solon did the Attique yeare by the helpe of Thales: an other ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of reformation, than that of the Calender, which the Pope Gregorie the xiij. hath newly publiſhed, by the helpe of I knowe not what Aſtrologers.

For priuate vſes, firſt <hi>in medendo:</hi> then, <hi>ad regen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dos mores:</hi> thirdly, <hi>ad deligenda ſtudia: plurimum enim re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fert intelligere, quo quemque natura ducat:</hi> (I vſe not a word, but his owne:) beſide, <hi>fortuna ſaepe comitatur mores: &amp; quanquam aliae quoque cauſae funt humanorum euentuum, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men res loquitur ipſa, interdum in Astris cauſara eſſe, cur vt Heſiodus inquit: ipſe dies quandoque parens, quandoque no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerca, ſit.</hi> Fiftly, <hi>conducit tempestatum obſeruatio ad Oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomiam:</hi> laſt of all, <hi>hi proximi anni aliquot ſatis claras ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficationes praebuerunt, ſidera magnam vim in aere, &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus naſcentibus habere, idque palam testantur inſignes ſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum congreſſus</hi> (which maketh directly for the preſent Diſcourſe.) And as for the publike vſe and neceſsitie thereof, he goeth forwarde thus, in my ſimple opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, both very politickely and diuinely: <hi>Existunt &amp; inrebus publicis fatales tempestates, in quibus admoniti ab hac arte, multa prouidere poſſunt, vel ad cauenda, vel ad mitiganda pericula. Saepe enim fata conſilio in melius flecti queunt, ſaepe fatorum ſaeuitiam lenit Deus, placatus pio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum votis. Quare haec quoque grauis cauſa fuerit, rerum futurarum ſignificationes animaduertendi.</hi> He addeth for reaſon. <hi>Prodest enim commonefieri homines atrocibus ſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum minis, vt à Deo opem implorent; deinde, vt bonitatem Dei magis agnoſcant, cum viderint aliquam eſſe ſuperiorem ac meliorem naturam ſideribus, quae tristes ſignificationes miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat.</hi> To the breeding of which politike, and diuine conſiderations in the mindes of ſome or other, I would to God, this ſlender Diſcourſe of mine might be anie meanes.

Deuteronomie, who vainly tooke vpon them, to diuine by magicall and ſuperſtitious ſorceries, numbers, lottes, characters, charmes, interrogatories propounded to the dead, inſpections of birds, entrals of beaſtes, and ſuch other monſtrous, and abhominable meanes: for ſo ſaith A.

All ſuch being by one Romane decree or other, at one time, or other, vpon one ſuddaine occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, or other, baniſhed the citie, as troubleſome, and needeleſſe perſons, in a politike and martiall ſtate, ſo long as the rage of that tempeſt endured. Thirdly, admit their Aſtrological diuinations were lawfully forbidden, being found commonly deceitfull and falſe, by reaſon that the art it ſelfe was then verie vnperfect, and vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, as it continued to the age of Ptolomey, who flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed but in the time of the Emperour Antoninus Pius, which ſucceeded Traian and Adrian: yet may ours ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe lawfully ſtand, the art being nowe generallie of the moſt and beſt acknowledged to be much more perfectly reformed, and a right art in deede: or if that ſeeme more, a right ſcience in deede. For which two laſt reaſons, I am to thanke a late conference, that I had with my brother Gabriel, about Hallowmas laſt, touching the validitie of thoſe Romane lawes. As for other later lawes, &amp; ſtatuts, either forreine, or our owne, I know not anie that vniuerſally and ſimplie condemne Aſtrologie:
<pb facs="tcp:174075:7"/>
and as for thoſe, that condemne ſome particular abuſe thereof, I muſt needes confeſſe, they are verie wiſe, and neceſſarie ordinaunces, to meete with the lewde practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and impoſtures of manie, that vnder the pretence of their figure commit intolerable villanies, wherein for my parte, I doubt not, but they deſerue the penalties, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted vpon them by law, thinking them worthily puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, <hi>Pro menſura conſultationis,</hi> as Vlpian ſpeaketh of his <hi>Mathematici</hi> in the forenamed title, with this addition of his, following immediatly after in the ſame place: <hi>qui de principis ſalute, capite puniantur, vel qua alia grauiore paenae afficiantur:</hi> extending withall the force of the law in that point, euen to the puniſhment of other ſimple wizardes: <hi>Qui contra quietem, imperiumque populi Romani, improbandas artes exercent:</hi> and finally alleaging the example of the Emperour Marcus, <hi>Qui in Syrum inſulam eum relegauit, qui motu Caſſiano vaticinatus erat, &amp; multa quaſi inſtinctu Deorum dixerat:</hi> Neither dare I excuſe either Thraſillus, or Aſcle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarion, or Gauricus: whereof the firſt foretold the deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Tiberius the Emperour: the ſecond of Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian: the third of the Bentiuoli in Bononia: or the Prieſt, that gaue out the rumour of the future murthering of Galeacius Sfortia, Duke of Millaine, (who were all wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily rewarded for their folly) or anie other, that by their Horoſcopicall predictions might ſeeme to harten, &amp; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten one conſpirators, to the atchieuing, or attempting of their Princes death, but in that caſe would wiſh all A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrologers, either not to deale at all, or elſe to deale pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uately and priuily with the Prince him ſelfe: &amp; then too, to hold Cardanes rule, ſet downe amongſt eight other like conditions, in the end of his booke, <hi>De Astrologicie interrogationibus: principi ne magnum malum firmiter vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam praedixeris, ſed periculum:</hi> howbeit Cardane him ſelfe dealt more plainly, and therefore more daungerouſly with our King Edward the VI. as appeareth in the Iudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cials of his natiuitie, giuen out in the beginning of his

But, neither this ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall priuiledge of his being withall a ſtraunger of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarie credit, nor anie like perſonall example can warrant other priuate men, to intermeddle in like ſorte in the natiuities, and deſtinies of their Princes, otherwiſe than is before limited, or vpon the Princes owne direct commaundement. And yet if either this way, or any like, the art happen by ſome buſie, and fonde fellowes to be abuſed, it hath but the ſame fortune, that all other artes and ſciences haue beſide: &amp; the Lawiers rule, <hi>Abuſus non tollit vſum,</hi> will ſtill iuſtifie the right, and commendable practice thereof. The bounds of which limitation, I ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing no way exceeded in anie parte of the Diſcourſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing: I hope, there is nothing therin contained, which, conſidering the premiſes, might not proceede, euen from one, that were already profeſſed in Diuinitie. And, then I truſt, in reſpect of the matter, I haue committed no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conuenience, in recommending the ſame to the fauour and patronage of ſuch a Diuine, as all England knoweth your Lordſhip to be: who I doubt not, can iudge exactly thereof. For the maner, I am humbly to craue pardon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neither practiſed in writing Engliſh, nor purpoſing anie ſuch publike dedication at the firſt. It may perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture be an occaſion, that hereafter I ſhall acquaint my pen better with enditing in our owne tonge. In the meane
<pb facs="tcp:174075:8"/>
time, I am to beſeech your Reuerend Lordſhippe, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect rather what is here ſaid, than how it is ſaid: preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming that I haue litle erred in my iudicials, whatſoeuer defects may chaunce to appeare in the ſtyle. And yet for the verie conſequence of the matter too, I muſt ſay with Tullie, <hi>Optanda quidem optima: expectanda deterrima: ferenda quaecunque erunt.</hi> How Gods omnipotencie ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruleth all cauſes, and effects, as well particularly <hi>in ſpecie, &amp; indiuiduo,</hi> as vniuerſally <hi>in genere,</hi> I haue ſufficiently vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered as it were by the way in other places: our laſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie is Chriſtian pacience, if there be no other reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die. But that is a Theologicall argument, worthie your Lordſhips handling: and I ſee I haue already preſumed ouermuch of your Lordſhippes pacience, in being thus troubleſome, and tedious vnto you, beyonde the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe of an ordinarie Epiſtle, or Preface.

            <p>Nowe, to treate ſomewhat more ſpecially touching the weather, &amp; conſtitution of the aier, I haue good coniecturall Arguments to perſuade me, that great ſtore of rayne and colde is lyke to enſue, that wée ſhall haue much haile, thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and lightning, much vnſeaſonable, immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate, tempeſtuous, and boyſterous weather, that huge waters ſhall ariſe, that floudes extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarily ſhall increaſe, many ouerflowings happen, diuerſe irruptions of waters ſuddain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly breake out, cauſing ſome loſſe by lande, but muche greater decaye of ſubſtaunce by ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrackes on the ſeas, whereby very many ſhall be ſhrewdely endammaged, and not a fewe vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly vndane.

of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> and <hi>Mars,</hi> which is the third waightie planet, and in malice litle inferiour vnto deuou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring <hi>Saturne</hi> him ſelf. After which kind of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunctions, ſome terrible, and fearfull Comet, or blazing ſtarre is like preſently to enſue: for the congreſſe of planets in a fierie ſigne, doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly foreſhew, and in déede naturally cauſe a blazing ſtar. As by induction of examples might at large be diſcourſed, but one for euery ſigne ſhall ſuffice. In the yeare <hi>1556.</hi> in the ſame mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth of March, when there was the like coacer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of both ſuperiour and inferiour planets in this very ſigne <hi>Aries,</hi> there followed imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly a great Comet. <hi>Anno <hi>1434.</hi>
               </hi> after the like méeting of the planets in the ſecond fierie ſigne <hi>Leo,</hi> their appeared likewiſe a fierie Comet. As alſo after their Coniunction in the third fierie ſigne <hi>Sagittary, Anno <hi>814.</hi>
               </hi> before the death of the inuincible and moſte renowned Emperour <hi>Carolus Magnus,</hi> there enſued in like manner a terrible, and tragicall Comet. And if a Comet, as I haue now problably inferred, ſhall ariſe, theſe effects muſt be looked for, much ſcorching and vehement heate, the drying vp of ponds and déepe waters: barren, and vnfrutefull fieldes: and conſequently, a dearth of all victuals, beſide a ſore death of cattel, and many peſtilent diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes amongſt men. But if no Comet appears, there ſhall doubtleſſe be ſéene other horrible and

rufull viſions in the Heauens, and many very ſtraunge &amp; terrible ſights in the middle region of the aier, as fierie Meteors, flaſhings, and fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mings of fire, wonderfull traiections, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, much lightning, and thunder mixte with haile. Whereby many ſhall be perillouſly terrified, and ſome miſerably vndone.

Wherefore, to ſpeake onely of the watrie Trigone, which ſhall now beare rule for a time,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:174075:27"/>
which Trigone conſiſteth of theſe thrée ſignes of the Zodiaque, <hi>Cancer, Scorpio, Piſces:</hi> it ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth a reſolute caſe, (vnleſſe my induction mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueylouſly faileth me) that their neuer hapned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny great Coniunction of the ſuperiour planets in any of thoſe thrée ſignes, but ſome extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary chaunge, and notorius alteration enſued. Firſt, after the mightie Coniunction of the two higheſt planets, <hi>Saturne</hi> and <hi>Iupiter</hi> in <hi>Cancer,</hi> which is reckened the firſt ſigne of the foreſaide watrie Triplicitie, (which Coniunction hapned <hi>in angulo quartae domus,</hi> the ninth moneth from March firſt called of the Romanes, and now of vs Nouember) the world was ouerflowed with that wonderfull exceeding deluge, which to this day doth, and ſhal euer beare the name of <hi>Noahs</hi> floude: ſuch a floude as the world ſhall neuer ſée againe. Secondly, this fourth Monarchie, called the Romane Monarchie, to follow the common diſtinction, (howſoeuer <hi>Monſier Bodine</hi> proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly reaſoneth to the contrary) wherein we now liue, and are ſtill to preferre before the Turkiſh Monarchie, ſéeme it neuer ſo ample and huge, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan vnder the dominio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the watrie Trigone: for the <hi>47.</hi> yeare before the glorious natiuitie of our ſauiour Ieſus Chriſt, and fiue yeares before the deſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the moſt valerous and puiſſant captaine, <hi>Iulius Caeſar</hi> there hapned a great Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction of the ſuperiour planets in <hi>Scorpio,</hi> the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:174075:28"/>
ſeconde ſigne of the ſame Triplicitie, at whiche time that moſt Memorable and notorious ciuill war betwéene <hi>Caeſar</hi> and <hi>Pompey,</hi> was verie hote and violent, the end whereof enſued a litle after the ſame Coniunction, whereupon <hi>Iulius Caeſar</hi> hauing oppreſſed the contrarie force, and valiantly ſubdued his enimies, whiche defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded their auncient ſtate, and common libertie, did firſt eſtabliſh this fourth moſt noble Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie. Thirdly, not long after this, namely, ſixe yéeres before the happie birth of our Redéemer, there hapned a Coniunction of theſe mighty ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour planets, <hi>Saturne</hi> and <hi>Iupiter,</hi> in the laſt face of <hi>Piſces,</hi> which is the laſte ſigne of the watry Trigone, &amp; the beginning of <hi>Aries,</hi> which is the firſt ſigne of the fierie Trigone, which Coniunction hapned neuer ſince, but only in the daies of the worthy chriſtian Emperour, <hi>Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus Magnus, <hi>Anno.</hi> 789.</hi> whiche is almoſt <hi>800.</hi> yeares ago, but is now to happen once againe in this preſent yeare <hi>1583.</hi> Touching which, foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as it is the laſt Coniunction that euer ſhal happen in the end of the watrie Trigone, I am Aſtrologically induced to this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>iecture, that we are moſt like to haue a new world, by ſome ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine, violent, &amp; wonderful ſtraunge alteration, which euen héeretofore hath alwaies hapned, at the ending of one Trigone, &amp; beginning of an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but now moſt eſpecially is like to happen,

commendations of his martiall prowes, tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with deuotion and wiſedome, in theſe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Terms: <hi>his longè optimis belli &amp; pacis artibus, non indomitos modò Saxones, &amp; peruicaces Cantabros, perpetuis victorijs deuictos, verùm, quod ad perenniorem laudem nobilius fuit, Longobardos arroganter &amp; impiè ſacroſancto Pontifici infaestos, Deo vltore, funditus exciſos videmus.</hi> But, to leaue the ſecond foundation, and as it were, the reedifying of the imperiall Monarchie vnder <hi>Charlmaine,</hi> which is farre better knowne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, than vnto me, (how be it by the way it would not be forgotten, that <hi>Romanum Imperium apud Graecos perstitit à Constantini Magni Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poribus, vſque ad Tempora Caroli Magni, in quem nomen duntaxat Imperij tranſlatum est ad Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nos,</hi> as <hi>Agrippa</hi> writeth in his inuectiue diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, <hi>De Nobilitate:</hi>) and to returne now to the preſent Coniunction, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidering that this fourth Monarchie began firſt about the ende of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie Trigone, and was afterwarde weakened and decayed vnder the ſame, as appeareth by the premiſſes: maye it nowe ſéeme likely and probable inough, that it ſhall alſo finally be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and deſtroyed vnder the ſame Trigone? And, for ſomuch, as our Lord and Sauiour tooke our humane nature vpon him, beyng borne of the virgin Marie in Bethlem, at the ende of the watrie Trigone, and the beginning of the fierie
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:174075:29"/>
Trigon: the ſame now happening againe, may it not alſo ſignifie and portend, ſome wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and maruelous alteration ſhortly after to enſue? yea, why not euen that great, &amp; dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full time, wherin the ſame Iheſus Chriſt, ſhal come againe in vnſpeakeable maieſtie, to iudge both the quicke and the dead, conſuming the whole world by fire? for now ſhall the fie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie Trigone raigne, and all the Coniunctions of the ſuperiour planets which hereafter ſhall happen, ſhall continually be in fierie ſignes, till the accompliſhment almoſt of <hi>200.</hi> yeares. In the raigne of <hi>Carolus Magnus,</hi> albeit the like Coniunction happened, yet the world could not then be at an ende: howbeit euen at that very time, there were excéeding great Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions amongeſt Princes, debated with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny fierce battailes, horrible murders, &amp; much ſhedding of bloud: to which effect I can not but remember thoſe goodly verſes of the excellent Italian Poet, <hi>Honoratus Faſitellus:</hi>
               <q>

Which are to be vnderſtoode of that ſelfe ſame time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet then I ſay, could not the conſumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the world be, becauſe <hi>5000.</hi> yeares from the Creation of the world, were not yet expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:174075:30"/>
but now the influence and effects of this preſent great Coniunctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> enduring and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing, as I haue ſayd, how litle to ſpeake of, ſhall remaine wanting, to make vp the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete number of <hi>6000.</hi> yeares, which account is originally grounded vpon the auncient fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous prophecy of <hi>Elias,</hi> concerning the worlds continuance, foretelling that the ſame ſhould ſtand <hi>6000.</hi> yeares: <hi>2000.</hi> vaine: <hi>2000.</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lawe: <hi>2000.</hi> Chriſt: which togither make in all the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal number of numbers <hi>6000.</hi> yeares.

Yea our Sauiour Chriſt him ſelfe hath promiſed in his Goſpel written by S. <hi>Mathew,</hi> the <hi>24.</hi> chapt. that he wil detract ſomewhat of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> appointed time, ſaying: Except thoſe daies ſhould be ſhortned, there ſhould no fleſh be ſaued, but for the elects ſake, they ſhall be ſhortned. So that all circumſtances being weyed, and all Aſtrological likehoods togither with prophetical predictions conſidered, what doubt is there, but we may, and ought to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade our ſelues, that the foundation of the world is in a manner worne out, and alſo this goodly frame ready to fall vpon our ſhoulders?
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:174075:30"/>
for if ſo be there yet remained another great Coniunction of <hi>Saturne</hi> and <hi>Iupiter</hi> like to the firſt, then ſhoulde there be required a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manet</hi> of almoſt eight hundred yeares moe, which being added to the yeare of this great Coniunction, would amount to the number of ſixe thouſand and almoſte foure hundred yeares: which manifeſtly oppugneth the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie of <hi>Elias</hi> aboue rehearſed, and <hi>Plato,</hi> before <hi>25.</hi> of thoſe yeares were exſpired, would bid vs whoe. Almighty God, through his infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite power, and vnſpeakeable wiſedom, in ſixe dayes created heauen and earth, the ſea, and al thinges therein contained, but the ſeuenth day he reſted, and hallowed the ſame: wherein ſome haue repoſed a high miſterie, imagining, and perſwading them ſelues, that by the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred miniſterie of his holie worde in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent life, within the compaſſe of <hi>6000.</hi> yeares, he will alſo gather togither his Church, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with in the ſeuenth he wil celebrate and kéepe holy his eternall and euerlaſting Sabaoth.

But how ſoundly theſe teſtimonies be applied to the enforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of my concluſion, it is for learneder men to determine, my ſelfe dare not be ouer bold with Textes of ſcripture, which are ſo reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently, and religiouſly to be handled, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore take it beſt, to ſtand rather vpon the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babilitie of Aſtrologicall predictions, and namely, vpon that olde, and common prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, touching the yeare <hi>1588.</hi> which is now ſo rife in euery mans mouth, and was ſo reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely defended in a publique diſputation in the laſt Commencement, by one, ſufficient to maintaine his aſſertion.

am I violently brought to a further conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the premiſſes, by ſuch extraordinary, and as a man would ſay, preſignificatiue Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents, as theſe following: When were there euer ſéene ſo many dreadfull Eclipſes of the Sunne and Moone?

For ſée what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable and ſwéete words the Lord of Hoſtes hath vttered with his owne mouth: If ye walke in my Ordinances, and kéepe my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements, and doe them, I wil ſend you raine in due ſeaſon, and the land ſhall yéeld hir encreaſe, and the trées of the fielde ſhall giue their fruite and your threſhing ſhal reach vnto the vintage, and the vintage ſhall reach vnto the ſowing time, &amp; ye ſhal eate your bread in plenteouſnes, and dwel in your land ſafely, and I wil ſend peace in the land, and ye ſhall ſléepe, and none ſhal make you afraid, and I wil rid euil beaſtes out of the land, and there ſhal no ſword goe throughout your land, and ye ſhal chaſe your enimies, and they ſhall fall before you vpon the ſword and fiue of you ſhal chaſe an hundred, and an hundred ſhal put ten thouſand to flight, and your enimies ſhall fall

Theſe are the goodly and bleſſed promiſes, which the Lord of Heauen &amp; Earth wil aſſuredly and plentifully performe vnto thoſe; that doe faithfully feare, and truly wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip him, in that integritie of holines &amp; righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes, that him ſelfe requireth. For no doubt, he is a moſt merciful God, &amp; a moſt louing fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ful of compaſſion, full of pacience, &amp; long ſuffering, ful of goodnes &amp; pitie. And yet as he is excedingly merciful to the repentant ſinner, ſo is he alſo iuſt &amp; terrible to the wilful &amp; obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate reprobate. For thus on the other ſide hath the Lord of Lords from the throne of his om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent Maieſtie thundered: but if ye walke contrary vnto me, and wil not harken vnto me, I wil alſo walke contrary vnto you: I wil bring vpon you fearfulnes, conſumption, and the burning ague, to conſume your eyes, and gender ſorrow of hart, and ye ſhal ſowe your ſeede in vaine, for your enimies ſhal eate it, and I wil ſet my face againſt you, and ye ſhal

and Gomorrha: let vs doe his commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that we may be bleſſed, that our pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er may be in the trée of life, and that we may enter in, through the gates into the citie, and take the water of life fréely. Babylon is made a dwelling place of diuels, a cage of vncleane birdes, ſpirits and goblins ſhall walke in hir pallaces, fearefull wilde beaſtes ſhall lurke there: ſcritchowles, and oſtriges ſhall walke in hir houſes, Apes and Satyres ſhall daunce in hir beautifull buildings, wilde Cats ſhall cry therein, and Dragons ſhall there abide, no voice of men ſhall be heard in hir, no ſou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of a bell, or a mill ſhall be heard, no light of a candle ſhall be ſéene, but perpetuall ſolitude, deſolation, and ſorrow ſhal remaine and dwel there for euermore.

But, to containe vs now within our bounds, in the yeare <hi>1424.</hi> the <hi>26.</hi> daye of Iune, in the eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, as is credibly recorded, there appeared an Eclipſe of the Sunne in <hi>Cancer,</hi> the <hi>14.</hi> degrée: at which time, <hi>Charles</hi> the king of <hi>Fraunce</hi> being valiantly ſet vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in battaile by the Ingliſh men &amp; Burgundians, was expelled his owne realme: warre was hotely maintayned betwéene the Danes, &amp; the Sleſuicians: the Biſhop of <hi>Breame</hi> prouoking the Hollanders to battaile, was grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouſly wounded of them, and taken priſoner: a terrible plague, and moſt vehement peſtilence and mortalitie of men enſued, continuing fierce, and hote a long time: afterwardes, certaine Princes of Germanie, entring <hi>Bohemia</hi> with a

               <p>In the yeare <hi>1569.</hi> the ninth day of Iulie in the morning, there likewiſe appeared an Eclipſe of the Sunne in the <hi>26.</hi> degrée of <hi>Cancer,</hi> the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, &amp; effects wherof continued two yeares: when the Turkes martially aſſayling and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uading <hi>Pannonia,</hi> called otherwiſe <hi>Hungaria,</hi> and <hi>Syria,</hi> a countrie lying in the eaſt partes of Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manie, a portion whereof bordereth on Hunga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, (ſauing which part y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole country beſides is altogither mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tainiſh) forcibly carried away many priſoners, &amp; captiues, with ouer ſenſible proofe of their might &amp; furie. <hi>Mathias Hunnia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi> ſurnamed <hi>Coruinus,</hi> a moſte fortunate prince, and as happie a warrier, who fiue yéeres before was crowned king of Hungarie, by <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick</hi> than Emperour, denou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced &amp; proclaimed warre againſt the Bohemians, being requeſted, and perſwaded thereunto by the Pope, &amp; at that time by force of armes, tooke fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them <hi>Morauia, Sileſia,</hi> and <hi>Luſatia.</hi> The ſame <hi>Mathias</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinued as fierce warre with <hi>Caſimire</hi> the king of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonia,

               <p>The Prince of the Tartarians at the ſame time, aſſaulted and ſpoyled <hi>Ruſsia,</hi> vpon whiche countrie <hi>Tartaria</hi> boundeth on the weaſt.

                  </hi> the force and influence of the Eclipſe ſtill continuing, many princes, and mightie poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates died: and amongſt the reſte, <hi>George</hi> the king of Bohemia, whom <hi>Ladiſlaus,</hi> ſonne to the king of Pollonia ſuccéeded. To conclude, <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> the ſixte King of Ingland, was within the reach of this Eclipſe, taken by king <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth, in the Biſhops palace at London, and by him committed to the tower, where afterwards he was murdered: as more fully appeareth by our owne Ingliſh Chronicles.</p>
               <p>Laſt of all, <hi>Anno <hi>1536.</hi>
                  </hi> there hapned an Eclipſe of the Sunne in the ſeuenth degrée of <hi>Cancer,</hi> that is iuſte in the very ſelfe ſame
<pb facs="tcp:174075:41"/>
degrée, wherein the Sunne was darkened this laſt yeare <hi>1582.</hi> After which Eclipſe there aroſe hote warre in <hi>Picardie,</hi> wherby both the French &amp; Burgundians receiued mutuall harmes and dammages diuers wayes, which are reported to haue bene very great and grieuous. At the ſame time, the ſouldiers of king <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> brother to the Emperour <hi>Charles,</hi> being conducted by their Captaines to reſiſt the force of their enimies in Hungarie, were, as you know, trecherouſly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed into the handes of the Turkes by one <hi>Catzianerus:</hi> of whome they were almoſt all moſt cruelly ſlaine, their chief Captaines taken captiue, and carried away to <hi>Constantinople</hi> the Turkes chiefeſt citie, where they liued in miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſeruitude and bondage. At the ſame time the <hi>Geldrenſes</hi> ſeditiouſly rebelled againſt their Soueraigne. At the ſame time, the moſt fruite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, bewtifull, and noble Ilands <hi>Sicilia</hi> and <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>labria,</hi> were wofully deſtroyed with fire, which did ſtraungly breake out of the ſealand béeing dried vp. At the ſame time their was heard at Rome, a moſt fearefull, and horrible thundering in the aire, béeing alſo the more extraordinarie for the very time of the yeare. At the ſame time, an auncient tower of <hi>Helderberg,</hi> being ſuddain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly blaſted with lightning, did cauſe a ſore ruine, much miſchiefe and great miſerie to that citie. At the ſame time, in high Germanie, their hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb facs="tcp:174075:41"/>
an excéeding great inundation, the force and rage whereof, was paſſing wonderful, and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelous ſtraunge. And after the ſame Eclipſe (which we in Ingland, ought chiefly to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber) twoo notable ſeditions and inſurrections did ſhrewdly trouble, and diſturbe vs héere in Ingland: which fell out in the <hi>18.</hi> yeare of the raigne of the moſt mightie and puiſſant Prince king <hi>Henry</hi> the eight. Whereof the firſte was rayſed principally for religion amongſt the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons of <hi>Lincolneſhire,</hi> who had gathered togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nigh <hi>20000.</hi> perſons, to ſerue their turnes in the atchieuing of that rebellious enterprize. The ſeconde beganne farther of, in <hi>Yorkeſhire,</hi> which northeren commotion was alſo attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for matter of religion, the people there floc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked togither, amounting to the number of fortie thouſand. Againſt thoſe of the firſt inſurrection, the King ſent out the Duke of <hi>Suffolke,</hi> with a ſtrong and princely power, which when the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belles did vnderſtand, they ſtraight waies brake vp there armie, and ſuddainly departed. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe of the ſeconde inſurrection, whiche was ſo farre the greater, his Maieſtie ſent the Dukes of <hi>Northfolke,</hi> and <hi>Southfolke</hi> both, with a farre ſtronger power, and mightier hoſt of ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers: vpon whoſe comming the battaile was appointed to be fought betwéene them on <hi>Simon</hi> and <hi>Iudes</hi> day, but the ſame night it rayned ſo
<pb facs="tcp:174075:42"/>
extréemely, that the twoo armies coulde by no meanes méete according to that appointment. Wherupon the rebels (as lightly they are woont firſt, or laſt) were glad to craue pardon the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time, ſhewing themſelues very deſirous to depart, with due ſubmiſſion to their moſt noble Prince: ſo that both theſe ſeditions were finally pacified, and diſpatched with the death of a fewe Archerebelles, and Captaine commotioners, whiche were ſhortly after executed for example ſake, according to the haynouſneſſe of their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyall, and deſperate attemptes. The ſame E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipſe might peraduenture be accompanied with ſome other ſemblable Euents: but theſe are the chiefeſt, that I can preſently call to minde, and are ſufficient, I ſuppoſe, to inferre my Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, what héede is to be taken of like Eclipſes, and namely this of late. Whereunto if we ſhall nowe conſiderately apply the examples before alledged may we not generally conceiue, what ſequele of troubles and euils, is like to be prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſticated by the ſame? And yet to ſpeake indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently according to the rules of Arte, I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade my ſelfe, that the miſfortunes threatned thereby, ſhall neither be fully ſo hainous, nor of ſo long continuance, as were thoſe of the former Eclipſes. My reaſon is, bicauſe the quantitie of the Eclipſe hauing bene but very little &amp; ſmall, (not one quarter of the Sunne béeing darkned)
<pb facs="tcp:174075:42"/>
the quantitie of the influence and effects is like to be proportionable. For ſo <hi>Meſſahalah</hi> iudgeth in his booke <hi>de Rebus Eclipſium,</hi> the <hi>7.</hi> chapter. <hi>In Eclipſi Solis ſemper ſignificatur magnum ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quod Accidens, ſed tamen ſecundùm quantitatem ipſius Eclipſis.</hi> Wherefore the quantitie of this late Eclipſe béeing ſo ſmall, I preſume, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations, and ſequeles thereof ſhall be both the leſſe in quantitie, and the ſhorter in continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. Nowe, as concerning the Regions, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces, territories, and cities which ſhall chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be afflicted and oppreſſed with the euils enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, (whiche euery man will be readie to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund) it is ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly knowne, which are prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally vnder the dominion, and regiment of the ſigne <hi>Cancer:</hi> as <hi>Numidia, Africe, Bithinia, Phry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia, Colchis, Carthago, Regnum Franciae, Regnum Scotiae, Regnum Granatae, Comitatus Burgundiae, Pruſsia, Hollandia, Selandia, Constantinopolis, Thumiſſa, Venetiae, Mediolanum, Genua, Luca, Piſa, Lubecum, Treueris, Magdeburgum, Gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licium, Berna, Ciuitas S. Andreae, Yorchia, ſiue Eboracum,</hi> as they are confuſedly heaped to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither by our chiefeſt Aſtrologers, reſpecting rather matter, than forme. Of whiche very countries, and cities, thoſe perſons too ſhall eſpecially féele the violence of this Eclipſe, whiche had <hi>Cancer</hi> placed in their Horoſcope. And this in effect is all, that I haue preſently
<pb facs="tcp:174075:43"/>
to ſay, touching the influence, and ſequele of the foreſayde late Eclipſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For, as for thoſe two in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaunces, which you in your chamber, not many moneths ſince, <hi>obiter,</hi> and as it were, <hi>diſputan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di cauſa</hi> obiected agaynſt me, reaſoning then fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarly of the obſeruation, and héede that was to be taken of Eclipſes: the one of <hi>Agathocles,</hi> the famous captaine, and tiranne of <hi>Syracuſae,</hi> the other of <hi>L. Sulpitius Gallus</hi> a noble Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane: whereof <hi>Agathocles,</hi> as I remember, in his wars againſt the Penians, when ſo euer anie Eclipſe was to happen the day before their battaile leaſt his ſouldiers ſhould take any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudiciall or ſuperſtitious conceite thereat, vſed, as you then alledged, to diſcourſe vnto his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie the whole reaſon thereof: ſhewing them, that what ſoeuer ſhoulde chaunce there, was to followe by courſe of nature, &amp; appertained no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to their Militarie affaires: <hi>Sulpitius Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> vnderſtanding likewiſe on a time, that an Eclipſe was at hande, aſſembled his ſouldiers togither, and warned them thereof afore hand, expounding vnto them all the reaſon, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall cauſes of Eclipſes, leaſt they ſhould igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly miſtake them, for heauie, and vnluckie tokens: As for theſe two inſtances, I ſaie, I muſte néedes graunt, they were good martiall pollicies, and wiſe <hi>Stratagemes</hi> for the preſent, to abandon ſuch feare, as their ſouldiers might
<pb facs="tcp:174075:43"/>
haply otherwiſe haue conceyued, by ſuch ſhews of ſome infortunate chaunce, to befall them, but as according to <hi>Ariſtotels</hi> ſaying in his Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques, <hi>Non est tuta Regula hominum voluntas:</hi> ſo I thinke, theſe, and ſuch lyke Militate deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, are not of force, to proue, or diſproue any other Concluſion, but this, that in the time of neceſſitie, or extremitie, eſpecially in warre, it is wiſedome, to make the beſte of euery ſuch Accident, and to interprete it in ſuch wiſe, as may ſéeme moſte behouefull for the incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of thoſe, whom it concerneth, to be kept in harte, and to be deliuered of all by feare, that might any way daunt, or aſtoniſh their minds. Which no doubte was <hi>Aeneas</hi> his politique co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, where <hi>Virgil</hi> writeth of him: <q>Spem vultu ſimulat, premit altum corde dolorem.</q>
               </p>
               <p>In which caſes, not ſo much the very truth and conſequence of the matter is commonly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded, as what is moſt expedient, and auaile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, to ſerue preſent turnes. At an other time I remember, you vrged vpon me the like hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorie out of the fourth booke of <hi>Q. Curtius, <hi>de Rebus gestis Alexandri.</hi>
                  </hi> Where it appeareth, how <hi>Alexanders</hi> ſouldiers were at the firſte terrified, and aſtoniſhed, with a terrible E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipſe of the Moone, and how againe afterward recomforted, and ſatiſfied, by a cunning and ſut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle interpretation of certaine learned Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:174075:44"/>
Aſtrologers, there preſent in the campe. The place is very notable, and therefore I haue thought it worth the recyting. Firſte, their maruelous feare, and agonie is thus deſcribed. <hi>Prima ferè vigilia luna deficiens, primùm nitorem ſideris ſui condidit, deinde ſanguinis colore ſuffuſo, lumen omne foedauit: ſollicitiſque ſub ipſum tanti diſcriminis caſum, ingens relligio, &amp; ex ea formido quaedam incuſſa est: Dijs inuitis, in vltimas terras trahi ſe querebantur: iam nec flumina poſſe adiri, nec ſidera pristinum praestare fulgorem, vastas ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras, deſerta omnia occurrere: in vnius hominis ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctationem, tot millium ſanguinem impendi: fasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dio eſſe patriam: abdicari Philippum patrem: coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum vanis cogitationibus petere.</hi> Then follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <hi>Alexanders</hi> remedie, and meanes of pacifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, more politique for the effect, than true for the cauſe. <hi>I am pro ſeditione Rex erat, cum ad omina interitus, Duces, Principeſque militum frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes adeſſe praetorio iubet, Aegyptioſque vates, quos coeli ac ſiderum peritiſsimos eſſe credebat, quid ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirent, expromere iubet.

In whiche caſe, many both Martial and Mercurial experiments haue bene practized, that are not to enforce any rule of Art, other than this, what way a poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique man is to take in time of like extremitie. As for that efficacie, and ſequele of Eclipſes, that I here ſpeake of, found out by induction of Examples, and obſeruation of cunning Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logers, it is not to be iudged vpon by any ſuch Stratagematicall co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceit either vttered in word, or practized in déede, at the point of neceſſitie: but to be credited ſo farre, as the iudgement of the learned in this facultie, and the foreſayde Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplifications may giue it credite. <hi>Artifici in ſua arte credendum:</hi> eſpecially if that <hi>Artifex</hi> be ſo <hi>expertus,</hi> as he ought to be, &amp; as here I make
