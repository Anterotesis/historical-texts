            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The true and wonderfull <hi>Relation</hi> of the <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witching</hi> of a young <hi>Girle</hi> in <hi>Ireland;</hi> What Way She was tormented, and a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt of the <hi>Ointment</hi> She was cured with.</head>
            <p>IT ſeemeth hard to unruly Minds, that GOD ſhould keep intellectual <hi>Souls</hi> ſo ſtrange to the unſeen <hi>World</hi> of <hi>Spirits;</hi> that We know ſo little of them, that our Knowledge of them is no more by the Way of <hi>Senſe;</hi> But there is in it much of GOD's <hi>Arbitrarie Soveraign Power,</hi> and much of His <hi>Wiſedom,</hi> and much of His <hi>Juſtice,</hi> and alſo of His <hi>Love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to ſee the <hi>Devils</hi> and other <hi>Spirits</hi> or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarly would not be enough to bring our <hi>Atheiſts</hi> to the ſaving knowledge of <hi>GOD,</hi> without which al other knowledge is vain. They that doubt of GOD, the moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, eternal, and infinite Beeing, while they ſee the <hi>Sun, Moon,</hi> and <hi>Stars,</hi> the <hi>Sea,</hi> and <hi>Land,</hi> would not know Him by ſeing created <hi>Spirits,</hi> and finding that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:174441:3"/>
all the <hi>Atheiſts, Sadducees,</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels,</hi> did ſeem to profeſs that were they but ſure of the Reality of the Apparitions and Operations of Spirits, it would cure Them; I thought this the moſt ſuitable Help for them.</p>
            <p>I confeſs it is very difficult to expound the Cauſes of all mentioned in theſe Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories of <hi>Witches</hi> and <hi>Spirits:</hi> But proved Maters of Fact muſt not be denied, but improved as well as well as We can, and And I confeſs very manie cheats of preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>Poſſeſſions</hi> have been diſcovered which have made ſome weak injudicious Men think that all are ſuch. Two ſorts of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons have oft been found Deceavers,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Perſons prepared and trained up pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely by <hi>Papiſt Priests,</hi> to honour their <hi>Exorciſms,</hi> You may find in Print of the <hi>Boy</hi> of <hi>Bilſon, Petrius</hi> who afterwards I heard turned <hi>Quaker</hi> at <hi>Bristol,</hi> many ſuch like are recorded in Hiſtory.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Luſtfull, rank <hi>Girls</hi> and young <hi>Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows,</hi> that plot for ſome amorous proca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Deſign, or have Imaginations con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered by Luſt, tho' I think when they
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:174441:3"/>
come to a <hi>Furor <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>terinus, Sathan</hi> oft ſetts in.</p>
            <p>The Inſtances tell Us, 1. that the ſtate Converſe, Policy, Laws of the <hi>Aerial World</hi> or <hi>Regions,</hi> are much, tho' not wholly, unknown to Us here. 2. And ſo is the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural State of the departed Souls of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Men, as to their having Bodies or no Bodies, their Power, their Witts, their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and Paſſions. 3. and alſo, whether they be proper <hi>Devils</hi> when joined with, or of another <hi>Species.</hi> 4. And 'tis hard to know by their Words or Signs, when it is a <hi>Devil,</hi> &amp; when is an <hi>Humane Soul</hi> that appeareth. 5. and it is unſearchable to us, how far God leaveth inviſible, intellectual Powrs to free will about inferiour things, ſuſpending his predetermining motion tho not his generall motion and concourſs &amp; whether thoſe called <hi>Fairies</hi> and <hi>Goblins</hi> are not ſuch.</p>
            <p>But as all theſe, and more ſuch, are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowen to us, ſo GOD ſeeth it meet for us that it ſhould be ſo, and we ſhould not ſo much as deſire or indeavor that it might be otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:174441:4"/>But we may know (which muſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice us) That no Spirits can doe any thing, but by GOD's will or permiſſion</p>
            <p>But now to come to this true relation which my eyes did ſee all along and many Hundereds did ſee which they can ateſt to this day ſay <hi>Atheiſts</hi> what they will I was not blinded in it.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Antrim</hi> in <hi>Ireland</hi> a litle girle in the ninth year of hir age, for beauty, edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, or birth inferior to none where ſhe lived, having inocently put into hir mouth a <hi>Sorrel</hi> leaf, which was given her by a Witch that begged at the door, to whom ſhe had firſt given a peice of bread, and then ſome Beer, it was ſcarce ſwallowed by her, when ſhe began to be tortured in her bowels, to tremble all over, and then to be convulſt, and in fine, to ſwon away &amp; fall as one dead. Severall Doctors being caled (for at the forſaid place wher theſe things happned in <hi>May</hi> 1698. it is cuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary for to practiſe phyſick) tho' they ſo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> manie Days experimented the Remedie u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual in this Caſe; The Child found no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, but was ſtill aflicted with very freqent

and moſt terrible <hi>Paroxiſms;</hi> whereupon, as the cuſtom of the Country is, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult the Miniſters of that place, but they had ſcarce laid their Hands on Her when the child was transformed by the <hi>Daemon</hi> in to ſuch ſhaps as a man that hath not beheld it with his eyes, would hardly be brought to imagine. It began firſt to rowl it ſelf about, and nixt to Vomit <hi>Horſe Dung, Needles, Pins, Hairs, Feathers,</hi> bottoms of <hi>Threed,</hi> Fieces of <hi>Glaſs Window Nails</hi> draven out of a Cart or Coach wheels, an iron <hi>knife</hi> above a ſpan long, <hi>Egg</hi> and <hi>Fiſh ſhells</hi> in the mean while, hir parents and thoſe of the neighbourhood, obſerve that whenſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Witch came near the Houſe, or ſo much as turned her eye towards it, even at the diſtance of two hundreth paces, the poor Child was in much greater tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment then befor, inſomuch that ſhe could by no means be eaſie of her fitt, or ſhew one ſign of life until ſhe was at a very great <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1+ letters">

by the <hi>Minister</hi> who aſſiſted Her in Her laſt <hi>Agony,</hi> and at that Moment on which depends Eternity; when the Executioner had now fitted the Rope to her Neck, that ſhe would diſſolve the <hi>Spell,</hi> and eaſe the Child, ſhe ſaid it was not in her Power be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the <hi>Ember-Weeks</hi> were paſt ſince ſhe had bewitched Her; adding, that ſhould ſhe undo the Villanies ſhe had perpetarted, the child would not ſo quickly recover, for the two other <hi>Witches,</hi> whom ſhe named, had alſo given her mortal <hi>Infections,</hi> from the Effects whereof ſhe could not without Difficulty, and much time, be delivered, the Mother as in a deſpicable caſe, brought her Daughter to me about the middle of <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember,</hi> and I had her with Me ſome weeks What I then ſaw, heard, and handled, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I know many <hi>Phyſicians,</hi> thoſe eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially that are averſe that there can be <hi>Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chas,</hi> will hardly believe it upon my Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative; So may GOD help Me, as I ſhall moſt truly relate what I ſaw. The Day af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this unfortunat child came to my houſe I took care to ſend for a <hi>Miniſter</hi> who ſtill lives here, while he was yet 50 paces from
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:174441:5"/>
my Chamber, the <hi>Girle</hi> fell down as one deprived of Life; I took her for dead, For ſhe had not ſo much as the leaſt <hi>breath:</hi> her Fingers and Toes, (which if I had not ſeen it my ſelf, I could not have believed it,) were ſo writhen and convulſt, that the exterior or third Joint, ſttuck ſo hard un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſecond, a thing which is ſcarce poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible narurallie, that they might ſeem to have been faſtned together with the ſtiffeſt <hi>Glue:</hi> I endeavoured to thruſt a Golden Bodkin betwixt them, and after an Iron Nail, a Wooden Spindle, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but all in vain; the <hi>Mother</hi> ſeing the <hi>Child</hi> fall, For ſhe would never go one ſtep from her, ſaid, the <hi>Miniſters</hi> were comeing, ſhe had no ſooner ſaid this, but they knocked at the Door: when they were come in and light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a <hi>Candle,</hi> as ſoon as ever they had read the firſt Words of a Chapter of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> of S. <hi>Matthew,</hi> the Girle which hitherto had lain more immovable than any dead <hi>Corps,</hi> fell a ſhaking all over, Her Fingers and Toes continuing as they were, with that Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence that ſhe could not be held ſtill by ſix of us, by no means We could uſe; my ſelf

who with all my ſtrength eſſayed to hold her Head, obſerved it both by my ſight and feeling, to be writhen as by an <hi>Ophistho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick Convulſion,</hi> together with Her Neck towards her ſhoulders; in the mean time, her belly was ra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

The Sound was the neareſt to that which is cauſed by tempeſtuous Waves under the Prow of a ſhip; all this while the child vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited ſevral of the abovementioned things I begg'd the <hi>Miniſter,</hi> out of Compaſſion to Her, to forbear his reading, he had ſcarce pronounced the laſt ſillable, when in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant ſhe lay as quiet as poſſible, and after He had quited the Houſe, and was at a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable diſtance off, ſhe undid her fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and Toes, and open her Eyes, &amp; ſtraight way ſtood up, and when ſhe had weept a little, and chid her mother for ſending for the <hi>Minister,</hi> tho' ſhe never ſaw them, nor as ſhe ſaid, heard them, ſhe preſently began to eat, drink, and play with her equals
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:174441:6"/>
juſt as if nothing had ailed her, but upon the <hi>Miniſter</hi>'s returning to do his office, ſhe was as formerly, I ſaw her this while caſt up Feathers, Bundles of Straw, above the bigneſs of my thumb, with pins ſtuck acroſs the ſtraws, Points woven of Threed of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Colours, and a row of Pins ſtuck in a blue paper, as freſh and new as any ſold in the <hi>Pedlar</hi>'s ſtall: In fine, every thing as the innocent child affirmed, which ſhe had ſeen in the <hi>Witches</hi> basket when ſhe begg'd, which favours plainly of <hi>Devilſm,</hi> &amp; which all the <hi>Philoſophers</hi> in the World, are not able to ſolve; for by what Operation could every thing ſhe had ſeen in the basket, be conveyed in the ſame kind and tale into the Bowels of the child, except the <hi>Devil</hi> himſelf was not aſſiſting? But when I ſaw all ſhe had caſt up, was perfectly dry, and without the leaſt wet, I told the Miniſters and ſeveral learned men preſent (for I cal'd many out of deſire of being the better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed) that ſurely our Eyes were inchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; for that theſe things could not poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly come out of her Body, For how could it be that the pricking of ſo many Pins,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:174441:7"/>
ſhould bring up no Blood? How could a ſharp knife come up the narrow throat of a young child without cutting the paſſage I added that it was my Opinion that theſe things muſt be convyed privatly ſome way from ſome other Place, and then by the malicious Demon that took pleaſure to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceave us, drop from the Childs Lips into our hands and that I was brought to mind of a Verſe in <hi>Ovid,</hi> which I never under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, but now leſs than ever, it is this,</p>
