            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Your Petitioners thought it high time to adreſs themſelves to this Honourable Houſe, and do begg leave to lay open be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you, the occaſions by which the Parliaments good intentions, and your Petitioners good hopes have bin fruſtrated.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">Firſt, That Act leaving the Trade of <hi>Europe</hi> open, to be Navigated by any Ships belonging to the Subjects of this Common-wealth, without any reſtriction of the Nation, or quality of perſons by whom the ſaid Ships ſhould be Sailed, hath ſince the War with <hi>Spain</hi> put all forraigne built Ships belonging to this Nation into the hands of <hi>Dutch Maſters</hi> and <hi>Marriners</hi>: Becauſe the Marchants who imploy the ſaid Ships, ſuppoſed their Trade during this War could not be otherwiſe ſecured.</p>
            <p n="2">Secondly, That Opinion of the Marchants hath occaſioned from time to time their imployment of a multitude of Holland <hi>Ships,</hi> under pretended and fraudulent Bils of Sale.</p>
            <p n="3">Thirdly, The Act of Parliament leaving the power of Seizure of Ships and Goods, (which by vertue of that Act were ſeizable) to any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons whatſoever; the Proprietors of the ſaid Ships and Goods, have appointed Confidents of their own, to make the firſt Seizure of them: And by not Proſecuting ſuch Seizure, have made null the good intention of the Law.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>By means whereof,</hi>

            </p>
            <p n="1">Firſt, That no Ships may be deemed to belong to the Subjects of this Common-wealth as Owners, but ſuch as are failed both out and home by a Maſter, and at leaſt three quarters parts of the Mariners who are Natives, Subjects of ſome of the Dominions thereof.</p>
            <p n="2">Secondly, That the Statutes of the <hi>5th</hi> year of King <hi>Richard</hi> the <hi>2d.</hi> and the <hi>3d Chap.</hi> and of the <hi>4th</hi> of <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>7th</hi> and the <hi>10th Chap.</hi> for the preſervation of the Navigation of this Nation, may be revived, and re-inforced.</p>
            <p n="3">Thirdly, That no Fiſh whatſoever taken by the Subjects of this Common-wealth, either at home or abroad, may be permitted to be tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſported to any forraigne Market, upon any forraigne Ships whatſoever.</p>
            <p n="4">Fourthly, That a perfect Regiſter may preſently be taken of all forraigne Bottomes which do now really belong to the Subjects of this Common-wealth; and a ſevere <hi>Prohibition</hi> be made, that no more may be bought for the future.</p>
            <p n="5">Fifthly, That the Clauſe of the Act of the year 1651. For condemning the Ship, Gunns, Tackle, and Apparell, for the ſake of any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited goods that may be found in her, may be moderated and limitted ſo as the Owners and Maſters of Ships belonging to the Subjects of this Common-wealth, may not ſuffer for offences committed contrary to their knowledge and will.</p>
            <p n="6">Sixthly, That thoſe proviſions and remedies may by your wiſdomes be ſo effectually penned, with ſuch ſevere penalties and executions, as may either totally diſcourage former tranſgreſſors from attempting the like, or puniſh the new, according to their merrits.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And then your Petitioners doubt not, but by the bleſſing of God, you ſhall in a ſhort time ſee this Nation to abound again in the number of Trading-Ships, and Sea-men: To the reſtoring of the Glory, Strength, and Wealth of the Nation.</hi>
