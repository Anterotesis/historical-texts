         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap> Meſſengers, Our Sheriffs in that part, conjunctly and ſeverally, ſpecially conſtitute, Greeting: Foraſmuch as the late Rebellion, and riſing in Arms in the Western Shires, is too great an evidence that there are man Diſaffected Persons in theſe Places, who are ready to involve the Kingdom again in a bloody and unnatural war: And that we have juſt reaſon to ſuſpect that theſe Rebels will be ready to lay hold in this opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to riſe in Arms, when we are neceſſitate to continue the war with Our Forraign Enemies. And not only to make uſe of ſuch Arms, Powder and Ammunition, as they have concealed, or may be tranſported to them from Our Enemies; but will ſeize upon the Arms of Our well affected Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, who reſide amongſt them, and are not able to make reſiſtance: Which may endanger the Peace of the Kingdom, and weaken Our Forces, neceſſitating them at one time to oppoſe Forraign Invaſions, and Inteſtine Commotions. As likewiſe, that according to their former wicked practices, they may invade the Miniſters of the Goſpel, who are lawfully admitted Preachers amongſt them, and do violence or injury to their Perſons, to the great contemnt of Our Authority, and ſcandal of the Reformed Religion, as it is now proteſt. Therefore, We, with Advice of the Lords of Our Privy Council, Command and charge all perſons reſiding within the Shires of <hi>Lanerk, Air, Renfrew, Wigton,</hi> and the Stewartry of <hi>Kirkcudbright,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt and the firſt day of <hi>May</hi> next, to bring in all their Arms and Ammunition which they have in their poſſeſſion, of whatſoever ſort (allowing Gentlemen only to carry Swords, and none other) to the Head Burgh of the reſpective Shires and Stewartry; and deliver the ſame to the Sheriff, his Depute, or any having his Order. With Certification to them, if they faylie, they ſhall be Fyn'd by Our Secret Council in the ſums of Money underwritten; <hi>viz.</hi> Jik Gentleman, in the ſum of two thouſand Merks; and every other perſon, in the ſum of five hundreth Merks; to be divided, the one half to be paid to Our Exchequer, and the other half to any perſon who ſhall firſt diſcover the Concealers: And further, ſhall be proceeded againſt as ſeditious perſons, and diſaffected to Our Government, Likeas, We ordain the ſaid Sheriff, his Depute, or any other appointed by him, immediatly upon the delivery of their ſaid Arms or Ammunition, to carry the ſame of <hi>Striviling,</hi> or <hi>Dumbarton</hi> Caſtles, which ſhall be next adjacent; there to be kept by the Governor thereof. As likewiſe, We Command and Charge, That all Heretors and Pariſhtioners, reſiding in any of the Paroches within the ſaids bounds, Protect and Defend the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, Famalies and Goods of their reſpective Miniſters, within their ſeveral Paroches, from all Affronts and Injuries to be committed by inſolent and diſaffected Perſons to the preſent Government; as well when they are in the Exerciſe of the Miniſterial Function, as reſiding at their own houſes and Dwellings: with certification, that if any Injury or Affront ſhall be done to them, in their Perſons or Goods, that the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhtioners who ſhall ſuffer the ſame to be done, and not oppoſe the doing thereof, ſhall be repute and hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den as art and part of the ſaids Crimes and Violence, and be proceeded againſt by Law, as guilty thereof, and puniſhed according to the quality of their offence, with all rigour. And incaſe the ſaids Injuries ſhall be done by ſurpriſal, That they follow and purſue the committers thereof, untill they apprehend their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and preſent them to Our Secret Council, to be Judged by them, as they ſhall order: Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe we declare, that they themſelves ſhall be lyable for ſuch Reparation, Dammage and Interest, as the ſaids Lords of Council ſhall think ſit to determine. And Ordains the ſaids Sheriffs to cauſe intimat theſe preſents, by Publick Proclamation, at the Mercat-Croſſes of the head Burghs of the ſaids reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Shires and Stewartries: And cauſe read the ſame at all the Paroch Churches within the ſaids Shires and Stewartry, upon a Sunday before noon, after Divine Service, with all diligence: And that theſe preſents be printed, that none pretend ignorance.</p>
