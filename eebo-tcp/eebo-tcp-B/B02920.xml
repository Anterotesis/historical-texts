            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>Séeking ſtill for that precious ſtone,</l>

               <l>She with her Nurſe, Husband, and Child,</l>
               <l>In poor array their ſighs beguil'd.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Thus through <hi>London</hi> they paſſed along</l>

               <l>Thus all along eſcaping wrong,</l>
               <l>at <hi>Billinſgate</hi> they all did méet,</l>

               </l>
               <l>They ſimply went with all their charge.</l>

               <l>with journeys ſhort on foot they went,</l>
               <l>Vnto the Sea-coaſt came they down,</l>
               <l>to paſs the Seas was their intent:</l>
               <l>And God provided ſo that day,</l>
               <l>That they took ſhip and ſayld away.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>And with a proſperous gale of wind,</l>

               <l>This was to their great eaſe of mind,</l>
               <l>and from their heavy hearts much wo did drive,</l>
               <l>And ſo with thanks to God on high,</l>
               <l>They took their way to <hi>Germany.</hi>
               </l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Thus as they travel'd ſtill diſguis'd,</l>
               <l>upon the High-way ſuddenly,</l>
               <l>By cruel Thieves they were ſurpriz'd,</l>
               <l>aſſayling their ſmall company:</l>
               <l>And all their treaſures and their ſtore,</l>
               <l>They took away and beat them ſore.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The Nurſe in midſt of their fight,</l>
               <l>laid down the Child upon the ground,</l>
               <l>She ran away out of their ſight,</l>
               <l>and never after that was found:</l>
               <l>Then did the Dutches make great moan,</l>
               <l>With her good Husband all alone.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The Thieves had there their horſes kill'd,</l>
               <l>and all their money quite had took,</l>
               <l>The pretty baby almoſt ſpoil'd,</l>
               <l>was by the Nurſe like wiſe forſook:</l>
               <l>And they far from their friends did ſtand</l>
               <l>And ſuccourleſs in a ſtrange Land.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The Sky likewiſe began to ſcowl,</l>
               <l>it Haild and Raind in pitious ſort,</l>
               <l>The way was long and wondrous foul,</l>
               <l>then may I now full well report,</l>
               <l>Their grief and ſorrow was not ſmall,</l>
               <l>When this unhappy chance did fall.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>SOmetimes the Dutches bore the Child,</l>
               <l>as wet as ever ſhe could be,</l>
               <l>And when the Lady kind and mild</l>
               <l>was weary, then the Child bore he:</l>
               <l>And thus they one another eas'd,</l>
               <l>And with their fortunes well was pleas'd.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>And after many a weary ſtep,</l>
               <l>all wet-ſhod both in dirt and mire,</l>
               <l>After much grief their hearts yet leaps,</l>
               <l>for labour doth ſome reſt require:</l>
               <l>A town before them they did ſée,</l>
               <l>But Lodged there they could not be.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>From houſe to houſe then they did go,</l>
               <l>ſéeking that night where they might lye,</l>
               <l>But want of money was their wo,</l>
               <l>and ſtill their babe with cold did cry;</l>
               <l>With cap and knée they courteſie make</l>
               <l>But none of them would pity take.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Lo here a Prince of great blood,</l>
               <l>doth pray a peaſant for releif,</l>
               <l>With tears bedewed as ſhe ſtood,</l>
               <l>yet few or none regard her grief:</l>
               <l>Her ſpéech they could not underſtand,</l>
               <l>But gave her money in her hand.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>When all in vain her ſpéeches ſpent,</l>
               <l>and that they could not houſe-room get,</l>
               <l>Into a Church-porch then they went,</l>
               <l>to ſtand out of the rain and wet:</l>
               <l>Then ſaid the Dutches to her Dear,</l>
               <l>O that we had ſome fire here.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Then did her Husband ſo provide;</l>
               <l>that fire and coals he got with ſpéed:</l>
               <l>She ſat down by the fire ſide</l>
               <l>to dreſs her Daughter that had néed:</l>
               <l>And whilſt ſhe dreſt it in her lap,</l>
               <l>Her Husband made the Infant pap.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Anon the Sexſton thither came,</l>
               <l>and finding them there by the fire,</l>
               <l>The drunken Knave, all void of ſhame,</l>
               <l>to drive them out was his deſire:</l>
               <l>And ſpurn'd forth the Noble Dame,</l>
               <l>Her husbands wrath ſhe did inflame.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>And all in fury as he ſtood,</l>
               <l>he wrung the Church-keys out of his hand</l>
               <l>And ſtruck him ſo that all the blood,</l>
               <l>his head ran down as he did ſtand:</l>
               <l>Wherefore the Sexſton preſently,</l>
               <l>For help and aid aloud did cry.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Then came the Officers in haſt,</l>
               <l>and took the Dutches and her Child,</l>
               <l>And with her husband thus they paſt,</l>
               <l>like Lambs beſet with Tygers wild;</l>
               <l>And to the Governor were brought,</l>
               <l>Who underſtood them not in ought.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Then Maſter <hi>Bertue</hi> brave and bold,</l>
               <l>in Latine made a gallant ſpéech,</l>
               <l>Which all their miſery did unfold,</l>
               <l>and their high favour did beſeech?</l>
               <l>With that a Doctor ſitting by,</l>
               <l>Did know the Dutches preſently.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>And thereupon ariſing ſtreight,</l>
               <l>with words abaſhed at this ſight,</l>
               <l>Vnto them all that there did wait,</l>
               <l>he thus brake forth in words aright:</l>
               <l>Behold within your ſight, quoth he,</l>
               <l>A Prince of moſt high degree.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>With that the Governour and all the reſt,</l>
               <l>were all amazed the ſame to hear,</l>
               <l>Who welcomed this new come gueſt,</l>
               <l>with reverence great and Princely chear,</l>
               <l>And afterwards convey'd they were,</l>
               <l>Vnto their Friend, Prince <hi>Caſſimere.</hi>
               </l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>A Son ſhe had in <hi>Germany,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Pergrine Bartue</hi> call'd by name,</l>
               <l>Surnam'd the good Lord <hi>Willoughby,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>of courage great and worthy fame:</l>
               <l>Her daughter young with her went,</l>
               <l>Was afterwards Counteſs of <hi>Kent.</hi>
               </l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>For when Queen <hi>Mary</hi> was deceaſt</l>
               <l>the Dutches home return'd again</l>
