            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE CASE OF THE Poor BREWER Humbly Repreſented.</head>
            <p>THE Exciſe on Beer and Ale is a conſiderable part of the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue, and for that Reaſon the Brewer ought to be conſidered. That as to the complaints of the Poor, 'tis very improbable they ſhould occaſion either their want or their clamour. For the quantity of Corn, beſides Moloſſo's which they uſe, is not more than 3 millions of Quarters in a Year, and if there ſhould be produc'd 3 hundred thouſand Quarters more than what they uſe, ſurely that is enough to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the Poor, and other uſes.</p>
            <p>The Brewers are ſo advantageous to the Kingdom, that there are 3 Men who conſume more Malt in a year, than all the Diſtillers have done; and ſurely ſuch Men ought not to be laid by, tho but for one Year; for 'tis more to the advantage of <hi>England</hi> certainly to let the whole Trade of Diſtilling be put down, than for ſuch Men to ſuffer, tho it ſhould be by obliging them to brew a little leſs Malt.</p>
            <p>The Brewers are come to that perfection in their Trade, that they now fine down their Waſh, and make Drink of that which the Hogs uſed to eat before.</p>
            <p>What if there is as much Malt Brew'd into Strong Beer or Ale, as is conſum'd by Diſtilling, and which pays no more Duty to the King, than ſingle Beer and Ale; yet ſurely the Exciſe for ſingle Drink is enough for both.</p>
            <p>What if there is a ſcarcity of Corn, is it neceſſary that the Brewer be reſtrain'd in their uſe of Malt? Is it not ſufficient to prevent Diſtilling? For then Corn will be cheap and plenty; and when there is but one buyer no body need fear that the Brewer will give too much for his Corn. The Farmer can't fatten Hogs with Barley to very great advantage, but if the Brewer once brings Corn to ſuch a cheapneſs, that it will be more profit to feed Poultry than bring it to <hi>London</hi> Markets to ſell them, the Poor won't ſurely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of the dearneſs of Corn, unleſs the Poultry ſhould unhappily conſume more than the Diſtillers have done; for by the beſt computation, if they ſhould conſume as much as has been ſuppoſed, it will amount to near Half a Peck to a man in one Year; which being ſo conſiderable they ought to be put down. For the worſt that can come is, that we ſhall then im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port <hi>French</hi> Brandy, and that will be ſo much to the advantage of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> that we only ſend ready Money out of the Land; and if we export Malt Spirits, it will be of that pernicious conſequence, that 'twill bring mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney home.</p>
            <p>A <hi>great</hi> many other conſiderations might be offer'd; but 'tis hop'd from theſe, that no body will put it into the head if any man to move, that the Brewer may be ſo much as conſider'd in this matter.</p>
