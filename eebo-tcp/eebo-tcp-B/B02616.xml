            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>BUt will you now to peace encline,</l>
               <l>And languiſh in the maine deſigne,</l>
               <l>and leave us in the lurch.</l>
               <l>I would not Monarchy deſtroy,</l>
               <l>But onely as the way t'enjoy,</l>
               <l>the ruines of the Church.</l>
               <l>Is not the Biſhops Bill deni'd,</l>
               <l>And we ſtill threatned to be tri'd?</l>
               <l>you ſee the King imbraces</l>
               <l>Thoſe counſels he approv'd before,</l>
               <l>Nor does he promiſe which is more</l>
               <l>that we ſhall have their places.</l>
               <l>Did I for this bring in the Scot,</l>
               <l>(For 'tis no ſecret now) the plot</l>
               <l>was <hi>Say's</hi> and mine together;</l>
               <l>Did I for this returne againe?</l>
               <l>And ſpent a winter then in vaine</l>
               <l>once more t'invite them hither.</l>
               <l>Though more our money then our cauſe</l>

               <l>my labour was not loſt;</l>
               <l>At my returne I brought you thence</l>
               <l>Neceſſity my ſtrong pretence,</l>
               <l>and this ſhall quit your coſt.</l>
               <l>Did I for this my Country bring,</l>
               <l>To helpe their Knight againſt their King,</l>
               <l>and raiſe the firſt diviſion;</l>
               <l>Yet I the buſineſſe did decline</l>
               <l>Though I contriv'd the whole deſigne,</l>
               <l>and taught them to petition.</l>
               <l>So many nights ſpent in the City</l>

               <l>the wheele that governs all;</l>
               <l>From thence the change in Church &amp; State</l>
               <l>And all the miſchiefes beares their date</l>
               <l>from Haberdaſhers Hall.</l>
               <l>Did we force Ireland to deſpaire?</l>
               <l>Upon the King to caſt the war,</l>
               <l>to make the world abhor him;</l>
               <l>Becauſe the Rebels uſed his name,</l>
               <l>Though we our ſelves can doe the ſame,</l>
               <l>while both alike are for him.</l>
               <l>Then the ſame fire we kindle here</l>
               <l>Whilſt we pretend to quench that there,</l>
               <l>and wiſely loſt that Nation;</l>
               <l>To doe as crafty beggars uſe</l>

               <l>the ſimple mans compaſſion.</l>
               <l>Have I ſo often paſt betweene</l>
               <l>Winſor and Weſtminſter unſeene?</l>
               <l>and did my ſelfe divide,</l>
               <l>To keep his Excellence in awe,</l>
               <l>And give the Parliament the Law,</l>
               <l>for they knew none beſide.</l>
               <l>Did I for this take paines to teach</l>
               <l>Our zealous ignorance to preach,</l>
               <l>and did their lungs inſpire;</l>
               <l>Read'em their texts, ſhew'd them their parts</l>
               <l>And taught them all their little arts</l>
               <l>to fling abroad the ſire.</l>
               <l>Sometimes to beg, ſometimes to threaten,</l>
               <l>Then ſay the Cavaleers are beaten,</l>
               <l>and ſtroake the peoples eares.</l>
               <l>And ſtreight when victories grow cheap,</l>
               <l>And will no more advance the heap,</l>
               <l>to raiſe the price of feares.</l>
               <l>And now the books, and now the bells,</l>
               <l>And now our arts the Preacher tells</l>
               <l>to edifie the people;</l>
               <l>All our Divinity is newes,</l>

               <l>the Pulpit and the Steeple.</l>
               <l>And ſhall we kindle all this flame,</l>
