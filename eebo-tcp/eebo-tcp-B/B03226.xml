         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <lg>
               <l>WHen <hi>Sol</hi> had ſet his day at one at Noon,</l>
               <l>An Ancient Lord, of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Was executed, and there then did die</l>
               <l>For Treaſon great, againſt His Majeſty;</l>
               <l>Deſigning Government to overthrow,</l>
               <l>And Chriſtian Religion, to lay low,</l>
               <l>Whereby to turn, the whole Engliſh Nation</l>
               <l>Into Blood, Murder, Sword, and Conflagration,</l>
               <l>And to figure us of the Pope's die,</l>
               <l>To become Devils in Divinity.</l>
               <l>He's a Deceiver, from the beginning,</l>
               <l>And only learneth men, the Trade of ſinning;</l>
               <l>Shews them the Mountains, and exalts them high,</l>
               <l>Only to throw them headlong from the Sky;</l>
               <l>Like a cunning Fowler, ſtill his Nets doth lay</l>
               <l>For Night-Birds, Owles, while others flie away:</l>
               <l>So that the Priſoners pay for coming there,</l>
               <l>As Sparrows taken, by the Hawks in the Air;</l>
               <l>Ambition like, the ſoaring lofty Kite</l>
               <l>Flies ſtill ſo long, at laſt flies out of ſight,</l>
               <l>And by uſing of that violence ſtill,</l>
               <l>At laſt drops down, and falls by its own ill:</l>
               <l>So Vice gives all its Children, but a falſe Light,</l>
               <l>The Flame goes out, with an eternal Night.</l>
               <l>'Tis ſtrange Religion, thus ſhould point to Blood,</l>
               <l>Therefore not ſo eaſily underſtood;</l>
               <l>Yet 'tis ſo, let us do what we can,</l>
               <l>So that it concerneth, nay every man;</l>
               <l>Becauſe, in dayly Fears, about our Lives,</l>
               <l>To loſe our Children, and our deareſt Wives;</l>
               <l>Nature ſtrives, ſtill, to preſerve it ſelf,</l>
               <l>As the gay Dutch-man, travels towards the <hi>Dolf:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Looks that he's well provided to go on</l>
               <l>To take his Journey, whether ſhort or long;</l>
               <l>Therefore we all look after a Diſeaſe,</l>
               <l>That ſo recovered, we may take our eaſe;</l>
               <l>Since Health's the I lower of all Bleſſings high,</l>
               <l>As the Sun's the Coach-man of the Sky.</l>
               <l>This is a Cauſe, relates to our Religion,</l>
               <l>Who would have men, to be reaſonable;</l>
               <l>Yet teaches men, how ſecretly to act ill,</l>
               <l>And plays the Fool, with the rebellious Will;</l>
               <l>The Charms falſe, and only from the Devil,</l>
               <l>The great Mountebank of the whole World's evil,</l>
               <l>That ſtill draws on poor Souls to be undone,</l>
               <l>As Miſts are ſcattered by the brighter Sun:</l>
               <l>This therefore teaches us their artful Harms,</l>
               <l>To be aware, of ſuch like kind of Charms;</l>
               <l>Becauſe we ſee, all Vice is like an Eel,</l>
               <l>Which ſtill, doth trip up, its own natural heel;</l>
               <l>Like Darkneſs, pleas'd with its own diſmal hue,</l>
               <l>Glides off from Colours, that are brave and true:</l>
               <l>All men being pleaſed, with their own Actions ſtill,</l>
               <l>Whether they prove, for good, or whether ill,</l>
               <l>And as Light, is above the Darkneſs ſtill,</l>
               <l>So the High-born Engliſh, do fear no ill;</l>
               <l>Their Faith's in God, and their Manners high,</l>
               <l>That renders them the Allies of the Sky.</l>
               <l>We having then at length, no more to do,</l>
               <l>But affect good Manners, and none new;</l>
               <l>For Vices, we our ſelves, are given to,</l>
               <l>Things that do always, conjure up our Woe;</l>
               <l>That we ſhould no ſuch fatal Object be,</l>
               <l>To be lamented in Calamity;</l>
               <l>Since 'tis the Pleaſure, of the alwiſe Heaven,</l>
               <l>To make different Objects, not all even.</l>
               <l>In ſhort, does Languages teach men to be uncivil,</l>
               <l>Why then they'r the Goblins of the Devil;</l>
               <l>Who while they laugh, their Hearts another way,</l>
               <l>As falſe as Water-men, on every day;</l>
               <l>Yet Nature doth provide for each Diſeaſe,</l>
               <l>To find a Remedy, for us ſtill to eaſe.</l>
               <l>The Dog, when ſick, he goes unto the Graſs,</l>
               <l>And there lies down, and playing like an Aſs;</l>
               <l>At length grows well, and whisks he on again,</l>
               <l>As the brisk Coney, after a ſhower of Rain:</l>
               <l>Charity therefore, always doth begin at home,</l>
               <l>To look to our Enemies, the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi>
               </l>
               <l>To love our King, and to honour him ſtill,</l>
               <l>And to ſee our ſelves, be guilty of no ill;</l>
               <l>But like Travellers, go on the Golden Way</l>
               <l>Of the Proteſtant Truth, without the leaſt delay;</l>
               <l>For Heaven proves, moſt auſpicuouſly kind</l>
               <l>To men of Truth, and of a generous Mind;</l>
               <l>By ſaving, and protecting of them ſtill</l>
               <l>From the Devil, and his Accomplices of ill:</l>
               <l>Therefore we have reaſon, and that all</l>
               <l>To ſtudy to be juſt, both great and ſmall;</l>
               <l>Since Miſchiefs, as they fatten, ſtand in need</l>
               <l>Of to be purged, and gently ſtill to bleed;</l>
               <l>Therefore give Eare, and to Reaſon ſtill draw nigh,</l>
