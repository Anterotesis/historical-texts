            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <lg>
               <l>How happy are we,</l>
               <l>When we meet with a Beauty,</l>
               <l>That is charming and free,</l>
               <l>and knows more than her Duty,</l>
               <l>Women they were made for men,</l>
               <l>'The Gods above allow the ſame;</l>
               <l>But this cunning Creature</l>
               <l>Will not yield to Nature,</l>
               <l>Nor will let you do't,</l>
               <l>Unleſs you court her to't,</l>
               <l>And give her Gold to boot,</l>
               <l>Put you, you muſt ever ſwear for to be true.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But when the Guinea wins her,</l>
               <l>ſhe's at your Devotion,</l>
               <l>She'll freely let you in Sir,</l>
               <l>and meet you in the motion;</l>
               <l>'Tis then, if you behold her eyes,</l>
               <l>How they rowl when at the ſport ſhe lies;</l>
               <l>Firſt, ſhe turns the white,</l>
               <l>And then ſhe ſhuts them quite,</l>
               <l>And then with all her might,</l>
               <l>She ſeems her Lips to bite,</l>
               <l>And ſwears you're her Delight,</l>
               <l>Such Joys ſure ſhe never felt the like before.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>And if you have but Gold Sir,</l>
               <l>with you ſhe'll be moving,</l>
               <l>She cares not though you're old Sir,</l>
               <l>ſhe will be fond and loving,</l>
               <l>In Love ſhe'll paſs the time away,</l>
               <l>And ask you all the night to ſtay,</l>
               <l>And for your money's ſake,</l>
               <l>She'll hang about your Neck,</l>
               <l>And give a Kiſs to pleaſe,</l>
               <l>And then your hand ſhe'll ſqueze,</l>
               <l>And look with dying Eyes,</l>
               <l>And ſwear, ſwear ſhe dies if that you leave her there.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>When ſhe's got your Treaſure,</l>
               <l>and left you no money,</l>
               <l>Then you muſt wait her leiſure,</l>
               <l>while another ſhe calls Hunny;</l>
               <l>She minds not all the Oaths you ſwear,</l>
               <l>Although you vow you love her ne're ſo dear</l>
               <l>But he that brings the Cole,</l>
               <l>Shall have my Ladys Hole,</l>
               <l>For money is the cry,</l>
               <l>Fine Rigging for to buy,</l>
               <l>Or elſe ſhe will deny</l>
               <l>The toy, toy, the <hi>Cullies</hi> of the Town call joy.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But where's the Charming Beauty,</l>
               <l>that's conſtant and loyal,</l>
               <l>That loves and will be true to ye,</l>
               <l>when put to the tryal;</l>
               <l>Although you'd Guineas give her down.</l>
               <l>Yet ſhe no ways can be like the Town,</l>
               <l>For ſhe'll be juſt and true,</l>
               <l>And lye with none but you,</l>
               <l>While the jilting Whore</l>
               <l>ets you and thouſands more,</l>
               <l>To do her o'er and o'er,</l>
