            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Full and True RELATION, Of the fortunate Victory gained over the Moors by the Garriſon of <hi>Tangier,</hi> upon the 27. of <hi>October,</hi> 1680.</head>
            <p>UPon the <hi>Moors</hi> refuſing to make a Peace, according to the Articles pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by Sir <hi>Palms Fairbourn</hi> our Lieutenant Governour, while he was alive, and their approaching their Trenches within 12 or 15 yards of our new Work at <hi>Pauls</hi>-fort, and their bringing a Piece of Cannon within a hundred yards of the ſaid Fort: It was reſolved in a Council of War, Colonel <hi>Sackville</hi> preſiding, to make a Sally the 27. of this inſtant, at 5 of the Clock in the morning, upon the left hand of <hi>Pauls</hi>-fort, with all the Forces in the Garriſon, leaving only the ordinary Guards in the Town.</p>
            <p>The Troops at their firſt drawing out upon the left hand of <hi>Pauls</hi>-fort, were ranked in Battalia in three Lines.</p>
            <p>Five Battalions of Foot, conſiſting of about 250 men, each Battalion with a Battalion of Sea-men, conſiſting of about 400. men, which have been a Shoar, ſince the taking of <hi>Pauls</hi>-fort, by order of Admiral <hi>Herbert.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſix Battalions of Foot was drawn up on the right hand, and being ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently covered on that ſide by the Fort, and the Line of communication be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Town and the Fort,</p>
            <p>The three Troops of <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and three Troops of <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Horſe, were drawn up on the left hand of the Fort; There was from every Battalion of Foot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catch'd 48 Fuzeliers, which were diſpoſed into ſix ſeveral Plottons upon the head of all the Troops, with the Company of Granadeers of <hi>Dumbartons</hi> Regiment ſeparated upon the right and left hand Plottons, where it was judged the hotteſt action would be: And a Company of Granadeers of Sea-men in the Center with theſe Plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons, with the number of 12 Horſemen from each Troop to ſuſtain theſe Plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons of Foot, who were to make the firſt Attatcks upon the place of Arms, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in one hundred yards of <hi>Pauls</hi>-fort, where the Enemy had erected a Battery, and advanced one piece of Cannon; and on the left hand toward the ruines of <hi>Monmouth</hi>-fort, where the enemy had advanced ſeveral Trenches, and made a place of Arms.</p>
            <p>All the Troops were very near form'd in Battalia, as was deſigned, with a great ſilence, before the Enemy took the Allarum, which they took at firſt from their place at Arms near <hi>Monmouth</hi>-fort, upon the Advancing of the firſt Troop of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> Horſe commanded by Captain <hi>Netby.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Enemy from their place at Arms, with hideous cry and noiſe, and fireing of ſmall ſhot upon us, gave the Allarum immediatly to their Camp.</p>
            <p>The Plotton of the Battalion of Guards, commanded by Captain <hi>Fortrey</hi> and Lieutenant <hi>Mackracken,</hi> with the half of the Company of <hi>Dumbartons</hi> Grana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deers, and the Plotton of the firſt Battalion of <hi>Dumbartons</hi> Regiment, commanded by Captain <hi>Julius Lockhart,</hi> and Lieutenant <hi>James Stewart,</hi> with the other half of the Company of Granadeers, were ordered by Colonel <hi>Sackville</hi> to go and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack the place of Arms, where the <hi>Moors</hi> Cannon was, which they did with great courage

and reſolution. The enemy being numerous in that place, ſtood firmly and defended themſelves for a long time, till at laſt Lieutenant <hi>Mackracken,</hi> with his Granadeers, advancing up very near to their Trench, and beſtowing the Granades liberally amongſt them, they began to be in Confuſion, and ſurpr<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the execution the Granadeers made amongſt them; Whereupon, he with Granadeers, leapt into their Trench amongſt them, and was immediatly follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Captain <hi>Fortry,</hi> and Captain <hi>Lockhart</hi> and their Parties, and Lieutenant <hi>Stewart,</hi> with the reſt of the Granadeers, where they all behaved themſelves very valiantly, and beat the Enemy from that place, and made themſelves maſter of that piece of Cannon of the Enemies, that was there, with the loſs of ſeveral Granadeers and good Souldiers, Lieutenant <hi>Mackracken</hi> of the Granadeers, was wounded with his hand on the Cannon; Captain <hi>Lockhart</hi> ſhot through the Thigh, Lieutenant <hi>Stewart</hi> through the Leg.</p>
            <p>The Plotton of the ſecond Battalion of <hi>Dumbartons</hi> Regiment, commanded by Captain <hi>Melvil</hi> and Lieutenant <hi>Gordoun,</hi> did attack the place of Arms on the le<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> hand near <hi>Monmouths</hi>-fort, at the ſame time that the Attack was on the Battery on the right hand, where they had no leſs vigorous reſiſtance than happy ſucceſs: For the firſt Battalion of <hi>Dumbartouns</hi> Regiment advanced to the Trenches upon the right hand of that place of Arms, the detatchment commanded by Captain <hi>Melvil,</hi> leapt forthwith into that place of Arms amongſt the Moors, where they did very great execution; and the Moors ſeeing the firſt Battalion advance with ſo much vigour, and ſtill ſuſtained by the ſecond Battalion of the ſaid Regiment commanded by Captain <hi>Douglaſs</hi> of <hi>Spot,</hi> and the Battalion of Seamen com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by Major <hi>George Barclay,</hi> they abandoned their two firſt Trenches, and retired themſelves behind the old Line toward the Sandy-hills, where they aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled together a conſiderable body of Foot, and being there under covert from our Shot, the old Line made by the Earl of <hi>Teviot</hi> ſerving them for a Breaſt<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>work, the Major of <hi>Dumbartouns</hi> Regiment who commanded there, ſeeing his Battalion ſo much expoſed to the fire of that enemy, thought it abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſar<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> to undertake to beat them from that Line: Whereupon he commanded his firſt Battalion, which they did moſt reſolutely, and made the enemy retire precipitantly, and in great diſorder; which Captain <hi>Melvils</hi> Detatchment per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, a Serjeant with fourteen or fifteen Soldiers fell out upon them, where they were carrying off their Colours, and purſued ſo hotly, that a Foot Colour was taken and brought in by a private Soldier of <hi>Dumbartouns</hi> Regiment, which was the firſt Colour was gained that day: which the enemy perceiving, from the Sand-hill Fort and from <hi>James</hi> Fort they had advanced very briskly, and ſeveral of their Horſemen began to enter within the Lines; but the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant of the Spaniſh Horſes advancing with his Troop, made the Mooriſh Horſe retire without the Lines again. Colonel <hi>Sackville</hi> finding that <hi>Dumbartons</hi> firſt Battalion had, till then, ſuſtained, with great courage, the heat of the Action, did then order the ſecond Battalion of <hi>Inchequins</hi> Regiment, commanded by Captain <hi>Giles,</hi> to march up on the right hand near the ruines of the Sandhill Fort, where the Moors were in great numbers, and made a very vigorous op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition: The ſaid Battalion of <hi>Inchequins</hi> continued for ſome time in that Poſt, with very great courage, and extreamly expoſed to the enemies fire, and throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſtones from the ruines of the Fort; they ſuſtained great loſs of Officers and Soldiers: And Captain <hi>Giles</hi> finding his Souldiers to be weary of their Poſt, he came and prayed Major <hi>Hacket</hi> to ſend a Battalion to his relief; whereupon Major <hi>Hacket</hi> ordered him to retire, and took his Poſt with the Battalions of <hi>Dumbartouns</hi> Regiment. The Moors ſeeing <hi>Inchequins</hi> Battalion to retire, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:175889:2"/>
to their cuſtom upon ſuch occaſions, did then advance very reſolutely, both Horſe and Foot, and would have again entered the Lines: But <hi>Dumbartouns</hi> Battalions gave ſoon a ſtop to their courage, and made them quickly run from the ſaid Hill-fort, from whence they had made the greateſt reſiſtance. The Major perceiving that they retired from thence to <hi>James</hi> Fort, which flanked his Battalions on the right, and had annoyed them very much during the heat of the Action, thought fit, without any further delay, to attack <hi>James</hi>'s Fort likewayes: There was a very great number of Moors there, and ſeveral Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collours planted. The Officers and Souldiers of the two Battalions appeared to be mightily ſatisfied with the Majors deſign of attacking that place; whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they went on with an unanimous reſolution, and within a very ſhort ſpace beat the Moors from <hi>James</hi>'s Fort, and from all the Lines on that hand: And the Moors having no further place of refuge there, did make themſelves to down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right running towards their Camps; and <hi>Dumbartouns</hi> Souldiers purſuing them ſtill, did find them drawing off a ſmall piece of Braſs-Cannon of four pound Ball, which they beat the Moors from, and it was brought in by Lieutenant <hi>Robert Innes,</hi> Adjutant to the ſecond Battalion.</p>
            <p>Colonel <hi>Sackville</hi> no ſooner ſees the Moors running, and <hi>Dumbartouns</hi> men ſtill in purſute of them beyond the Lines; But he, upon the head of the Spaniſh Horſe, did immediatly ride over the Lines to purſue them more vigorouſly, and to bring off the Foot, if any Ambuſh had been laid for them.</p>
            <p>About the ſame time that <hi>Dumbartouns</hi> Batallions had paſſed the Lines at <hi>James</hi>'s Fort, the Battalion of Seamen had likewayes paſt over the Line near <hi>Monmouths</hi> Fort, The three Troops of Engliſh Horſe that were commanded to ſuſtain the Seamen, paſſed the Lines immediatly after them, and got to their head very quickly, where they purſued the Moors firſt into their Camp.</p>
            <p>Near the Camp, Captain <hi>Netby</hi> with his Troop of Engliſh Horſe, took five Foot-collours, and one of them with his own hand.</p>
            <p>At that ſame time, the Major of <hi>Dumbartouns</hi> Regiment, coming up to Colonel <hi>Sackville,</hi> who did not know well what way the enemy had retired from <hi>James</hi>'s Fort, the Major therefore, who had taken very good notice, and had purſued them in their retreat, did take Colonel <hi>Sackville</hi> with the Commandant of the Spaniſh Horſe, to a little Valley towards the right of <hi>James</hi>'s Fort, from whence the Spaniſh Horſe purſued them juſt into their Camp; and there was a Collours taken by one of the Commandants Troop. Captain <hi>Langſtoun</hi> was ſhot in the Leg in the purſute. Upon the Engliſh and Spaniſh Horſes approaching their Camp, they began to carry away their Women with great precipitation.</p>
            <p>In the morning, when the Garriſon ſallied out, four Captains of the Earl of <hi>Dumbartouns</hi> Regiment being then on Guard in <hi>Pauls</hi> Fort, Colonel <hi>Sackville</hi> thought fit to command, out of the Fort, Captain <hi>Lundie</hi> and Captain <hi>Home,</hi> with 150 men of that Guard, to ſally out upon the right hand; And at the ſame time that the Plottons of Foot with the Granadeers, did attack the place of Arms, they did attack the advanced Trenches that was within twelve or fifteen yards of the Fort, with very great courage and ſucceſs. They were both dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerouſly wounded, with the loſs of ſeveral good men.</p>
            <p>Captain <hi>Bows,</hi> Commandant of the Guards, advancing with his Battalion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the left hand of the place where the Cannon was found, continued there all that day for a reſerve till the Cannon was carried off and the enemies Trenches filled on both ſides of the Fort. Major <hi>Boynten</hi> ſtayed with his Battalion near <hi>Monmouth</hi> Fort for a reſerve.</p>
            <p>The Admiral <hi>Herbert</hi> had ordered all the Long-boats belonging to his Fleet, to
