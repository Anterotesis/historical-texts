            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A POEM ON THE HAPPY RETURN OF His ROYAL HIGHNESS FROM SCOTLAND.</head>
            <l>IS Royal <hi>James</hi> return'd, and are we dumb?</l>
            <l>Diſplay your joy by Sack, Beer, Ale, and Mum;</l>
            <l>Let every Street be drunk with Ale or Wine</l>
            <l>For joy, to welcome home the Royal Line.</l>
            <l>Who can his joy, who can his gladneſs ſmother,</l>
            <l>When he beholds Great <hi>James,</hi> the King's own Brother?</l>
            <l>Guns bid him welcome with a thund'ring noiſe;</l>
            <l>His very preſence ſhould beget our Joys:</l>
            <l>Trumpets ſhou'd ſweetly ſound for his return,</l>
            <l>Whilſt <hi>Scotland</hi> for his abſence now doth mourn.</l>
            <l>Bells ring aloud, and ſhake the very Steeple;</l>
            <l>Let mirth and joy come from all ſorts of people:</l>
            <l>Bonfires burn high, like that in <hi>Leic'ſter-fields,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>For his Return, our joy and triumph yields.</l>
            <l>Drums make a noiſe, Muſick of ev'ry ſort</l>
            <l>Eccho from City, Suburbs, Town, and Court</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Scotland</hi> receiv'd him gladly, ev'ry tongue</l>
            <l>Was ready for to ſing a welcome Song.</l>
            <l>Shall they lament his abſence? ſhall not we</l>
            <l>Cry <hi>Welcome Duke of Tork and Albany?</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Their ſorrow ought to be our great delight,</l>
            <l>We have the Sun of joy, they Clouds of night.</l>
            <l>None but a factious Brood can now be ſorry</l>
            <l>At th'appearance of this Son of Glory.</l>
            <l>The King and Countrey's Friends will ſhout for joy,</l>
            <l>And cry, <hi>Let JAMES long live,</hi> and <hi>Viv'le Roy.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Some of the whining Race will be as ſad,</l>
            <l>As ev'ry true-bred Proteſtant is glad.</l>
            <l>Thoſe that do hate a King will loath this Prince;</l>
            <l>I know 'tis now as it was ſome years ſince.</l>
            <l>They never will let's ſee a ſmiling face,</l>
            <l>Till ſome damn'd <hi>Noll</hi> uſurps the Royal Place.</l>
            <l>Wou'd ſome <hi>Geneve-man</hi> come take the Crown,</l>
            <l>And tread the Royal Stemm and Off-ſpring down:</l>
            <l>Wou'd any Canting Cobler take the Throne,</l>
            <l>And give them leave to lie, to ſigh and groan,</l>
            <l>To damn the Common-pray'r and curſe the King;</l>
            <l>I do not doubt but then this Sect would ſing.</l>
            <l>Were Angels Kings, I know this factious Brood</l>
            <l>Would hate to be in any pleaſing mood:</l>
            <l>The very name of King they loath and hate,</l>
            <l>Witneſs the Martyrdom at <hi>White-hall-gate.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>But let them pine to ſee your Highneſs here;</l>
            <l>To ev'ry true-bred Subject you are dear:</l>
            <l>We will rejoyce, and let the Kingdom know</l>
            <l>The hearty love we to your Highneſs owe.</l>
            <l>Our Trading's dull, our Kingdom is divided,</l>
            <l>We are no longer able to abide it.</l>
            <l>The Factious Party daily threaten Wars,</l>
            <l>And now we hope you will deſtroy thoſe jars:</l>
            <l>If courting will not with this ſort prevail,</l>
            <l>Then they muſt quickly hear another Tale;</l>
            <l>Their head-ſtrong necks muſt buckle to the ſtroaks</l>
            <l>Of the intreaty of ſome ſtubborn Oaks.</l>
            <l>Are they grown King-proof? let the Rabble know</l>
            <l>The due Allegiance that ſuch Subjects owe.</l>
            <l>But ſtay, my angry Muſe, me-thinks I hear,</l>
            <l>That ſome begin to love and others fear</l>
            <l>I wiſh that you to us wou'd reconcile,</l>
            <l>And make <hi>Great Britain</hi> the moſt happy Iſle.</l>
            <l>Wou'd you fear God, honour the Royal Line,</l>
            <l>Then you might eat the Fruit of your own Vine;</l>
            <l>Your morſel wou'd be ſweet, plenty and peace</l>
            <l>Wou'd overtake you, and your diſcords ceaſe.</l>
            <l>What! do you itch for Wars? are your Dads rotten,</l>
            <l>Or are their cruel bloody Deeds forgotten?</l>
            <l>What tumults, rapines, murders, and diſorders</l>
            <l>Did lately fill our moſt inhumane Borders?</l>
            <l>Read but the Civil Wars, and you will ſing,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Welcome great James unto our Sacred King:</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>Peace be to you, to us, and all the Land,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>And may no foe in oppoſition ſtand;</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>May all that strive againſt the King and Crown,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>Like</hi> Jezabel, <hi>be hurled head-long down.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Thus you wou'd ſing and pray with one conſent,</l>
            <l>And of your paſt unkindueſſes repent;</l>
            <l>Forget your malice, faithful Subjects prove,</l>
            <l>Then <hi>Charles</hi> and <hi>James</hi> wou'd both receive y' in love.</l>
            <l>Like Mouſe and Frog the King and Commons 'gree,</l>
            <l>And the <hi>French</hi> Kite their Diſcords glad to ſee:</l>
            <l>But as you're fearful to be made a prey,</l>
            <l>Know 'tis your intereſt now to obey.</l>
