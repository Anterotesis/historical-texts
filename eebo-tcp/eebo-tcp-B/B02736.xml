            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>ELEGIE On the Much to be Lamented Death of the Right Honourable, ALEXANDER Lord REATH, One of His Majeſties Moſt Honourable Privy Council, and Exchequer, <hi>&amp;c. Departed this Life,</hi> March 21 1698.</head>
            <lg>
               <l>IT ſeems the Heavens begins to frown, the World draws near an end</l>
               <l>When Wiſdom drops down to the Grave, that did this Land defend;</l>
               <l>Great <hi>A'banie,</hi> go mourn a while, my Quil is droping Tears,</l>
               <l>Thou loſt not ſuch a Friend I trow, no not this Hundred years;</l>
               <l>Now Wiſdom, Charity and Love, put on your ragged Gown,</l>
               <l>There is a Jewel very rich, this day, fall'n from your Crown!</l>
               <l>The Voice of Poor, like Echo cryes, making a dolefull Sonnet,</l>
               <l>Until the Council find a Head, that well can fill his Bonnet.</l>
               <l>His Wiſdom lay in Silence long, until it got a Vent,</l>
               <l>Like precious Oyntment gave a Smell, the King than for him ſent:</l>
               <l>And gave him places Honourable, he did Deſerve them All,</l>
               <l>In future Ages for to come, will be Chrononical.</l>
               <l>Dame Nature has been very bold, that Fram'd him at firſt,</l>
               <l>The Motto of his Emblem was, GOD ſayes, <hi>Be Good and Juſt;</hi>
               </l>
               <l>And when he came into the World he was endu'd with Grace,</l>
               <l>Than Reaſon did take hold thereon, and ſat in Natures place:</l>
               <l>Vertue ſent him to her Garden, to ſee what Flower he would pull,</l>
               <l>There he puld Grace, like <hi>Aarons</hi> Rod, that buded ever ſtill:</l>
               <l>Then Vertue fell in Love with him, 'cauſe he had choſen the beſt,</l>
               <l>She ſayes to Honour, follow him, he is my Real Gueſt.</l>
               <l>When Vertue ſaw that Honour went, and followed at his back,</l>
               <l>Wiſdom cryes aloud, I will run with Truth, to be his Cloak:</l>
               <l>And that will ſerve him all his Life, what e're he can need,</l>
               <l>But I'le defy the Univerſe to take from it one Threed:</l>
               <l>As <hi>Solomon</hi> did Wiſdom choiſe, for to obey GOD's Will;</l>
               <l>So I reſolv'd to follow him, and will do ever ſtill.</l>
               <l>The Ark was of a curious Bulk, but was not very much.</l>
               <l>Yet it contain'd the World great, yea and the Holy Church.</l>
               <l>King <hi>David</hi> was but a little Man, Sober, but not <hi>Machia,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Yet Wiſdom found him out a way, to kill the Great <hi>Golia.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>His Virtuous Perſon and its Worth, before Others to diſcrive,</l>
               <l>For Vertue, Wiſdom, Parts, and Grace, there's few like him alive:</l>
               <l>His Wiſdom like the <hi>Jordans</hi> Flood o'reflow'd, refreſht the Land,</l>
               <l>His Council great as Oracles, but none could it withſtand.</l>
               <l>He ſpake in council like to <hi>Job,</hi> with out all kind of fear,</l>
               <l>Gray Hairs roſe up, and gave him praiſe, his Wiſdom did admire.</l>
               <l>His Worthie Noble Family, even from their very Youth,</l>
               <l>The whole Track of their Life has been to Suffer for the Truth:</l>
               <l>Till <hi>Phoebus</hi> roſe with mighty heat, in all his Radiant Beams,</l>
               <l>They Sail'd the Goulf, againſt the Tyde, came to the Cryſtal Streams.</l>
               <l>Now thy Succeſſour <hi>Leven</hi> Great, he is a Man Belov'd</l>
               <l>In Council, State, and Mighty Warr, the King has him approv'd;</l>
               <l>He did behave himſelf ſo well abroad by Sea and Land,</l>
               <l>Which made the King put him in Truſt, Hye Keeper of <hi>SCOTLAND.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Though now L: <hi>Reath</hi> lyes in this Tomb, according to GODS Will,</l>
               <l>His Name and Fame continue ſhal in future Ages ſtill.</l>
               <l>You Seraphims and Cherabims, Salute him with a Bleſs,</l>
               <l>He's gone from Earth to Heavens Glor, that truely Honour'd was,</l>
               <l>Ten Thouſand Ages yet to come, is but to him one day.</l>
               <l>That Beatiphick Viſion great, he will enjoy for aye.</l>
               <l>As One of the Saints, all clade in White, upon Mount Zion Hill,</l>
               <l>Through Ages of Eternity the Lamb will follow ſtill.</l>
               <l>Tho Friends ſhould make the Rivers run with Tears that's ſhed below,</l>
               <l>He will not riſe for all their Cryes, till the laſt Trumpet blow.</l>
