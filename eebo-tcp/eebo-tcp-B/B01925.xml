            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Caſe of the Refiners of <hi>England,</hi> with reference to Forreign Imported Moloſſoes, a Duty intended to be laid on the Spirits drawn from our own Moloſſoes.</head>
            <p>REfining of Sugars has been a very Ancient Art and Myſtery in this Kingdom, and has (by former Encouragements from the Government) been always eſteemed very profitable thereunto; In that this Trade gives a livelihood not only to great numbers of menial Servants therein employed, but to ſome thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of Subjects, who in their reſpective Callings have their dependance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whereby they have occaſion'd the Expence of at leaſt Fifty Thouſand Pounds <hi>per Annum</hi> in this Kingdom.</p>
            <p>And great Eſtates have been expended, in erecting many large Sugar-works in this Kingdom for that purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Vaſt quantities of Coals are conſumed in this Trade, when in full work, which pays a great Duty.</p>
            <p>And not only by the imploy of Shipping in the Coal Trade, but the increaſe of our Shipping in the Plantation Trade, by Importing Brown Sugars, our Navigation, the Strength and Glory of this Kingdom is much encouraged.</p>
            <p>The <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> being ſenſible hereof, have moſt ſtudiouſly promoted this Trade within themſelves, and conſequently our diſcouraging thereof will tend to the tranſplanting of it.</p>
            <p>But of late years it has very unhappily lain under great diſcouragements in this Kingdom, partly by the vaſt and increaſing Importation of wrought Sugars from our own Plantations, and partly alſo by the great advantage which the Forreign Buyer has had of the Home Refiner; for the whole Duty upon unpurged Sugars is three Shillings and ten pence <hi>per</hi> hundred, out of which, the Forreign Buyer draws back three Shillings and a penny, and leaves the King poſſeſſed but of Nine pence. The Refiners of this Kingdom Expending Annually in their uſual Working about Fifteen Thouſand Tuns of unpurg'd Sugars, which at 3 <hi>s.</hi> 10 <hi>d. per</hi> Hundred, pays the King Fifty Seven Thouſand Five Hundred Pounds; but if the ſaid Fifteen Thouſand Tuns of Brown Sugars be Exported (by reaſon of the diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment given to the working of them here) they draw back Forty Six Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Two Hundred and Fifty Pounds, <note place="margin">57500. 46250. 11250.</note> and leaves the King poſſeſſed only but of Eleven Thouſand Two Hundred and Fifty Pounds, and were Incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment given to this Trade, the Revenue would grow up with it; whereby our own Plantation Sugars are wrought cheaper in Forreign parts, than they can be by the Home Refiner; which has ſo diſcouraged this Trade in this Kingdom, that the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of the Refiners have been neceſſitated greatly to abate their works; and had not the price of Moloſſoes, commonly called Treakle, yielded them ſome ſmall Encouragement, they muſt have wholly declined their Trades.</p>
            <p>But ſo great are the quantities of Moloſſoes, which are now daily Imported into this Kingdom from Forreign parts, that the generality of the Refiners are forced wholly to deſiſt their working, and can have no rational hope of reviving their works; unleſs ſome proportional Additional Duty be laid upon Forreign Imported Moloſſoes, and Encouragement given to the Diſtillers Conſumption of our own Moloſſoes: It being a Commodity of ſo great uſe to the Diſtiller, in making palatable the Spirits drawn from Corn, and other Engliſh Materials, to ſupply this Kingdom, in the room and ſtead of French Brandies, that the Diſtiller cannot Draw ſo Clean a Spirit from our own Corn to Imitate Brandy without the help thereof.</p>
            <p>This Commodity not being (as ſome have very weakly apprehended) the Droſs, Filth, Scum, and Dregs of Sugar, but the clean, pure, and clear part of the Sugar, which through weakneſs will not come to Grain, and be Imbodied, and is to all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents as wholeſom as the Sugar from which it comes, as can be made appear.</p>
            <p>Whereupon it is moſt Humbly hoped that nothing will be determined, by the Honourable the Commons of <hi>England</hi> now Aſſembled in Parliament, in Prejudice and Ruin of this Antient Trade, by charging a greater Duty upon Spirits drawn from our own Moloſſoes than upon Spirits drawn from Corn; the Encouraging of the Expence of Moloſſoes being the only true way to Encourage the Expence of Corn in Diſtilling; and thereby to ſecure both the Revenue to the Crown, and Incouragement to the farmer.</p>
