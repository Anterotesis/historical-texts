            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <lg>
               <l>Has't Thou for this, by thy calm valour, taught</l>
               <l>How Young men can fight, and how Old men ought?</l>
               <l>Is this the guerdon of the Stout, and Brave?</l>
               <l>Are theſe the Flow'rs ſtrew'd on thy Watry Grave?</l>
               <l>Muſt we confeſs, to th' honour of <hi>Argier,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Thou 'wer't Kill'd ith' <hi>Streights,</hi> but thou wer't Murder'd here?</l>
               <l>Dear Sir, could I as well acquainted be</l>
               <l>With thy bleſs'd Ghoſt, as once I was with Thee,</l>
               <l>Thou would'ſt (what thou did'ſt never yet,) complain,</l>
               <l>That thou wer't now by Gooſe-ſhot baſely ſlain.</l>
               <l>Thou, who ſo oft, when Bullet, Ball, and Fire</l>
               <l>Did joyntly, to thy ruine, all conſpire,</l>
               <l>Stood'ſt on the Billowes, as on Native Ground,</l>
               <l>Fix'd like the Poles, when all the World turn'd round.</l>
               <l>Thy Father's Courage was ſo tri'd and known,</l>
               <l>'Twas fit to be bequeath'd to Thee alone.</l>
               <l>Valour in Thee would ſcarce for Vertue go,</l>
               <l>(For <hi>Harman</hi>'s Son muſt like a <hi>Harman</hi> do:)</l>
               <l>Had not thy Brain commanded ſtill thy Heart,</l>
               <l>Improving Nature by well-meaſur'd Art.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>This the brave <hi>Sprag</hi> foreſaw, when Thee he choſe</l>
               <l>To run the Gauntlet, through 'our then <hi>Belgic</hi> foes:</l>
               <l>When the diſabled <hi>Cambridge</hi> breathleſs lay;</l>
               <l>Though (like a Stag imbauch'd) ſhe ſtood at Bay,</l>
               <l>Till Thou Her, as <hi>Aeneas</hi> did his Sire,</l>
               <l>Brought'ſt nobly off, and ſpitd'ſt out all their Fire.</l>
               <l>At Eighteen to ſo high a pitch to ſoar,</l>
               <l>Had bin a mir'acle, were not <hi>Harman</hi> More.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>— But did not I a Poetaſter blame?</l>
               <l>And am I not my ſelf become the ſame?</l>
               <l>Pardon, dear Friend, if Sorrow make me mad:</l>
               <l>Men know not what they ſay, when they are throughly ſad.</l>
               <l>Take but a parting Tear—But why on Thee</l>
               <l>Are Drops beſtow'd, when cover'd with a Sea?</l>
               <l>Yet Thou wer't ſo belov'd, that had the Shore</l>
               <l>Receiv'd thy Corps, thou'had'ſt bin intomb'd in More.</l>
               <l>For though thy Courage did the Stouteſt awe,</l>
               <l>Thy Gen'erous Mildneſs equally gave law.</l>
               <l>Thy 'obliging temper with it's potent charms</l>
               <l>Vi'ed conqueſts ev'en with Thy victorious arms.</l>
               <l>Nor Friend, nor Foe thy 'unbounded power controuls;</l>
               <l>Thou 'or'ecom'ſt Their Forces, and inſlav'ſt Our Souls.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>What Valour, Art, and Prudence could command</l>
               <l>Was ſtill perform'd by Thy ſucceſsfull hand:</l>
               <l>And when reſiſtleſs Fate thy Foe appear'd,</l>
               <l>Though ne'r ſo pow'erfull, yet ſhe was not fear'd.</l>
               <l>Nay though her Pow'er has plac'd her among the Gods,</l>
               <l>She dar'ed not to attacque Thee, but with Odds.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Methinks I ſee the Great <hi>Leviathan</hi> fly</l>
               <l>With winged hunger to devour the fry:</l>
               <l>Sure of her Prey, ſhe ſports upon the Main,</l>
               <l>And hugs the thought of what ſhe ne'r ſhall gain.</l>
               <l>A greater Rage the <hi>Guernſey</hi> does inſpire,</l>
               <l>She ſpreads her Sails, and fills them with her Fire:</l>
               <l>Only complains One ſingle Ship to meet;</l>
               <l>Shee, and her Captain, us'd to 'ingage a Fleet.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>They ſtand not long at diſtance to diſpute,</l>
               <l>But with warm breath each other's ſides falute.</l>
               <l>The' inſulting <hi>Turk</hi> with Bulk and Numbers ſwell'd</l>
               <l>The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Valour not by Monſters quell'd.</l>
               <l>The Infidel twice ſeiz'd the Noble Prey:</l>
               <l>Twice from her rave'nous jaws ſhe's ſnatch'd away.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Engliſh</hi> ne'r loſe what they 'are reſolv'd to ſave:</l>
               <l>Nor can the Bulky over-pow'er the Brave.</l>
               <l>This <hi>Harman</hi> ſees and does; with his bold Hand</l>
               <l>Example gives: with his wiſe Head, Command.</l>
               <l>'Midſt his own wounds he makes the reſt ſecure:</l>
               <l>His Courage keeps them Stout, his Conduct Sure.</l>
               <l>And though the Shot thrice pierce his valiant breaſt,</l>
               <l>The Soul, he's loſing, he imparts to th' reſt.</l>
               <l>A Soul ſo active, and diffus'edly great,</l>
               <l>'Twould ſerve, alone, to animate a Fleet;</l>
               <l>And 'ſpight of all <hi>Argier,</hi> command the Main;</l>
               <l>'Twould quickly 'have brought their <hi>Creſſent</hi> to her wane.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Nor will we now thy Death Misfortune call:</l>
               <l>He never bravely ſtands, that fears to fall.</l>
               <l>Shall we bewail that man, who 'has loſt his blood</l>
               <l>In his King's Favour, for his Countrey's Good?</l>
               <l>No, 'tis Our Selves that we commiſerate,</l>
               <l>Who are depriv'd by this thy early fate:</l>
               <l>Thy early fate, which did deſigns defeat</l>
               <l>As great as could be good, as good as great.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Live then, bleſs'd Friend, thy life's remainder out</l>
               <l>In the hearts of all that Loyal are, or Stout.</l>
