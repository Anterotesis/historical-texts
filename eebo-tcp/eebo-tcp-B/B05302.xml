         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p> Foraſmuch, as the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God, in His moſt Wiſe and Righteous Providence, after the ſinfull abuſe of His moſt ſignal mercies of the bleſſed Goſpel, of Our Own and Our Subjects wonderfull Deliverance from the Yoke of Uſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Bondage, by the almoſt Miraculous Reſtauration of Us to the exerciſe of Our Government, and of the long and mercifull Continuance of Our deſpiſed Peace and Plenty; Doth, by His Warnings and Judgements incumbent and impendent, manifeſtly diſcover His Anger and Diſpleaſure againſt the grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Sins of this Kingdom; and particularly by the ſad and pinching dearth, whereby many indigent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and families are reduced to a ſtarving condition, and by the long and threatning Drought, the Lord, in His Righteous Judgement, having ſo long bound up the Clouds, making the Heavens Braſs, and the Earth Iron, thereby threatning Our Subjects of this Kingdom with the breaking of the Staff of their Bread, and with the dreadful plague of Famine: Which Diſpenſation doth with a loud voice call upon all ranks of people for ſpeedy and true Repentance, and the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional expreſſion hereof by deep Mourning and ſolemn Faſting and Humiliation.</p>
            <p>Therefore We, with Advice and Conſent of the Lords of Our Privy Council, do Ordain a day of Publick and Solemn Faſting and Humiliation to be keeped and obſerved by all the people of this Kingdom in the ſeveral Paroches thereof; Strictly Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Requiring them upon that day, to ceaſe from all the Works of their ordinary Callings, and to repair to their reſpective Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roch Churches, and there make ſolemn Confeſſion of their Sins, and implore the Divine Mercy for the Land, by Praying, Mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, Faſting, and ſuch other Devotions, as are requiſite and uſual upon ſuch dayes of Publick Humiliation: And more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, Humbly to Confeſs and Mourn for the great Neglect and Contempt of, and Diſobedience to the Bleſſed Goſpel, and the Ordinances thereof, and the great and lamentable increaſe and prevalency of <hi>Atheiſm,</hi> Profaneneſs, and Irreligion which is thereby occaſioned, and for the ſinfull undervaluing of the great Bleſſing of Peace ſo long enjoyed by Our Subjects under Our Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.

And for this end and purpoſe, We, with Advice foreſaid, do ſeriouſly recommend to, and require the Arch-Biſhops and Biſhops, to be carefull that this Faſt be duely obſerved by the Miniſters in their reſpective Dioceſſes, as followes; To the Arch-Biſhops of St. <hi>Andrews</hi> and <hi>Glaſgow,</hi> the Biſhops of <hi>Edinburgh, Dunkell, Brechin</hi> and <hi>Dumblane,</hi> to cauſe it to be intimated in the ſeveral Paroch Kirks of their Diocies upon Sunday, the twenty fifth, and obſerved on Wedneſday, the twenty eighth of <hi>July</hi> inſtant; and the remanent Biſhops, whoſe Diocies are more remote, to cauſe it to be intimated on Sunday, the firſt of <hi>August,</hi> and to be obſerved the fourth of <hi>Anguſt</hi> next. And as to ſuch Miniſters, who, by reaſon of their diſtance from <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> cannot be ſo ſoon advertiſed, that they celebrate this Faſt upon the next convenient Wedneſday thereafter.</p>
