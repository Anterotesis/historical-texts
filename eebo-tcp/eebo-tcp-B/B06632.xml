         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>When We conſider the many unjuſt Methods the <hi>French</hi> King hath of late Years taken to gratifie his Ambition, that he has not only Invaded the Territories of the Emperor, and of the Empire now in Amity with Us, laying waſte whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, and deſtroying the Inhabitants by his Armies, but Declared War againſt our Allies, without any Provocation, in manifeſt Violation of the Treaties Confi<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>med by the Guaranty of the Crown of <hi>England</hi>; We can do no leſs than joyn with Our Allies, in oppoſing the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of the <hi>French</hi> King, as the Diſturber ot the Peace, and the Common Enemy of the Chriſtian World.</p>
            <p>And beſides the Obligations We ly under by Treaties with Our Allies, which are a ſufficient Juſtification of Us for taking up Arms at this time, ſince they have called upon Us ſo to do, the many Injuries done to Us, and to Our Subjects, without any Reparation, by the <hi>French</hi> King, are ſuch, that (however of late years they were not taken notice of, for Reaſons well known to the World, nevertheleſs) We will not paſs them over without a Publick and Juſt Reſentment of ſuch Outrages.</p>
            <p>It is not long ſince the <hi>French</hi> took Licences from the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Governor of <hi>New Found-Land,</hi> to Fiſh in the Seas upon that Coaſt, and paid a Tribute for ſuch Licences, as an acknowledgment of the ſole Right of the Crown of <hi>England</hi> to that Iſland; And yet of late, the Encroachments of the <hi>French</hi> upon Our ſaid Iſland, and Our Subjects Trade and Fiſhery have been more like the Invaſions of an Enemy, than becoming Friends, who enjoyed the Advantages of that Trade only by Permiſſion.</p>
            <p>But that the <hi>French</hi> King ſhould Invade Our <hi>Charibbee</hi> Iſlands, and poſſeſs himſelf of Our Territories of the Province of <hi>New-York,</hi> and of <hi>Hudſon's Bay</hi> in a Hoſtile manner, ſeizing Our Forts, burning Our Subjects Houſes, and enriching his People with the Spoil of their Goods and Merchandizes, detaining ſome of Our Subjects under the hardſhip of Impriſonment, cauſing others to be inhumanely kill'd, and driving the reſt to Sea in a ſmall Veſſel, without Food and neceſſaries to ſupport them, are Actions not becoming even an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; And yet he was ſo far from declaring himſelf ſo, that at that very time he was Negotiating here in <hi>England</hi> by his Miniſters, a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Neutrality and good Correſpondence in <hi>America.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Proceedings of the <hi>French</hi> King againſt Our Subjects in <hi>Europe,</hi> are ſo Notorious, that We ſhall not need to enlarge upon them; his countenancing the Seizure of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ships by <hi>French</hi> Privateers, forbidding the Importation of great part of the Product and Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures of Our Kingdom, and impoſing exorbitant Cuſtomes upon the reſt, notwithſtanding the vaſt Advantage he and the <hi>French</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion reap by their Commerce with <hi>England,</hi> are ſufficient Evidences of his Deſigns to deſtroy the Trade, and conſequently to ru<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ne the Navigation, upon which the Wealth and Safety of this Nation very much depends.</p>
            <p>The Right of the Flag, inherent in the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> has been Diſputed by his Orders in Violation of Our Sovereignty of the narrow Seas, which in all Ages has been Aſſerted by Our Predeceſſors, and We are reſolv'd to Maintain, for the Honour of Our Crown, and of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation.</p>
            <p>But that which muſt nearly touch Us, is his unchriſtian Proſecution of many of Our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Proteſtant Subjects in <hi>France,</hi> for matters of Religion, contrary to the Law of Nations, and expreſs Treaties, forcing them to abjure their Religion by ſtrange and unuſual Cruelties, and Impriſoning ſome of the Maſters and Seamen of Our Merchants Ships, and condemning others to the Gallies, upon pretence of having on Board, either ſome of his own Miſerable Protes;tant Subjects, or their Effects, And laſtly, as he has for ſome Years laſt paſt, endeavoured by Inſinuations and Promiſes of Aſſiſtance, to overthrow the Government of <hi>England</hi>; So now by open and violent Methods, and the actual Invaſion of Our Kingdom of <hi>Ireland,</hi> in ſupport of Our Subjects in Arms and in Rebellion againſt us, he is promoting the utter Extirpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Our good and Loyal Subjects in that Our Kingdom.</p>
            <p>Being therefore thus neceſſitated to take up Arms, and Relying on the Help of Almighty God in Our Juſt Undertaking; We have thought fit to Declare, and do hereby Declare War againſt the <hi>French</hi> King, and that We will in Conjunction with Our Allies, vigorouſly Proſecute the ſame by Sea and Land (ſince he hath ſo unrighteouſly begun it) being aſſured of the hearty Concurrence and As;ſiſtance of Our Subjects in ſupport of ſo good a Cauſe: Hereby Willing and Requiring Our General of Our Forces, Our Commiſſioners for Executing the Office of High Admiral, Our Lieutenants of Our ſeveral Counties, Governors of Our Forts and Gariſons, and all other Officers and Souldiers under them, by Sea and Land, to do and execute all Acts of Hoſtility in the Proſecution of this War againſt the <hi>French</hi> King, his Vaſſals and Subjects, and to oppoſe their Attempts, willing and Requiring all Our Subjects to take Notice of the ſame, whom We henceforth forbid to hold any Correſpondence or Communication with the ſaid <hi>French</hi> King or his Subjects. And becauſe there are remaining in Our Kingdoms many of the Subjects ot the <hi>French</hi> King, We do Declare and Give Our Royal Word, That all ſuch of the <hi>French</hi> Nation as ſhall demean themſelves Dutifully towards Us, and not Correſpond with Our Enemies, ſhall be fate in their Perſons and Eſtates, and free from all Moleſtation and Trouble of any kind.</p>
