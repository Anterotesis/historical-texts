            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Foraſmuch, as by the twenty ſixth Act of the third Seſſion of Our firſt Parliament, The Ordering and Diſpoſal of Trade with Forreign Countreys, and the laying of Reſtraints and Impoſitions upon Forreign Imported Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, is aſſerted to belong to Us and Our Royal Succeſſors, as an undoubted Priviledge and Prerogative of the Crown; and that by vertue thereof, We may lay ſuch Impoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Reſtraints upon Forreign imported Commodities, and ſo Order and Diſpoſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Trade of them, as We ſhall judge ſit for the good of Our Kingdom: And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, by an Act and Proclamation of the eleventh of <hi>April</hi> laſt, upon conſideration of the great detriment Our Cuſtomes and Exciſe might ſuſtain by a Prohibition put upon ſeveral Forreign Commodities, deduction of the Exciſe of that imployed upon Fiſhes and other allowances, given for the encouragement of Manufactures and building of Ships; We did for ballance of ſome part thereof, appoint a further Duty to be put upon Wine and Tobacco, which is found to be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry far ſhort in ballancing and compenſing the foreſaid loſs: Wherefore We, with advice of Our Privy Council, conform to the Power given Us by the ſaid Act of Parliament, Ordain, that each Tun of <hi>French, Spaniſh</hi> and <hi>Rheniſh</hi> Wine, which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly payed thirty pound Scots of Cuſtom, ſhall hereafter pay thirty pound Scots more, being in all threeſcore pounds Scots, with the burden of the Bullion as formerly, by way of Custom: And each pound of Tobacco coming immediatly from the Plantations, pay hereafter two ſhilling four pennies Scots of Cuſtom, and eight pennies Scots of Exciſe: And each pound of all other Tobacco, coming from any other place, except the Plantations, pay five ſhilling Scots of Cuſtom; and twelve pennies of <hi>Exciſe,</hi> making in all ſix ſhilling Scots of Cuſtom and <hi>Exciſe,</hi> each pound weight. And whereas, by the Act of Parliament, <hi>Anno 1669.</hi> the Merchant exporter is to have allowed or repayed by the Cuſtomers, ten pounds four ſhilling Scots for the Salt of each exported Laſt of Herrings: And that by an Act of Parliament, <hi>Anno</hi> 1673. anent the taking away the Pre-emption of Salt, It is appointed that the exporters of Herring, ſhall only be free of Cuſtom at the export, being only twenty four ſhilling Scots <hi>per</hi> Laſt; And that by the foreſaid Proclamation following thereupon, the Merchant exporter is to have allowance according to the firſt Act of Parliament, without conſidering that We did quite the Exciſe then payable to him upon In-land Salt, being fifteen ſhilling Scots <hi>per Linlithgow</hi> Boll, which would have extended to much more then what is to be returned to the Merchants for their exported Herrings; and that the Act 1673. does take away all pretences thereto. Therefore We Ordain, that the ſaid Act, 1673. ſhall ſtand in full force, and that no allowance be given for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported Herrings, notwithſtanding of the ſaid Act of Council and Proclamation foreſaid, following thereupon, appointing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payment for exported Herrings, according to the Act of Parliament foreſaid, in the year, 1669. And Ordains the Collectors or Fermorers of Our Cuſtom and Exciſe, preſent and to come, their Deputs, Servants and Waiters, to uplift and exact the ſaid Cuſtom and Exciſe upon the ſaids Goods, as the ſame is now Impoſed in time coming, whether Our Cuſtomes and Exciſe be uplifted by Collection or Ferm, any former <hi>Act</hi> to the contrair notwithſtanding.
