            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE CASE OF THE RESPECTIVE ARTIFICERS Belonging to Their Majeſties Office of the Ordnance, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>THE ſaid Artificers being a Society of ſeveral ſorts of People, who for many Years have made it their buſineſs in their divers Qualifications, to furniſh the ſaid Office with all manner of Stores, Proviſions, and Utenſils of War, <hi>viz.</hi> Great Guns, ſmall Guns, great Shot, ſmall Shot, Powder, Match, Cordage, Ship and Field-Carriages, and all ſorts of Arms. Tents, Bedding, and near 2000 Species of other Stores, too tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous here to Enumerate, ſuch as are daily adapted to the proper Service of the Crown in that Office; and in which Service are concerned the whole Body of Artificers, whoſe Callings have dependance thereon, and who have been at all times ready, to their utmoſt Power, to ſerve the Crown with their Eſtates and Fortunes; and are now left to bemoan their unhappineſs of being deprived of their good Intentions of proceeding in their accuſtomed Methods in ſerving the ſaid Office, being therein totally diſabled as followeth, <hi>Viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. By a Debt left upon them by King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second for Stores ſerved in, and Services performed by <hi>Direction from the Officers of the</hi> Ordnance, amounting to about 100000 <abbr>l.</abbr> which hath been fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently Sollicited for, and often promiſed, though yet unpaid: Great part of which Stores have been Transferred to the Service of the preſent Crown, and all applied for the Service of the Nation.</p>
            <p n="2">II. By Debts owing them from the ſaid Office, contracted ſince their preſent Majeſty's Acceſſion to the Crown, amounting to about 150000 <abbr>l.</abbr> Which ſaid great Debts having ſo Exhauſted both the Stocks and Credits of the ſaid Artificers, that they are left (though willing) altogether uncapable of proceeding any further in the Performance of the aforeſaid Services, without a ſpeedy Supply of Money.</p>
            <p>They <hi>therefore humbly Supplicate this Honourable Houſe, to take into their ſpeedy Conſiderations, the deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Condition of the ſaid Artificers (Great part of thoſe Inſtruments of War, which by them are to be provided, cannot be had at a Moments warning, but at certain Seaſons in the Year,) That ſome ſpeedy Proviſion may be made to ſatisfie the late Debts contracted; As alſo the former Debt in this following Method, or any other way or means as this Honourable Houſe ſhall think convenient, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to Enable them to proſecute their Wonted Vigor in ſerving their Majeſties in the ſaid Office, which otherwiſe they will be Compelled into an Incapacity of doing, and will prove the Ruine of them and their Poſterities.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WE are informed that <hi>SALT</hi> in ſeveral Countries pays a very great Duty, <note place="margin">Forty puſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els makes a Way and <gap reason="illegible: damage" extent="1+ letters">

               </note> as it has done here in former Years, and great Quantities being here Imported, there is laid upon it but 12 d. <hi>per</hi> Way, which, in truth, may bear 4 l. <hi>per</hi> Way; So that in ſome time, the Artificers may be paid the Debt owing to them in King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second's time, if this Honourable Houſe ſhall not Order ſome other way to ſatisfie it: And if this Duty be found convenient to be continued and appropriated to the Office of the Ordnance, it will go a great way in defraying the ordinary Charge of that Office; and this Duty will hardly be felt in Vending the ſaid Commodity, computing how ſmall a quantity a Family uſes in a Year. The great Objection that has been made againſt laying a higher Duty on this Commodity, is the <hi>Fiſhery:</hi> To overcome that Difficulty, We pray this Honourable Houſe, That all Salt, made uſe of for the Fiſhery, may be drawn back out of His Majeſties Cuſtoms, it will prevent the Ruine of many Hundreds of Families, and pay a juſt Debt, which, in Proceſs of time, will be a greater benefit to the Nation, in encouraging the making of that Commodity.</p>
