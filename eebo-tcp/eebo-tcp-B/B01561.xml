            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>Admire not then the death of <hi>ORRERY,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Renown'd all's days, ſhould in a moment flie,</l>
               <l>Both far and near the World to terrifie.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>

               <l>Till at both <hi>Indies,</hi> or where e'er more far is.</l>
            </lg>
            <l>'Mongſt the Worlds Treaſuries, it there declare,</l>
            <l>Than any theirs, a Pearl more rich, more rare</l>
            <l>W' have loſt; thus ranging all the World about,</l>
            <l>Finds many zealous mournful Poets out:</l>
            <l>But ſtill I thought the Muſes triple Trine,</l>
            <l>And Learned Crew concern'd, muſt have deſign</l>
            <l>Some Eagles Quill ſhould make the worthy Pen,</l>
            <l>To write their Dictates on the beſt of Men;</l>
            <l>But chanc'd to view a mournful Elegy</l>
            <l>Upon his Death, enough to ſtupifie</l>
            <l>The Reader, whilſt the Poet did invite</l>
            <l>Each Poetaſter on him Diſtichs t' write.</l>
            <l>This Author took I for good warrant to it,</l>
            <l>To be as bold as any Errant Poet:</l>
            <l>But quick as Thought <hi>Minerva</hi> ſaid in haſte,</l>
            <l>Hold, hold, poor man! don't Time and Paper waſte;</l>
            <l>He was my Foſter Child, 'twas my good hap</l>
            <l>The Babe to dandle firſt upon my Lap,</l>
            <l>Who kindly took my Breaſts, and throve ſo well,</l>
            <l>That in the Liberal Arts he did excell.</l>
            <l>Thy grov'ling Fancy, and too low pitch'd Eye,</l>

            <l>In God's and's King's cauſe ſtill defending thine.</l>
            <l>His care to breed brave Horſes thou would'ſt write,</l>
            <l>In Peace for Pleaſure, and in War for fight:</l>
            <l>Thou fain would'ſt talk on' s Vict'ry at <hi>Knockny Clarſhy,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>And give him (next to God) the <hi>God-a-mercy;</hi>
            </l>
            <l>While thouſands yet alive would with thee ſay,</l>
            <l>His Proweſs (under God) obtain'd that Day.</l>
            <l>But what is this to all that he hath done,</l>
            <l>To th' Towns and Caſtles he by force hath won?</l>
            <l>Thou'dſt find an endleſs Task on 't, to declare</l>

            <l>In general terms I know thou'dſt praiſe thus far,</l>
            <l>Prudent in Counſel, proſperous in War:</l>
            <l>But home to ſpeak his praiſe, and to deſcend</l>
            <l>Unto particulars, there were no end.</l>
            <l>Singly admire his prudence in the thing,</l>
