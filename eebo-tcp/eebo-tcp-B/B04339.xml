            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>MEMORIAL To his Grace, His MAJESTIES High Commiſsioner, and the Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Eſtates of Parliament, concerning a Fond for a yearly Sallary to the Judge of the High Court of Admirality.</head>
            <p>THE High Court of Admirality, being by Act of Parliament declared a Sovereign Court, it is ſuitable to the Dignity thereof, that the Judge have a ſettled Sallary for his Pains and Encouragement, as other Judges of Soveraign Courts have, and that he be not left to the meanneſs and uncertainty of Sentence-money.</p>
            <p>The moſt natural Fond that occurs, is ſome ſmall Tunnage on Shipping, which may be made to eaſie, that it will be very inſenſible to thoſe lyable in payment.</p>
            <p>In the laſt Seſſion of Parliament there was Impoſed Sixteen Pence on the Tun of every Foraign Ship which came into any Harbour or Road within this Kingdom, each Voyage, and Four Shilling <hi>Scots</hi> on every Tun of <hi>Scots</hi> Ships above Twelve Tuns Burden, once ilk Year, which was to be applyed by the Lords of Privy Council for Re-imburſing Captain <hi>Slazer</hi> and Mr. <hi>Adair,</hi> for certain Mapps, Proſpects, and Deſcriptions of <hi>Scotland,</hi> with power to ſtop the ſaid Impoſition in whole or in part, when the ſaids Maps and Proſpects were perfected.</p>
            <p>How far Mr. <hi>Slazer</hi> and Mr. <hi>Adair</hi> are payed or might have been payed out of the ſaid Fond, may be enquired into if the Eſtates of Parliament think fit.</p>
            <p>It is certain this Impoſition was complained of as a very heavy Burden by thoſe concerned with Shipping, for eaſing them thereof in a great Meaſure.</p>
            <p>It is humbly propoſed, that the one half of the ſaid Impoſition be continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be a Fond for a Sallary to the Judge of the High Court of Admirali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and for making it the more effectual, that a Collector be appointed toup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lift the whole Termly, and that he have a ſuitable Allowance, as alſo that the Judge and Collectors Sallary be appointed to be payed out of the firſt and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dieſt of the ſaid Impoſition, and if the Parliament think fit to continue any part of the ſaid Tunnage for Mr. <hi>Slazer</hi> or <hi>Adairs</hi> Behoves, that the ſame be payed out of the <hi>ſuperplus:</hi> But Captain <hi>Slazers</hi> performances being altogether extrinſick from Shipping, the Parliament may poſſibly fall on ſome other more proper Fond for his Reimburſement.</p>
            <p>The Royal Burrows who are moſt concerned in this Matter, will willingly agree to this Propoſal, and what ſhall be the <hi>Quota</hi> of the Sallary, is ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Commisſioner his Grace and the Honourable Eſtates of Parliament.</p>
