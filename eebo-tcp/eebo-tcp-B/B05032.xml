         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <l>WHen <hi>England</hi> half Ruin'd, had cauſe to be ſad,</l>
               <l>The <hi>Pope</hi>'s bloody Bulls they began to run mad,</l>
               <l>Becauſe we had given them Paſture a while,</l>
               <l>They ran about ranging all over the Iſle;</l>
               <l>Theſe mereſſeſs Beaſts, their rage for to feaſt,</l>
               <l>They gor'd and had like to have Murder'd our <hi>Teſt:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>But juſt in the intrim there came in a Friend,</l>
               <l>Who did the poor <hi>Teſt,</hi> from their Fury defend.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Theſe Bulls they were kept by that Bear in the <hi>Tower,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>And chiefly were Nouriſh'd by Diſpenſing Power:</l>
               <l>But ſometimes to feaſt their devouring Iaws,</l>
               <l>Their Keeper would give them ſome ſcraps of the Laws;</l>
               <l>Theſe Bulls have been found in other Mens Ground,</l>
               <l>But now we have put them in <hi>Packington</hi>'s Pound;</l>
               <l>O never was Bulls ſo βaited about,</l>
               <l>For certain, as theſe will be, e're they come out.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Thus in our Nation a great many Fools,</l>
               <l>Endeavour'd to Fatten his Holineſs Bulls;</l>
               <l>The Iudges almoſt out of every Cauſe,</l>
               <l>Allow'd them a Penſion of <hi>Penal Laws;</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Theſe Bulls had ſuch power, they'd like to devour</l>
               <l>Our Church and our Laws, but they now are brought lower</l>
               <l>Was ever ſuch Impudent Bulls ever known,</l>
               <l>To toſs Sacred Majeſty out of the Throne.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Their Keeper who was no leſs Man than a Lord,</l>
               <l>Were by theſe Mad Bulls moſt notoriouſly Gor'd:</l>
               <l>They had on they Heads ſuch a <hi>Sampſon</hi>-like power,</l>
               <l>The caſt him at one clever Toſs in the <hi>Tower;</hi>
               </l>
               <l>And ſome they are jealous that he and his Fellows,</l>
               <l>Will be toſt from the <hi>Tower,</hi> to a Scaffold or Gallows;</l>
               <l>O what a ſad ſight would it be for to ſee</l>
               <l>So many bleſt Martyrs to ſwing on a Tree.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>We've done with the Keeper, and now for the Driver,</l>
               <l>Who valued Religion no more than a Stiver:</l>
               <l>Theſe Bulls being Wanton, and at no Command,</l>
               <l>They toſt their poor Driver quite out of the Land;</l>
               <l>This is a ſad matter to looſe <hi>Ob—r,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Who has a ſtrange Name, but is ſtranger by Nature:</l>
               <l>'Twould be a ſad thing, ſhould he dance the long Iigg,</l>
               <l>For making Diviſion 'twixt <hi>Tory</hi> and <hi>Whigg.</hi>
               </l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Theſe Bulls were ſo Wanton and Maſterleſs grown,</l>
               <l>They broke into Paſtures that lay nigh the Throne;</l>
               <l>They Fatted themſelves, and they ranged about,</l>
               <l>And undid the Owner before they come out:</l>
               <l>He was fore'd out of hand, to leave all his Land,</l>
               <l>Such damn'd Popiſh Bulls deſerve all to be Hang'd;</l>
               <l>More Miſchief they did which muſt not be expreſt,</l>
               <l>I'le leave you alone to imagine the reſt.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But now theſe ſad Beaſts for the Miſchief they'd done,</l>
               <l>Will be to the Slaughter brought every one;</l>
               <l>And if that they were but well order'd and dreſt,</l>
               <l>'Twould make <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Devil</hi> a delicate Feaſt;</l>
               <l>Their Bull nor their Bears, ſhall breed no more fears,</l>
               <l>Nor ſet us together again by the Ears,</l>
               <l>We'll out of our Land quickly drive out ſuch Beaſts,</l>
               <l>As popular Rogues, and diſquieted Prieſts.</l>
            </lg>

               <l>You that are minded to purchaſe a Hide,</l>
               <l>Pray lay by your Coin while the Bulls they are try'd,</l>
               <l>For then at the Gallows you'll ſee ſuch a heap,</l>
               <l>And excellent Penniworths ſold very Cheap:</l>
               <l>Stay but while Seſſions, you'll hear ſuch Confeſſions,</l>
               <l>As Subtle as e're was the Old Declarations;</l>
               <l>But we ſhall have now a much Honeſter State,</l>
