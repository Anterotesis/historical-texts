            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <lg>
               <l>Yet ſince ſome Sons of Darkneſs dare invade</l>
               <l>It, with what Subtil Arts hath ſpecious made,</l>
               <l>Pretended Zeal dreſt up in Maſquerade;</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>'Tis but an Act of Goodneſs to adviſe</l>
               <l>All that their own, or Countries Safety prize,</l>
               <l>To ſhun the Fiend, though in the Saints diſguiſe,</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>You are too young more than by Rumour to</l>
               <l>Know, what their Bloody Anceſtors did do,</l>
               <l>When they their Sovereign to a Scaffold drew;</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But thoſe that ſaw thoſe Diſmal Times can tell,</l>
               <l>Their Actions then and now run Parallell;</l>
               <l>If different, theſe in Villany excell.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Thoſe Sandy Props of State, the Common Rout,</l>
               <l>Were then, as they are now, hurried about</l>
               <l>With Fears and Fancies till the Flame burſt out.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>They then, as now, unjuſtly did complain</l>
               <l>Of Popiſh Prelates, Arbitrary Reign,</l>
               <l>And all that might the Royal Ermins ſtain.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But here our Modern great Projectors have</l>
               <l>Got ſome Advantage; here's a Plot to ſave</l>
               <l>The Presbyter from being th' only Knave.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>A Real Plot, by Subtil Jeſuits drew,</l>
               <l>Whoſe Ruine Faction but pretended to,</l>
               <l>Whilſt they erected One more ſtrange and new.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Here the White Devil puts on Innocence,</l>
               <l>Makes Zeal and Loyalty the falſe Pretence,</l>

            <lg>
               <l>The Popiſh Lords with Caution lain aſide,</l>
               <l>As if their twiſted Intereſt would divide,</l>
               <l>Should they before more Loyal Men be try'd.</l>

            <lg>

            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>For though the Blinded People will not ſee</l>
               <l>What 'tis they drive at, there's no Good Man free</l>
               <l>From Danger, where the Crime is Loyalty.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>There is no Means their Sovereign to annoy,</l>
               <l>Nor Biſhops Lands again to re-enjoy,</l>
               <l>Leſt His Great Council do His Good deſtroy;</l>

            <lg>
               <l>Impeach His Loyal Lords, Biſhops ſuſpend,</l>
               <l>And ruine him that to the Crown's a Friend,</l>
               <l>And then Rebellion hath its wiſht-for End.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>They they'll diſcover what is now th'Intent,</l>
               <l>That a Damn'd Faction only ſtrives to rent</l>
               <l>Religions Veil, and Civil Government:</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>A Private Stab which brings Authority</l>
               <l>From <hi>Rome</hi>'s dark Conclave of no uſe will be,</l>
               <l>When the King's made His Kingdoms Enemy.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>When the Deluded Rout <hi>Their Own</hi> they have,</l>
               <l>Let Him but Grant what they are bold to Crave,</l>
               <l>They'll Lop that Head, they now pretend to Save.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The Zealous Veil they'll then caſt off, and in</l>
               <l>Their Native Colours to the World be ſeen,</l>
               <l>As Black without, as they are now within.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>What now you're flatter'd to, you then will hate;</l>
               <l>Perhaps turn Convert, but 'twill be too late:</l>
               <l>You may repent; but not retrieve your Fate.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
