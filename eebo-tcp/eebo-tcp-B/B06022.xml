         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>THat you do fear an Oath I dare not ſwear,</l>
               <l>Eſpecially, if it the cauſe advance,</l>
               <l>And yet I dare ſwear that one Oath you fear,</l>
               <l>And that the Oath is of Allegiance.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>To God yet you will ſwear, and to your King,</l>
               <l>Provided that the Oath be myſtical:</l>
               <l>You promiſe, and you muſt performe the thing,</l>
               <l>Though with the <hi>Forty,</hi> 'tis to kill Saint <hi>Paul.</hi>
               </l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>You are, you ſay, no <hi>Quaker</hi> to proteſt</l>
               <l>Againſt all Swearing; that indeed I grant:</l>
               <l>But if with <hi>Rome,</hi> you ſwore not Eaſt and Weſt,</l>
               <l>How a pox gulpt ye down that <hi>Covenant</hi> ?</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But what an alteration here is made ?</l>
               <l>What ſubjects on a ſudden ye commence ?</l>
               <l>Maintain the Crown, and yet the Church invade;</l>
               <l>Come ye'l yield all things, but Obedience.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But if that great King <hi>Conſcience</hi> ſayes not nay,</l>
               <l>You to the Kings Commands will freely yield:</l>
               <l>But is not this that Conſcience Sir I pray,</l>
               <l>That has our Land with Blood and Rapine fill'd ?</l>

               <l>You ſwear forfooth you will the Crown defend,</l>
               <l>And all the dignity of the Royal Oak:</l>
               <l>But here the thief uſurps the name of Friend,</l>
               <l>The <hi>Kirk</hi> the lvie is of which you ſpoke.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>With the <hi>Apochrypha</hi> you cannot bear,</l>
               <l>And your Devotion ſtumbles at this logg:</l>

               <l>I'le ſwear and venture all that I am worth,</l>
               <l>That Biſhops laſt as long as King and Queen.</l>

               <l>But by your leave, what <hi>Peters</hi> do you mean;</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Peters</hi> that preacht at <hi>Charing-Croſs</hi> ſo lately ?</l>
