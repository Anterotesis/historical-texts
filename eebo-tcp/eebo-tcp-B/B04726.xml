            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <lg>
               <l>AS I went through the North Countrie,</l>
               <l>I heard a merry meeting,</l>
               <l>A pleaſant Toy and full of joy.</l>
               <l>two Noble-man were greeting;</l>
               <l>And as they walked forth to ſport,</l>
               <l>upon a Summers Day,</l>
               <l>They met another Noble-man,</l>
               <l>with whom they had a fray.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>His Name was Sir Iohn Barley-Corn,</l>
               <l>be dwelt down in a Vale,</l>
               <l>And had a Kinſman dwelt with him,</l>
               <l>they call'd him Tom Good Ale,</l>
               <l>Another named Sir Richard Beer,</l>
               <l>was ready at that time;</l>
               <l>And likewiſe came a buſie Peer,</l>
               <l>called Sir William White-Wine.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Some of them fought in a black ſack,</l>
               <l>ſome of them in a Can,</l>
               <l>But yet the chiefeſt in a black Pot,</l>
               <l>fought like a Nobleman.</l>
               <l>Sir Barley-Corn fought in a bowl,</l>
               <l>who wan the Victory,</l>
               <l>Which made them all to curſe and ſwear,</l>
               <l>that Barley-Corn muſt die.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Some ſaid kill him, ſome ſaid him drown</l>
               <l>ſome wiſht to hang him high.</l>
               <l>For thoſe that followed Barley-Corn,</l>
               <l>they ſaid would Beggars die.</l>
               <l>Then with a Plow they Plow'd him up,</l>
               <l>and thus they did deviſe</l>
               <l>To bury him within the Earth,</l>
               <l>and ſwore he ſhould not riſe.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>With Harrows ſtrong they came to him</l>
               <l>and burſt Clods on his head,</l>
               <l>A joyful Banquet then was made,</l>
               <l>when Barley-Corn was dead,</l>
               <l>He reſted ſtill upon the Earth,</l>
               <l>till rain from Sky did fall.</l>
               <l>Then he grew up in branches green,</l>
               <l>which ſore amazed them all.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Increaſing then till midſummer,</l>
               <l>he made them all afraid:</l>
               <l>For then be did ſpring up on high,</l>
               <l>and had a goodly beard.</l>
               <l>When riping at St. James's time,</l>
               <l>his countenance wax'd wan:</l>
               <l>Yet now full grown in part of ſtrength,</l>
               <l>and thus became a man.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Wherefore with hooks and ſickles keen,</l>
               <l>unto the fields they hy'd,</l>
               <l>They cut his Legs off by the knees,</l>
               <l>and Limb from Limb divide,</l>
               <l>Then bloodily they cut him down,</l>
               <l>from place where he did ſtand.</l>
               <l>And like a Thief for treacherie,</l>
               <l>they bound him in a band.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>So then they took him up again,</l>
               <l>according to his kind,</l>
               <l>And plac'd him up in ſeveral ſlacks,</l>
               <l>to wither with the wind,</l>
               <l>Then with a Pichfork ſharp and lang,</l>
               <l>they rent him to the heart,</l>
               <l>And Traitor like for Treaſon vile,</l>
               <l>they bound him in a Cart.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>And tending him with Weapons ſtrong,</l>
               <l>unto the Town they hie,</l>
               <l>Whereas they mov'd him a mow,</l>
               <l>and ſo they let him ly.</l>
               <l>They left him groaning by the walls,</l>
               <l>till all his bones were ſore,</l>

               <l>the fleſh fell from his bones.</l>
               <l>Then after took him up again,</l>
               <l>to pleaſe ſome womens minds,</l>
