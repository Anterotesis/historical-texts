         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S the daily expectation of the comming of the Propoſitions hath made his Majeſty this long time to forbeare giving his Anſwer unto them, ſo the appearance of their ſending being no more for any thing he can heare, then it was at his firſt comming hither, notwithſtanding that the Earle of <hi>Louderdale</hi> hath been at <hi>London</hi> above theſe 10 dayes, (whoſe not comming was ſaid to be the onely ſtop) hath cauſed his Majeſty thus to anticipate their comming to him, and yet conſidering his Condition, that his Servants are denied ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe to him, all but very few, and thoſe by appointment, not his owne Election, and that it is declared a crime for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny but the Commiſſioners, or ſuch who are particularly permitted by them, to converſe with his Majeſtie, or that any Letters ſhould be given to, or received from him, may hee not truly ſay, that he is not in caſe fit to make Conceſſions, or give Anſwers, ſince he is not maſter of thoſe ordinary Actions which are the undoubted Rights of any free-borne man, how meane ſoever his birth be? And certainly hee would ſtill be ſilent as to this ſubject, untill his Condition were much mended, did he not preferre ſuch a right under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding betwixt Him and his Parliaments of both King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, which may make a firme and laſting Peace in all His Dominions, before any particular of his owne or any earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bleſſing: and therefore His Majeſty hath diligently im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed his utmoſt indeavours for divers moneths paſt, ſo to
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:175556:3"/>
informe His Underſtanding, and ſatisfie His Conſcience, that he might be able to give ſuch Anſwers to the Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as would be moſt agreeable to His Parliaments; but He ingenuouſly profeſſes, that notwithſtanding all the paines that He hath taken therein, the nature of ſome of them ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares ſuch unto him, that without diſclaiming that Reaſon which God hath given him to judge by for the good of Him and His People, and without putting the greateſt violence upon His owne Conſcience, Hee cannot give His conſent to all of them. Yet His Majeſtie (that it may appeare to all the VVorld how deſirous He is to give full ſatisfaction) hath thought fit hereby to expreſſe His readineſſe to grant what he may, and His willingneſſe to receive from them, and that perſonally if His two Houſes at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> ſhall approve thereof, ſuch further Information in the reſt as may beſt convince His judgement, and ſatisfie thoſe doubts which are not yet cleer unto him, deſiring them alſo to conſider that if His Majeſtie intended to winde himſelfe out of theſe trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles by indirect meanes, were it not eaſie for him now rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily to conſent to what hath or ſhall bee propoſed unto him, and afterwards chuſe his time to breake all, alledging, that forc't conceſſions are not to be kept, ſurely he might, and not incurre a hard cenſure from ſome indifferent men. But max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imes in this kinde are not the guides of His Majeſties acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, for hee freely and cleerly avows, that he holds it unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for any man, and moſt baſe in a King to recede from his promiſes for having been obtained by force or under re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint; wherefore his Majeſty not onely rejecting thoſe acts which he eſteems unworthy of him, but even paſſing by that which he might well inſiſt a point of honour, in reſpect of his preſent condition, thus anſwers the firſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. That upon his Majeſties comming to <hi>London,</hi> hee will heartily joyne in all that ſhall concerne the honour of his two Kingdomes or the Aſſembly of the States of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:175556:3"/>
or of the Commiſſioners or Deputies of either King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, particularly in thoſe things which are deſired in that Propoſition, upon confidence that all of them reſpectively with the ſame tenderneſſe will look upon thoſe things which concerne his Majeſties honour.</p>
            <p>In anſwer to all the Propoſitions concerning Religion, His Majeſtie propoſeth, that he will confirme the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall Government, the Aſſembly of Divines at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and the Directory, for three yeares, being the time ſet downe by the two Houſes, ſo that His Majeſtie and His Houſhold be not hindred from that forme of Gods Service which they formerly have; And alſo, that a free conſultation &amp; debate be had with the Divines at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> (twentie of His Majeſties nomination being added unto them) whereby it may be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by His Majeſtie and the two Houſes, how the Church ſhall be governed after the ſaid three yeares or ſooner, if dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences may be agreed. Touching the Covenant, His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie is not yet therein ſatisfied, and deſires to reſpite His par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular anſwer thereunto untill His comming to <hi>London,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it being a matter of conſeience he cannot give a reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion therein till he may be aſſiſted with the advice of ſome of His own Chaplains (which hath hitherto bin denied Him) &amp; ſuch other Divines as ſhall be moſt proper to informe Him therein; and then He will make clearely appeare, both His zeale to the Proteſtant profeſſion, and the Union of theſe two Kingdomes, which he conceives to be the maine drift of this Covenant. To the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> and 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Propoſitions, His Majeſtie will conſent. To the 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi> His Majeſtie doubts not but to give good ſatisfaction when he ſhall be particularly informed how the ſaid penalties ſhall be levied and diſpoſed of. To the 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> His Majeſties anſwer is, That he hath beene alwayes ready to prevent the practices of Papiſt, and therefore is content to piſſe an Act of Parliament for that purpoſe; And alſo, that the Lawes againſt them be duly executed. His
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:175556:4"/>
Majeſtie will give His conſent to the Act for the due obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Lords Day, for the ſuppreſſing of Innovati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and thoſe concerning the Preaching of Gods Word, and touching Non-Reſidence and Pluralities, and His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie will yeeld to ſuch Act or Acts as ſhall be requiſite to rayſe moneyes for the payment and ſatisfying all publique Debts, expecting alſo that his will be therein included. As to the Propoſition touching the Militia, though his Majeſtie cannot conſent unto it <hi>in terminis</hi> as it is propoſed, becauſe thereby he conceives, hee wholly parts with the power of the Sword entruſted to him by God and the Lawes of the Land, for the protection and government of his people, thereby at once deveſting himſelfe, and diſ-inheriting his Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteritie of that right and prerogative of the Crowne which is absolutely neceſſary to the Kingly Office, and ſo weaken Monarchy in this Kingdome, that little more then the name and ſhadow of it will remaine: yet if it be onely ſecuritie for the preſervation of the peace of this Kingdome, after the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy troubles, and the due performance of all the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which are now to be concluded, which is deſired, (which his Majeſtie alwayes underſtood to be the caſe, and hopes that herein he is not miſtaken) his Majeſtie will give aboundant ſatisfaction, to which end he is willing by Act of Parliament, That the whole power of the Militia, both by Sea and Land for the ſpace of tenne yeares bee in the hands of ſuch perſons as the two Houses ſhall nominate, giving them power during the ſaid terme to change the ſaid per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and ſubſtitute others in their places at pleaſure, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards to returne to the proper channell againe, as it was in the times of Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and King <hi>Iames</hi> of bleſſed memory. And now his Majeſtie conjures his two Houſes of Parliament, as they are Engliſhmen and lovers of Peace, by the dutie they owe to his Majeſtie their King, and by the bowells of compaſſion they have to their fellow Subjects,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:175556:4"/>
that they will accept of this his Majeſties offer, whereby the joyfull news of Peace may be reſtored to this languiſhing Kingdome His Majeſtie will grant the like to the Kingdome of <hi>Scotland</hi> if it bee deſired, and agree to all things that are propounded touching the conſerving of peace betwixt the two Kingdomes.</p>
            <p>Touching <hi>Ireland</hi> (other things being agreed) His Majeſtie will give ſatisfaction therein. As to the mutuall Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons propoſed to be eſtabliſhed in both Kingdomes by Act of Parliament, And the Modifications, Qualifications, and Branches which follow in the Propoſitions, His Majeſty onely profeſſes, that He doth not ſufficiently underſtand, nor is able to reconcile many things contained in them; but this He well knoweth, That a general Act of Oblivion is the beſt Bond of Peace; and that after inteſtine Troubles, the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of this and other Kingdomes hath uſually and happily in all ages granted generall Pardons, whereby the numerous diſcontentments of many Perſons and Families otherwiſe expoſed to ruine, might not become fewell to new diſorders, or ſeedes to future troubles. His Majeſty therefore deſires, that his two Houſes of Parliament would ſeriouſly deſcend into theſe conſiderations, and likewiſe tenderly look upon his Condition herein, and the perpetual diſhonour that muſt cleave to him, if He ſhall thus abandon ſo many perſons of Condition and Fortune that have ingaged themſelves with and for Him, out of a ſenſe of Duty, and propounds as a very acceptable teſtimony of their affection to him, That a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Act of Oblivion and free Pardon be forthwith paſſed by Act of Parliament. Touching the new great Seal, His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty is very willing to confirme both it and all the Acts done by vertue thereof untill this preſent time, ſo that it be not thereby preſſed to make voyd thoſe Acts of his done by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of his great Seale, which in honour and juſtice he is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to maintaine, And that the future Government there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:175556:5"/>
may be in his Majeſty, according to the due courſe of Law. Concerning the Officers mentioned in the 19. Article, His Majeſty when he ſhall come to <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> will gratiſie his Parliament all that poſſibly he may, without deſtroying the alterations which are neceſſary for the Crown. His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty will willingly conſent to the Act for the confirmation of the Priviledges and Cuſtomes of the City of <hi>London,</hi> and all that is mentioned in the Propoſitions for their particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler advantage. And now that His Majeſty hath thus far in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to comply with the deſires of his two Houſes of Parliament, to the end that this agreement may be firme and laſting, without the leaſt face or queſtion of reſtraint to ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh the ſame, his Majeſty earneſtly deſires preſently to bee admitted to his Parliament at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> with that Honour which is due to their Soveraigne, there ſolemnly to confirme the ſame, and legally to paſſe the Acts before mentioned, and to give and receive as well ſatisfaction in all the remaining particulars, as likewiſe ſuch other pledges of mutuall love, truſt, and confidence as ſhall moſt concerne the good of him, and his peoples upon which happy agreement, his Majeſty will diſpatch his Directions to the Prince his Son, to returne immediately to him, and will undertake for his ready obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encc thereunto.</p>
            <p>For the Speaker of the Lords Houſe (<hi>pro tempore</hi>) to be communicated to the Lords and Commons in tht Parliament of <hi>England</hi> at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and the Commiſſioners of the Parliament of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
