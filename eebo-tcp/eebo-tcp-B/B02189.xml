         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THe Provincial Synod of <hi>Lothian</hi> and <hi>Tweddale</hi> met here, taking to their Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Diſpenſations of God in his Providence, with reſpect to the Seaſon of the Year, in this cold and unkindly Spring; Did judge that God was thereby calling them, and the People under their Charge to ſolemn Humiliation, for averting his threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Judgements: And therefore Appointed <hi>Tueſday</hi> the Seventeenth day of this current Moneth of <hi>May,</hi> to be obſerved as a Day of Solemn Faſting and Humiliation, in all the Churches within the Bounds of the ſaid Synod, for theſe Cauſes following.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That notwithſtanding the Light of the glorious Goſpel ſhining among us, there is a great Contempt of the Goſpel, much Ignorance and Ungodlineſs in the Land, and Self-ſeeking, and Lukewarmneſs in the Matters of God among all Ranks of Perſons, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneneſs and Wickedneſs grow, the ſhameful Sins of Drunkeneſs and Uncleaneſs, Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Sabbath-breaking, the total Neglect by ſome, and ſuperficial performing by others of the Worſhip of God, both in Secret and in Families, abound in City and Countrey, and by frequent Murders Blood toucheth Blood.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That notwithſtandidg of Vows and Engagements National and Perſonal, and after ſevere Judgements, and ſignal Mercies, and after Solemn Humiliations People go on in their Sins and continue impenitent, hard Hearted and unreformed.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That for theſe &amp; other Sins, the Wrath &amp; diſpleaſure of God is viſible againſt us in the unkind<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly cold &amp; winter-like Spring, whereby GOD threatnes to blaſt our Expectations and Hopes of the Fruits of the Earth, and cut off Man and Beaſt by Famine, and that already there is a great Dearth ariſen, and in many places of the Land they have great Want both of Food and Seed, and the Cattel and Sheep die in great Numbers, and yet we are not duely af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected therewith, but there is generally a woful Stupidity and Security.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The dangerous State of the Church both at Home and Abroad, through the ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Atheiſtical and Blaſphemous Opinions contrary to, and deſtructive of the Fundamental Principles of Religion, and the increaſe of Popery in diverſe Places, the Diviſions in ſome, and Deſolations in other parts of this Church, and that in diverſe Places Abroad, theſe of the reformed Religion are under Perſecution, and others in Fear and Danger.</p>
            <p>For theſe beſide many other Cauſes mentioned in former Faſts, we have Cauſe to humble our ſelves by Faſting and Prayer, and to be Afflicted, and Mourn, and Weep, and to turn unto the Lord, and to pray that He would turn us unto him, and pardon our Sins, and the Sins of the Land, and that he would turn from His Wrath, and ſend kindly Weather, which may cheriſh the Fruits of the Earth for Food to Man and Beaſt, that he would heal our Breaches, plant our deſolate Places, ſtop the growth of Prophaneneſs and Popery, and other corrupt Opinions, and grant Deliverance, and Reſt, and Safety to his ſuffering People, and preſerve his Church, and advance the Kingdom of the Lord Jeſus, and that for His Churches ſake he would long preſerve, and richly bleſs our King, direct and guide him in his Government, that under him the People may live a quiet and peaceable Life, in all Godlineſs and Honeſty.</p>
