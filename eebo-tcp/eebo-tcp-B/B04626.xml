            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>WHO wou'd on Greatneſs, or on Worth rely,</l>
               <l>When Hero's thus like common men muſt die?</l>
               <l>Cou'd Virtue, Merit, or cou'd Valour ſave</l>
               <l>Deſerving Men, from the Impartial Grave;</l>
               <l>None ſurely cou'd with ſo much Juſtice be</l>
               <l>Secur'd from Fate, Great <hi>Albemarle,</hi> as Thee;</l>
               <l>Whoſe mighty Actions to the World has ſhown,</l>
               <l>'Tis more to merit, than uſurp a Crown;</l>
               <l>When gen'rouſly You did refuſe and ſcorn</l>
               <l>That uſurp'd Titles ſhou'd Your Name adorn,</l>
               <l>Eſteeming it a far more glorious thing</l>
               <l>For to Reſtore, than be Your Self a King.</l>
               <l>Thoſe Baits of Pow'r which Empire did impart,</l>
               <l>Prov'd far too weak to tempt Your Loyal Heart.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>When Civil Broils (for our Offences hurl'd</l>
               <l>By Angry Heaven on our Sep'rate World,)</l>
               <l>Whoſe Rage almoſt Three Kingdoms had deſtroy'd,</l>
               <l>And wrought a Ruine none cou'd ſcarce avoid,</l>
               <l>Relenting Fate through pity then ordain'd</l>
               <l>You ſhou'd thoſe ills redreſs, our State ſuſtain'd;</l>
               <l>And by an Act, as gen'rous as unknown,</l>
               <l>Reſtore Our Soveraign to his Native Throne:</l>
               <l>Nothing cou'd too, Your Prudence more declare</l>
               <l>Than the Wiſe Conduct of this great Affair.</l>
               <l>Through Tracts of Blood you did not Conqueſt trace;</l>
               <l>A <hi>Halcyon</hi> calm did all Your Triumphs grace.</l>
               <l>Thoſe Pow'rs which oft had Royal Arms withſtood,</l>
               <l>You ſoon diſpers'd without one drop of Blood.</l>
               <l>Secure You wrought what Rebels ſcarcely fear'd;</l>
               <l>As Lightning kills before the Thunder's heard.</l>
               <l>Thus, through Your Noble Conduct we were bleſt</l>
               <l>From all the Toils of horrid War, with Reſt.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>When not Content with what we did Enjoy,</l>
               <l>Unleſs <hi>Batavia's</hi> Traffick we deſtroy;</l>
               <l>A War's begun, which nothing did advance</l>
               <l>To either Nation, but make Potent <hi>France.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Whil'ſt on the Sea, others for Empire fight,</l>
               <l>In Court-Enjoyments You took ſmall delight;</l>
               <l>Nor yet Content with former Glories gain'd,</l>
               <l>Unleſs You now, Your Countries Cauſe maintain'd.</l>
               <l>Victorious <hi>York</hi> did Firſt the <hi>Dutch</hi> ſubdue,</l>
               <l>Their Second Conqueſt Fate reſerv'd for You;</l>
               <l>Who ſo improv'd, what was before begun,</l>
               <l>As <hi>Belgick</hi> Fleets did from our Canon run;</l>
               <l>And whilſt You Gen'ral on the Ocean Ride,</l>
               <l>No Hoſtile Fleet did on our Seas abide.</l>
               <l>Theſe Glorious Actions prov'd that You cou'd be,</l>
               <l>Great <hi>Albion's</hi> Patron both at Land and Sea;</l>
               <l>And with more Juſtice may that Title Clame,</l>
               <l>Than he who <hi>England</hi> does for Patron Name.</l>
               <l>He only help'd a poor diſtreſſed Maid,</l>
               <l>You vanquiſh'd thoſe, who did our Rights Invade.</l>
               <l>Rights, our<note n="(*)" place="margin">Selden.</note> great Antiquary prov'd to be</l>
               <l>As Ancient Ours, as is the <hi>Britiſh</hi>-Sea.</l>
               <l>Fore-knowing Fate only ordain'd that He,</l>
               <l>Shou'd prove an Emblem, and a Type of Thee.</l>
               <l>His Fab'lous Stories ſcarcely known, but You</l>
               <l>A Monſter worſe than that great Hero ſlew:</l>
               <l>A Monſter us'd to Act ſuch horrid things,</l>
               <l>As it durſt ſhed the Sacred Blood of Kings.</l>
               <l>For which brave deed, Thy Name ſhall ever be</l>
               <l>Ador'd and Reverenc'd by Poſterity.</l>
               <l>And may Auſpicious Fate ſtill grant that You,</l>
               <l>May as their Wonder, prove their Pattern too.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But now at length Death claims, Great Sir, from You</l>
               <l>A Debt, as Mortal, was to Nature due.</l>
               <l>Nor can thoſe Lawrels Conquering bows adorn,</l>
               <l>Protect thoſe Hero's that are Mortal born.</l>
               <l>Too well, alas, Th' Imperious Tyrant knew,</l>
               <l>He only You, cou'd through Your Self ſubdue.</l>
               <l>In other Parts he vainly ſtrove to wound</l>
               <l>Your too much Heart he only Mortal found.</l>
               <l>Thus to ſome Grove the aged Phenix flies,</l>
               <l>Builds its own Neſt, and through its own means dies.</l>
               <l>In Bloody Fields his Malice You defi'd,</l>
               <l>And like a Gen'ral in Your Chair You di'd.</l>
               <l>An <hi>Exit</hi> Your great Courage did befit,</l>
               <l>Which ſeem'd to Conquer, when it did ſubmit.</l>
               <l>Natures great Debt You willing were to pay,</l>
               <l>Yet ſcorn'd to do it an ignoble way.</l>
               <l>And though Y' are Dead, to future Ages fame</l>
               <l>With ſuch Advantage ſhall, tranſmit Your Name,</l>
               <l>As no Oblivion ſhall thy Deeds obſcure,</l>
               <l>As long as Time, or Hiſtory indure.</l>
               <l>And be amongſt our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Monarchs laid,</l>
               <l>With all the Pomp a grateful Prince can give,</l>
               <l>Whilſt in his Thoughts You ſhall for ever live.</l>
               <l>No <hi>Mauſolaeum</hi> can ſecure Thy reſt,</l>
               <l>Like ſuch a Lodging in His Royal breſt.</l>
               <l>Protected thus within that Sacred Place,</l>
               <l>Envy, nor Time, Your Merits ſhall Deface.</l>
               <l>Who wou'd not then prove that Great Monarch's Friend,</l>
               <l>Who does His Kindneſs beyond Life extend;</l>
               <l>And to Your Mem'ry nobly ſtrives to pay</l>
               <l>Paſt Obligations in a gen'rous way.</l>
               <l>Yet who like You, when Fate ſeem'd moſt to frown,</l>
               <l>Sav'd an Uſurp'd, Secur'd an Envied Crown,</l>
               <l>And Three Great Kingdoms did from Ruine free,</l>
