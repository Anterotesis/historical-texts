            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>Deliver'd at the Devil's Arſe of Peak.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WHEN we come to be <hi>laid up in the Sepulchres of our Fathers, the laſt Stage of our Throne of Mortality, the ſituation ſeems to be ſomewhat horrid: But upon review, the</hi> Elyſian <hi>Vallies open with greater Amazement, and the rocky</hi> monumental <hi>Hills</hi> of Marble, <hi>that hang over in a more awful guard of it, ſeem to be Art in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting Nature. 'Tis not Parts, corrupted in the fineſt Head, on the Surface of which Straws and Feathers may Swim, while weightier Matters lie at the Bottom: 'Tis not Knowledge,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd by ſome to be a <hi>Bubble in the Water, a Meteor in the Air, or a Tumour and Spectacle:</hi> 'Tis not being of a <hi>Society</hi> for promoting <hi>Stocks, and Work-Houſes, for erecting Parochial Libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, or writing Parochial Antiquities, that can preſerve us from having Gravel in our Mouths.</hi> Upon this deplorable Occaſion, altho' my Writings have <hi>ſunk into contempt and diſuſe,</hi> yet I ſhall once again attempt a <hi>ſerious and rational Diſcourſe,</hi> under theſe two <hi>Paradoxes,</hi> which <hi>my love of ſingularity make me fond to maintain.</hi> I ſhall ſhew, Firſt, How a Good Rich Man may be never the Worſe for living Odly? Secondly, I ſhall explain the uſe of my <hi>Plank</hi> and <hi>Door</hi> in all Caſes of deſperate Extremities.</p>
            <p>As to the firſt Point: A Good Rich Man <hi>may allow himſelf to climb up any Hill within his reach; to fatigue himſelf within Doors; to acquire Heat, and expel Moiſture; to take a comfortable Breakfaſt, and then walk round his Lodgings; to have a Dinner provided for him about</hi> 12 <hi>a Clock; to have a Candle with ten or twelve Tobacco-pipes before him; then to ſhut the Door and fall a Smoaking and Writing, and thinking how to digeſt what he had fed upon; to be jealous of being burnt for a Heretick, and afraid of the Biſhop of</hi> Sarum; <hi>to run beyond Sea in a fright, and be driven back by the ſame: Not to endure Contradiction, or an empty Houſe; in <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>his Sickneſs to ride upon a Feather-bed in a Coach; to bate any thoughts or diſcourſe of Death; to make himſelf a warm Coat the Winter before be dies;</hi> and if then he falls <hi>into a Pit, to catch hold of one of the Devil's cloven Feet, or of</hi> my <hi>Plank,</hi> which under the next Head, I ſhall prove worth both of them.</p>
            <p>Far be it from me to deny, that Gloves, Scarves, <hi>Funeral Sermons,</hi> and <hi>Memoirs,</hi> &amp;c. are proper to be us'd at the <hi>Obſequies</hi> of the Dead, <hi>who too often affect Secrecy and Silence,</hi> as their Executors do a <hi>parcimonious narrowneſs of Mind.</hi> But theſe are things of an inferior Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to my <hi>Plank</hi> and <hi>Wicket.</hi> Some Philoſophers <hi>have been glad to creep out of the World at any Hole;</hi> but I have a new <hi>Door of hope for them; provided they be Men of Parts and Figure,</hi> and will give Crape enough to <hi>conſecrate their Memory</hi> with my <hi>Decorums.</hi> I have before inſinuated, that a good rich witty Man may do any thing but be damn'd. But I ſee ſome Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple pricking up their Ears there. You Goodman <hi>Two ſhoes,</hi> and you Gammer <hi>Two ſhoes,</hi> and you <hi>Tom Trap,</hi> and you <hi>Dick Froſt,</hi> and you Goody <hi>Gurton,</hi> that have lain in Straw ever ſince <hi>your Bed was taken away for Plunder in the Civil Wars,</hi> let me tell ye, you are <hi>poor ſtupid Wretches;</hi> your <hi>duller Flame will be more eaſily exſtinguiſh'd; you meaner ſinful</hi> Scrubs <hi>are generally given over <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
