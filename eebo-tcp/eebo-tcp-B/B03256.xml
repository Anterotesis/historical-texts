         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <lg>
               <l>AS when the Sun doth Set, we all put on</l>
               <l>A kind of pale, and dark Complection:</l>
               <l>Concerned at the Abſence of its Light;</l>
               <l>Becauſe in it, the whole Creation's right.</l>
               <l>So when a great Man, or Learn'd one falls,</l>
               <l>We are troubled at this, their Funeralls.</l>
               <l>The Feet do linger, and are never Well,</l>
               <l>When the Body is Dead, their Centinel.</l>
               <l>This Nature teaches, from her Morals high.</l>
               <l>A Courſe, we do it, it's by Sympathy:</l>
               <l>Like the pretty Flower, that hangs down its Head,</l>
               <l>When the Sun's Abſented, and is gone to Bed.</l>
               <l>Much more doth Man his fellow Creature high,</l>
               <l>When he doth ſicken to Mortality.</l>
               <l>Th' Loſs but of a Trifle we cannot bear,</l>
               <l>Much more a Gent. without ſome kind of Tear.</l>
               <l>To think of the great Frayltie of Nature,</l>
               <l>In Man, Bird, in Beaſt, in every Creature:</l>
               <l>Subject to Changes, and Alterations, ſtill</l>
               <l>As an Empreſs, Mutation is her Will.</l>
               <l>The Roſe, the Tulep, and the pretty Bee,</l>
               <l>Have but their Seaſon now, for to be Free:</l>
               <l>And Man, the Lord of the Creation,</l>
               <l>Death cometh, and takes him from his Station.</l>
               <l>For we're here to Day, and gone to Morrow,</l>
               <l>Into the Grave, where there is no Sorrow.</l>
               <l>Where all in Silence do remain, and lie</l>
               <l>As ordered from the Heavens on high.</l>
               <l>Art, Wit, Riches, nay all they cannot Save</l>
               <l>Us, from the cold, Icy Tomb, and Grave.</l>
               <l>The Potter having a Power o're his Veſſel ſtill,</l>
               <l>Whether that it be good, or whether ill.</l>
               <l>We are his Handywork, we are his Sheep;</l>
               <l>By him we Eat, and Drink, and Reſt, and Sleep:</l>
               <l>And when going in Sunſhine, or in Rain;</l>
               <l>Death appears, and bids us Return again.</l>
               <l>So that each Step we take, we do draw near,</l>
               <l>Unto the King of Terrors, and of Fear.</l>
               <l>Like Seamen ſtill, our Ships are under Sail,</l>
               <l>Though toſs'd with Ill, or with a pleaſant Gale:</l>
               <l>At laſt Anchor they muſt, in ſome kind Port,</l>
               <l>To pleaſe themſelves, and there to keep their Court.</l>
               <l>Men great in Virtue, and Men truly Brave,</l>
               <l>They think they can Outface Death, and the Grave:</l>
               <l>Like Countryman in Fable, that did ſay,</l>
               <l>O, where's Death, for to haſte me now away:</l>
               <l>With this my Load, and heavy Burthen high;</l>
               <l>I cannot carry it, I deſire to Die.</l>
               <l>Death Appears; and when to th' Man he came;</l>
               <l>'Twas nothing, but to help him with that ſame</l>
               <l>Bundle of Sticks, he was to carry away;</l>
               <l>But not to Die, for ſo doth th' Story ſay.</l>
               <l>The Moral teaches how ſweet a thing's Life,</l>
               <l>Though troubled here and there with every Strife:</l>
               <l>Fain it would Live, and fain be in Renown,</l>
               <l>Rather then go to a Country unknown.</l>
               <l>Bleed, Purge, Vomit, and ſo endure all,</l>
               <l>Rather than hear moſt fatal Death, his Call.</l>
               <l>So all that a Man has, ſaies holy <hi>Job,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Will a Man give for Life, and Life's fine Robe:</l>
               <l>Rather then be Diſmantled, and Uncloath'd be</l>
               <l>Of his dear Life, and his Vitalitie.</l>
               <l>Since we muſt Die, as Ordered from above,</l>
               <l>We muſt prepare, by living in true Love.</l>
               <l>When Nature into tireing Room doth go,</l>
               <l>The Scene it changes, and ſo ends her Woe.</l>
               <l>And flies into the golden Place of Reſt,</l>
               <l>Like Bird when having got into her Neſt.</l>
               <l>And there ſits down with Saints, and with Juſt Men,</l>
