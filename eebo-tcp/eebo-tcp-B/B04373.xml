            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Yet durſt I never preſume in my own minde, that either the one or the other was abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> but I ever thought that with a good conſcience I might live under either of them.

                     </gap>h Eccleſiaſticall Government in general: But to determine this or that kind of Government in particular, I think there is a latitude left to the Supream Magiſtrate; ſo that admitting neither Epiſcopacy nor Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterianiſme, in themſelves ſimply conſidered to be <hi>Jure Divino;</hi> Yet, either of them being eſtabliſhed <hi>Jure Humano,</hi> or by the Authority of the Civil Magiſtrate, muſt be recived by me and ſubmitted unto, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in that caſe, <hi>Jure Divino:</hi> Seing that <hi>Jue Divinum,</hi> in the word of God, tyeth all Subjects to render active obedience to <hi>Jus Humanum</hi> and lawfull Authority, in theſe things, whereby the eſteem of Religion and fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals of Faith are not ſhaken; and ſuch may Epiſcopacy and Presbyterianiſme be conceived to be: And whoſoever reſufeth to ſubmit to either of them, being eſtabliſhed by Authority, muſt be, not only a Rebel to the Supream Power upon earth, but to God himſelf alſo. Now to anſwer your long queſtion in few words, let me intreat you to diſtinguiſh betwixt a Miniſter of the Goſpel <hi>ſimpliciter quatalis,</hi> and a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the Goſpel <hi>in potentia proxima,</hi> to be a Biſhop: Albeit Presbyterian Ordination may make a qualified perſon a lawfull Miniſter of the Goſpel; yet, in my weak judgment, to put him <hi>in potentia proxima</hi> to be a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, Epiſcopal Ordination, if not neceſſary <hi>ad eſſe,</hi> yet <hi>requiſita ad decorum &amp; ad bene eſſe.</hi> Hence may be inferred, that by the re-ordaining of, or conferring Epiſcopal Ordination upon Presbyterian Divines, to put them in a capacity to be Biſhops, as no ſcandal is juſtly given by the Engliſh Biſhops to the Presbyterian Churches in Forraign Countries, ſo I am confident (as being throughly acquainted with the opinion in that point, of many of the moſt learned and eminent amongſt them) that no occaſion of ſcandal will be taken by them at the ſame; far leſs that they will think that the Church of <hi>England</hi> (which they ever held, and ſtill do hold as it was conſtituted in the dayes of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> King <hi>James</hi> and King <hi>Charles</hi> the firſt, all of bleſſed memory, to have been a glorious Orthodox Church) doth thereby intend to diſclaim communion with them; their Maximes and Principles both of Divinity and Policy (for they never eſteemed bad Policy to be conſiſtent with good Divinity) being more conſonant to theſe of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> conſtitued as ſaid is, then to thoſe, according to which the Presbyterians in theſe Kingdoms have walked theſe three and twenty years by-gone. But I forbear now to enter upon this point; their new Doctrine and the woefull effects that have followed thereupon, do ſufficiently evidence the truth of it to the world.</p>
