            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IN imitation of the Ancient <hi>Theaters</hi> of the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> which were too large to be covered with Lead or Tyle, this is ſuppoſed to be open: and as they ſtretched a Cordage from Pilaſter to Pilaſter, upon which they ſtrained a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering of Cloth, to protect the People from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries of the weather; ſo here is a Cord-moulding guilded, that reaches croſs and croſs the Houſe both in length and breadth, which ſupporteth a great Red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh Drapery, ſuppoſed to have covered the Roof, but now furled up by the <hi>Genii</hi> round about the Houſe, towards the Walls, which diſcovereth the open Air, and maketh way for the deſcent of the <hi>Arts</hi> and <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,</hi> that are congregated together in a Circle of Clouds; to whoſe Aſſembly Truth deſcends, as being ſolicited and implored by the moſt of them. For joy of this Feſtival the other <hi>Genii</hi> ſport about the Clouds, with their Feſtoons of Flowers and Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels; and prepare their Garlands of Laurels and Roſes, <hi>viz. Honor</hi> and <hi>Pleaſure,</hi> for the great Lovers and Students of thoſe <hi>Arts.</hi> And that the Aſſembly may be perfectly happy, their great Enemies and Diſturbers, <hi>Envy, Rapine,</hi> and <hi>Brutality,</hi> are <gap reason="illegible: damage" extent="1 word">

            <p>The report of the Aſſembly of the one, and the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion of the other, is proclaim'd through the open and ſerene Air by ſome other of the <hi>Genii,</hi> who blowing their Antick Trumpets, divide themſelves into the ſeveral Quarters of the World.</p>

               <p>But more particularly, the Circle of Figures con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts of <hi>Theology,</hi> with her Book of ſeven Seals, imploring the aſſiſtance of <hi>Truth</hi> for the unfolding of it. On her left hand is the <hi>Moſaical Law</hi> Vailed, with the Tables of Stone, to which ſhe points with her <hi>Iron Rod.</hi> On her right ſide is the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> with the <hi>Croſs</hi> in one hand, and a <hi>Chalice</hi> in the other. In the ſame Diviſion, over the Moſaical Law, is <hi>Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> holding up her <hi>Pen</hi> as dedicating it to <hi>Truth,</hi> and an attending <hi>Genius</hi> with ſeveral <hi>Fragments</hi> of <hi>Old Writing,</hi> from which ſhe collects her Hiſtory into her Book. On the other ſide of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> is Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine <hi>Poefie,</hi> with her <hi>Harp</hi> of <hi>David</hi>'s faſhion.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide of the Circle, oppoſite to <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy,</hi> in three Squares, are the <hi>Mathematical Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,</hi> (depending on <hi>Demonſtration,</hi> as the other on <hi>Faith:</hi>) In the firſt of which is <hi>Aſtronomy</hi> with the <hi>Celeſtial Globe, Geography</hi> with the <hi>Terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrial,</hi> together with three attending <hi>Genii.</hi>

               <p>In the next is <hi>Arithmetick</hi> with a Paper of <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures; Optick</hi> with her <hi>Perſpective Glaſs; Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metry</hi> with a pair of <hi>Compaſs</hi> in her left, and a <hi>Table</hi> with Lines drawn in it in her right hand.</p>
               <p>In another Square, on the West ſide of the Circle, is <hi>Law,</hi> with her Ruling Scepter, accompanied with <hi>Records, Patents,</hi> and <hi>Evidences,</hi> on the one ſide, and on the other with <hi>Rhetorick,</hi> by which is an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending <hi>Genius,</hi> with the <hi>Scales</hi> of <hi>Juſtice,</hi> and a Figure with a <hi>Palm-Branch,</hi> (the Emblem of Reward for virtuous Actions) and the <hi>Roman Faſces,</hi> the Marks of Power and Puniſhment. <hi>Printing,</hi> with a <hi>Caſe</hi> of Letters in one hand, and a <hi>Form</hi> ready ſet in the other, and by her ſeveral Sheets hanging as a drying.</p>
               <p>On that ſide the Circle, oppoſite to <hi>Law,</hi> is <hi>Phyſick,</hi> with the <hi>Knotty Staff</hi> of <hi>Aeſculapius,</hi> with a <hi>Serpent</hi> winding about it: The <hi>Herbaliſt,</hi> imploring the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of <hi>Truth</hi> for the right underſtanding of the Nature of her Plants: <hi>Chymiſtry,</hi> with a <hi>Bolt-head</hi> in her hands: <hi>Chyrurgery,</hi> as preparing her ſelf to finiſh the Diſſecting of an Head, which hath the Brain already opened, and is held before her by one of the <hi>Genii.</hi> In the Triangle on the right hand of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> is <hi>Logick</hi> in a poſture of Arguing. In the Triangle on the left hand of the Moſaical <hi>Law</hi> is <hi>Muſick,</hi> with her Antick Lyre and Paper of Muſick-notes on her knee, with a <hi>Genius</hi> by her (a little within the next Circle) playing on a <hi>Flute,</hi> being the Emblem of the most ancient Muſick. <hi>Dramatick Poetry</hi> with a <hi>Vizor,</hi> repreſenting <hi>Comedy,</hi> a <hi>bloudy Dagger</hi> for <hi>Tragedy,</hi> the <hi>Reed Pipe</hi> for <hi>Paſtoral.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the midſt of theſe Squares and Triangles (as deſcending from above) is the Figure of <hi>Truth</hi> ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on a <hi>Cloud;</hi> in one hand ſhe holds a <hi>Palm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branch,</hi> (the Emblem of Victory) in the other the <hi>Sun,</hi> whoſe Brightneſs enlightens all the <hi>Circle</hi> of Figures, and is ſo bright, that it ſometimes hides the face of her ſelf to us that are below.</p>
               <p>Over the Entrance of the Front of the <hi>Theater</hi> are Three Figures tumbling down; firſt <hi>Envy</hi> with her <hi>Snaky hairs, Squint eyes, Haggs breſts, Pale ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemous Complexion, Strong, but ugly Limbs,</hi> and <hi>Riveling skin,</hi> frighted from above by the ſight of <hi>Pallas</hi> her Shield with the <hi>Gorgon</hi>'s head in it, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt which ſhe would oppoſe the biggeſt of her Snakes, but her fall is ſo precipitous that ſhe hath no command of her Arms.</p>
