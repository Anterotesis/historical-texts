            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <l>YOu beauteous Ladies great and ſmall,</l>
                  <l>I write unto you one and all,</l>
                  <l>Whereby that you may underſtand</l>
                  <l>What I have ſuffered in this Land.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>I was by birth a Lady fair,</l>
                  <l>My Fathers chief and onely Heir.</l>
                  <l>But when my good old Father dy'd,</l>
                  <l>Then was I made a young Knights Bride.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>And then my Love built me a Bower,</l>
                  <l>Bedeckt with many a fragrant flower;</l>
                  <l>A braver Bower you never did ſée,</l>
                  <l>Then my true Lover built for me.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>But there came Thieves late in the night,</l>
                  <l>They broke my Bower, and ſlew my Knight,</l>
                  <l>And after that my Knight was ſlain,</l>
                  <l>I could no longer there remain:</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>For my ſervants all from me did fly,</l>
                  <l>I'th midſt of my extremity,</l>
                  <l>And left me by my ſelf alone,</l>
                  <l>With a heart more cold then any ſtone.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Yet though my heart was full of grief &amp; care,</l>
                  <l>Heaven would not ſuffer me to deſpair,</l>
                  <l>Wherefore in haſte I chang'd my name,</l>

                  <l>My Doublet, Hoſe, and Beaver Hat,</l>
                  <l>And a golden Band about my Neck.</l>

                  <l>With a ſilver Raypier by my ſide,</l>

               <lg>
                  <l>At laſt the King from hunting came,</l>
                  <l>And preſently upon the ſame</l>
                  <l>He called for the good old man:</l>
                  <l>And thus to ſpeak the King began.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>What news, what news, old man (quoth he)</l>
                  <l>What news haſt thou for to tell me;</l>
                  <l>Brave news the old man then did ſay,</l>
                  <l>Swéet <hi>William</hi> is a Lady gay.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>If this be true thou telleſt me,</l>
                  <l>Ile make thée a Lord of high degrée:</l>
                  <l>But if thy words do prove a lye,</l>
                  <l>Thou ſhalt be hang'd up preſently.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>But when the truth the King had found,</l>
                  <l>His joyes did more and more abound;</l>
                  <l>According as the old man did ſay,</l>
                  <l>Swéet <hi>William</hi> was a Lady gay.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Wherefore the King without delay</l>
                  <l>Put her on glorious rich array,</l>
                  <l>And upon her head a Crown of Gold,</l>
                  <l>Which was moſt famous to behold.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>And then for fear of further ſtrife,</l>
                  <l>He took ſwéet <hi>William</hi> to his Wife:</l>
                  <l>The like before was never ſéen,</l>
                  <l>A Serving-man to be a Quéen.</l>
