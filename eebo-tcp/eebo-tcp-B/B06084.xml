            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A LETTER <hi>Written to my</hi> LORD RUSSEL IN NEWGATE, The Twentieth of <hi>July,</hi> 1683.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>MY LORD,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Was heartily glad to ſee your Lordſhip this Morning in that calm and devout temper at the Receiving of the Bleſſed Sacrament; but Peace of minde unleſs it be well-grounded will avail little: And becauſe tranſient Diſcourſe many times hath little effect for want of time to weigh and conſider it, therefore in tender compaſſion of your Lordſhips Caſe, and from all the good will that one man can bear to another, I do humbly offer to your Lordſhips deliberate thoughts theſe following Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations concerning the points of Reſiſtance. If our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and Rights ſhould be invaded, as your Lordſhip puts the Caſe, concerning which I underſtand by Dr. <hi>B.</hi> that your Lordiſhip had once received Satisfaction, and am ſorry to find a change.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That the Chriſtian Religion doth plainly forbid the Reſiſtance of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That though our Religion be Eſtabliſhed by Law, (which your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip urges as a difference between our Caſe, and that of the Primitive Chriſtians) yet in the ſame Law which Eſtabliſhes our Religion it is declared, That it is not Lawful upon any pretence whatſoever to take up Arms, &amp;<hi>c.</hi> Beſides that, there is a particular Law declaring the power of the <hi>Militia</hi> to be ſolely in the King. And that ties the hands of Subjects, though the Law of Nature and the General Rules of Scripture had left us at liberty; which I believe they do not, becauſe the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Peace of Humane Society could not well ſubſiſt upon theſe Terms.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Your Lordſhips opinion is contrary to the declared Doctrine of all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Churches; and though ſome particular Perſons have taught otherwiſe, yet they have been contradicted herein and condemned for it by the Generality of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants. And I beg your Lordſhip to conſider how it will agree with an avowed aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting of the Proteſtant Religion, to go contrary to the General Doctrine of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants. My end in this is to convince your Lordſhip that you are in a very Great and Dangerous Miſtake, and being ſo convinced, that which before was a Sin of Ignorance, will appear of much more heynous Nature, as in Truth it is, and call for a very particular and deep Repentance; which if your Lordſhip ſincerely exerciſe upon the ſight of your Error, by a Penitent Acknowledgment of it to God and Men, you will not only obtain Forgiveneſs of God, but prevent a mighty Scandal to the Reformed Religion. I am very loath to give your Lordſhip any diſquiet in the Diſtreſs you are in, which I commiſerate from my heart, but am much more concerned, that you do not leave the World in a Deluſion and falſe Peace, to the hinderance ot your Eternal Happineſs. I heartily Pray for you, and beſeech your Lordſhip to believe that I am with the greateſt Sincerity and Compaſſion in the World,</p>
