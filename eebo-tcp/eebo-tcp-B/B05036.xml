            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A TRUE COPY of the PAPER Delivered By <hi>Brigadier Rookwood,</hi> TO THE SHERIFF At TYBURN, the Place of EXECUTION. <hi>April.</hi> 29. 1696.</head>
            <p>WIlls of Dying Men, were ever Sacred, and as ſuch ought to be fulfill'd. The Sufferer a Man of Deeds, more than Words, by way of Will made to the People, conſign'd his Thoughts to Paper; The Paper to the Sheriff to be Publiſh'd. To this Paper as he told the ſaid Sheriff he referr'd himſelf; And that he might not fail of his Intent, ſome days before his Execution, he had Tranſmitted a Copy of it to a Friend, who ſince the Sheriff has ſo long fail'd of his Truſt and Duty, reſolves to ſupply it by doing His. Take it therefore in Print. Mr. She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riff cannot but Own it to be the ſame Word for Word.</p>
            <div type="letter">
               <head>The PAPER.</head>
               <p>HAving committed the Juſtice of my Cauſe and recommended my Soul to God, on whoſe Mercies, through the Merits of Jeſus Chriſt, I wholly Caſt my ſelf; I had once reſolv'd to die in Silence; But ſecond Thoughts of my Duty to others, Chiefly to my True and Liege Sovereign K. <hi>James,</hi> moved me to leave this behind me.</p>
               <p>I do therefore, with all Truth and Sincerity, Declare and Avow, I never Knew, Saw, or Heard, of any Order or Commiſſion from K. <hi>James</hi> for the Aſſaſſinating of the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> and Attacking his Guards; But I am Certainly inform'd, he had rejected Propoſals of That Naure, when made unto him.</p>
               <p>Nor do I think He Knew the leaſt of the Particular Deſign of Attack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Guards at his Landing, in which I was engag'd as a Soldier, by my Immediate Commander, (much againſt my Judgment,) But his Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier I was, and as ſuch I was to Obey and Act.</p>
               <p>Near twelve years, I have ſerv'd my True King and Maſter K. <hi>James,</hi> and freely now lay down my Life in his Cauſe. I ever Abhor'd a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous Action even to an Enemy. If it be a Guilt to have Complied with what I thought, and ſtill think to have been my Duty, I am Guilty. <hi>No other Guilt do I Own.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As I beg all to forgive me, ſo I forgive all from my Heart, even the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> who as a Soldier ought to have conſider'd my Caſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he Sign'd the Warrant for my Death. I pray God to open his Eyes and render him Senſible of the Much Blood from all Parts Crying out againſt him, ſo to prevent a Heavier Execution Hanging over his Head, than what he Inflicts on me.</p>
