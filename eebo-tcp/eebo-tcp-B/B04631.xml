         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>ON THE Second Entertainment of the Batchelours BY THE RIGHT HONOURABLE The Lord Mayor of the City of London, <hi>SEPTEMBER</hi> viij. MDCLXIX.</head>
            <lg>
               <l>NOW, Gallants, Much good do't ye. But d' you hear</l>
               <l>The News abroad? I heard one juſt now ſwear</l>
               <l>That all th' unmarry'd Ladies, that were met</l>
               <l>To ſee your Pomp, are fighting in the ſtreet.</l>
               <l>Th' have pin'd away, e're ſince their former ſight,</l>
               <l>With the <hi>Green-Sickneſs,</hi> all; but now they'l ſight.</l>
               <l>While this Mans Face was prais'd, and that Mans Foot,</l>
               <l>One Gallants Perruque, and anothers Sute,</l>
               <l>A jealous humour took 'em all i'th' pate,</l>
               <l>And th' are by th' ears, none knows for whom, or what.</l>
               <l>'Tis ſome of You; pray think upon their Caſes:</l>
               <l>Unleſs You part 'em, they'l ſpoil all their Faces.</l>
               <l>They rave (alas!) to think their deſtinies</l>
               <l>Have Damn'd 'em Maids, till You'l be otherwiſe.</l>
               <l>Th' are tantaliz'd; what would you have 'm do?</l>
               <l>They neither can enjoy your Feaſt, nor You.</l>
               <l>Theſe <hi>Sabine</hi> Ladies came with longing Eyes</l>
               <l>To view your more than <hi>Roman</hi> Gallantries:</l>
               <l>And now they'l prove th' inverted Story true,</l>
               <l>And will (I fear) commit a Rape on You. —</l>
               <l>— But I'l no longer 'fright you, ben't dejected:</l>
               <l>'Twas but to try you, how you ſtood affected.</l>
               <l>The Ladies thank you for their Noble View:</l>
               <l>The Men, both for the ſight of Them, and You.</l>
               <l>You've beg'd th' young City Ladies this daies Play:</l>
               <l>But they muſt Faſt upon their Holy-day.</l>
               <l>They were both gallant Sights; but 'troth 'tis pity,</l>
               <l>Maids may Adorn, but ne're can Make a City:</l>
               <l>And Maids and Batchelours are a finer ſight</l>
               <l>For a Summers Day, than for a Winters Night.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>'Pray, Gallants, think upon't; but for to day</l>
               <l>Eat, drink, be jovial: — let the Ladies ſtay.</l>
               <l>If to their Healths you'l drink a Glaſs or two,</l>
               <l>I dare be bold they'l do as much for You.</l>
               <l>See all before you, you can wiſh; and here</l>
               <l>You need no Horn, but that of Plenty, fear.</l>
               <l>Such ſtore of Ammunition is able</l>
               <l>To 'fright one with th' Artill'ry of the Table.</l>
               <l>Tables fo nobly fill'd, as if laſt Fleet</l>
               <l>Had brought home no Commodity, but Meat:</l>
               <l>And Wines ſo rich and coſtly, as if there was</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Cleopatra</hi>'s Pearl diſſolv'd in ev'ry glaſs.</l>
               <l>Two more ſuch Feaſts were able to undo</l>
               <l>A Land, and bankrupt all the World, but You.</l>
               <l>This very Sight would make a Miſer bold</l>
               <l>To wiſh (like <hi>Midas</hi>) he could eat his Gold.</l>
               <l>A <hi>Puritans</hi> eternal Lungs would waſte</l>
               <l>To ſay a Grace, of length for ſuch a Feaſt:</l>
               <l>He'd leave his Faſts, though ne're ſo great a Sinner,</l>
               <l>And keep a long Thankſgiving, for the Dinner.</l>
               <l>Thoſe nauſeous ſtomachs o'th' preciſer Ones</l>
               <l>Bark at thoſe Tables, where they'd pick the Bones.</l>
               <l>But Envy, no not Theirs, can dare to call</l>
               <l>What's Noble by the name of Prodigal.</l>
               <l>'Tis free from all Exceſs, as full of State:</l>
               <l>All Great Mens Actions, like Themſelves, are Great.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>He from whoſe only Pattern may be ſeen</l>
               <l>What MAYORS muſt be, and what they ſhould have been:</l>
               <l>Whoſe early Vig'lance keeps th' Rebellious in,</l>
               <l>That they want Opportunity to ſin:</l>
               <l>Who ſtays not calmly till the Law is broke,</l>
               <l>But keeps Men ſtom't, his Eye prevents his ſtroke:</l>
               <l>Who rouzes Juſtice from her ſleeping hole,</l>
               <l>Is both the Body of the Law, and Soul:</l>
               <l>Who weighs things with an equal ſteady hand,</l>
               <l>And to whoſe Teſt Juſtice her ſelf may ſtand:</l>
               <l>He who does this, and more wou'd you but know,</l>
               <l>What ample boon Heaven does on him beſtow?</l>
               <l>H' has <hi>Adam</hi>'s bleſſings in his ſingle life,</l>
               <l>His Wiſdom, Inn'cence, Honour, and no VVife.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Let <hi>London</hi> lift up her recruited Head:</l>
               <l>She's New-born, and her Father is a Maid.</l>
               <l>May th' <hi>Omen</hi> hold, and She forever be</l>
               <l>Chaſt as a Virgin, as a Virgin Free.</l>
               <l>When She's again with this daies ſplendour bleſt,</l>
               <l>Make this brave Pattern th' <hi>Epo'che</hi> to the reſt.</l>
               <l>But may no <hi>Poetaſter</hi> of the Times</l>
               <l>Send in Sedition crouch'd in Joking Rimes:</l>
               <l>Still may all thoſe that rail ad <hi>Biſhopſgate</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Feel an eternal <hi>Bedlam</hi> in their Pate.</l>
               <l>For next to ſuch a PRINCE, and ſuch a Day,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>London</hi> can only wiſh, She ever may</l>
