         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The CASE of the City of London, In Reference to DEBT to The ORPHANS, and Others.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Y the Cuſtom of <hi>LONDON,</hi> confirmed by divers Acts of Parliament, the <hi>Lord Mayor</hi> and <hi>Court of Aldermen</hi> are Guardians of the <hi>ORPHANS</hi> of all Freemen of the ſaid City, and have the Care and Government of Them, their Eſtates, and Marriages; and have a Cuſtomary Juriſdiction by the Name of <hi>The Court of Orphans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By that Cuſtom the <hi>Executors</hi> of every the ſaid Citizens are bound, either to find ſufficient Sureties to the <hi>Chamberlain</hi> for the <hi>Orphans Portions,</hi> who is a ſole Body Corporate for that purpoſe: Or otherwiſe, to pay the ſame into the <hi>Chamber</hi> of <hi>London</hi> as a Depoſit, to be kept for them until Security be found, or their reſpective Portions become due; and ſuch Maintenance to be allowed to the <hi>Orphans,</hi> as the Cuſtom directed, by the Name of <hi>Finding-Mony.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In regard the Eſtates of the Citizens were moſtly Perſonal, and liable to be waſted by Widows and Executors, That Court hath been found by the Experience of many Ages, to be a moſt neceſſary and effectual means to preſerve the Eſtates and Children of the Citizens; and the Protection and Preſervation of the Perſons, Eſtates and Marriages of many Thouſands of <hi>Orphans,</hi> are owing to the Care of that Ancient Court.</p>
            <p>The <hi>CHAMBER</hi> of <hi>London</hi> (being the Receipt of all the Cities Revenue, and the Treaſury wherein all the Portions of <hi>Orphans</hi> were to have been depoſited, as in a Sacred Treaſury) had for many Ages a moſt unqueſtionable Credit, very Great Sums of Mony being continually Receiving in, and Paying out: And the <hi>Chamber</hi> had Sufficient to Anſwer to every <hi>Orphan,</hi> and all other Debts, until about the beginning of the late Troubles between <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But about the Beginning of thoſe Troubles, divers Debts owing to the City, amounting to near <hi>Thirty Thouſand Pounds,</hi> became deſperate: And about the ſame time, the City in compliance with His late Majeſty King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, having Advanced to him, and Expended for him, about <hi>Forty Thouſand Pounds</hi> more, the City became Indebted in the Year 1638, in <hi>Seventy Thouſand Pounds.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ever ſince the ſaid Year, the <hi>Chamber</hi> paid <hi>Interest</hi> for the ſaid Debt, and the then Government of the City very Improvidently allowed the Executors of the Citizens, to bring into the <hi>Chamber</hi> Orphans Portions upon Intereſt, which ought to have been only depoſited by ſuch Executors as could not, or would not give the <hi>Chamber</hi> Security for them: And by that means a great Caſh was kept in the <hi>Chamber,</hi> of which no profit was made; and out of the ſame, <hi>Intereſt</hi> was conſtantly paid for the ſaid Debt, as alſo for the ſaid Portions: So that by a true Account, Mony being taken in at Intereſt to pay Intereſt, the ſaid Debt of <hi>Seventy Thouſand Pounds,</hi> in <hi>FIFTY AND FO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>R YEARS,</hi> hath increaſed to above Five times that Sum: And the Intereſt paid alſo to <hi>Orphans,</hi> contrary to the Cuſtom of the City, hath made up the reſt of the preſent Debt.</p>
            <p>The Cities Ancient great Revenues, given by Benefactors for the ſupport of its Government, might in ſome meaſure have prevented the vaſt Encreaſe of its Debt; If the Troubles of the Kingdom had not happen'd, and the Rebellion of <hi>Ireland</hi> firſt broke out, and afterwards a Civil War here enſued, whereby the City was conſtrained (by the Powers unto which they were Subject) to lay out ſeveral Sums of Mony upon divers Occaſions, as the prevailing Powers Commanded. All which, together wth their great Loſſes and Diminution of their Revenue by the <hi>Iriſh Rebellion,</hi> Augmented their Debt, and whilſt the City laboured under the intollerable Burthen of Intereſt for <hi>Orphans Portions,</hi> Unduly and Improvidently (as is before mentioned) brought upon th<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>m, the dreadful Fire of <hi>London</hi> happen'd, and conſumed moſt part of the Cities Revenue, which conſiſted in <hi>Houſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs the Credit of the Chamber continued, and Payments both of Principal and Intereſt were anſvered until the <hi>Quo Warranto</hi> brought againſt the City, to deſtroy their Being: Which not only put them to great Charge, but ſo ruined their Credit, that all Payments into the Chamber ceaſed, and the Body Corporate and all its legal Powers (until this preſent happy Revolution) was taken to be utterly deſtroyed: Whereby the Duties of Waterbailage and Tronage, or Kings Beam, and many other ancient Duties and Profits belonging to the Corporation, were in a great meaſure loſt, and the Intereſt of a vaſt Debt in the mean time continually growing, the City became diſabled to anſwer the ſame.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding for the Reaſons aforeſaid, the City hath not received any <hi>Orphans</hi> Mony into the Chamber ſince <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> 1683; yet ſince that time, there has been ſuch Care to get in Debts owing to the City, and to improve their Revenue, That they have paid to all <hi>Poor Orphans</hi> (whoſe Portionsin the Chamber of <hi>London</hi> exceeded not <hi>Fifty and Five Pounds</hi>) Their Whole Debt, amounting to <hi>Ten Thouſand Six Hundred Seventy Three Pounds, Two Shillings and Eight Pence;</hi> And have further Paid to the <hi>Orphans,</hi> and Others, for Intereſt, <hi>One Hundred Thouſand, Five Hundred and Fifty Pounds.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the Preſent Court of Aldermen (finding it impoſſible for the Government of this City to be ſupported under the burthen of ſo great a Debt) have thought it their Duty, from time to time, to apply themſelves to the Wiſdom of the Parliament, for proper Remedies to ſuch a Grievance: In regard it is the Caſe of the Capital City of the Kingdom, in whoſe Support and Welfare the whole Nation is much concerned; And this Court of Aldermen humbly hope, that it will be rightly urderſtood, that the Debt has not been incurred, nor augmented by their Default, Negligence, or Expence; They ſerving the City freely at their own Coſt, without Eating or Drinking at the Cities Charge, as has been untruly ſuggeſted.</p>
            <p>And they have been and are unceſſant in their Cares and Endeavours, to make the utmoſt Improvement of all that belongs to the City, only for the Benefit of the <hi>Orphans:</hi> And are now humble Solicitors to the <hi>Parliament,</hi> not for any Intereſt or Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of their own; but for the Relief of the Diſtreſſed, and the Quiet and Support of the Government.</p>
            <p>And they ſhall humbly crave leave to ſhew unto the <hi>Parliament</hi> (if they may be admited thereunto) wherein they conceive this City to be wronged and deprived of divers Ancient Rights and Cuſtoms belonging to it: Which being Reſtored and Eſtabliſhed by Act of <hi>Parliament,</hi> will greatly help towards the Payment of the ſaid Debt, or of a reaſonable perpetual Intereſt for the ſame, as the Wiſdom of the <hi>Parliament</hi> ſhall think moſt convenient.</p>
