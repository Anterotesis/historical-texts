            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THere happened near this place ſo ſtrange and ſo ſad an accident that I think the like hath been ſeldome known. On Saturday laſt about ten of the Clock in the day, we heard much Thunder within 15 miles from hence, made many great brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in a Mountain, and ſuch ſpouts of water fell upon the places ſo broken up, that the Flood hurri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the looſſened Earth with it to the bottom, and ſwell'd a Brook which ran there, and comes into the Rivers by this place, ſo ſuddenly that it carried away all that ſtood before it, People who lived near the Bauck had not time to get out of their houſes, but their goods, houſes and all were ſwept along with it and periſhed, the Beaſt that fed near it were loſt, the very Fiſh were ſtifled by the Earth which the Currant brought with it great quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Salmon, Trouts, and Lamperies, which Ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſaw here before, even the Eeles that live in the Mud were choked and thrown dead upon the Shore, and I do not believe there is one Fish alive in the River from the Mountains to the Sea, my curioſity took me yeſterday to the place where this Deluge began, and truely I was amazed to ſee a Mountain torn in above ten ſeveral places and all the low Ground by the River for ten miles together, covered with the Ruines the Corn-fields buried, and the people poking in the mud and Earth for the Bodies of their Friends and of their Cattel I cannot yet learn exactly how many have periſhed but by the accounts that are given there are loſt in ſeveral places fifty Souls and abundance of Cattle.</p>
