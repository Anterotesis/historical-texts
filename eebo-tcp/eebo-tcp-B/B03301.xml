            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>To an Excellent New Tune.</opener>
            <lg>
               <l>ON <hi>Enfield Common</hi> I met a Woman,</l>
               <l>a bringing of her Water to the Town,</l>
               <l>Said <hi>I</hi> fair Maiden, you're heavy laden,</l>
               <l>I'll light and give you eaſe in a green Gown,</l>
               <l>Says ſhe, 'tis good Sir, to ſtir the Blood Sir,</l>
               <l>for the Green-ſickneſs, Friend, will make me like it,</l>
               <l>Then in a minute I left my Ginnet,</l>
               <l>and went aſide with her into a Thicket,</l>
               <l>Then with her leave there, a doſe I gave her,</l>
               <l>ſhe ſtraight confeſs'd her Sickneſs I did nick it.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>I went to leave her, but this did grieve her,</l>
               <l>for panting on the Graſs ſhe did, complain,</l>
               <l>Saying Phyſician, my ſick Condition,</l>
               <l>I fear will ſuddenly return again,</l>
               <l>If you deny me, and don't ſupply me,</l>
               <l>with many Potions of your ſweeteſt pleaſure,</l>
               <l>Then prithee Gallant improve thy Tallant,</l>
               <l>ſince we have Opportunity and Leiſure,</l>
               <l>With ſuch like Greeting my pritty Sweeting,</l>
               <l>ſhe ſeem'd to preſs upon me out of meaſure.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>'Twas ſummer weather, we ſat together,</l>
               <l>and chatted all the pleaſant afternoon,</l>
               <l>No one was near us, to over hear us,</l>
               <l>at length I ſaid I'd put my Pipes in Tune,</l>
               <l>To give a Gliſter, with that I Kiſs'd her,</l>
               <l>ſhe cry'd another fit does round me hover,</l>
               <l>With the green Ruſhes I'll vail my Bluſhes,</l>
               <l>for in my Cheeks I know you may diſcover,</l>
               <l>What's my deſire; Love never Tire,</l>
               <l>for Oh! I long, I long to be a Mother.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>With that I told her, that I would hold her</l>
               <l>a Guinea to a Groat it ſhould be ſo,</l>
               <l>In nine months after, a Son or Daughter,</l>
               <l>will be your lucky lot Dear love I know,</l>
               <l>Quoth ſhe you vapour, and draw your Rapour,</l>
               <l>but yet methinks too ſoon you ſeem to tire,</l>
               <l>I'll lay a ſhilling if you are willing,</l>
               <l>that nine Months hence I have not my deſire,</l>
               <l>Except you'll venter, once more to enter,</l>
               <l>Alas! the name of Mother I admire.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Becauſe I'd eaſe her, and fully pleaſe her,</l>
               <l>I took a Lodging for my <hi>Enfield</hi> Laſs,</l>
               <l>Who was a Beauty and knew her Duty,</l>
               <l>the night we did in youthful pleaſures paſs,</l>
               <l>With melting Bliſſes and Charming Kiſſes,</l>
               <l>on downy Beds ſecure from Wind or Weather,</l>
               <l>And in the Morning by days adorning,</l>
               <l>we 'roſe and drank a Glaſs of Wine together,</l>
               <l>With joys I crown'd her, for then I found her,</l>
               <l>to have a heart far lighter than a feather.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>I having cur'd her, likewiſe aſſur'd her,</l>
               <l>if e're it was my luck to come that way,</l>
               <l>I'd pawn my honour to call upon her,</l>
               <l>but for that time I could no longer ſtay;</l>
               <l>The loving creature, of pure good nature,</l>
               <l>ſhe gave me twenty kiſſes when we parted,</l>
               <l>Becauſe ſhe never had found ſuch favour,</l>
               <l>in loves ſoft pleaſures to be ſo diverted,</l>
               <l>Then ſtraight I mounted, for why I counted,</l>
               <l>'twas time I had her company deſerted.</l>
