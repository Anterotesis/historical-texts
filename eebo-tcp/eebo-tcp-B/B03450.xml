         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <q>Whom the Lord hath indeed made a worthy Inſtrument unto us, and among us, and yet I hope ſhall unto many more, and who is ſafe in the Hand of Him that holdeth the Seven Stars, and the Seven Golden Candleſticks in his Right Hand: And all thy Malicious Reviling, and Slanderous Defamation of him, cannot diminiſh any thing from that true Honour wherewith the Lord hath Honour'd him, and other Faithful Labourers with him, whom the Lord hath raiſed up, in this Day of the Appearance of his Great and Mighty Power.</q>

               <p>Now can <hi>G. Keith</hi> in Truth and Sincerity ſay more of and for, 1ſt, That Religion he now Profeſſeth. 2dly, Of thoſe People he is now joyned unto. 3dly, Of the Preachers and Publiſhers of their Faith. 4thly, Of any Man or Men amongſt them, then he hath of <hi>G. Fox,</hi> and other Faithful Labourers with him among the <hi>Quakers?</hi> I'ts left to the Judgment of all Serious Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>'And all good Chriſtians (as in the Poſtſcript to <hi>Serious Call</hi>) are deſir'd to have this Sheet in their 'Houſes, and to ſhow it to their Neighbours as they have opportunity, that they may ſee the Chriſtianity of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> and <hi>G. Keith</hi> alſo, <note n="*" place="margin">Whilſt a Quaker.</note> and enquire if ever they ſee, heard or read of any Man that hath done like him, that pretended to be ſo many Years ſound, as to the Fundamentals of Chriſtianity, and all the Doctrines of the Chriſtian Religion, and that hath made ſo bold with the Name of the Lord, and pretended to ſuch Zeal and Concern for God, to contradict himſelf, and feignedly to ſay, He judgeth it his <hi>Duty</hi> from true <hi>Conviction,</hi> and out of real Love to <hi>Truth,</hi> to ſay and unſay, and ſo confidently Aſſert he doth it freely and humbly; Can you think this is a Teacher ſent or called of God, commiſſionated by Chriſt, guided by his Spirit, and fit to Follow, or to Preach up that Diſpenſation, of which it's ſaid, <hi>every Man ſhall ſpeak the Truth to his Neighbour?</hi> And are the ſo called Doctors, and Rectors, and thoſe that abet him, to be commended for their Wiſdom? And do they thereby Demonſtrate that they have, are in, or are guided by, the Wiſdom of God, and his Holy Spirit (by which ſo many as are the Sons of God are led) in their joyning with this Man? It's hoped, if you that follow <hi>George Keith.</hi> &amp;c. will duly and well conſider theſe things, you will not only Renounce him, but conſider that his evil Works, and thoſe that Joyn with him therein, ought to be forſaken, and that it wil be more for your Profit, and tend more to your Inward Peace and Chriſtian Reputation, to hearken to the Voice of Chriſt in your own Hearts, and to mind that Light by which all things that are reproved are made manifeſt, and believe in him who ſaid, <hi>I am the Light of the World,</hi> and exhorted to <hi>learn of him,</hi> who will teach you <hi>freely;</hi> and no longer to follow him and ſuch Preachers, if you would be Chriſtians indeed, and then it's hoped you will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, <hi>viz.</hi> as <hi>G.

                  <q>It had been more Manly and ſeemingly Chriſtian, (for <hi>G. K.</hi> and his Abettors) or any others of their Sect or Society, <hi>fairly</hi> to have ſtated the <hi>Quakers Principles,</hi> and then to have refuted them by the beſt or ſtrongeſt Arguments they could find: But this none of them have done [and he truly hath ſaid, <hi>They never can</hi>] nor did I ever ſee to this day, any <hi>one Writer,</hi> that did write againſt the <hi>Quakers,</hi> that did fairly ſtate their <hi>Principles,</hi> but miſerably <hi>be-lyed</hi> and <hi>abuſed</hi> them, (as <hi>G. K.</hi> hath) either by affirming things to be their Principles which were not, <hi>or by ſo unfairly Repreſenting</hi> and <hi>Wreſting</hi> the words of our Honeſt Friends, by their <hi>Addings</hi> and <hi>Diminiſhings,</hi> that they could not at all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge them as ſuch; <hi>all</hi> which is a manifeſt Evidence of the <hi>Weakneſs</hi> and <hi>Badneſs</hi> of their <hi>Cauſe,</hi> as well as of that evil <hi>Conſcience</hi> that is in them, when they uſe ſuch <hi>unlawful ways</hi> and <hi>means</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend themſelves, or to oppugn others.</q>
