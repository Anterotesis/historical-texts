            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>And I ſhall tell what lately did befall,</l>
               <l>At Exeter, a place in <hi>Devonſhire,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>The like whereof of late you nere did hear.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>At the laſt Aſsizes held at <hi>Exeter,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Three Aged Women that Impriſoned were</l>
               <l>For Witches, and that many had deſtroy'd;</l>
               <l>Were thither brought in order to be try'd.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>For Witchcraft, that Old Wicked Sin,</l>
               <l>Which they for long time had continued in:</l>
               <l>And joyn'd with Satan, to deſtroy the good,</l>
               <l>Hurt Innocents, and ſhed their harmleſs blood.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But now it moſt apparent does appear,</l>
               <l>that they will now for ſuch their deeds pay dear:</l>
               <l>For Satan having lull'd their Souls aſleep,</l>
               <l>Refuſes Company with them to keep.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>A known deceiver he long time has been,</l>
               <l>To help Poor Mortals into dangerous Sin;</l>
               <l>Thereby to cut them off, that ſo they may,</l>
               <l>Be plung'd in Hell, and there he made his Prey.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>So theſe Malicious Women at the laſt,</l>
               <l>Having done miſchiefs, were by Iuſtice caſt:</l>
               <l>For it appear'd they Children had deſtroy'd,</l>
               <l>Lamed Cattel, and the Aged much annoy'd.</l>

            <lg>
               <l>Having Familiars always at their beck,</l>
               <l>Their Wicked Rage on Mortals for to wreck:</l>
               <l>It being prov'd they uſed Wicked Charms,</l>
               <l>To Murther Men, and bring about ſad harms.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>And that they had about their Bodys ſtrange</l>
               <l>And Proper Tokens of their Wicked Change:</l>
               <l>As Pledges that to have their cruel will,</l>
               <l>Their Souls they gave unto the Prince of Hell.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The Country round where they did live came in,</l>
               <l>And all at once their ſad complaints begin:</l>
               <l>One loſt a Child, the other loſt a Kine,</l>
               <l>This his brave Horſes, that his hopeful Swine.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>One had his Wife bewitched, the other his Friend,</l>
               <l>Becauſe in ſome things they the Witch offend:</l>
               <l>For which they labour under cruel pain,</l>
               <l>In vain ſeek remedy, but none can gain.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But Roar in cruel ſort, and loudly cry,</l>
               <l>Deſtroy the Witch, and end our miſery:</l>
               <l>Some uſed Charms by <hi>Mountabanks</hi> ſet down,</l>
               <l>Thoſe cheating <hi>Quacks,</hi> that ſwarm in every Town.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But all's in vain, no reſt at all they find,</l>
               <l>For why? all Witches to cruelty are enclin'd:</l>
               <l>And do delight to hear ſad dying groans,</l>
               <l>And ſuch laments, as wou'd pierre Marble Stones.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But now the Hand of Heaven has found them out,</l>
               <l>And they to Iuſtice muſt pay Lives, paſt doubt:</l>
               <l>One of these Wicked Wretches did confeſs,</l>
               <l>She Four Score Years of Age was, and no leſs.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>And that ſhe had deſerved long before,</l>

               <l>For the great miſchiefs ſhe ſo oft had done,</l>
               <l>And wondered that her Life ſo long had run.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>She ſaid the Devil came with her along,</l>
               <l>Through Crouds of People, and bid her be ſtrong:</l>
               <l>And ſhe no hand ſhould have, but like a Lyer,</l>
               <l>At the Priſon Door he fled, and ne're came nigh her.</l>
