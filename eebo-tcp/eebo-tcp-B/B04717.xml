            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <l>IN <hi>Ninivie</hi> old <hi>Toby</hi> dwelt,</l>
            <l>an aged man, and blind was he,</l>
            <l>And much affliction he had felt,</l>
            <l>which brought him unto miſery:</l>
            <l>He had by <hi>Anna,</hi> his true wife,</l>
            <l>one only Son, and eke no more,</l>
            <l>Which was the comfort of his life,</l>
            <l>and he by him did ſet great ſtore.</l>
            <l>He brought him up ſo vertuouſly</l>
            <l>in true obedience, and in awe,</l>
            <l>And every day he did apply,</l>
            <l>to fear the Lord and keep his law:</l>
            <l>Upon a time it came to paſs,</l>
            <l>he call'd his Son to him with ſpeed,</l>
            <l>And thus to him theſe words did frame:</l>
            <l>
               <hi>My Son</hi> (qd. he) <hi>thou know'ſt my need,</hi>
            </l>

            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>For I did lend him long ago</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>ten Talents on his only band.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>My Father (<hi>dear</hi> Tobias <hi>ſaid</hi>)</l>
            <l>at your command ſtrait will I go,</l>
            <l>How ſhall I get the money paid?</l>
            <l>ſeeing the man I ne'er did know.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Take then the writings here with thee,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>which is ſufficient to be ſeen;</hi>
            </l>
            <l>

            <l>A Guide <hi>Tobias</hi> ſoon had got,</l>
            <l>An <hi>Angel</hi> in the ſhape of man,</l>
            <l>Which thing he did not know God wot,</l>
            <l>the Lord had ſo appointed then.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Tobias</hi> with his bleſſed Guide,</l>
            <l>went on his journey thus with ſpeed,</l>
            <l>Until they came to <hi>Tigris</hi> ſide,</l>
            <l>at the fair Flood they did abide:</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Tobias</hi> he did go waſh him there,</l>
            <l>by reaſon of the Summers heat,</l>
            <l>A mighty Fiſh put him to fear,</l>
            <l>which leapt out of the waters deep.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Cut up the fiſh,</hi> the Angel ſaid,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>and keep the liver, heart, and gall,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>to do the ſame be not afraid,</hi>

            <l>
               <hi>great cures there ſhall be done withal,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>When this was done away thry went,</l>
            <l>and coming near their journeys end,</l>
            <l>We'll lodge to night, the Angel ſaid,</l>
            <l>with <hi>Raguel</hi> thy Father's friend,</l>

            <l>and alſo of a vertuous life,</l>
            <l>And when we come unto that place,</l>

            <l>the tears fell down from <hi>Sarahs</hi> eyes.</l>
            <l>A Pan of Coals he brought with him,</l>
            <l>the Fiſhes heart and liver there;</l>
            <l>Within the fire he did caſt in,</l>
            <l>which caſt a ſavour every where:</l>
            <l>And by that ſweet and pleaſant ſmell</l>
            <l>the wicked Spirit was diſplac'd,</l>
            <l>Within that room he could not dwell,</l>
            <l>but out he went in haſte.</l>
            <l>In bed they laid the beauteous Bride,</l>
            <l>the Chamber-door was ſhut therefore;</l>
            <l>Young <hi>Toby</hi> lying by her ſide,</l>
            <l>whom he did think to ſee no more,</l>
            <l>And therefore Raguel in the night</l>
            <l>for him before had made a Grave:</l>
            <l>And to his wife he went and ſaid,</l>
            <l>there is no means his life to ſave.</l>
            <l>One of the Maidens ſend, quoth he,</l>

            <l>When <hi>Raguel</hi> heard of this thing,</l>
            <l>he did rejoyce exceedingly.</l>
            <l>For joy he made a ſolemn feaſt,</l>
            <l>the bridal fourteen days they kept,</l>
            <l>There came many a friendly Gueſt,</l>

            <l>
               <hi>Azarius</hi> went ſtraight way,</l>

            <l>Rejoycing at his marriage day,</l>
            <l>and paid the money that he ought.</l>
            <l>But yet old <hi>Toby</hi> and his wife,</l>
            <l>did all this while in ſorrow dwell,</l>
            <l>They thought their Son had loſt his life,</l>
            <l>and nothing could their grief expell,</l>
            <l>His aged mother every day</l>
            <l>did watch the High-way ſide,</l>
            <l>And for his welfare oft did pray.</l>
            <l>no meat nor drink ſhe could abide.</l>
            <l>But when the wedding ended was,</l>
