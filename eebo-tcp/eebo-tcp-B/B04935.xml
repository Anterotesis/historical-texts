            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <l>THou Child of Sin and Fate, who only can</l>
            <l>Meaſure the true Dimenſions of a Man,</l>
            <l>Who with impartial and triumphant Wings</l>
            <l>O'retakes the poor mans Flight as well as Kings,</l>
            <l>And with thy Martial All-controuling Drum,</l>
            <l>Beats a cold March to the Eternal Home,</l>
            <l>Tyrant o'r tyrants, who, with Fatal Force,</l>
            <l>Betwixt the Soul and Body makes Divorce.</l>
            <l>No more thy <hi>Trophies</hi> boaſt, thou here muſt yield,</l>
            <l>Here's on thou could not Conquer in the Field,</l>
            <l>Who, ſpite of all the Forces him withſtood,</l>
            <l>Has div'd for Honour in a Sea of Blood.</l>
            <l>Who, wherſoe're he Fought, or Seige did lay,</l>
            <l>Honour and Conqueſt did their wings diſplay.</l>
            <l>Whoſe Heart by night nor day did ever feel</l>
            <l>A cowards damps, oft ſleept in ſheets of ſteel.</l>
            <l>That Soul of Chivalrie, which no delight</l>
            <l>Could weaken, or the face of Death affright,</l>
            <l>The Great <hi>DALȜIEL,</hi> who with undazled eyes,</l>
            <l>Affronted all the Flames from Steel could riſe.</l>
            <l>Juſt like the generous <hi>Eagle</hi> dare oppoſe.</l>
            <l>The proudeſt light that ever in Heaven aroſe.</l>
            <l>His Actions all were Generous, and Free,</l>
            <l>And did no Intereſt own, but Loyaltie,</l>
            <l>He lov'd not Wars for Wars, nor Striſe for Strife,</l>
            <l>Not Prodigal, nor Nigard of his Life,</l>
            <l>He did not loftly ſpare himſelf, but then</l>
            <l>He did exact the like of other men.</l>
            <l>For of his Generous, and Martial Heart,</l>
            <l>Courage and Judgement had their equal part,</l>
            <l>He was the <hi>Genius</hi> of the Camp, yet knew,</l>
            <l>When to Retire, and when his Foes purſue,</l>
            <l>He knew all Order of tumultuous War,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Ranks, Files, March, Counter-march,</hi> to make a <hi>Squar,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>And from a <hi>Squar,</hi> to raiſe a <hi>Diamond,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>And all Battalias ever yet were found.</l>
            <l>How to Encamp, Entrench, and any part</l>
            <l>Where Nature fails, to Fortifie by Art:</l>
            <l>How to Deſend, or to aſſault a Town,</l>
            <l>And Courtings, Bulwarks, Plat-forms to beat down.</l>
            <l>He knew no treacherous Arts, nor cheating Charms,</l>
            <l>But maſculin Courage, and the Laws of Arms,</l>
            <l>With theſe he made his Souldiers well train'd Men,</l>
            <l>With theſe he brought them on, and off again.</l>
            <l>It was by thoſe, he to his lateſt Breath,</l>
            <l>In every War, Conqueſt Propound, or Death.</l>
            <l>Like a Majeſtick General, by thoſe,</l>
            <l>He ſold his Souldiers Lives dear to their Foes.</l>
            <l>By his Example every minor Band,</l>
            <l>Did take new Force from his <hi>Heroick</hi> Hand;</l>
            <l>Souldier inſpired Souldier; Foot, the Horſe;</l>
            <l>But he them both; <hi>ſo great's a Generals Force.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Who by his Valour, made it underſtood,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>An ounce of Honour's worth a pound of Blood,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>His never daunted Courage undervalu't</l>
            <l>The iron ſalutation of a Bullet.</l>
            <l>Therefore ſome grovling cowards low-pitcht eye,</l>
            <l>That could not reach triumphant honors Skie.</l>
            <l>What their affrighted ſenſe could not behold,</l>
            <l>Without being dazled, yet to carp were bold.</l>
            <l>But he at home, abroad, and in all parts,</l>
            <l>His Blade imbrew'd in Rivers Sprung from Hearts.</l>
            <l>Yet with ſuch Moderation that he made</l>
            <l>It clear; <hi>War was for Phyſick not for Trade.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>In <hi>Ireland,</hi> and in <hi>Muſco,</hi> and at Home,</l>
            <l>Like <hi>Hercules</hi> he Monſters overcome.</l>
            <l>In all which Interprizes we might ſee</l>
            <l>His Counſel, Courage, Generoſitie.</l>
            <l>He knew when to be harſh, when to be mild,</l>
            <l>And did eſteem each Souldier as his Child.</l>
            <l>And train'd them ſo, which Care was not in vain,</l>
            <l>They as their Father Reverénc'd him again,</l>
            <l>And with the <hi>Prophet</hi> did him thus bewail,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Horſe-men and Chariots of our Iſrael.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>But now being Enfranchiſed, and at large</l>
            <l>From all our Wars, Death ſeals him a Diſcharge.</l>
            <l>He with the Souls above and <hi>Hierarchie,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Has Valour turned into Extaſie,</l>
            <l>Where till the Earth and all its Trophies lie</l>
            <l>A ſcattered Heap, and Time it ſelf ſhall die.</l>
