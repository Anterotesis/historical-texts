            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>REASONS</hi> Offered to the Conſideration of his Grace, His Majeſties high Commisſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and the Honourable Eſtates of Parliament, by ſeveral Salt-Maſters, againſt the Act for a Manufactorie of Salt upon Salt, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in by Mr. <hi>VVilliam Areskin</hi> Governour of <hi>Blackneſs Caſtle.</hi>
            </head>
            <p n="1">1. IF this Act in favours of Mr. <hi>William Areskin</hi> ſhall be paſt, it will make one Manufactrie deſtroy another which is of far greater Import and Advantage to the Nation, <hi>viz.</hi> The Manufactorie of ſmall Salt, by which ſo many thouſands of People are maintained, and by the Exporting of which, ſo much Advantage redounds to the Countrey; For ſhould it be paſt in his favours, under the Notion of making Salt upon Salt, he would import ſo much Foraign Salt, as ſhould not only ſerve for Curing of Fiſhes, but all other Domeſtick Uſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and being free of Duty, will be able to ſell it at a lower Rate than the Salt-maſters can make their Salt at.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If the Advantage of the Countrey be conſulted, it cannot be paſt in his favours and Part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners only, for then the Buyers are confined to Buy as it were from one hand, and ſo muſt pay what Price they ſhall pleaſe to impoſe upon it, and thus it becomes a Monopoly, whereas if power be granted to every Salt-maſter to make Salt upon Salt, the Countrey ſhall be far better ſerved, and the Merchants if they cannot buy from one may go to another, as in the buying of ordinary Salt.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Art of making Salt upon Salt is not ſo great as Mr. <hi>William Areskin</hi> repreſents it, ſince any perſons who have any Skill in <hi>Alchymie</hi> may do it, and it is ordinarly done in <hi>Holland</hi> by ſilly Women; the Expenſe of bringing ſome of theſe home, cannot be ſo very great as he would have it to be.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It is offered by ſeveral of the Salt-maſters, that each of them ſhall ſet up for themſelves, and have their Works in readineſs for accompliſhing the Deſign betwixt and the time conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended on in the Act.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Should this Act be granted in his favours, Coal-maſters might cloſe up their Pits, to the great loſs of the Countrey: for when ſmall Salt cannot be made with ſome Advantage, the ſmall Coals by which it is made muſt be left in the Coal-heugh, which in ſome places takes Fire, and in other places ſo Immures the Coal-heugh that they cannot work, and ſo in effect renders their Works altogether uſeleſs.</p>
            <p>It is therefore humbly expected, that His Grace His Majeſties High Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioner and the Honourable Eſtates of Parliament in reſpect of the above Reaſons, will not paſs the Act in Mr. <hi>Areskines</hi> Favours, but in Favours of ſuch of the Salt Maſters as are willing to ſet up for themſelves to make Sal<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
