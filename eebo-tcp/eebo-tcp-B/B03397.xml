         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>ON <hi>Sunday</hi> the 19th inſtant, the Army marched from <hi>Atheuree</hi> to this place. The General immediatly ſent a Trumpeter to my Lord <hi>Dil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi> Governor of the Town, and offered him the Benefit of the Lords Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices Proclamation of the 7th, which he encloſed to him, if he would Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render it before he was obliged to fire his Cannon The Anſwer was, <hi>That Monſieur</hi> Duſſone, <hi>who Commanded, was of the ſame Opinion with himſelf and the reſt of the Officers, who were reſolved to Defend it to the laſt.</hi> While it was light, our Men made but ſmall Advances, but at night they attack'd a ſmall Fort they had made to command a Valley between the Town and us, and immediatly beat the <hi>Iriſh</hi> out of it; and hearing that <hi>Baldarock O Donnel</hi> intended to throw himſelf and his Brigade into the place that night, or the next morning, the Tin-Boats were immediatly put into the Water, and Six Regiments of Foot, and Four Squadrons of Horſe and Dragoons, ſent over the River, and Poſted in the way <hi>Baldarock</hi> was to take, ſo that finding no Succours could be put in on that ſide, he retired with his Rabble into the County of <hi>Mayo</hi> burning and deſtroying all the Country as he marched. The taking this Fort, and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Water ſo ſuddenly, we ſuppoſe, were the things that frighted them into a Treaty; For on the 20th, about 10 in the morning, the Governour deſired a ſafe Conduct for ſome Perſons he intended to ſend to the General to Capitulat; and in the afternoon three of their Lieutenant-Colonels came out, and as many of ours went into the Town as Hoſtages: The Treaty laſted the reſt of the day, and night, they being often obliged to go back to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult their Principals; At laſt it was agreed, <hi>That on next</hi> Sunday <hi>morning, at ſix a Clock, the Town ſhould be delivered to ſuch Officers as the General ſhould appoint, and in the mean time we ſhould have five Hoſtages for the due perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of Articles, whereof my Lord</hi> Clanriccard <hi>is one, and all the Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works of the Town put into our Poſſeſſion, That the Enemy ſhould forbear to For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify in this time, and withdraw all their Cannon from the Walls, but that we may be permitted to work, and Poſt our ſelves where we will, provided we came not within three yards of the Wall, nor place any Cannon upon the Batteries we make. The Garriſon and Townſmen that remain, have the benefit of the Lord Justices Proclamation, which gives them their Eſtates and Liberties; and thoſe who have a mind to depart, are to be conducted ſafe to</hi> Limerick, <hi>with their Arms, Drums beating,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and ſix Pieces of Cannon. They have liberty to ſend to my Lord</hi> Tyrconnel, <hi>to acquaint him with what they have done, and invite him to do the ſame at</hi> Limerick.</p>
            <p>A <hi>French</hi> Veſſel of 30 Guns ſailed out of the Harbour as we marched hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and two more remain ſtill here.</p>
