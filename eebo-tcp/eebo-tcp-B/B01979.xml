            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>The common Beadle of this wilful Age,</l>
               <l>Has with impartial hand whipt Sov'raign Sin,</l>
               <l>In me it is but manners to begin.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>To correct Vice keen Satyr may prevail,</l>
               <l>Beyond the Law, when preaching Block-heads ſail;</l>
               <l>For Law and Satyr from one Fountain flow,</l>
               <l>Were not men vicious there would be no Law:</l>
               <l>And to cry up this ſaucy Cant a Rule</l>
               <l>For lawful Satyr, proves a Wit a Fool;</l>
               <l>To rail at State, and Monarchs ill intreat,</l>
               <l>They cry, 'tis good, becauſe the Subject's great;</l>
               <l>As Man was only plac'd in Paradiſe,</l>
               <l>To nibble on the Fruit for which he dies.</l>
               <l>Can Owls and Woodcocks with the Eagle play,</l>
               <l>And not in danger to become a prey?</l>
               <l>What is't to laſh a King, and Council-Table,</l>
               <l>When I myſelf am kick'd by the Town-rabble?</l>
               <l>Nor do I covet, matters for my Rhimes,</l>
               <l>The greateſt Perſons; but the greateſt Crimes.</l>
               <l>What is't to me who keeps a Miſs, who's Wed,</l>

               <l>Theſe are the crying Crimes; yet one may do</l>
               <l>All theſe, and be an honeſt Subject too:</l>
               <l>But to ſupplant the Government, and cry</l>
               <l>Allegiance down, and rail at Monarchy;</l>
               <l>To make Cabals, and by a bold Petition</l>
               <l>Imbroil the Nation in a new Sedition;</l>
               <l>To ſowſe Rebellion, lay up Plots in pickle,</l>
               <l>And make each Tavern-bar a Conventicle:</l>
               <l>This would become a Muſe's excellence,</l>
               <l>To whip the Club into Allegiance.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>

               <l>Witneſs the <hi>Catiline</hi> that left <hi>Whitehall</hi>
               </l>
               <l>To be made Preſident of the Cabal:</l>
               <l>So he's in play, (provided there's no blows)</l>
               <l>It matters not, the New, or the Old Cauſe:</l>
               <l>Has through all points of Government run his rounds,</l>
               <l>As <hi>Gore</hi> the Compaſs did, with Bloud and Hounds:</l>
               <l>But ſooner may you fix the Northern wind,</l>
               <l>Than hope this Weathercock will be confin'd.</l>
               <l>Nature made him a perverſe wight, whoſe Noſe</l>
               <l>Extracts the Eſſence of his Gouty Toes;</l>
               <l>Double with Head to Tail he crawls apart:</l>
               <l>His Body's th' Emblem of his double Heart.</l>
               <l>In the Court-Sun he wriggles like a Snail;</l>
               <l>Touch but his Horns, he ſhrinks into his Shell.</l>
               <l>Roul'd like a Hedg-hog up, he ſhews his Snout,</l>
               <l>And at the Council-Table makes a rout,</l>
               <l>'Gainſt <hi>Charles</hi> and the Succeſſion domineers;</l>
               <l>If ought oppoſe him, he has Forks and Spears:</l>
               <l>Like a vile Scullar, he abjures the Realm,</l>
               <l>And ſinks the Bark, 'cauſe he's not chief at Helm;</l>
               <l>Then cries, All hands to pump a Leakiſh Keel,</l>
               <l>And ſtops it up with <hi>Julian</hi>'s Conger-eel,</l>
               <l>That when a Ball pierc'd the Broad-ſide, ev'n then</l>
               <l>Clapt in the hole, and ſav'd Sir <hi>Edward</hi>'s men.</l>
               <l>The way's to keep him there; if he get through</l>
               <l>Secure himſelf, he drowns the Ship and Crew.</l>
               <l>If to the Ocean back again he's bent,</l>
               <l>The Rabble, he's in his own Element.</l>
               <l>There let him Plot, and ne're behold the Sun,</l>
               <l>Till he has through all Seas of Folly run,</l>

            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Like the late Duke, who, from a glorious Bully,</l>

               <l>Rather than not be popular, be baſe?</l>
               <l>So once an Emperor, as Stories ſay,</l>

               <l>To levy Forces, and aſſign Commanders,</l>
               <l>Is Treaſon in the King 'gainſt <hi>France</hi> or <hi>Flanders;</hi>
               </l>
               <l>But if the Houſe command me, though I ſtarve,</l>
               <l>I'll quit Wine, Whores, Allegiance, to ſerve.</l>

               <l>
                  <hi>Gray</hi> Better far might flight his Soveraign's bounty,</l>
               <l>He had a Regiment within his County,</l>
               <l>And power enough beſides to back his Cauſe,</l>
               <l>Would <hi>Rowley</hi> venture but a broken Noſe.</l>
               <l>Appeaſe this mouthing <hi>Cerberus</hi> with a Bone,</l>
               <l>Honour's a dainty Cruſt to pick upon:</l>
               <l>While his dear Doxy makes a ſhift to rub</l>
               <l>The buſineſs out with <hi>Monmouth;</hi> he the Club:</l>
               <l>And <hi>Rowlſtone</hi> leads the Van, while they combine,</l>
               <l>And humbly beg their Soveraign to reſign.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>How Faction, and the quenchleſs thirſt of Rule,</l>
               <l>Hurries to ruine the Ambitious Fool;</l>
               <l>Whoſe buſie Soul, puft up with popular ſway,</l>
               <l>Will ſcarce be ever humbled to obey!</l>
               <l>The Earl whoſe Spouſe had ſuch a ſpacious Poop,</l>
               <l>As ſwallow'd up <hi>Ned Brab'zon,</hi> and his Troop,</l>
               <l>Who was lately Lord Lieutenant of the Realm,</l>
               <l>Seem'd a good Pilot while he ſate at Helm;</l>
               <l>But when he was depos'd, he overthrew</l>
               <l>His Maſter's Cauſe, and ſided with the Crew.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Now <hi>Bedford</hi> found he had the worſt o'th' lay,</l>
               <l>Having more wit or honeſty than they,</l>
               <l>Sneak'd off, and left the Club his Game to play;</l>
               <l>When he had alſo led 'em to the Perch,</l>
               <l>Like <hi>Buckingham,</hi> he left 'em in the lurch,</l>
               <l>At ſuch a juncture of a time, and odly,</l>
               <l>As <hi>Peyton</hi> for his Highnesſ left the Godly;</l>
               <l>Or <hi>Eſcrick Howard,</hi> to become a bawler,</l>
               <l>Withdrew from Court to cry up buſie <hi>Waller.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Theſe are the men that all the Buſtle make,</l>
               <l>And Empire check meerly for Empire's ſake:</l>
               <l>They lay their Stamp on the Revolting Darling,</l>
               <l>And in that Club make Treaſon paſs for Sterling.</l>
               <l>There are ſome other Beagles of the Pack,</l>
               <l>That make a noiſe the Royal Chaſe to back:</l>
               <l>As when a Maſtiff opens in the dark,</l>
               <l>The little Dogs will ſhake their tails and bark;</l>
               <l>And though the foremoſt Hound but ſtart the Hare,</l>
               <l>The reſt will mouth it as they claim'd a ſhare,</l>
               <l>Who follow by the ſcent, and ſcarce have ſenſe</l>
               <l>To judge 'twixt Treaſon and Allegience.</l>
               <l>As Fops meet in the Pit, to damn a Play,</l>
               <l>Not what they know, but by what others ſay:</l>
               <l>Unmeaning — Fools, who, ſomething to be a<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <l>Follow the leading Cucko, like the Bat,</l>
               <l>And juſtly merit, as they are deſpis'd,</l>
               <l>Rather to be rejected than chaſtis'd.</l>
               <l>So bawling <hi>Huntingdon,</hi> and <hi>Kent</hi> the mute,</l>
               <l>With noiſe and nonſence fill up the diſpute:</l>
               <l>And while the Club proclaims the lawleſs ſtrife,</l>
               <l>One is the Drum, and th' other is the Fife.</l>
               <l>What ſhall we ſay of <hi>Falconbridge, Bridgwater?</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Or <hi>Cherbury,</hi> or dull <hi>Denhigh</hi> ſhall I flatter?</l>
               <l>Who in the Synod drudge like Gally-ſlaves,</l>
               <l>And buy the Stock, to make a Gleek of Knaves:</l>
               <l>Like Beaſts, inſenſible of wrong, they ſtray,</l>
               <l>And find a Pound, quitting the King's High way.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>And laſt, behold in Triumph to their Follies,</l>
               <l>In <hi>Nol</hi>'s own Coach of State, comes Loyal <hi>Hollis,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Who ſold the Father by an old Commiſſion,</l>
               <l>And purchaſes the Son with a Petition.</l>
               <l>Now whether has the better on't; the Club,</l>
               <l>Or the Five Members did the Royal job?</l>
               <l>This is the Baker's dozen makes the Rump,</l>
               <l>And little <hi>Waller</hi>'s Leaven to the lump.</l>
               <l>When <hi>Bedford</hi> civilly had made his Leg,</l>
               <l>The Club engender'd, and brought forth an Egg;</l>
               <l>Which, like <hi>Grand Cairo,</hi> for a quick diſpatch</l>
               <l>Hot Monſieur <hi>Parliament</hi> muſt ſit and hatch.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Rowley</hi> began to puff, and ſhake his Noddle,</l>
               <l>And told 'em in plain terms their Brood was addle;</l>
               <l>That to a Rump he never more would give</l>
               <l>Away his Birthright, or Prerogative:</l>
               <l>Then, like a God which from his voice did leap,</l>
               <l>Diſſolv'd that Chaos and confuſed heap.</l>
               <l>Bravely he ſpake, and wiſely he perform'd,</l>
               <l>While ſtill the Club againſt the Council ſtorm'd:</l>
               <l>Who, rather than from Faction would be free,</l>
               <l>Or touch no more of the forbidden Tree,</l>
               <l>Would damn themſelves, and their Poſterity.</l>
