            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IN the Year of our Lord, 1654. on the 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day of <hi>September,</hi> a League of Amity and Friendſhip was concluded, and afterwards on both ſides ratified, between the King and Kingdom of <hi>Denmark</hi> on the one part, and the Lord Protector and Commonwealth of <hi>England, Scotland and Ireland,</hi> &amp;c. on the other part, whereof this is the firſt Article.</p>

That is to ſay,</p>
               <p>That from this day ſhall be a firm, entire and ſincere Amity, Peace and Confederacy, as well by Sea, as Land and freſh Waters, between the King and Kingdom of <hi>Denmark</hi> and <hi>Norway,</hi> and the Protector and Commonwealth of <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> together with the Dominions, Countreys and Cities in the Juriſdiction of either; as alſo between the People, Inhabitants and Subjects of both, of what Degree or Dignity ſoever; ſo as neither Part, People, or Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of either, neither by themſelves, nor others, directly or indirectly may do any thing, nor as much as in them lies, may ſuffer to be done, to the Damage or Prejudice of the other; but that the one ſhall aid the other by all good offices, and ſhall advance the Welfare and Profit of the other to his utmoſt Power.</p>

But this Warre being ended through the Mediation of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> and the Peace concluded at <hi>Rotſhilt</hi> in <hi>February</hi> laſt, was Signed by the Publick Miniſters of the moſt Chriſtian King, and his late Highneſs the Lord Protector, who thereby became Sureties for the ſame, as is more fully ſet forth in a Relation of the Affairs between the two Northern Kings, Printed in this City about a Moneth ſince.<note place="margin">To be ſold at the ſign of the ship in S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Pauls</hi> Churchyard.</note>
               </p>
               <p>This Peace the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> kept, till he had got into his hands four or five Provinces, wherein were many Strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds, and had received other Advantages granted to him by the ſaid Treaty of Peace; but being bound by the ſame to quit all the Territories of the King of <hi>Danmark,</hi> in which at that time his Army lay quartered, in ſtead of Marching away, he Marched back again into the Iſle of <hi>Zealand,</hi> beſieged the Caſtle of <hi>Cronenburg</hi> and took it, laid alſo Siege to <hi>Coppen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haguen,</hi> which although it ſucceeded not, yet he threatneth to beſiege again; and he ſhould have no better Succeſs than he had before, he endeavoureth to engage us in his Quarrel, and by the help of our Navy to make himſelf Maſter of the three Northern Kingdoms, as he is already of the <hi>Baltick</hi>-Sea, and the Ports thereof.</p>
               <p>In the beginning of this ſecond Inuaſion, the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> made full account, that the Moſt-Chriſtian King of <hi>France,</hi> and his late Highneſs the Lord Protector, were bound in Honour, to ſee the contents of that Treaty of Peace, whereof they were Mediators and Sureties, as well performed on the <hi>Swediſh</hi> ſide, as he had done on his, and implored their Aide to that purpoſe: but finding no Relief from <hi>England</hi> (whether the indiſpoſition of his Highneſs, or ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe was the cauſe) he ſought for Aide from ſuch of his Neighbours, as had tenderneſs enough, not to ſee a King and all his Royall Progenie unjuſtly oppreſſed: amongſt thoſe Friends and Neighbours were the States Generall of the United Provinces, who were bound to defend Him by a defenſive League, concluded between them and that King in the Year 1649. But before they came to put in execution what they were obliedged to do, they endeavoured to ſatisfie his Highneſs, concerning the juſtice and neceſſity thereof, and to demonſtrate to him the inconveniencies, that would ariſe to the Commonwealth of <hi>England</hi> it ſelf, if the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> ſhould become ſole Maſter of all thoſe parts; and more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over manifeſted their deſire, that his Highneſs would be pleaſed to cooperate with them, for the compoſing of thoſe diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, which were grown to that height, between the two Northern Kings: and his ſaid Highneſs being deceaſed, they continued to uſe the ſame inſtance with this preſent Lord Protector, declaring, that they intended nothing, but what might be equally to the good and profit of this Nation, as well as of their Own, in any Liberty or Priviledge of Trade and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation, not deſiring the leaſt advantage to their own Subjects more then to us, although their endeavours to preſerve thoſe Liberties had already been expenſive to them, both in Blood and Treaſure.</p>
               <p>From theſe precedent conſiderations, we may propoſe theſe following Queries.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>I. Whether the Commonwealth of <hi>England,</hi> &amp;<hi>c.</hi> can in conſcience break their Pulick Faith and Treaty with <hi>Denmark,</hi> without any cauſe given ?</item>
                  <item>II. Whether the ſaid Commonwealth be not bound in Honour, to ſee the Treaty of Peace between the two Northern Kings, whereof his late Highneſs was Mediator and Surety, performed on both ſides; obliedging him, who hath violated the Treaty, to give due reparation, for the dammage received by the party injured ?</item>
                  <item>III. Whether it be for the Intereſt of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> in their Trade and Navigation to the Baltick Sea, that all the Eaſtland Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, be in the power of one Prince, who either may withhold them, or raiſe thereupon any arbitrary Tolls and Cuſtoms, though never ſo exceſsive ?</item>
                  <item>IV. Whether it be very ſafe for this Commonwealth, that one Prince ſhould be the ſole Dominator of all the North; and whether <hi>England</hi> hath not reaſon to fear the ſame Inconveniencies from thence, which it has felt heretofore, when thoſe three Kingdoms had but one King, and he ſtill to conteſt with thoſe Vandalick Cities, which now are in the King of <hi>Swedens</hi> power.</item>
                  <item>V. Whether the Offers and Deſires of the States Generall; that we would joyn with them to the compoſing of thoſe Differences between the two Northern Kings, by way of Mediation, be not rather to be accepted, then that we ſhould involve our ſelves in an unjuſt and dangerous Warre, wherein a Victory may prove of worſe conſequence to our own Countrey, then an overthrow ?</item>
                  <item>VI. Or whether Conſcience, Honour, our Trade and Navigation, and our Fleet, yea the ſafety of the State, ought to be ſet at ſtake, to gratiſie the <hi>French,</hi> our Friends at preſent; who doubtleſs for one of theſe two reaſons, endeavours to engage us in this over-haſty Warre, againſt both our Intereſts and our Allies; either that they may thereby advance and enlarge their Conqueſt upon the <hi>German</hi> Empire, and make themſelves Maſters of all <hi>Flanders,</hi> this Campagna; or rather that they may ſet all Proteſtant Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and States at variance, then make Peace with <hi>Spain,</hi> and ſo at laſt Extirpate the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> having firſt weakned the Defenders thereof by their own Arms ?</item>
