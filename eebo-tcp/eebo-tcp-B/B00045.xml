         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y meaning is not to make any contentious Arguments about the diſcourſes, diſtinction or definition of Witch-craft, the power of Deuills, the nature of Spirits, the force of Charmes, the ſecrets of Incantation, and ſuch like; becauſe the Scriptures are full of prohibitions to this purpoſe, and proclaimes death to the preſumptuous attempters of the ſame: Beſides, both Princes, (yea, our owne learned and moſt judicious King) Philoſophers, Poets, Chronologers, Hiſtoriographers, and many worthy Writers, have concurred and concluded in this; that divers impious and facinorous miſchiefes have beene effectua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted through the inſtruments of the deuil, by permiſſion of God, ſo that the Actors of the ſame have carried away the opinion of the world, to doe that which they did by Witch-craft; or at leaſt to be eſteemed Witches, for bringing ſuch and ſuch things to paſſe: For howſoever, the learned have charactered delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents in this kinde, by titles of ſundry ſorts, and moſt ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant attributes; as <hi>Pythoniſſae,</hi> dealing with artificiall charmes; <hi>Magi,</hi> anciently reputed ſo, for extraordinary wiſedome and knowledge in the ſecrets of Simples, and Hearbes; <hi>Chaldei</hi> famous for Aſtronomie, and Aſtrologie; <hi>Negromancers,</hi> for pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſing to raiſe dead bodies, and by them to foretell euents of the earth; <hi>Geomantici,</hi> for converſing with Spirits, and uſing In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantations; <hi>Genethliaci,</hi> for preſuming on the calculating of Nativities; or, if you will, aſſuming the credit of Figure-caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; <hi>Ventriloqui,</hi> for ſpeaking with hollow voyces, as if they were poſſeſſed with Devills; <hi>Venefici,</hi> for dealing with poyſon, and either killings, or curing that way: For you muſt underſtand, however the Profeſſors aforeſaid, practiſe murther and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe;
<pb facs="tcp:180784:3"/>
yet many times, they pretend cures and preſervation; with many others, carrying the ſhew of great learning and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired knowledge; yet have they all but one familiar terme with us in Engliſh, called Witches. As for the conceit of Wiſe-men, or Wiſe-women, they are all meerely coſeners and decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers; ſo that if they make you beleeve, that by their meanes you ſhall heare of things loſt or ſtolne, it is either done by Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racie, or put off by protraction, to deceive you of your money.</p>
            <p>Onely (as I ſaid before) there bee certaine men and women growne in yeares, and over-growne with Melancholie and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſme, who out of a malicious diſpoſition againſt their betters or others thriving by them; but moſt times from a heart-burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſire of revenge, having entertained ſome impreſſion of diſpleaſure, and unkindneſſe, ſtudie nothing but miſchiefe and exoticke practiſes of loathſome Arts and Sciences: yet I muſt needs ſay, that ſometimes the fained reputation of wiſedome, cunning, and to be reputed a dangerous &amp; skilfull perſon, hath ſo prevailed with divers, that they have taken upon them indeed to know more than God ever afforded any creature, and to performe no leſſe than the Creator both of heaven and earth; making you beleeve with <hi>Medea,</hi> that they can raiſe tempeſts, turne the Sunne into blood, pull the Moone out of her Sphere, and ſaile ouer the Sea in a cockell ſhell, according to the Poet:
<q>
                  <l>Flectere ſi neueam Superos, Acheronta movebo.</l>
                  <l>If Art doe faile to move the Gods</l>
                  <l>conſent unto my minde:</l>
                  <l>I will the Devils raiſe, to doe</l>
                  <l>what they can in their kinde.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>But howſoever ſpeciall perſons are tranſported with an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of their owne worth, &amp; prevailing in this kinde, yet by la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable experience, we know too wel, what monſtrous effects have been produced, even to the horror of the hearers, and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, of their owne ſoules, by ſuch kinde of people: For as it is in the tale of the envious man, that put out one of his eyes to have his companion loſe both; ſo fareth it with them and worſe, to give away their ſoules to be revenged of their adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries
<pb facs="tcp:180784:3"/>
bodies, where in the monſtrous ſubtlety of the Devill is ſo apparent, that it is wonderfull one way to relate, and lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table another way to obſerve the ſame. For no ſooner ſhall ſuch motives poyſon the inward conceit or apprehenſion of ſuch damnable caitiffes: But then ſteppeth forth the Devill, and not onely ſheweth them the way, but preſcribeth the manner of ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting the ſame, with facility and eaſineſſe, aſſuring that bee himſelfe Will attend them in ſome familiar ſhape of Rat, Cat, Toad, Bird, Cricket, &amp;c. yea effectuate whatſoever they ſhal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand or deſire; and for their better aſſurance and corroboration of their credulity they ſhall have palpable and forcible touches of ſucking, pinching, kiſſing, cloſing, colling, and ſuch like. whereupon, without any feare of God or man, knowledge of Chriſt, hope of redemption, confidence of mercy, or true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe, that there is any other thing to be looked after but this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent world; according to that Atheiſticall poſition of <hi>Epicurus:</hi>
               <q>
                  <l>Ede, bibe, lude, poſt mortem nulla voluptas.</l>
                  <l>Eat, drinke, ſport, play, and take thy pleaſures reſt:</l>
                  <l>For after death who knowes what ſhall be beſt.</l>
               </q>
they admit of thoſe execrable conditions of commutation of ſoules for the entertaining of the ſpirits, and ſo fall to their abominable practiſes, continuing in the ſame till God laugh them to ſcorne, and will by no meanes ſuffer them to abuſe his holy Name, nor deceive others by their prophane lives any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: Witneſſe for the generall, thoſe infinite Treatiſes of many of them convinced by Law, and condemned to death, to the fearefull example of all carnall and hypocriticall Chriſtians: but more eſpecially you may over-looke (if you pleaſe) that lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Diſcourſe of <hi>Daemonology,</hi> compoſed in forme of a Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue, by the high and mighty Prince, <hi>Iames</hi> by the grace of God, King of <hi>England, Scotland, France,</hi> and <hi>Ireland, &amp;c.</hi> and printed (as I take it) according to the copie of <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> 1603. As alſo a Treatiſe of Witch-craft made by that learned <hi>Mr. Alexander Roberts,</hi> Preacher at Kings-Linne in Norfolke, 1615, upon the diſcovery of the Witchcrafts of <hi>Mary Smith,</hi> wife of <hi>Henry Smith</hi> Glover, with her vocall contract between
<pb facs="tcp:180784:4"/>
the Devill and her ſelfe, in ſolemne termes, and ſuch like impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturing filthineſſe; with many hurts and miſchiefes which thereby ſhe procured. As alſo a certaine diſcovery 1611. made by <hi>Iohn Cotta</hi> Doctor of Phyſicke in Northampton, of Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks, women about ſicke perſons, Quackſalvars, and Fugitives, which ſeeme to worke iugling wonders; Surgeons, Apotheca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, practiſers by Spels, the true diſcovery of Witch-craft, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially in the ſicke, with many inſtances of that kinde: Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards, and ſervants of Phyſicians, who may be called, miniſtring helpers: To this he hath added, the Methodian learned decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, or heretick phyſician; Aſtrologers, Ephemerides-maſters, Conjecters by urine, Travellers: and laſt of all, the true Artiſt his right deſcription and election. As alſo a Dialogue concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Witches and Witch-craft, compoſed by <hi>George Gifford,</hi> Miniſter of Gods word in Maldon, 1603. wherein the cunning of the Devill is diſcovered, both concerning the deceiving of Witches, and ſeducing of others into many great errors: As alſo an ancient Diſcourſe of the fearefull practiſes of foure no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious French Witches, with the manner of their ſtrange exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution. As alſo the ſeverall and damnable practiſes of Mother <hi>Sutton</hi> of Milton Mills in the County of Bedford, and <hi>Mary Sutton</hi> her daughter, who were arraigned, condemned and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted for the ſame. As alſo, 1612. the wonderfull diſcovery of Witches in Lancaſhire, being 19. in number, notorious for many infamed actions, and conuicted before <hi>Sir Iames Altham,</hi> and <hi>Sir Edward Bromley,</hi> Barons of the Exchequer: together with the Arraignement and triall of <hi>Iennet Preſton</hi> at Yorke, with her fearefull execution for the murthering of <hi>Mr. Lister</hi> by Witch-craft, with infinite other relations concerning the generall conuiction of Witches, &amp; their practiſes, &amp; condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the particular opinion of ſome men, who ſuppoſe there be none at all, or at leaſt, that they doe not perſonally or truely effect ſuch things as are imputed unto them, and which out of ſome dangerous impreſſion of Melancholy, Vaine glory, or ſome other diſeaſed operation, they aſſume to themſelves by reaſon of a former Contract with the Devill. And ſo much for the certainty of Story, and fearefulneſſe of the truth concerning
<pb facs="tcp:180784:4"/>
the damnable practiſes of Witches, and cunning of the Devill to deceiue them.</p>
            <p>But yet becauſe the minde of man may be carried away with many idle conjectures, either that women confeſſed theſe things by extremity of torture, or that ancient examples are by this time forgotten (although the particulars are upon record, for the benefit of all poſterity:) Or that they were beſides them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or ſubject to ſome weake device or other; rather to bring in queſtion the integrity of juſtice, than to make odious the lives of ſuch horrible offenders: I have preſumed to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent on the Stage of verity, for the good of my Countrey, and the love of truth, the late wofull Tragedie of the deſtruction of the Right Honourable the Earle of <hi>Rutlands</hi> children, who (to his eternall praiſe) proceeded yet both religiouſly and charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly againſt the offenders, leaving their proſecution to the Law, and ſubmitting himſelfe and deplorable caſe to the providence of God, who afflicteth his beſt ſervants with puniſhments, and many times, ſendeth extraordinary vengeance as well on the innocent, as the bad deſerver, to manifeſt his glory: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by way of Caution I aduiſe thee (gentle Reader) what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever thou art, to take heed how thou doeſt either deſpiſe the power of God in his creatures, or vilipend the ſubtletic and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Devill, as Gods inſtrument of vengeance, conſidering that Truth in deſpight of gaine-ſayers will prevaile, according to that principle; <hi>Magna eſt veritas &amp; praevalebit.</hi>

And although ſuch Honourable perſons ſhall not want of all ſorts of people, either to bring them newes, tales, reports, or to ſerve their turne in all Offices whatſoever; ſo that it may well be ſaid of them, as it is of great Kings and Princes, that they have large hands, wide eares, and piercing ſights, to diſcover the unſwept cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of their remoteſt confines, to reach even to their fartheſt borders, and to underſtand the ſecrets of their meaneſt Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects: yet in this matter, neither were they buſie-bodies, flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, malicious politicians, underminers, nor ſupplanters one of anothers good fortune: but went ſimply to worke, as regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the honour of the Earle and his Lady, and ſo by degrees gave light to their underſtanding to apprehend their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints. Firſt, that <hi>Ioane Flower</hi> the mother, was a monſtrous malicious woman, full of oathes, curſes, and imprecations irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious and for any thing they ſaw by her, a plaine Atheiſt: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, of late dayes, her very countenance was eſtranged, her eyes were fiery and hollow, her ſpeech fell and envious, her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour ſtrange and exoticke, and her converſation ſequeſtred; ſo that the whole courſe of her life gave great ſuſpition that ſhe was a notorious Witch: yea, ſome of her neighbours dared to affirme, that ſhe dealt with familiar ſpirits, and terrified them all with curſes and threatning of revenge, if there were never
<pb facs="tcp:180784:5"/>
ſo little cauſe of diſpleaſure and unkindneſſe. Concerning <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garet,</hi> that ſhee often reſorted from the Caſtle to her mother, bringing ſuch proviſion as they thought was unbefitting for a ſervant to purloine, and comming at ſuch unſeaſonable houres, that they could not but conjecture ſome miſchiefe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them, and that their extraordinary riot and expences tended both to rob the Lady, and to maintaine certaine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauſht and baſe company, which frequented this <hi>Ioane Flowers</hi> houſe the mother, and ſpecially her youngeſt daughter. Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>Phillip,</hi> that ſhe was lewdly tranſported with the love of one <hi>Thomas Sympſon,</hi> who preſumed to ſay, that ſhe had bewit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched him; for he had no power to leave her, and was (as hee ſuppoſed) maruellouſly altered both in minde and bodie, ſince her acquainted company. Theſe complaints began many yeares before either their conviction, or publike apprehenſion: Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, ſuch was the honour of this Earle and his Lady; ſuch was the cunning of this monſtrous woman in obſervation towards them; ſuch was the ſubtlety of the Devill to bring his purpoſes to paſſe: ſuch was the effect of a damnable womans wit and malicious envy, that all things were carried away in the ſmooth channel of liking and good entertainment on every ſide, untill the Earle by degrees conceived ſome miſlike againſt her; and ſo, peradventure eſtranged himſelfe from that familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and accuſtomed conferences hee was wont to have with her: untill one <hi>Peake</hi> offered her ſome wrong; againſt whom ſhe complained, but found that my Lord did not affect her cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous and malicious information: untill one <hi>Mr. Vavaſor</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned her company, as either ſuſpicious of her lewd life, or diſtaſted with his owne miſliking of ſuch baſe and poore Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, whom no body loved but the Earles houſhold; untill the Counteſſe miſconceiving of her daughter <hi>Margaret,</hi> and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverig ſome undecencies both in her life and neglect of her buſineſſe, diſcharged her from lying any more in the Caſtle, yet gave her forty ſhillings, a bolſter, and a mattreſſe of wooll; commanding her to goe home; untill the ſlackneſſe of her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payring to the Caſtle, as ſhe was wont, did turne her love and
<pb facs="tcp:180784:6"/>
liking toward this Honourable Earle and his Family, into hate and rancour: whereupon deſpighted to be ſo neglected, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probrated by her neighbours for her daughters caſting out of doores, and other conceived diſpleaſures, ſhee grew paſt all ſhame and womanhood, and many times curſed them all that were the cauſe of this diſcontentment, and made her ſo loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, to her former familiar friends &amp; beneficiall acquaintance.</p>
               <p>When the Devill perceived the in ficious diſpoſition of this wretch, and that ſhe and her daughters might eaſily be made inſtruments to inlarge his kingdome, and be as it were the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutioners of his vengeance; not caring whether it lighted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on innocents or no, hee came more neerer unto them, and in plaine termes, to come quickly to the purpoſe, offered them his ſervice, and that in ſuch a manner as they might eaſily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand what they pleaſed: For hee would attend you in ſuch pretty formes of Dog, Cat, or Rat, that they ſhould neither be terrified, nor any body elſe ſuſpitious of the matter. Vpon this they agree; and (as it ſhould ſee me) give away their ſoules for the ſervice of ſuch Spirits, as he had promiſed them; which filthy conditions were ratified with abominable kiſſes, and an odious ſacrifice of blood, not leaving out certaine charmes and conjurations, with which the Deuill deceived them, as though nothing could be done without ceremony, and a ſolemnity of orderly ratification. By this time doth Satan triumph, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth away ſatisfied to have caught ſuch fiſh in the net of his il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſions: By this time are thoſe women Devills incarnate, and grow proud againe in their cunning and artificiall power to doe what miſchiefe they liſted: By this time they learne the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Incantations, Spells, and Charmes: By this time they kill what Cattell they liſt, and under the covert of flattery and familiar entertainement, keepe hidden the ſtinging Serpent of malice, and a venomous inclination to miſchiefe: By this time is the Earle and his family threatned, and muſt feele the burthen of a terrible tempeſt, which from theſe womens deviliſh de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſes fell upon him, he neither ſuſpecting nor underſtanding the ſame: By this time both himſelfe and his honourable Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſſe are many times subject to ſickneſſe and extraordinary
<pb facs="tcp:180784:6"/>
convulſions, which they taking as gentle corrections from the hand of God, ſubmit with quietneſſe to his mercy, and ſtudy nothing more, then a glorifie their Creator in heaven, and beare his croſſes on earth.</p>
               <p>At laſt, as malice increaſed in theſe damnable women; ſo his family felt the ſmart of their revenge and inficious diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For his eldeſt Sonne <hi>Henry</hi> Lord <hi>Roſſe</hi> ſickened very ſtrangely, and after a while died: and his next, named <hi>Francis</hi> Lord <hi>Roſſe,</hi> accordingly, was ſeverely tormented by them and moſt barbarouſly and inhumanely tortured by a ſtrange ſicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: not long after the Lady <hi>Katherine</hi> was ſet upon by their dangerous and divelliſh practiſes, and many times in great danger of life; through extreame maladies and unuſuall fits. Nay (as it ſhould ſeeme, and they afterward confeſſed) both the Earle and his Counteſſe were brought into their ſnares as they imagined, and indeed determined to keepe them from ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving any more children. Oh unheard of wickeneſſe and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous damnation! Notwithſtanding all this did the noble Earle attend his Majeſty, both at New-Market before Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas, and at Chriſtmas at Whitehall; bearing the loſſe of his children moſt nobly, and little ſuſpecting that they had miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried by Witch-craft, or ſuch like inventions of the Devill, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till it pleaſed God to diſcover the villanous practiſes of theſe bad women, and to command the Devill from executing any further vengeance on innocents, but leave them to their ſhames, and the hands of Juſtice, that they might not onely be confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for their villanous practiſes, but remaine as a notorious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample to all ages of his judgement and fury. Thus were they apprehended about Chriſtmas; and carried to Lincolne Jayle, after due examination before ſufficient Juſtices of the Peace, and diſcreet Magiſtrates, who wondered at their audacious wickedneſſe; but <hi>Ioan Flower</hi> the mother, before conviction (as they ſay) called for bread and butter, and wiſhed it might never goe through her if ſhee were guilty of that whereupon ſhe was examined; ſo mumbling it in her month, never ſpake more words after, but fell downe and died as ſhe was carried to Lincolne Jayle, with an horrible excrutiation of ſoule and
<pb facs="tcp:180784:7"/>
body, and was buried at Ancaſter.</p>
               <p>When the Earle heard of their apprehenſions, hee haſted downe with his brother Sir <hi>George,</hi> and ſometimes examining them himſelfe, and ſometimes ſending them to others; at laſt left them to the triall of the Law, before the Judges of Aſſize at <hi>Lincolne;</hi> and ſo they were convicted of murther, and executed accordingly, about the 11. of March, to the terror of all the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders, and example of ſuch diſſolute and abhominable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: and becauſe yee ſhall have both cauſe to glorifie God for this diſcovery, and occaſion to apprehend the ſtrangeneſſe of their lives, and truth of their proceedings: I thought it both meet and convenient to lay open their owne Examinations and Evidences againſt one another, with the manner of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding and revenges, with other particulars belonging to the true and plaine diſcovery of their villany and Witch-craft.</p>

               <head>The Examination of <hi>Philip Flower,</hi> ſiſter of <hi>Margaret Flower,</hi> and daughters of <hi>Ioane Flower,</hi> before Sir <hi>William Pelham,</hi> and Maſter <hi>Butler,</hi> Iuſtices of the Peace, <hi>February 4. 1618.</hi> Which was brought in at the Aſſizes as evidence against her ſiſter <hi>Margaret.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>SHe ſaith, That her mother and her ſiſter maliced the Earle of <hi>Rutland,</hi> his Counteſſe, and cheir children, becauſe her ſiſter <hi>Margaret</hi> was put out of the Ladies ſervice of Laundry, and exempted from other ſervices about the houſe, whereupon her ſaid ſiſter; by the commandement of her mother, brought from the Caſtle the right hand glove of the Lord <hi>Henry Roſſe,</hi> which ſhe delivered to her mother; who preſently rubd it on the backe of her Spirit <hi>Rutterkin,</hi> then put it into hot boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling water, afterward ſhe pricked it often, and buried it in the yard, wiſhing the Lord <hi>Roſſe</hi> might never thrive, and ſo her ſiſter <hi>Margaret</hi> continued with her mother, where ſhe often ſaw the Cat <hi>Rutterkin</hi> leape on her ſhoulder, and ſuck her neck.</p>
               <p>Shee further confeſſed, that ſhe heard her mother often curſe the Earle and his Lady, and thereupon would boyle feathers and blood together, uſing many Devilliſh ſpeeches and ſtrange geſtures.</p>

               </head>
               <p>SHe ſaith and confeſſeth, That about foure or five yeare ſince her mother ſent her, for the right hand glove of <hi>Henry</hi> Lord <hi>Roſſe,</hi> afterward that her mother bade her goe againe into the Caſtle of <hi>Bever,</hi> and bring downe the glove or ſome other thing of <hi>Henry</hi> Lord <hi>Roſſe,</hi> and ſhe askt what to doe? Her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther replied, to hurt my Lord <hi>Roſſe:</hi> whereupon ſhee brought downe a glove, and delivered the ſame to her mother, who ſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked <hi>Rutterkin</hi> her Cat with it; after it was dipt in hot water, and ſo prickt it often, after which <hi>Henry</hi> Lord <hi>Roſſe</hi> fell ſicke within a weeke, and was much tormented with the ſame.</p>
               <p>Shee further faith, That finding a glove about two or three yeares ſince of <hi>Francis</hi> Lord <hi>Roſſe,</hi> on a dunghill, ſhee delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it to her mother, who put it into hot water and after tooke it out and rubd it on <hi>Rutterkin</hi> the Cat, and bad him goe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and after her mother buried it in the yard, and ſaid a

miſchiefe light on him, but hee will mend againe.</p>
               <p>Shee further ſaith, That her mother, and ſhee, and her ſiſter agreed together to bewitch the Earle and his Lady, that they might have no more children: and being demanded the cauſe of their malice and ill-will; ſhee ſaith, that about foure yeares ſince, the Counteſſe (growing into ſome miſlike with her) gave her forty ſhillings, a bolſter, and an attreſſe, and bade her lie at home, and come no more to dwell at the Caſtle; which ſhe not onely tooke in ill-part, but grudged at it exceedingly, ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in her heart to be revenged. After this her mother com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained to the Earle againſt one <hi>Peake,</hi> who had offred her ſome wrong, wherein ſhee conceived that the Earle tooke not her part, as ſhe expected, which diſlike with the reſt, exaſperated her diſpleaſure againſt him, and ſo ſhe watched an opportunity to bee revenged: whereupon ſhee tooke wooll out of the ſaid mattreſſe, and a paire of gloves, which were given her by Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Vavaſor,</hi> and put them into warme water, mingling them with ſome blood, and ſtirring it together, then ſhee tooke the wooll and gloves out of the water, and rubd them on the belly of <hi>Rutterkin</hi> her Cat, ſaying, the Lord and the Lady ſhould have more children, but it would be long firſt.</p>
               <p>Shee further confeſſeth, that by her mothers commandment, ſhe brought to her a piece of a handkerchiefe of the Lady <hi>Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therine</hi> the Earles daughter, and her mother put it into hot wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and then taking it out, rubd it on <hi>Rutterkin,</hi> bidding him flie, and goe; whereupon <hi>Rutterkin</hi> whined and cried Mew: whereupon ſhe ſaid, that <hi>Rutterkin</hi> had no power over the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <hi>Katherine</hi> to hurt her.</p>

               <p>SHee confeſſeth and ſaith, That ſhee hath a Spirit ſucking on her in the forme of a white Rat, which keepeth her left breaſt, and hath ſo done for three or foure yeares, and concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the agreement betwixt her Spirit and her ſelfe, ſhee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth and ſaith, That when it came firſt unto her, ſhe gave her

               <p>THeſe Examinations and ſome others were taken and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily preſerved for the contriving of ſufficient evidences againſt them, and when the Judges of Aſſize came downe to Lincolne about the firſt wecke of <hi>March,</hi> being Sir <hi>Henry Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert,</hi> Lord chiefe Juſtice of the Common-Pleas, and Sir <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Bromely,</hi> one of the Barons of the Exchequer, they were preſented unto them, who not onely wondred at the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of theſe perſons, but were amazed at their practiſes and horrible contracts with the Devill to damne their owne ſoules: And although the Right Honourable Earle had ſufficient griefe for the loſſe of his children; yet no doubt it was the greater to conſider the maner, and how it pleaſed God to inflict on him ſuch a faſhion of viſitation: Beſides, as it amazed the hearers to underſtand the particulars, and the circumſtances of this devilliſh contract was it as wonderfull to ſee their deſperate
<pb facs="tcp:180784:11"/>
impenitency, and horrible diſtraction, according to the reſt of that ſort, exclaiming againſt the Devill for deluding them, and now breaking promiſe with them, when they ſtood in moſt need of his helpe.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding all theſe aggravations, ſuch was the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paralleld magnanimity, wiſedome, and patience of this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Noble-man, that he urged nothing againſt them more then their owne confeſſions, and ſo quietly left them to judiciall triall, deſiring of God mercy for their ſoules, and of men cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to cenſure them in their condemnation: but God is not mocked, and ſo gave them over to judgement, nor man ſo refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, but for the Earles ſake, they curſed them to that place which they themſelves long before had bargained for.</p>
               <p>What now remaines (gentle Reader) but for thee to make uſe of ſo wonderfull a ſtory, and remarkeable an accident, out of which, to draw to a conclusion, thou mayeſt collect theſe particulas: Firſt, that God is the ſupreame Commander of all things, and permitteth wonderfull actions in the World, for the triall of the godly, the puniſhment of the wicked, and his owne glory: of which man ſhall never attaine to know the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or occaſion. Secondly, that the Devill is the meere ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant and agent of God, to proſecute whatſoever he ſhall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand rather then give leave unto; limiting him yet thus farre in his owne nature, that he can goe no further then the bounds within which he is hedged. Thirdly, that this God hath pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments, <hi>ad correctionem,</hi> that is to ſay, chaſtiſements of the godly, <hi>&amp; Ad ruinam, Videlicet,</hi> judgements againſt the wicked, wherein yet man muſt diſclaime any knowledge, and forſake prejudicate opinions. For the very juſt ſhall be tried like gold, and no man exempted from caſtigation whom God doth love. Fourthly, that this Devill, though hee bee Gods inſtrument, yet worketh altogether by deceit: for as he was a lier from the beginning; ſo let no man truſt him, becauſe hee aimes at the confuſion of all mankinde, Fifthly, that the wicked (however they may thriue and proſper for a time) yet in the end are ſure to be payed home, either with puniſhment in this life or in the life to come, or both, as a finall reward of menſtrous impicty.
<pb facs="tcp:180784:12"/>
Sixthly, that man in his frailty muſt not preſume of proſperity, but prepare a kind of ſtooping under the hand of God, when it pleaſeth him to ſtrike or puniſh us. Seventhly, that there is no murmuring nor repining againſt God, but quietly to tolerate his inflictings, whenſoever they chance, of which this worthy Earle is a memorable example to all men and ages. Eightly, that the puniſhments of the wicked are ſo many warnings to all irregular ſinners to amend their lives, and avoid the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to come, by penitency, and newneſſe of life. Ninthly, that though man could bee content to paſſe over blaſphemies and offences againſt the Statutes of Princes, yet God will over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take them in their owne walkes, and pull them backe by the ſleeve into a ſlaughter-houſe, as here you know the evidences againſt theſe people tooke life and power from their owne Confeſſions. Tenthly, and laſt of all, that private opinion cannot prevaile againſt publike cenſures: for here you ſee the learned and religious Judges cried out with our Saviour, <hi>Ex ore tuo.</hi> Therefore though it were ſo, that neither Witch nor Devill could doe theſe things, yet <hi>Let not a Witch live,</hi> ſaith God, and <hi>Let them die</hi> (ſaith the Law of <hi>England) that have converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with ſpirits, and preſume to blaſpheme the Name of God with ſpels and incantations.</hi> O then you ſonnes of men, take war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning by theſe examples; and either divert your ſteps from the broad way of deſtruction, and irrecoverable gulfe of damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or with <hi>Ioſuahs</hi> counſell to <hi>Achan,</hi> Bleſſe God for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of wickedneſſe, and take thy death patiently, as the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of thy future judgement, and ſaving innocents from puniſhment, who otherwiſe may be ſuſpected without a cauſe.</p>

               <head>The triall of a Witch.</head>
               <p>Now as touching the triall and diſcovery of a Witch (then which these cannot be any preſident more neceſſary and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoovefull
<pb facs="tcp:180784:12"/>
for us) there are divers opinions holden; As ſome by the pricking of a ſharpe knife, naule, or other pointed instrument under the ſtoole or ſeate on which the Witch ſitteth (for thereon ſhee is not able to ſit or abide) others by ſcratching, or drawing of blood from the Witch, by either party that is grieved, or the next of blood to the ſame, and others by fire; as by burning any relique or principall ornament belonging to the ſuſpected Witch, which ſhall no ſooner bee on fire, but the Witch will preſently come running to behold it; and of theſe, trials have beene made both in <hi>Hartfordſhire, Northamptonſhire,</hi> and <hi>Huntingtonſhire;</hi> But the onély aſſured and abſolute perfect way to finde her out, is to take the Witch or party ſuſpected either to ſome Mildam, Pond, Lake or deepe River, and ſtripping her to her ſmocke, tie her armes acroſſe, onely let her legs have free liberty; then faſtening arope about her middle which with the helpe of by ſtanders may be ever ready to ſave her from drowning (in caſe ſhe ſinke) throw her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the water, and if ſhee ſwimme aloft and not ſincke, then draw her foorth, and have ſome honeſt and diſcreet women neere, which may preſently ſearch her for the ſecret marke of Witches, as Teates, blood-moales, moiſt warts, and the like, which found, then the ſecond time (binding her right thumbe to her left toe, and her left thumbe to her right toe) throw her into the water againe (with the aſſiſtance of the former rope to ſave her, if ſhee ſhould chance to ſincke) and if then ſhee ſwim againe and doe not ſincke you may moſt aſſuredly reſolve ſhe is a Witch: and of this many preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and true proofes have beene made, as namely by one Maſter <hi>Enger</hi> of Bedfordſhire, upon the perſon of <hi>Mary Sutton</hi> (a notable Witch) whom he caſt into his Mildam at <hi>Milton</hi> Mills, and found the effect as hath beene declared, and for her Witchcraft was there condemned and executed, and as this ſo I could recite a world of others in the ſame nature.
