            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving lately (as far as I might) diſcerned the ſubtle, yet ambiguous deſires of ſom, (not the ſoundeſt nor moſt able Printers) I finde their pretences to bee <hi>Regulation,</hi> as in order to themſelvs, but no way in relation to the Common-wealth: And their chief ends to apply to themſelvs Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municatively the chiefeſt Copies, being the <hi>proprieties</hi> of other men. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that theſe <hi>innovating</hi> men ſhould, if they would, better underſtand themſelvs, I have directed theſe ſequels.</p>
            <p n="1">1. A Companie <hi>Municipal</hi> is ſuch an one which ſubordinately <hi>utitur regulis ſuis in ordine ad ſe;</hi> uſeth their own Rules and Conſtitutions in relation to themſelvs, as do <hi>Mercers, Drapers, Fiſh-mongers, &amp;c.</hi> Alſo <hi>Gold-ſmiths, Braſiers, Shoo-makers, &amp;c.</hi> All of whom can buy, barter, ſell, contract, work, &amp;c. without any ſpecial privilege, order, or li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence from any Superior, Superiors, Superviſor or Superviſors. But <hi>Printers, Book-binders,</hi> and <hi>Book-ſellers</hi> cannot by Decrees and Ordinances (hitherto thought fit to continue) print, binde, or ſell a Book (imprinted within this Nation) but by <hi>ſpecial licence and allowance;</hi> nor import from other Nations, but with like regard. And in <hi>France, Germanie, Spain,</hi> and other Countries, they cannot print, but for a certain determined time, ſuch or ſuch a Book; nor ſell, but for ſuch a price (a convenience, which, I ſuppoſe, would bee uſeful in this Common-wealth,) eſpecially for ſom Books. So that albeit the <hi>Printers, Book-binders,</hi> and <hi>Book-ſellers,</hi> are a Companie which ſubordinately <hi>utitur ſuis regulis,</hi> in ſom things; yet they uſe ſuch Rules and Conſtitutions <hi>in ordine ad alios, viz.</hi> Their Superiors (or rather the Common-wealth) not <hi>ad ſe;</hi> as the forementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned Companies do; And are therefore to bee accounted a <hi>Privilegial,</hi> not a <hi>Municipal</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And whereas the <hi>Printers</hi> would not only invade other mens Proprieties (thereby endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to null, as much as in them lie's, <hi>Meum &amp; Tuum,</hi> and inducing, as far as may bee, an example of ill conſequence to this Common-wealth) but they would alſo deſtroy (as I am credibly informed) <hi>Patrimonial</hi> Right; that is, that the Father of a free Stationar ſhall not make his Son free; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently that his Son ſhall not bee capable of having or enjoying the benefit of Printing his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Copies; This their endeavour I conceiv to bee moſt injurious; For many a Stationar (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding the Printers) have many times little or nothing to leav their Wives and Children, but their Copies: Which if they ſhould, by the indirect <hi>device</hi> of theſe innovating Printers, be deprived of; then they cannot other way ſubſiſt. <hi>Moreover,</hi> why ſhould any free Stationar bee debarred from ſuch Right, which by the Rules and Conſtitutions general of the honorable Citie of <hi>London</hi> every Free-man enjoyeth; to wit, to make his Son a Free-man? This I take to bee a device of the Printers againſt <hi>Matthew Barker,</hi> and others, whoſe Rights they would invade. So that (in my opinion) it would bee requiſite, that neither the <hi>Book-ſellers,</hi> nor the <hi>Printers,</hi> being (as I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie inſtanced, but <hi>privilegial,</hi> and not properly <hi>municipal</hi>) debate nor draw any Act or Acts, on their own behalf, for regulating of Printers &amp; Printing: But that ſuch Act or Acts bee from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth debated by the Honorable Council of State, or by ſuch as they ſhall appoint, and by them drawn up and recommended to the Parlament, for the regulating of Printing it ſelf in a true <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corum,</hi> as alſo of all <hi>Proprieties</hi> individually. And if this of <hi>Proprieties</hi> were but exactly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered and reported, theſe new (and for the moſt part mean) Innovators, would (in all probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie) deſiſt from further troubleſom ſolliciting the Honorable Council of State, and apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelvs to bee ruled and governed, as their Honors, and high Court of Parlament ſhould in their Wiſdoms think fit.</p>
            <p>If it ſhould bee ſaid, That none ought to exerciſe <hi>the Art or Myſterie of Printing,</hi> but ſuch as have ſerved ſeven years to a Printer, in regard that <hi>Printing</hi> may be ſaid to bee a <hi>manual</hi> occupation, and conſequently to bee comprehended within the Act of <hi>Eliſ.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 4. I anſwer, That albeit Printing may in regard of its <hi>labor,</hi> bee ſaid to bee a manual occupation; yet in regard of its <hi>END,</hi> it is a <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilegial,</hi> and not a <hi>Popular</hi> manual occupation, no otherwiſe then <hi>Coyning.</hi> And that Act of <hi>Eliſ.&amp;c.</hi> intend's onely <hi>manual occupations popular,</hi> not <hi>privilegial;</hi> as the clauſes thereof manifeſt. So that the <hi>privilege of Printing,</hi> or right of Copies, may reſide in one or more, who are no Artiſts; and the performance of Printing in ſuch onely who are Artiſts in Printing.</p>
