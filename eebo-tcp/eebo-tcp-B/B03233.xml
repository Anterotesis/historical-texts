            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>Art thou gone too, great and couragious mind!</l>
               <l>And muſt we fear even thoſe are left behind?</l>
               <l>Lord, ſtay thy hand and cauſe thy wrath to ceaſe,</l>
               <l>And call not home ſo faſt our Sons of Peace.</l>
               <l>If Heaven do call ſo faſt for Saints to come,</l>
               <l>Who will be left on Earth t' ſupply their room?</l>
               <l>The Reverend zealous <hi>FOWLER</hi>'s dead; alas,</l>
               <l>What ſadder news to us could come to paſs!</l>
               <l>Shall I then weep alone? come every eye,</l>
               <l>Pity ſuch duſt as his ſhould e're lie dry:</l>
               <l>Come every eye with tears his Coffin wet;</l>
               <l>It is not what is given, but a debt.</l>
               <lg>
                  <l>When Vice grows rampant, and <hi>Socinians</hi> ſay</l>
                  <l>They hope to triumph in a bleſſed day,</l>
                  <l>To have our ſecond <hi>Luther</hi> ſnatcht away:</l>
               </lg>
               <l>How did he teeze the <hi>Quaker</hi> by the Word,</l>
               <l>And with his reas'ning pierc'd him as a Sword?</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Socinus</hi> Cauſe he level'd to the ground;</l>
               <l>And Popery the ſame fate from him found.</l>
               <l>Now where's thy Judgment, Memory and Tongue,</l>
               <l>That durſt ſpeak Truth when <hi>Scoffers</hi> came in throng!</l>
               <l>And was not plagu'd with an inglorious ſloth</l>
               <l>To hug thy ſelf, but dared to come forth</l>
               <l>Into the open field, whil'ſt crafty Fox</l>
               <l>Lurkt in the Buſhes to devour the Flock.</l>
               <l>Where's thy rich fancy, man? to who beneath</l>
               <l>Didſt thou thy rich and Goſpel-ſtrain bequeath?</l>
               <l>Tell us for thy own ſake, for none but he</l>
               <l>That hath thy Wit can write thy Elegy:</l>
               <l>Thoſe flattering Arts which Poets uſe to ſave</l>
               <l>Decaying-Reputations in the Grave,</l>
               <l>Are here but vain, for no <hi>Hyperbole</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Can tell the World how great thy Merits be;</l>
               <l>And Hiſtory it ſelf can ſay no more</l>
               <l>Than what thy Learning told the World before:</l>
               <l>Thy Goſpel-Sermons did declare thy worth:</l>
               <l>Thy Expoſitions ſet thy Learning forth.</l>
               <l>And whil'ſt we here lament thy being gone,</l>
               <l>Angels with <hi>Anthems</hi> welcome thee at home:</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Fowler!</hi> whoſe converſation free from ill,</l>
               <l>Can't be expres'd, but by an Angels Quill;</l>
               <l>To thoſe that mock't and ſcoft at him, I'le ſay,</l>
               <l>He's ſafely lodg'd in Heav'n out o' their way.</l>
               <l>He'd not delight in ſinners way to ſtand,</l>
               <l>But as the Angel with drawn Sword in's hand,</l>
               <l>That ſo their ruine might prevented be,</l>
               <l>By him who was Gods Seer, and did ſee.</l>
               <l>He lov'd his God, his King, his Country's Cauſe,</l>
               <l>And was not led or tempted by Applauſe.</l>
               <l>Now let the worſt of men ſnarl at his flight,</l>
               <l>And bark as Curs do at the Morning-light;</l>
               <l>By them who'e're writes truth of him, will be</l>
               <l>Slandered with byas, or with flattery.</l>
               <l>But flattery can never reach his ſtate,</l>
               <l>We only praiſe to make men imitate;</l>
               <lg>
                  <l>And ſo muſt ſpeak in ſober terms, for know,</l>
                  <l>If Saints in Heaven can hear things here below</l>
                  <l>They'l no man thank that flatteries beſtow.</l>
               </lg>
               <l>Hee's dead, let's imitate his Life, that we</l>
