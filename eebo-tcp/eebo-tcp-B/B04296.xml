            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </epigraph>
            <q>
               <p>THis ſudden news of my Execution [after my Reprieve,] coming ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expectedly, made me fear I ſhould have more ſeverity ſhew'd Me than has been to others; and conſequently, that <hi>I</hi> ſhould not have my full liberty to declare my mind in the place of my Execution, Therefore <hi>I</hi> have briefly expreſt my ſelf in Writing as followeth.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Firſt,</label> As <hi>I</hi> hope for Salvation, and Benefit by the Blood and Paſſion of my Bleſſed Saviour, <hi>I</hi> moſt ſincerely Proteſt, that what <hi>R. Balron</hi> and <hi>L. Mowbray</hi> ſwore againſt me, was abſolutely falſe; For here in the preſence of the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal God, <hi>I</hi> declare <hi>I</hi> never knew of any Conſult at <hi>Barnbow,</hi> leaſt prejudicial to the KING or Kingdom; Nor Was <hi>I</hi> ever at any ſuch Conſult or meeting With Sir <hi>Thomas Gaſcoin,</hi> Mr. <hi>Gaſcoin</hi> his Son, Sir <hi>Miles Stapleton,</hi> the Lady <hi>Tempeſt, Mr. Ingleby,</hi> or any other, where any thing was ever treated, ſpoken, or Written, about killing the KING, or alteration of the Government; Nor did <hi>I</hi> ever ſee, or know of any <hi>List</hi> of Names of Perſons mention'd, and ſworn by them againſt me.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Secondly,</label> Upon my Salvation <hi>I</hi> declare, that <hi>I</hi> never have been in my whole life time Guilty, even ſo much as in Thought of any Treaſon againſt his Majeſty, or the Kingdom, being directly contrary to the Principles of our Faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Thirdly,</label> That although <hi>I</hi> have, and do declare againſt the <hi>Oath of Allegiance</hi> as it is worded, Yet it is only by reaſon of ſome Clauſes therein contained, not pertaining to <hi>Allegiance;</hi> And therefore, if an Oath, containing nothing but <hi>Allegiance,</hi> had been legally tendred me, <hi>I</hi> ſhould have thought it a ſin to refuſe it.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Laſtly,</label> 
                  <hi>I</hi> acknowledge my ſelf a PRIEST, and to have about 15 years per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the Prieſtly Function; which <hi>I</hi> am ſo far from denying, that <hi>I</hi> thought it the greateſt Honour imaginable.</p>
               <p>Now Dear Country-men, having made this Proteſtation in the moſt plain and ſerious terms <hi>I</hi> could, without all Equivocation, or mental Reſervation whatſoever; <hi>I</hi> appeal to the Eternal Judge, whether all good Chriſtians ought not rather to believe what is here in this manner ſworn by me in my preſent Circumſtance, than what was ſworn by my Accuſers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whom notwithſtanding, <hi>I</hi> beg of God Almighty to Forgive; As alſo the Jury, and all others, who have in any kind concur'd to my Death.</p>
            </q>
            <p>Having full time allow'd him, he ſpoke much more (with a clear Voice, and (as they ſay) a remarkably Chearful Countenance,) to the ſame Effect, declaring his Innocence as to any <hi>Plot,</hi> his Loyalty to the King, his Charity to his Neighbour, his Love and Piety to God, which he expreſſed in Fervent Prayers and Ejaculations: But theſe Particulars not being by him committed to Writing, we muſt expect a more verbal account of each from thoſe Who were actually preſent at his Execution.</p>
            <p>Juſt as he went off the Ladder, he was diſtinctly heard to ſay theſe words, <hi>Sweet Jeſus Receive my Soul.</hi>
            </p>
            <closer>GOD SAVE THE KING.</closer>
