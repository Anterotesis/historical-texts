            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The CASE of M<hi rend="sup">R.</hi> JAMES TREFUSIS, Of the County of Cornwal Gent.</head>
            <p>THAT The ſaid <hi>Trefuſis,</hi> having made it his Buſineſs, and Imployed divers Servants in Diſtilling and Extracting of Spirits from Corn and Molloſſoes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and having conſiderably Improved himſelf in the knowledge of the ſaid Art, and obſerving how much the Preſent Government did ſuffer in the Revenue and Duty chargeable upon Spirits, by the Unskillfulneſs and Ill Management of the Officers, who were intruſted to Superviſe and Collect the ſame; He the ſaid <hi>James Trefuſis,</hi> in the Month of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> in the Firſt Year of His Majeſty's Reign, applyed himſelf to a Perſon of Quality, and requeſted him to make the Government Acquainted therewith.</p>
            <p>THAT thereupon the ſaid Perſon of Quality, the ſame month of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> Recommended the ſaid <hi>Trefuſis</hi> to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners of <hi>Exciſe,</hi> and the Commiſſioners directed the ſaid <hi>Trefuſis,</hi> to reduce what he had Diſcourſed them into Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which he accordingly did; and demonſtrated the Quantities and Qualities of <hi>Low Wines</hi> and <hi>Spirits</hi> uſually Extract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed either from Barley Malt, or Molloſſoes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>THAT</hi> Some of the Commiſſioners were ſo well Satisfied, that they declared. <hi>The ſaid</hi> Treffuſſis, <hi>had given them the beſt and fulleſt Information they ever had in that Affair;</hi> but believed the ſaid <hi>Trefuſis</hi>'s Method Impracticable, in reſpect the Diſtillers would be induced to Indict their Officers, in caſe they ſhould proceed that way, the then Acts of Parliament being deficient therein: But <hi>Trefuſis</hi> having fully ſatisfied them, that the ſaid Duty could be no other ways Aſcertained to Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance the Revenue, but by Gauging and taking an Account of all Wash and other Materials, as they ſhould at all times be found Prepared or Preparing, for the making of <hi>Low Wines,</hi> as well as of all <hi>Low Wines</hi> and <hi>Spirits:</hi> And that the Diſtillers ſhould from time to time give the Officer an account of what was become of ſuch <hi>Waſh Low Wines</hi> and materials, and the Produce thereof, or otherwiſe to ſtand Charged therewith: And this being Repreſented by the Commiſſioners to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, a New Act of Parliament paſt to that purpoſe the 5th. of <hi>January,</hi> 1690.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>THAT</hi> the ſaid <hi>Trefuſis</hi> having been promiſed Preferment for making the ſaid Diſcovery (by the ſaid Commiſſioners) Diſmiſt his Servants, and left his Trade as a Diſtiller, and in order to his being Inſtructed, was firſt brought in a Supernume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary, and placed to obſerve the working of one Mr. <hi>Woodward</hi> a Diſtiller; but the ſaid <hi>Woodward,</hi> being ſenſible of the ſaid <hi>Trefuſis</hi> knowledge in that Buſineſs, he would no longer work under <hi>Trefuſis</hi>'s Inſpection, but compounded rather to pay <hi>801. per Month,</hi> which was 4cl. more than he paid before.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>THAT</hi> One <hi>Mr. Newman,</hi> the then General Surveyor (Envying <hi>Trefuſis</hi> for being the Author of ſo Great an Improv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in that Duty) Uſed all poſſible means to prevent his being Prefered for his good Service, and therefore Prefered and Introduced the ſaid Diſtiller <hi>[Woodward]</hi> to be one of the General Surveyors of the Diſtillery of this City of <hi>London,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho' he was, at that time, Incapable of that Poſt; and at the ſame time, Miſ-repreſented the ſaid <hi>Trefuſis</hi> to the Board, and threatned the Officers, to deter them from Certifying his Ability.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>THAT</hi> the ſaid <hi>Trefuſis</hi> being very well Inſtructed in Gauging and Book-keeping, by the means of Sr. <hi>Henry Aſburſt</hi> [then one of the Commiſſioners] Procured an Examination, and was found Capable of any Imployment in the Exciſe; yet nevertheleſs the ſaid <hi>Trefuſis</hi> obteined but a common Gaugers place; and after three Years in that Poſt without proſpect of Preſerment, for his ſaid good Service, under the then Managers, he gave up his Commiſſion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>THAT</hi> the Revenue of that Branch of the Exciſe, within the Bills of Mortality, in the Year 1690. before the ſaid Act was granted, Produced no more but 9942l. 17s. but after the ſaid Act of Parliament was paſt, the ſaid Revenue advanced in the Year 1691. to 5770l. 14s. In 1692, it advanced to 19544l. 10s. 6d. which was more then double the Duty it Produced before the ſaid Act of Parliament was procured; and the ſame hath been every year Improving, as will appear by the Books in the Office.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>THAT</hi> the ſaid Mr. <hi>Newman</hi> [for his Unfaithfulneſs] and ſome others, being removed, the ſaid <hi>Trefuſis</hi> a gain Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioned and obtained a Warrant to be one of the General Surveyors of the Diſtillery in the place of the ſaid Mr. <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</hi> but altho the ſaid Mr. <hi>Newman</hi> and the ſaid Mr. <hi>Woodward,</hi> his Partner in that Offiice, had Four Hundred Pounds a Year Sallery, between them [beſides their Incident Charges, which was very conſiderable] paid them Quarterly; yet the ſaid <hi>Treffuſſis</hi> and Mr. — his Partner in that Office, are allowed but <hi>80l.</hi> a year each, without any Incident Charges; by which reaſon, the ſaid <hi>Treffuſſis,</hi> and Mr. — is out of Pocket in maintaining themſelves in that Chargeable Poſt; and very far from being a Reward to the ſaid <hi>Trefuſis</hi> for his good Service done to the Government, or to compenſate his leaving his Imployment as a Diſtiller, which have proved very detrimental to his Family.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>THE</hi> ſaid <hi>Trfeuſis</hi> therefore hopes that either the Sallery ſhall be Augmented, and the Incident Charges added to the ſaid Office, as formerly; or that ſome other way may be conſidered of, as a Reward for his ſaid Good Service; the ſame having now evidently appeared very Beneficial to the Publick.</p>
