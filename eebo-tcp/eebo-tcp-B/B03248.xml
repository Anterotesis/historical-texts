         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>IS Pious <hi>Henchman</hi> Dead, then <hi>LONDON,</hi> thou</l>
               <l>Did'ſt never want more Tears than thou doſt now;</l>
               <l>For if thy Grief could but retrieve him, then</l>
               <l>A Sea of Tears ſhould fetch him back agen;</l>
               <l>Such the old Patriarch's were, with ſuch a hand</l>
               <l>They led their Flocks, and rul'd the Holy Land;</l>
               <l>Such gentle Croſiers weilded they, when firſt</l>
               <l>Their tender Lambs, and Proſelites they Nurſt;</l>
               <l>Guarding the Churches Pale by their ſtrict ſway</l>
               <l>From ſacralegious <hi>Thief</hi> and <hi>Beaſt of Pray;</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Their Fences and Encloſures kept with Toyl</l>
               <l>Secur'd their <hi>Dioceſs</hi> or <hi>Fold</hi> from ſpoyl;</l>
               <l>Such once were they when in their Graves they ſlept</l>
               <l>And Company with none but Angels kept;</l>
               <l>By them he drew a Pious Life, which muſt</l>
               <l>Like theirs, ſmell ſweet, though he be turn'd to Duſt;</l>
               <l>He ſhar'd with them, beſides their ancient Seat,</l>
               <l>VVhat Primitive is Apoſtolick or Great;</l>
               <l>Nor was his Life leſs comely or leſs clean</l>
               <l>In his receſs, than in his publick ſcene;</l>
               <l>Thoſe gay Adornments which Inrich'd his Mind</l>
               <l>VVere not with Robes put off nor yet Confin'd;</l>
               <l>To the Show-Day, and ſo no Longer laſt</l>
               <l>Than the Solemnity or Pomp was paſt:</l>
               <l>VVhen all diſmiſt, he laid aſide his State,</l>
               <l>His trayn of Virtues held their conſtant weight:</l>
               <l>The truely Gallant keep their Court within,</l>
               <l>And are Attended by a Trayn unſeen;</l>
               <l>Their Masks are ſecret and their Joys unknown,</l>
               <l>Their greateſt Tryumphs are when all alone;</l>
               <l>VVhat the beſt Prelate ſhould be, was his due,</l>
               <l>Their Orders rare, and Orders Glorious too.</l>
               <l>No cruel Rancour harbour'd in his Breſt,</l>
               <l>'Gainſt Men of diff'rent Principles poſſeſt,</l>
               <l>His Miter was his Shield, and not his Rod,</l>
               <l>He lov'd them all that did but ſerve his God.</l>
               <l>In truth and in ſincerity; allthough</l>
               <l>He could not every Circumſtance allow</l>
               <l>As to himſelf; yet quietly he cou'd</l>
               <l>Diſpence with ſmall things, ſo their Lives were good;</l>
               <l>Thus like our kind Creator he ſurvey'd</l>
               <l>VVhere we did well, and where from good we Stray'd:</l>
               <l>But finding Piety, the thing deſign'd,</l>
               <l>Forgot our little Faults, and grew kind:</l>
               <l>Yet this indulgence neither was not ſuch</l>
               <l>But that he ſtill took care of's Mother Church;</l>
               <l>To keep up all her Splendor, all her Glory,</l>
               <l>And leave her ſiting them for future ſtory.</l>
               <l>He Lov'd her ſo, as if ſh' had been his Spouſe,</l>
               <l>And like a VVife he kept her in his Houſe:</l>
               <l>That Houſe of large Dimentions, whoſe old Fame</l>
               <l>Lays claim to <hi>London</hi> as her beſt Sirname;</l>
               <l>Mauger all her Honour, heretofore</l>
               <l>Could never boaſt of Temple to Adore</l>
               <l>Th' Almighty in, till Rev'rend <hi>Henchman</hi> came</l>
               <l>VVhoſe Piety has much enhaunc'd her Fame.</l>
               <l>Antiquity nor Cuſtom neither cou'd</l>
               <l>Prevail with him to juſtle out his God:</l>
               <l>A Stately Chappel up he quickly</l>
               <l>Shall ſerve him for a Mauſolean Tomb:</l>
               <l>But why alas do I thus waſte my Breath,</l>
               <l>He wants no Elegy, nor Epitaph;</l>
               <l>But durſt commit his Body as it lies,</l>
               <l>To Tongues of living Men, not unborn Eyes.</l>
               <l>VVhat profits thee a ſheet of Lead, what good</l>
               <l>If on thy Grave a Marble Quarry ſtood.</l>
