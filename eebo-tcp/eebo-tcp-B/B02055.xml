         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>Ur Care and Endeavours for the Preſervation of the Rights and Intereſts of the Church, have been ſufficiently manifeſted to the World, by the whole courſe of Our Government, ſince Our happy Reſtauration, and by the many and frequent wayes of Coercion that We have uſed for reducing all Erring or Diſſenting Perſons, and for compoſing the unhappy Differences in matters of Religion, which We found among Our Subjects upon Our Return: But it being evident, by the ſad experience of twelve years, that there is very little fruit of all thoſe forceable Courſes, We think Our Self oblieged to make uſe of that Supream Power in Eccleſiaſtical Matters, which is not only inherent in Us, but hath been Declared and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognized to be ſo by ſeveral Statutes and Acts of Parliament; And therefore, We do now accordingly iſſue this Our Declaration, as well for the quieting the Minds of Our good Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects in theſe Points, for inviting Strangers in this Conjuncture, to come and live under Us, and for the better Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement of all to a chearfull following of their Trade and Callings, from whence we hope by the Bleſſing of GOD, to have many good and happy Advantages to Our Government; As alſo, for preventing for the future, the danger that might otherwiſe ariſe from Private Meetings, and Seditious Conventicles.</p>
            <p>And in the firſt place, We Declare Our expreſs Reſolution, Meaning and Intention to be, That the <hi>Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> be preſerved, and remain entire in its Doctrine, Diſcipline and Government, as now it ſtands Eſtabliſhed by Law; And that this be taken to be, as it is, the Baſis, Rule, and Standard of the General and Publick Worſhip of GOD, and that the Orthodox conformable Clergy do receive and enjoy the Revenues belonging thereunto: And that no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, though of a different Opinion and Perſwaſion, ſhall be exempt from paying his Tythes, or other Dues whatſoever. And further We Declare, That no perſon ſhall be capable of holding any Benefice, Living, or Eccleſiaſtical Dignity or Preferment of any kind, in this Our Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> who is not exactly conformable.</p>
            <p>We do in the next place Declare Our Will and Pleaſure to be, That the Execution of all and all manner of Penal Laws in Matters Eccleſiaſtical, againſt whatſoever ſort of Non-conformiſts or Recuſants, be immediately Suſpended, and they are hereby Suſpended. And all Judges, Judges of Aſſize and Goal-delivery, Sheriffs, Juſtices of the Peace, Mayors, Bayliffs, and other Officers whatſoever, whether Eccleſiaſtical or Civil, are to take notice of it, and pay due Obedience thereunto.</p>
            <p>And that there may be no pretence for any of Our Subjects to continue their illegal Meetings and Conventicles, We do Declare, That We ſhall from time to time allow a ſufficient number of Places, as they ſhall be deſired, in all parts of this Our Kingdom, for the uſe of ſuch as do not Conform to the <hi>Church of England,</hi> to meet and aſſemble in, in order to their Publick Worſhip and Devotion; which Places ſhall be open and free to all perſons.</p>
            <p>But to prevent ſuch diſorders and inconveniencies as may happen by this Our Indulgence, if not duly regulated, and that they may be the better protected by the Civil Magiſtrate, Our expreſs Will and Pleaſure is, That none of Our Subjects do preſume to meet in any Place, untill ſuch Place be allowed, and the Teacher of that Congregation be approved by Us.</p>
            <p>And leſt any ſhould apprehend, that this reſtriction ſhould make Our ſaid Allowance and Approbation difficult to be obtained, We do further Declare, that this Our Indulgence, as to the Allowance of the publick Places of Worſhip, and Approbation of the Teachers, ſhall extend to all ſorts of Non-conformiſts and Recuſants, except the Recuſants of the Roman Catholick Religion, to whom We ſhall in no wiſe allow publick Places of Worſhip, but only indulge them their ſhare in the common Exemption from the execution of the Penal Laws, and the exerciſe of their Worſhip in their private Houſes only.</p>
            <p>And if after this Our Clemency and Indulgence, any of Our Subjects ſhall preſume to abuſe this Liberty, and ſhall Preach ſeditiouſly, or to the derogation of the Doctrine, Diſcipline or Government of the Eſtabliſhed Church, or ſhall meet in Places not allowed by Us, We do hereby give them warning, and Declare, We will proceed againſt them with all imaginable ſeverity: And We will let them ſee, We can be as ſevere to puniſh ſuch Offenders, when ſo juſtly provoked, as We are indulgent to truly Tender Conſciences.</p>
