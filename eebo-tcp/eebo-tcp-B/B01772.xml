            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE Defendants Pleaded to the <hi>Scire Facias</hi> in <hi>Eaſter</hi>-Term, 1681. Reciting the Letters Patents, <hi>in haec ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba; Charles</hi> the Second, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> not doubting but that Sir <hi>Robert Sawyer,</hi> the Kings Attorny General, had been ſatisfied therewith, and that the Letters Patents ought not to be Repealed or made void, upo<gap reason="illegible: damage" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> that Writ of <hi>Scire Facias,</hi> without ſatisfaction made to the Grantees.</p>
            <p>But the Attorny General having lately put in a Demurrer to the ſaid Plea, unto which the Defendants rejoyned, ſo that the Record being made up and read in Court, on <hi>Saturday</hi> laſt, the 20th. of this Inſtant <hi>May,</hi> 1682. (conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of five large Skins of Parchments; The Lord Chancellor was pleaſed to appoint <hi>Tueſday</hi> following to argue the ſame; Declaring, That he would give Judgment thereupon on <hi>Saturday</hi> next, although Mr. <hi>Wallop</hi> and Mr. <hi>Whitlock,</hi> the Defendants Council, prayed longer time to conſult thereon, for that a Copy of the Record could not be made in that time.</p>
            <p>Divers Debates in this Affair paſſed the High Court of <hi>Admiralty,</hi> the <hi>Council Table,</hi> the <hi>Commons</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> in Parliament, and the Deputies of the States General ſeveral years together, before it was brought into this Solemn and judicial Grant of Letters Patents, and therefore worthy of that conſideration, to be Argued ſolemnly before the Lord Chanchellor of <hi>England,</hi> for his Judgment therepon; and the rather becauſe the KING himſelf ſays, in the Body of the Patent, <hi>That he is bound in Juſtice and Honour to ſee the Debt and Damages Satisfied and Repaired;</hi> which is not done in the leaſt meaſure to this day.</p>
            <p>It may be conſidently affirmed (all circumſtances conſidered) That there was never two ſuch Families as Sir <hi>William Courten</hi> and Sir <hi>Paul Pindars,</hi> that merrited ſo much from the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> ſo Barborouſly uſed abroad, and ſo much neglected at home.</p>
            <p>The Attorny General, by his <hi>Demurrer,</hi> admits all to be true in the Defendants PLEA, That nothing was paid to the Defendants, or recoverd of the ſaid Debt and Damages, out of the Prizes, taken by the Kings Ships, or out of the 800000 Patacoones, mentioned in the PLEA, (and ingroſſed by the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> and others,) or by any other money from the States of <hi>Holland,</hi> or the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Company of the <hi>Netherlands.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Defendants cannot admit any thing in the <hi>Scire Facias,</hi> to be effectual in the Law, againſt the force of the Grant in the Letters Patents (<hi>quo uſque</hi>) until the Debt and Damages with Coſts be recovered and ſatisfied; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though a Treaty at <hi>Breda</hi> is urged in Bar againſt the Defendants; Dated 21th. of <hi>July</hi> 1667. as recited in the <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re Facias,</hi> but no Inrolment thereof, that the Subjects might reſort thereunto according to Law, and it ought to be made a Record (otherwiſe it cannot any ways invalide this Grant; However, ſuch a particular Right cannot by Law be taken away, by any Publick Treaty: Then Mr. Attorny General farther ſays, That the Treaty at <hi>Breda</hi> was Renewed, Ratified and Confirmed, by a ſecond Treaty, Proclamed and Publiſhed, and alſo mentions a preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>Superſedeas,</hi> Dated <hi>Sexto die Junij,</hi> in the 32 year of the King, but recites no Records or Inrolments thereof, in regard they erroneouſly recite the names of ſome perſons for others.</p>

                  <hi>Some</hi> Reaſons <hi>and</hi> Arguments, <hi>why the</hi> Letters Patents <hi>ought not to be Repealed or Vacated, upon this</hi> Scire Facias, <hi>before ſatisfaction made to the</hi> Grantees.</head>
               <p n="1">1. IN the Caſe of a Spoyle, there is no other remedy but REPRISALS, which are in the nature of a <hi>Withernam,</hi> and if the <hi>Remedy</hi> be taken away, the <hi>Right</hi> is ſuſpended; which the Law will not admit in any Caſe that there ſhould be a failer of <hi>Juſtice.</hi> The Laws and Statutes of this Realm are poſitive in this Caſe: In the 27th of <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 17. the Act of Parliament ſays, <hi>That if Merchants of</hi> England, <hi>ſhall be indamaged or ſpoyled at Sea, by the Subjects of any other Prince, they ſhall have the Law of</hi> Marque <hi>or</hi> Repriſals, <hi>without Fraud or Deceit.</hi> Which Expreſſes and Imploys an effectual Releif for the Debt and Damages, and the <hi>ſcire facias</hi> cannot have any Influence upon the <hi>Letters Patents,</hi> there being no ſuch perſons therein concerned as is mentioned in the Record, upon which Iſſue is joyned.</p>
               <p>The Law of Nations, ſo ſoon as the Damages are made Evident, and the Grant paſſed for Recovery, Inveſts the Debt in the Grantee, as an Inviolable Right, to be Repaired upon the Nation, whoſe Subjects did the Wrong, wherefore the Creditors and Grantees in this Caſe would be left in a miſerable Condition, after the Expence of Ten Thouſand Pounds and upwards, to acquire the Grant by ſuch ſteps and meaſures as they have taken, if it ſhould reſt in the Kings Power (without any ſatisfaction to the perſons intereſſed and injured) to Retract his own Act paſſed upon ſuch valuable Conſiderations, and wherein he was not deceived in his Grant, that coupled an Intereſt with an Authority, as the Law directs of common Right, for Relief of his Subjects.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Hollanders</hi> pretend, That the King in Juſtice and Honor is oblieged to pay the <hi>Defendants</hi> the Debt and Dammages (out of the 800000 <hi>Pattacoons</hi>) which hath been ſo uſeful to his Majeſty, but the Grantees and others clayming under them, have patiently expected &amp; ſought after Reparations by the ordinary means preſcribed by Law, putting both his Majeſty, the States General, and the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> in Mind, by taking ſome ſmall quantities of Corn and Wine, for their Refreſhment (which was by Force and Power indirectly, taken from them again) and the Poor Seamen Tryed for <hi>Fellony</hi> and <hi>Piracy,</hi> for ſeeking after their Goods by Lawful Authority; yet the <hi>Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants</hi> are ready to take any Reaſonable Satisfaction from either Party, and give up the <hi>Letters Patents,</hi> concerning the Spoyles and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>predations mentioned therein, not excluding Themſelves from purſuing their Right at Law, upon Civil and perſonal Actions depending in <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Zealand,</hi> upon other Accounts, Bills of <hi>Exchange,</hi> and Obligations for Monys Lent, wherein the Opinions of the Lord <hi>Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor,</hi> the late Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Rainsford,</hi> and the Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>North,</hi> were tranſmitted to the States, affirming, That Juſtice ought to be adminiſtred in thoſe Caſes, according to the Laws of <hi>England,</hi> where the Contracts were Originally made. And in the mean time be obliged to make no further Entries of Ships to put in Execution the ſaid <hi>Letters Patents,</hi> for Repriſals until the <hi>ſcire facias,</hi> Plea, Demurrer, and Rejoynder be Solemnly argued on both Sides, according to Common Juſtice for Judgment of the Court, or that any other Expedients may be found out how the Debt and Damages may be repaired and ſatisfied. That the Hiſtory of this woful Cauſe may not riſe up in Judgment in future Ages, againſt thoſe that have eaten the Bread of Grieved and Oppreſſed Orphants and Widdows.</p>
