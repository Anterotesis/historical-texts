         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE SAYINGS Of that Reverend and Great Preacher Mr. S. CHARNOCK, Who departed this Life on <date>
                  <hi>Wedneſday</hi> the 28 of <hi>July,</hi> 1680,</date> and was ſolemnly Interred the 30th following.</head>
            <list>
               <item>ONE would ſcarce imagin ſuch an inward neſt of wickedneſs as is in a natural man; but God hath af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed it: and if the ſinner ſhould deny it, his own heart would give him the lye.</item>
               <item>Thoughts are then ſinful when they have a bad principle, want a due end, and converſe with the object in a wrong manner.</item>
               <item>The holineſs of God is ſeen in forbidding ſin, his wiſdom in permitting ſin, his mercy in pardoning ſin, and his juſtice in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing ſin.</item>
               <item>Such evils as skip up from our natural corruption, and ſink down again as fiſh in a river, theſe are ſins though we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent not to them; becauſe though they are without our will, they are not againſt our nature, but ſpring from an inordinate frame of a different hue from what God implanted in us.</item>
               <item>The Idolatry of the mind is when we dreſs up a god accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to our own humors, humanize him, and aſcribe to him what is grateful to us, though never ſo baſe and unworthy of his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, <q>
                     <bibl>
                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.21.</bibl>
                     <hi>Thou thought I was ſuch a one as thy ſelf.</hi>
                  </q>
               </item>
               <item>'Tis the frequent buſineſs of mens minds to flutter about things without the bounds of Gods revelation.</item>
               <item>Worldly concerns may quarter in our thoughts, but they muſt not poſſeſs all the room, and thruſt Chriſt into a manger.</item>
               <item>Some mens fancies are like a Carriers bag ſtuft with a world of Letters, having no dependance one upon another, ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining buſineſs, and others nothing but froth.</item>
               <item>As the more delight there is in any holy ſervice, the more precious it is in it ſelf, and more grateful to God; ſo the more pleaſure there is in any ſinful motion, the more malignity there is in it.</item>
               <item>'Tis very dangerous when the mind doth brood upon a ſinful motion, to hatch it up, and invent Methods for performance.</item>
               <item>Gods law is ſuitable to his Soveraignty, as mens Laws are to theirs; muſt they not then be as extenſive as Gods dominion, and reach even to the privateſt cloſets of the heart?</item>
               <item>'Tis not for the honour of Gods holineſs, righteouſneſs, good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to let the Spirit which bears more flouriſhing characters of his Image than the body, range wildly about without a legal curb.</item>
               <item>Man was created both with a diſpoſition and ability for holy contemplation of God; the firſt glances of his ſoul were pure, he came every way compleat out of the mint of his infinitely wiſe and good Creator.</item>
               <item>Sin is the key that opens the flood-gates of Divine vengeance, and broaches both the upper and neather Ciſterns to overflow the world.</item>
               <item>Our good thoughts will be our accuſers for not obſerving them, and our bad thoughts will be inditements againſt us for complying with them.</item>
               <item>The tongue was only an inſtrument to expreſs what mans heart did think, and would have been wholly innocent had not his thoughts been firſt criminal.</item>
               <item>There is an infinite variety of conceptions, as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſpeaks of the Sea, <hi>Wherein are all things creeping innumerable both ſmall and great;</hi> and a conſtant generation of whole ſhoals of them, that you may as well number the fiſh in the Sea, or the atoms in the Sun-beams as recount them.</item>
               <item>A Hypocrites religious ſervices are materically good; but poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned by the imagination ſeulking in the heart, that gave birth unto them.</item>
               <item>Evil thoughts are the immediate ſpawn of Original corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and therefore partake more of the ſtrength and nature of it, ſucking the breſt of that poyſonous dam that bred them.</item>
               <item>In carnal ſins Satan is a tempter, in Mental an actor; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the one we are conformed to his will, in the other we are transformed unto his likeneſs; in outward we evidence more obedience to his Laws, in inward more affection to his Perſon.</item>
               <item>Where there is more enmity to God, there is more of ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and love to the Devil; a near approach to the Diabolical nature, implying a greater diſtance from the Divine.</item>
               <item>The Underſtanding is more excellent than the Will, both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we know and judg before we will; or ought to will only ſo much as the Underſtanding thinks ſit to be willed.</item>
               <item>God being the Father of ſpirits, ſpiritual wickedneſs of nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing evil thoughts is a caſhiering all child-like likeneſs to him.</item>
               <item>What a maſs of vanity ſhould we find in our minds if we could bring our thoughts in the ſpace of one day, yea but one hour to an accompt, how many fooliſh thoughts with our wiſdom, ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant with our knowledg, worldly with our heavenlineſs, hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocritical with our Religion, and proud with our humiliation.</item>
               <item>Were we really and altogether Chriſtians, would not that which is the chiefeſt Purity of Chriſtianity be our pleaſure, and would we any more wrong God in our ſecret hearts, than in the open ſtreets?</item>
               <item>He that lets his mind wallow in a cinque of phantaſtical fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, robs God of his due, and his Soul of its happineſs.</item>
               <item>We can more eaſily reſiſt Temptations without, if we conquer motions within: Thoughts are the Mutiniers of the ſoul, which ſet open the Gates for Satan; he hath held a ſecret Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence with them (ſo far as he knows them) ever ſince the fall.</item>
               <item>Chriſt dyed to reſtore God to his right, and man to his hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs; neither of which can perfectly be attained, till thoſe be thrown out of the poſſeſſion of the heart.</item>
               <item>A ſanctified reaſon would both diſcover and ſhame our natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral follies.</item>
               <item>As all animal operations, ſo all the ſpiritual motions of our heads depend upon the life of our hearts.</item>
               <item>As there is a law in our members to bring us into the Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity to the law of ſin; ſo there muſt be a law in our minds to bring our thoughts to the obedience of Chriſt.</item>
               <item>Till the underſtanding <hi>be born of the Spirit,</hi> it will delight in, and think of nothing but things ſuitable to its fleſhly origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal; but when 'tis ſpiritual, it receives new impreſſions, new re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finings and motions ſuitable to the Holy Ghoſt, of whom it is born.</item>
               <item>Without skill in the Scriptures, we ſhall have as fooliſh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits of divine Things, as ignorant men without the Rules of which they never ſaw.</item>
               <item>The Devil had not his Engines ſo ready to aſſault Chriſt, as Chriſt from his knowledg had Scripture-Precepts to oppoſe him.</item>
               <item>None have more pleaſant thoughts of divine Things, than new Converts when they firſt claſp about Chriſt; partly from the Novelty of their ſtate, and partly becauſe God puts a new ſtock into them for improvement.</item>
               <item>If you cannot tell the time when you firſt cloſed with Chriſt, recollect thoſe ſeaſons wherein you have found your affections moſt fervent, your thoughts moſt united, your mind moſt ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated, and endeavour to gain that again.</item>
               <item>'Tis difficult to divorce our hearts and thoughts from what appears lovely and glorious in our minds, whether it be God or the World.</item>
               <item>He that is winged with a divine Love to Chriſt, will have fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent glances and flights towards him.</item>
