            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>I Send this to give Your Grace an Account of a Fight I had yeſterday with the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my at <hi>Cavan.</hi> On <hi>Munday</hi> at four a Clock in the Afternoon, I left this place, with a Detachment of 700 Foot, and 300 Horſe and Dragoons; I paſſed the River about Twelve at Night, within two Miles of <hi>Ballibays,</hi> where were two of the Enemies Scouts, who gave the Signal of our Motion, by firing ſeveral Muſquets down the River, and making a Fire on a high Hill. I carried all my Men over about One a Clock, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be at <hi>Cavan</hi> an hour before day; but the Miles were ſo much lorger than I expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the way ſo dirty, and the difficulties ſo many, that I got not thither until half an hour after Day break; and when I came there, I found what I did not expect: The Duke of <hi>Berwick</hi> who came there the Night before with 2500 Men, with which, and the Men of the Garriſon, made a Body of 4000 Men; all drawn up in very good Order before the Town, and near the Fort. As ſoon as I diſpoſed my Men as the Ground would give me leave, I Charged them, and after an Hours Diſpute, we beat the in all out of the Field into the Fort: The Duke had his Horſe ſhot under him, and be in the Thigh. Coll. <hi>O Riely,</hi> who was Governour of the Town, was killed on the place, with two Lieutenant-Collonels, one a <hi>French-man,</hi> the other one <hi>Geogbagan</hi> an <hi>Iriſh-man,</hi> in great eſteem with them. Moſt of our M<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n unhappily fell on the Plunder, both on the Field, and in the Town, ſo that we were in the greateſt confuſion imaginable, which the Enemy ſeeing from the Fort, made a very ſtrong Sally upon us, and came on ſo briskly, that I thought all had been loſs: I went with all the ſpeed I could to a place where I had placed ſome Detatchments of Foot, at the beginning of the fight, who had not been engaged at all, and as Providence had ordered, found them all there, being about 250; with thoſe, and about 80 Horſe and Dragoons, I oppoſed the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, whom I judged to be about 1500; and about the ſame time, ſeeing it impoſſible to get our Men out of the Town, <hi>I</hi> ſent an Officer with a Party of Horſe, and ordered him to Fire the Town, which was immediatly done, and by that means the Soldiers were forced to quit it, and having joyned thoſe that were Fighting, we drove, the Enemy like Sheep into the Fort; which being a ſtrong place, and full of Men, and our Men Fatigued with Marching all Night, <hi>I</hi> did not think fit to Attacque it.</p>
            <p>In this firſt Action, thoſe that were Engaged, behaved themſelves very well; it was very unfortunate to us, that the Soldiers falling on the Plunder, put me udder a neceſſity of burning the Town; for there was as much proviſion in it as would have ſerved this Garis;on Six Months, all the Houſes being full of Bread, Meal, and Wheat, and vaſt quantities of Oats and Beans. The Priſoners give an Account, That the D. of <hi>Berwick</hi> was to Command a Body at <hi>Cavan</hi> of 10000 Men, which were to be made up out of a Detatchment out of the whole <hi>Army</hi>; and the firſt place he was to Attacquc was this: which was to be done this day. This, <hi>I</hi> believe, was the Army Your Grace had ſo frequent intelligence of; But I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the neck of the Deſign is now quite broke, we having deſtroyed all their Proviſions both for Horſe and Man: And what, <hi>I</hi> believe, is a greater loſs to them (we having blown up) their Ammunition which was in Town. As ſoon as my Men are refreſhed, I'le have another bout with them for the Fort, which, <hi>I</hi> believe, they will quite of themſelves, for they have no Proviſions or Cover for their Men; and <hi>I</hi> do not ſee bow they can well keep it, now the Town is deſtroy'd.</p>
            <p>I have receiv'd your Grace's Inſtructions about the Fortifications and Gariſon, which ſhall be carefully obſerved; I prefume Your Grace will ſend another Engineer, for Cap, <hi>Blood</hi> was ſhot yeſterday in the Side, and I do not know how long it will be before he will be in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to go abroad.</p>
            <p>I do not find we have loſt above Twenty Men, and I think the Enemy loſt not above Two or Three Hundred Men. Our greateſt loſt fell on my Regiment; for my Major, and two of the beſt Captains I had, were killed; That is, Capt. <hi>Armſtrong,</hi> and Cap. <hi>Mayo.</hi> We have taken of the Enemy, Priſoners, four Captains, five Lieutenants, two Enſigns, and a Quarter-maſter.</p>
