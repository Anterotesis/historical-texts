            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE CASE Of the Petitioners, <hi>William Strode</hi> and <hi>John Speke,</hi> Eſquires.</head>
            <p>IN the Burrough of <hi>Ivelcheſter,</hi> in <hi>Somerſet,</hi> it hath been the Cuſtom and Uſage, for only all Houſe-keepers, to give Votes for chooſing Members to ſerve in Parliament.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Joſeph Winter,</hi> a Barber, being Baliff on the Election Day, did partially, contrary to the Cuſtom, when he had Polled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and called for all that were Polled for Sir <hi>Edward Wyndham,</hi> Baronet, and Mr, <hi>William Helyar,</hi> admitted of ſeveral Non-reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, Tablers and Lodgers, amongſt them, whereas they were all ſeverally excepted againſt, by ſome of the Inhabitants, to have no right; alledging, that they did not Rent Houſes, and could not be called Houſe-keepers. Whereupon, the Petitioners Clerk marked the Names of fifteen of that Poll he took when they were thus objected againſt: So afterwards, Mr. <hi>Strode</hi> and Mr. <hi>Spekes,</hi> Voters, waiting in the Hall, at length were allowed to Poll for Mr.<hi>Strode.</hi> There were fifty two unqueſionable Houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keepers, whereof fifty were alſo for Mr.<hi>Speke;</hi> but then, at Laſt, ſome real Houſe-keepers, who offered to Poll for the Petitioners, were refuſed.</p>
            <p>There are but fifty eight, on the Poll, for Sir <hi>Edward Wyndham</hi> and Mr. <hi>Helyar,</hi> whereof not above forty three are Houſe-keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 line">
                  <desc>〈1 line〉</desc>
               </gap> Neither have they there any Freemen, or other Electors, then Houſe-keepers, who are not effectively one hundred in all the Burrough; ſo that the Petitioners will plainly prove, a good Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jority of the ſaid Houſe-keepers, as they now ſtand on the Poll, without adding thoſe who were refuſed them; and conſequently, the Petitioners are duely choſen.</p>
            <p>As for the Charter, it gives none any right to chooſe Members for Parliament, it only makes a Corporation conſiſting of a Baliff and twelve Capital Burgeſſes: and by the expreſs words of the ſaid Charter, the Baliff, and ſaid Capital Burgeſſes, upon Death or removal of any, they are required to go to a new choice of ſome Inhabitant to be a Capital Burgeſs: Altho', contrary hereunto, the Baliſf and Burgeſſes of late years, have Elected four Gentlemen, Non-reſidents, and did allow one of thoſe Gentlemen to be their Baliff, for ſome years ſucceſſively whilſt living at leaſt three miles then out of their Burrough.</p>
