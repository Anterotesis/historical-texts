            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>MY bléeding heart with grief and care,</l>
               <l>Doth wiſh all young Men to beware,</l>
               <l>That they no ſuch like ſteps may tread,</l>
               <l>Nor lead the life which I have led:</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>My Father was a Gentleman,</l>
               <l>As many Gallants witneſs can;</l>
               <l>He had no Son but only I,</l>
               <l>Which made his gold and ſilver flye.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>When as my Father had me ſent,</l>
               <l>To ſell his goods, or take up rent,</l>
               <l>I did conſume and waſte the ſame,</l>
               <l>In drinking or unlawful game,</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The cards and dice were my delight,</l>
               <l>I haunted taverns day and night;</l>
               <l>Lew'd Woman were my chiefeſt joys,</l>
               <l>And my Conſorts were Cut-purſe-boys,</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>God's holy Word I diſobey'd,</l>
               <l>I car'd not what the Preacher ſaid;</l>
               <l>For quaffing cans of ale and beer,</l>
               <l>Was all the ſervice I would hear.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Then acting my ungracious part,</l>
               <l>I broke my aged Father's heart,</l>
               <l>When ghaſtly Death did on him ſeize,</l>
               <l>I thought myſelf in happy caſe.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>What he had left I thought well got,</l>
               <l>But now the ſhame falls to my lot;</l>
               <l>Five hundred pound of good red gold,</l>
               <l>For wine and beer I quickly ſold.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Then was I preſt to ſerve the King,</l>
               <l>That might my name to honour bring;</l>
               <l>A Souldier's life I held it baſe,</l>
               <l>And always took it in diſgrace.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>And having thus conſum'd my ſtore,</l>
               <l>I to my Mother went for more;</l>
               <l>Who ſold and mortgaged her land,</l>
               <l>And put the mony in my hand:</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>And then with tears theſe words ſhe ſaid,</l>
               <l>Thou know'ſt my Son thy Father's dead,</l>
               <l>No more is left but I and thee,</l>
               <l>Therefore dear Son be good to me.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>If that thy love from me ſhould fall,</l>
               <l>I have no Friend on earth at all:</l>
               <l>Therefore good Son to me prove kind,</l>
               <l>And thou reward in Heaven ſhalt find.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Then on my bended knees fell I,</l>
               <l>Deſiring of the Lord on high,</l>
               <l>A ſhameful death might be his end,</l>
               <l>That would his Mother once offend.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>All you that do no reckoning make,</l>
               <l>Of ſwearing, when your words you ſpeak,</l>
               <l>Give ear to that which I will tell,</l>
               <l>Lewd Livers ſeldom dyeth well.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>You diſobedient Children all,</l>
               <l>Draw near and liſten to my fall,</l>
               <l>Example take, repent in time,</l>
               <l>Leſt that your woes be like to mine.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>You Fathers dear, and Mothers kind,</l>
               <l>Bear you this Leſſon in your mind,</l>
               <l>Truſt not too much a wicked Child,</l>
               <l>For oft times Men are ſo beguil'd:</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>When twigs are green you may them ply,</l>
               <l>But let them grow while they be dry,</l>
               <l>They will ſo <unclear>ſtiff</unclear> and ſtubborn ſtand,</l>
               <l>You cannot bend them with your hand.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>So that I ran a wicked race,</l>
               <l>And to amend had not the grace,</l>
               <l>Sixteen ſcore pound in good red Gold,</l>
               <l>Into my hand my Mother told.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But in the compaſs of one year,</l>
               <l>I ſpent it all as may appear,</l>
               <l>And having left no means at all,</l>
               <l>I unto robbing ſtraight did fall.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Thus did I ſteel my Mother's rings,</l>
               <l>Her braſs, her pewter, and ſuch things,</l>
               <l>The very bed whereon ſhe lay,</l>
               <l>I like a Villian ſtole away.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>What ever I could get or take,</l>
               <l>I thereof ſtraight did mony make;</l>
               <l>My flinty heart did feel no grief,</l>
               <l>To ſee my Mother want relief.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>At laſt ſhe grew exceeding poor,</l>
               <l>And beg'd relief from door to door:</l>
               <l>No Infidel, nor Pagan vild,</l>
               <l>Could bring to light ſo bad a Child.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>At laſt my Mother loſt her breath,</l>
               <l>As ſhe conſtrained was by Death;</l>
               <l>Who yields relief, when Friends grow ſcant,</l>
               <l>And eaſe to them that are in want.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>From place to place then was I toſt,</l>
               <l>By every Man and Woman croſt,</l>
               <l>No harbour could I get, whereby</l>
               <l>I might at night in ſafe-guard lie.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>My deareſt Kinsfolks do me chide,</l>
               <l>My deareſt Friends mock and deride,</l>
               <l>Thoſe that were my Conforts of late,</l>

            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Thoſe that have feaſted many a time,</l>
               <l>And fed upon that which was mine,</l>
               <l>Deſpiſe at me along the ſtreet,</l>
               <l>As if they ſhould a ſerpent meet.</l>

            <lg>
               <l>Both Old and Young, both Great and Small,</l>
               <l>Both Rich and Poor deſpiſe me all,</l>
               <l>No friend to take my part have I,</l>
               <l>But was conſtrain'd in fields to lie.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>In this my extream miſery,</l>

               <l>No Creature gave for my relief,</l>

            </lg>
            <lg>

               <l>His lateſt gaſp that he did fetch,</l>
               <l>Was on a dung-hill in the night,</l>
