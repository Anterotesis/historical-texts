            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E have had too ample a manifeſtation of your Affection and Duty towards Us, the good effect whereof is notorious to the World, to make the leaſt doubt of the continuance and improvement thereof, or in the leaſt degree to diſlike what you have done, <gap reason="illegible: damage" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> to complain of what you have left undone. We know well the weight of thoſe Affairs which depend upon your Counſels, and the time that muſt unavoidably be ſpent in Debates, where there muſt naturally be difference of Opinion and Judgement, amongſt thoſe whoſe deſires of the Puplique Peace and Safety, are the ſame; And neither We nor You muſt be over much troubled, if We find Our good Intentions, and the unwearied paines We take to Reduce thoſe good Intentions into Reall Acts, for the quiet and ſecurity of the Nation, miſrepreſented and miſ-interpreted, by thoſe who are in truth, afflicted to ſee the Publique Diſtractions, by Gods bleſſing, ſo near an end; and, by others upon whoſe weakneſſe, fears and jealouſies, the Activity, and cunning of thoſe Ill men, have too great an Influence.</p>
            <p>How wonderfull, and miraculous ſoever the great harmony of Affections between Us and Our good Subjects is, and that it is ſo viſible and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt to the World, that there ſcarce appears the view of any clould to overſhadow or diſturb it; yet, We muſt not think that God Almighty hath wrought the Miracle to that degree, that a Nation, ſo miſerably divided for ſo many Years, is ſo ſoon, and entirely United in their Affections and Endeavours as were to be wiſhed; but that the evil Conſciences of many Men continue ſo awake for Miſchief, that they are not willing to take Reſt themſelves, or to ſuffer others to take it: And We have all had too ſad experience of the unhappy effects of Fears and Jealouſies, how ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe and unreaſonable ſoever, not to think it very neceſſary to apply all timely and proper remedies to thoſe Diſtempers, and to prevent the Inconveniencies and Miſchiefs, which too naturally flow from thence: We well foreſaw, that the great violation which the Laws of the Land had for ſo many years ſuſtained, had filled the hearts of the People, with a terrible Apprehenſion of Inſecurity to themſelves, if all they had ſaid and done ſhould be lyable to be examined and puniſhed by thoſe Laws, which had been ſo violated; and that nothing could eſtabliſh the Security of King and People, but a full Proviſion, that the returning to the Reverence and Obedience of the Law, (which is good for Us all) ſhould not turn to the Ruine of any, who are willing and fit to receive that Protection hereafter from the Law, and to pay that Subjection to it, that is juſt and neceſſary, and therefore We made that free Offer of a General Pardon, in ſuch a manner as is expreſſed in Our Declaration, and how ready and deſirous We are to make good the ſame, appears by Our Proclamation, which We have iſſued out upon, and according to your Deſire.</p>
            <p>However it is evident, that all We have, or do offer, doth not enough compoſe the minds of Our People, nor in their Opinions can their Security be provided for, till the Act of Indemnity and Oblivion be paſſed; and We find great Induſtry is uſed by thoſe, (who do not wiſh that Peace to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome they ought to do) to perſwade Our good Subjects, that We have no mind to make good our Promiſes, which in Truth We deſire to perform for Our own ſake as well as Theirs: And We do therefore very earneſtly recommend it to you, that all poſſible expedition be uſed in the paſſing that moſt neceſſary Act, whereby Our good Subjects generally will be ſatisfied, that their Security is in their own Hands, and depends upon their future Actions, and that they are free for all that is paſt; and ſo all the Endeavours of ill Men will be diſappointed, which would perſwade them not to do well now, becauſe they have heretofore done amiſſe. And We are the more engaged to this Our Recommendation, becauſe upon the Reflection of your eminent Zeal and Affection for Our Service, and hearty Concurrence with Us in all We have deſired from you, men are apt to perſwade others (though they do not believe it themſelves) that the paſſing this Act is therefore deſerred, becauſe We do not enough preſſe the Diſpatch of it; which We do deſire from our heart, and are confident you will the ſooner do, upon this Our earneſt Recommendation.</p>
