            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE CASE OF D<hi rend="sup">R.</hi> JOHN JONES RESPONDENT, Upon the APPEAL of WILLIAM BEAW, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>THE Office of Chancellor, Principal Official, and Vicar-General of the Biſhop of <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daffe</hi> was, and is an Antient Office, and has been antiently before the Reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> uſually grantable, and granted to Two Perſons, to hold for their Lives, and the Life of the longer Liver of them.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">7. Septemb. 1671.</note>
               <hi>Francis</hi> Lord Biſhop of <hi>Landaffe,</hi>  by Letters Patents under his Epiſcopal Seal, granted this Office to Dr. <hi>Richard Lloyd</hi> and the Reſpondent <hi>John Jones;</hi> to hold to them joyntly and ſeverally, and to the longer Liver of them. Which Grant was duly confirm'd by the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of that Church, and accordingly the ſaid Dr. <hi>Richard Lloyd,</hi> for ſeveral Years, by the Reſpondent's conſent, quietly held and enjoyed the ſame.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">20. March 1674.</note>The ſaid Lord Biſhop died,  and Dr. <hi>William Lloyd</hi> ſucceeded in that Biſhoprick; and upon his Tranſlation to the Biſhoprick of <hi>Norwich,</hi> Dr. <hi>William Beaw</hi> ſucceeded, and is now the preſent Lord Biſhop of <hi>Landaffe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">June 1686.</note>The preſent Lord Biſhop of <hi>Landaffe,</hi>  having in his Cuſtody the Original Grant of this Office to Dr. <hi>Richard Lloyd,</hi> and the Reſpondent Conſtituted Commiſſioners to Execute the Office, and refuſed to admit the Petitioner to Execute and Enjoy the ſaid Offices, as by Law he ought.</p>
            <p>Whereupon the Reſpondent brought an Action at Law againſt the Appellant, and others for the Profits of the Office by them received; which Action, by the Death of One of the then Defendants abated.</p>
            <p>Afterwards, the Reſpondent brought his Bill in Equity againſt rhe Appellant, to have an Account of, and Satisfaction for the Profits of the ſaid <hi>Office,</hi> to which the Appellant anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and confeſſed the Patent and Grant to the ſaid Dr. <hi>Richard Lloyd</hi> and the Reſpondent; whereupon the Reſpondent proceeded to try his Right and Title to the ſaid <hi>Office</hi> in an Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at the Common Law againſt the Appellant; and at <hi>Glouceſter</hi>-Aſſizes, on full Evidence, obtained a Verdict, and had Judgment thereupon.</p>
            <p>That afterwards the Court of <hi>Chancery</hi> Ordered, That a Trial at Bar ſhould be had upon an Action of the Caſe for Trial of the Title of the ſaid <hi>Office;</hi> whereupon, a Trial was had at the <hi>Kings-Bench-Bar;</hi> and upon full and long Evidence, a Verdict was given for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondent, and upon the Importunity of the Appellant's Counſel, the Caſe was Stated, and Argued before all the <hi>Judges</hi> of the ſaid Court of <hi>Kings-Bench;</hi> who on Hearing ſeveral Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments on both Sides, were all of Opinion, That the Letters-Patents and Grant made to Dr. <hi>Richard Lloyd,</hi> and the Reſpondent were good in Law; and that the Reſpondent was well Intituled to the ſaid <hi>Office</hi> for his Life.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">20 Novemb. 1691.</note>That the ſaid Cauſe coming to be Heard in <hi>Chancery,</hi>  on the Equity reſerved in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Council on both Sides, the Lords-Commiſſioners were of the ſame Opinion; and Decreed an Account to be taken of the Profits of the ſaid <hi>Office,</hi> and the Reſpondent to be quieted in the Poſſeſſion and Enjoyment thereof.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Which Decree, the Reſpondent hopes is Juſt; and that it ſhall be Confirmed.</hi>
