         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <figure/>
            <p>It is not unknown to moſt who are pleaſed to take Cogniſance of Wonders and ſtrange Miracles, which this preſent Age doth frequently repreſent; that of late Years we have been exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly aſtoniſht at ſeveral (to us ſtrange and ſeldom heard of) much to be admired Wonders: But now prepare your Ears to hear the moſt amazing and moſt unparallel'd Miracle that ever <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> was made ſenſible of, or I think the whole World was ever made acquainted with; nay, ſo wonderfully ſtrange, and ſeemingly impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to be true, that though it be atteſted with manifold Aſſertions, it cannot lodge in the breaſt of the Incredulous, as an unqueſtionable Verity. But to proceed to the matter intended, and not too much to derogate from my deſined Buſineſs, let this inform the moſt doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and unbelieving Reader, That there is lately an account ſent from <hi>Italy,</hi> of the ſtrange manner of the coming of one Man into the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> eminently known by many Travellers, to be one of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties not leaſt accounted of in <hi>Italy</hi>; this Perſon of ſuch an Age (as he ſays he is) no leſs to be admired for his great Age, then for his ſtrange kind of Propheſies, which he daily parts with; and his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of coming into the City, which we are informed was inviſible; but to come to particulars: This Perſon doth affirm, That his Age is greater then e're was heard off, for he doth ſay he is above a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Years old; he doth pretend to be an Apoſtle of Jeſus Chriſt, and ſays that he hath the Spirit of Truth in him; with many other Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tions, no leſs full of Wonder then that you have already heard of in the preceeding lines: His manner of Apparel is no leſs to be admir'd then his manner of Diſcourſe, for ſuch Habit as we are informed he doth wear, was never ſeen by mortal eye; his Deportment is alſo ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſtrange, for he walks up and down the City, preaching and admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing to ſerious Repentance, and giving admirable Advice to the People to forſake their Iniquities, and to return from their evil Ways, for, ſays he, <hi>The wrath of God is kindled againſt the</hi> Romans. He alſo adds, That the City of <hi>Rome</hi> is a ſecond <hi>Sodom</hi>; and that the Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions of the People have aſcended to the Heavens, and approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Ears of the <hi>Almighty,</hi> and that nothing can preſerve them from approaching. Miſery, but ſpeedy, and unſeigned Repentance; without which, he doth aſſert, that in three Years the City ſhall be utterly deſtroyed and conſumed by Fire. By our laſt Advice we are informed, that this Man had continued there for the ſpace of eight Days, preaching about the City: his cuſtom is to go bare-headed and bare-footed, ſtrange to behold. The Magiſtrates being offended at his Doctrine, have forbidden him to preach; but he took no more notice thereof, then to return this anſwer, <hi>That he was ſent from God to move the People to Repentance, and to abandon thoſe Iniquities, which if not deſerted, would doubtleſly pull down Vengeance upon them in a ſhort time.</hi> After this, order was given for his, Confinement; which being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, he was frequently viſited by ſeveral Jeſuits, who diſcourſed with him in ſeveral Tongues, namely, the <hi>Latine, Hebrew,</hi> and <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dean,</hi> wherein he was exquiſitely perfect. He alſo acknowledges that he knows well ſuch as live looſe and wicked Lives. Ha is not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercurious in his Dyet, for his greateſt Delicate, and general Food is nothing but dry Bread; and his ſtrongeſt Drink is Water only. He propheſies of many ſtrange things, and the time when ail the Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs in the World ſhould have an end, and every one ſhall ſerve the Lord; and wormp the God of Heaven than Nation ſhall no more riſe againſt Nation, nor Kingdom againſt Kingdom, all the World ſhall be at peace. Being asked by ſome of the amazed People, whoſe aſtoniſhments were as great as his anſwers ſtrange, How long it would be before this bleſſed Day would come? His reply was abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, and about the Year 1699, ſhould certainly be the end of all Wickedneſs in the World: all Nations ſhall live in the fear of the Lord; all the World ſhall be at peace. His ſtrange and unknown coming into that City was admired by all: at laſt he was examined by the Magiſtrates from whence he came: He anſwered, That he came from a place called <hi>Galadiam</hi> in <hi>Damas,</hi> a City of <hi>Gallilea,</hi> and is the Meſſenger of the <hi>Almighty,</hi> ſent to preach Repentance to the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful World. But the Jeſuits not at all pleaſed with his Doctrine or Diſcourſe, have prevalently perſwaded their Magiſtrates to conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend to what they ſo earneſtly requeſted, which is, That this Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, on whom we know not what Title juſtly to beſtow, ſhould by all means be conveyed to the <hi>Pope,</hi> there to be examined by his Holineſs: But he makes tittle account of what is ordered, ſaying, That he is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well acquainted with what ſhall be his Portion, and what ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of him; and that he looked upon it altogether Unneceſſary to be ſo loaded with Chains; but did acknowledge that he was very deſirous to ſee the <hi>Pope</hi>; and ſo without any difficulty, and with great eaſe, breaking the Chains all to pieces, he filled the Spectators with aſtoniſhment, as the Report of theſe Wonders will certainly fill with amazement, all thoſe to whom this matter ſhall be communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. But beſides all this, he propheſie what Transactions ſhall happen yearly, which I shall particularize as followeth: He propheſies, That</p>
            <p>In 1693 great Changes you will hear of and ſee.</p>
            <p>In 1694 ſhall be Wars over all the World.</p>
            <p>In 1695 <hi>Rome</hi> ſhall begin to fall, and <hi>England</hi> ſhall begin to thrive.</p>
            <p>In 1696 ſhall be no Pope, and <hi>Rome</hi> ſhall have no Head.</p>
            <p>In 1697 the <hi>Turk</hi> ſhall turn Chriſtian.</p>
            <p>In 1698 the Goſpel ſhall be preached throughout the World.</p>
            <p>In 1699 a great Man ſhall riſe.</p>
            <p>In 1700 all the World ſhall be at Peace.</p>
            <p>In 1701 Jeſus Chriſt ſhall be known to all Mankind.</p>
            <p>In 1702 a great Earthquake ſhall happen.</p>
            <p>In 1703 will be the time when the <hi>Jews</hi> will be called.</p>
