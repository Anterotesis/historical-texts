         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Brief REMEMBRANCER, OR, The Right IMPROVEMENT OF CHRIST'S BIRTH-DAY.</head>
            <l>THe Glorious Day doth now begin to dawn;</l>
            <l>Now is the Curtain of thick darkneſs drawn:</l>
            <l>Now doth the Lord of all things condeſcend</l>
            <l>To take up in a Stable, and be pen'd</l>
            <l>Within a dirty Manger: Now thou'rt bleſt</l>
            <l>Ignorant Inn with this moſt Glorious Gueſt.</l>
            <l>And now the Saviour of the World's reveal'd</l>
            <l>From Heaven to Shepherds watching in the Field.</l>
            <l>The Glory of an Angel did ſurround them:</l>
            <l>The Glory was ſo great, it did confound them.</l>
            <l>Fear not, ſaid he, perceiving them afraid,</l>
            <l>Fear not all, be not at all diſmay'd:</l>
            <l>'Tis Joyful Tydings that I come to bring,</l>
            <l>This Day is born your Sav'our and your King;</l>
            <l>In <hi>Bethlehem</hi> you'l find it as I ſaid,</l>
            <l>The Babe's wrapt up, and in a Manger laid.</l>
            <l>And hardly had the Angel made an end,</l>
            <l>But there whole Quires of Angels did attend</l>
            <l>That King with <hi>Hallelujahs</hi> to adore,</l>
            <l>That ſitteth on the Throne for evermore.</l>
            <l>Glory to God on High, Peace on the Earth,</l>
            <l>Good will to Men they Sung with holy Mirth.</l>
            <l>Then ran the Shepherds to the Town, and ſaw</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Mary</hi> and <hi>Joſeph,</hi> and the Babe in Straw.</l>
            <l>They fill'd the Town with Fame; and their Relation</l>
            <l>Fill'd all that heard the ſame with Admiration.</l>
            <l>But <hi>Mary</hi> pondr'd all things in her Heart:</l>
            <l>And they with Joy and Praiſe to God depart.</l>
            <l>Him at the Time prefixt they circumcis'd,</l>
            <l>Naming Him <hi>Jeſus,</hi> as they were advis'd.</l>
            <l>Some Five Weeks after that, his Parents went</l>
            <l>Up to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> him to preſent.</l>
            <l>Now while they were i'th' Temple, came to them</l>
            <l>Old upright <hi>Simeon</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Who by the Spirit had been certifi'd</l>
            <l>Of ſeeing God's Anoynted, ere de dy'd.</l>
            <l>Fill'd with the Holy Ghoſt he came in haſt,</l>
            <l>And in his Arms that Holy Child embrac'd.</l>
            <l>Now let thy Servant Lord (ſaid he) deceaſe</l>
            <l>According to thy holy Word in Peace;</l>
            <l>For I have ſeen the thing I waited for,</l>
            <l>Now I have ſeen my LORD my Saviour.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Anna,</hi> a Proph'teſs alſo thither came</l>
            <l>To render Praiſe and Glory to his Name,</l>
            <l>Affirming <hi>Jeſus</hi> to be Chriſt, to them</l>
            <l>That waited for him at <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>The Wiſe-men from the Eaſt enquire for one</l>
            <l>Born amongſt them to ſit on <hi>Judah</hi>'s Throne:</l>
            <l>We've ſeen ſaid they the Star of your Great King,</l>
            <l>And came to worſhip with our offering.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Herod</hi>'s Amaz'd with this ſtrange ſuddain News,</l>
            <l>With all the Learned Rabbies of the <hi>Jews:</hi>
            </l>
            <l>And having askt the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors, where</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Meſſiah</hi> ſhould be Born? 'twas made appear</l>

            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>Micah</hi> ſends forth this Ruler over them.</l>
            <l>Then <hi>Herod,</hi> after private Conference</l>
            <l>About the Star's appearing, ſent them thence:</l>
            <l>Deſiring them to ſearch and find him out,</l>
            <l>Then to Return, and tell him where about.</l>
            <l>But warn'd of God to flee the Tyrant, they</l>
            <l>Returned home again another way.</l>
            <l>But ſeeing he was mockt, in curſed Fury</l>
            <l>Reſolves the Death of every Child in <hi>Jury.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>But the all-piercing Eye this ſecret views,</l>
            <l>And unto <hi>Joſeph</hi> ſwiftly ſends the News.</l>
            <l>Up (ſaid the Angel) Take the Child, and's Mother;</l>
            <l>This place is not ſecure, go ſeek another.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Herod</hi> hath Murd'rous thoughts, his rage is ſtir'd,</l>
            <l>Go dwell in <hi>Egypt,</hi> till I bring you word.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Joſeph</hi> obey'd, and there he ſtay'd, till thence</l>
