         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>
                  <hi>COFFEE,</hi> a kind of <hi>Turkiſh Renegade,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Has late a match with <hi>Chriſtian water</hi> made;</l>
               <l>At firſt between them happen'd a Demur,</l>
               <l>Yet joyn'd they were, but not without great <hi>ſtir;</hi>
               </l>
               <l>For both ſo cold were, and ſo faintly met,</l>
               <l>The <hi>Turkiſh Hymen</hi> in his <hi>Turbant</hi> ſwet.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Coffee</hi> was cold as <hi>Earth, Water</hi> as <hi>Thames,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>And ſtood in need of recommending Flames;</l>
               <l>For each of them ſteers a contrary courſe,</l>
               <l>And of themſelves they ſue out a Divorce.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Coffee</hi> ſo brown as berry does appear,</l>
               <l>Too ſwarthy for a Nymph ſo fair, ſo clear:</l>
               <l>And yet his ſails he did for <hi>England</hi> hoiſt,</l>
               <l>Though cold and dry, to court the cold and moiſt;</l>
               <l>If there be ought we can as love admit;</l>
               <l>'Tis a hot love, and laſteth but a fit.</l>
               <l>For this indeed the cauſe is of their ſtay,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Newcaſtle's</hi> bowels warmer are than they:</l>
               <l>The melting Nymph diſtills her ſelf to do't,</l>
               <l>Whilſt the Slave <hi>Coffee</hi> muſt be <hi>beaten</hi> to't:</l>
               <l>Incorporate him cloſe as cloſe may be,</l>
               <l>Pauſe but a while, and he is none of he;</l>
               <l>Which for a truth, and not a ſtory tells,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>No Faith is to be kept with Infidels.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Sure he ſuſpects, and ſhuns her as a Whore,</l>
               <l>And loves, and kills, like the <hi>Venetian Moor;</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Bold Aſian Brat! with ſpeed our confines flee;</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Water,</hi> though common, is too good for thee.</l>
               <l>Sure <hi>Coffee's</hi> vext he has the breeches loſt,</l>
               <l>For ſhe's above, and he lies undermoſt;</l>
               <l>What ſhall I add but this? (and ſure 'tis right)</l>
               <l>The Groom is <hi>heavy,</hi> cauſe the Bride is <hi>light.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>This canting <hi>Coffee</hi> has his Crew enricht,</l>
               <l>And both the <hi>Water</hi> and the <hi>Men</hi> bewicht.</l>
               <l>A Coachman was the firſt (here) <hi>Coffee</hi> made,</l>
               <l>And ever ſince the reſt <hi>drive on</hi> the trade;</l>
               <l>

                  <hi>Ver boon for de ſtomach, de Cough, de Ptiſick,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>And I believe him, for it looks like Phyſick.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Coffee</hi> a cruſt is charkt into a coal,</l>
               <l>The ſmell and taſte of the Mock <hi>China</hi> bowl;</l>
               <l>Where huff and puff, they labor out their lungs,</l>
               <l>Leſt <hi>Dives</hi> like they ſhould bewail their tongues.</l>
               <l>And yet they tell ye that it will not burn,</l>
               <l>Though on the Jury Bliſters you return;</l>
               <l>Whoſe furious heat does make the water riſe,</l>
               <l>And ſtill through the Alembicks of your eyes.</l>
               <l>Dread and deſire, ye fall to't ſnap by ſnap,</l>
               <l>As hungry Dogs do ſcalding porrige lap,</l>
