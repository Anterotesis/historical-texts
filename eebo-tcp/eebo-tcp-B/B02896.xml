            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He ſaid <hi>Abraham Vandenbemde</hi> with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the ſaid confederates (having laid a Plot to take away the life of Mrs. <hi>Anne Levingſton,</hi> becauſe the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <hi>Powel</hi> had given her an eſtate which ſome of them expected) in <hi>December</hi> laſt repaired to one <hi>Jone Simpſon,</hi> and proffered her 10 <hi>l.</hi> in hand, and 500 <hi>l.</hi>
more in Hillary term following, if ſhe would ſwear that Mrs. <hi>Levingſton</hi> had uſed ſorcery &amp; withcraſt to take away the Lady <hi>Powels</hi> life. And on the 10 of <hi>Jan.</hi> then following, one <hi>Anne Hook</hi> (who pretends her ſelf to be a cunning woman) being imployed by the ſaid confederates, did per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade her thereunto, offering her ſix ſcore pounds, and half the money which the ſaid <hi>Vandenbemde</hi> and the ſaid <hi>Cr<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>mp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> were to give her and her husband for making their Affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>davits, if ſhe would do the like. But the ſaid <hi>Simpſon</hi> ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hominating ſo wicked a practice, to take away an innocent Gentlewomans life, diſcovered the Plot; for which conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racies of the ſaid confederates, a ſpeciall Supplicavit was granted out of Chancery, to bind them to the good beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:180195:3"/>
and other legal proſecutions are ſtill depending a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them. But the ſaid confederates not reſting there (in further proſecution of the Plot) did imploy the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid <hi>Hook,</hi> to procure witneſſes to ſwear what they deſired: who accordingly about <hi>January</hi> laſt came to the above-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Jone Peterſon,</hi> at her houſe in Spruce Iſland near Wap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping and there made offer of 100 <hi>l.</hi> to her, to ſwear, that the ſaid Mrs. <hi>Levingſton</hi> had received from her (the ſaid <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terſon</hi>) certain powders, and bags of ſeeds, to help her in her law ſuits, and to provoke unlawfull love (as the ſaid <hi>Jone Peterſon</hi> did affirm before her triall.) But ſhe refuſing to do the ſame, the ſaid confederates to prevent the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which juſtly and vnavoidably muſt have befallen them, in caſe the ſaid <hi>Peterſon</hi> ſhould have revealed this their practice, as <hi>Simpſon</hi> (before) had done the other, they lay a new deſign, to anticipate the ſame, as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</p>
            <p>On the 7th of <hi>March</hi> laſt, the ſaid confederates came to Wapping, and got a warrant from one Mr. <hi>Waterton</hi> a Juſtice of the Peace, to apprehend the ſaid <hi>Peterſons</hi> perſon, and to ſearch her houſe for Images of Clay, Hair, &amp; Nails, which accordingly they did; but upon ſtrict ſearch and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent inquiry could find no ſuch thing; whereupon the ſaid confederates carried her before the ſaid Juſtice, to have her examined where the ſaid <hi>Vandenbemde, Collet</hi> (their Solli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citour) and two or three other perſons whom they brought with them, ſate at the table as the Juſtices Clerks to take her examination, where the ſaid Juſtice examined the ſaid <hi>Peterſon</hi> upon oath (contrary to law) concerning her uſing of witchcraft and ſorcery to take away the life of the Lady <hi>Powel</hi> of <hi>Chelſey.</hi> To which ſhe anſwered, that ſhe never u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſorcery or Witch-craft, neither had ſhe ever heard of the Lady <hi>Powel,</hi> ſaving that not long before one <hi>Anne Hook</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:180195:3"/>
(an Iriſh woman) came to her with one Goodwife <hi>Garland</hi> to have perſwaded her to have made ſuch an oath againſt Mrs. <hi>Levingſton,</hi> as ſhe the ſaid <hi>Hook</hi> her ſelf before had done, as the ſaid <hi>Jone Peterſon</hi> likewiſe did affirm before her death. Whereupon the ſaid Iuſtice (contrary to law) gave order to ſearch her, which was done; but the ſearchers could find nothing on her body which might create the leaſt ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition in them of her being a witch; whereupon the ſaid Juſtice took bayl for her appearance at the next Seſſions. And on the 14 of <hi>March</hi> following (being the Sabboth day) was by the ſaid confederates means, again apprehended, and examined a new, about the ſaid Lady <hi>Powels</hi> death. And the Argument which they then made uſe of to perſwade the ſaid <hi>Peterſon</hi> to confeſs, was, that ſhe needed not fear what ſhe confeſſed, for it was not her life they aimed at, but to have matter whereby to accuſe one Mrs. <hi>Levingſton,</hi> who had gotten the ſaid Lady <hi>Powels</hi> eſtate, and thereby had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done 36 Perſons of the ſaid Ladyes Kindred: And then told her, that they were ſhortly to queſtion the ſaid Mrs. <hi>Levingſtone</hi> for the ſame, either in the <hi>Parliament</hi> houſe, or before a Committee (as the ſaid <hi>Jone Peterſon</hi> did like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe affirme before her death.) Whereunto the ſaid <hi>Jone Peterſon</hi> replyed, that ſhe never knew, nor heard of the ſaid Lady <hi>Powell,</hi> otherwiſe as aforeſaid; And that ſhe had not heard from the ſaid Mrs. <hi>Levingſtone</hi> for above a yeare before that time: Then they cauſed her (contrary to Law) to be ſearched againe in a moſt unnaturall &amp; Barbarous man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, by fower women whom they themſelves for that purpoſe had brought along with them, on of which women told the Juſtice that there was a Teat <note n="*" place="margin">Note that this Teat upon the view of the Phyſitians was the day before her death found to be natural' &amp; leſſe then in many other women, &amp; the ſaid Phyſitians alſo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed that ſhe was then quick with child.</note> of fleſh in her ſecret parts more then other women uſually had, whereupon the ſaid Juſtice committed her firſt to New-priſon
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:180195:4"/>
and from thence to Newgate, where ſhe was left to the ordering and mercy of one <hi>Brooks,</hi> a Keeper there, and an Agent of the ſaid confederates.</p>
            <p>On Munday the 5th. of <hi>April</hi> inſtant, two Bills of indictment were preferred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt her at Hicks-hall, <note n="*" place="margin">Note, That Sir <hi>Jo. Danvers,</hi> Mr: <hi>Snape,</hi> Mr. <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanley,</hi> and Mrs <hi>Waterton</hi> Juſtice. of the Peace were with the confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates at a Tavern near Hicks-hall, conſulting when the Bill of Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and that Sir <hi>John Danvers</hi> came and dined at the Seſſions houſe and had much pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate diſcourſe with the Recorder and many of the Juſtices and came and ſate upon the Bench at her Trial, where he hath ſeldome or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver been for theſe many years.</note> and found by the Grand-Jury, upon which indictments upon the 6th. of <hi>April,</hi> ſhe was arraigned before Mr. Recorder (who is of Councel for the conſpirators,) and on the 7 of <hi>Apr.</hi> ſhe was tried; at which triall the ſaid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates (who before had ſpent three weeks time at <hi>Wapping</hi> in procuring wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes) were preſent, with three Councel<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lors to proſecute the ſaid <hi>Peterſon.</hi> Then the Court proceeded upon the firſt indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which was for bewitching the Lady <hi>Powel</hi> to death; whereupon many women perſons of mean degree (and of ill fame and reputation) were produced againſt her, and interrogated by the ſaid Councel, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Briefs delivered unto them, wherein were all the witneſſes teſtimonies, written before hand. And being asked what ſhe had to ſay for her ſelf? (upon her knees) ſhe took God to witneſſe that ſhe never knew the Lady <hi>Powel</hi> nor the houſe where ſhe dwelt, nor was any wiſe guilty of her death; and delivered a paper of ſuch wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes as ſhe had to defend her, deſiring that they might be called, whereupon Dr. <hi>Bates,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Colledon</hi> Phyſitians, together with Mr. <hi>Stamford,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Page</hi> Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgians,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:180195:4"/>
and divers other perſons of good quality, teſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the diſeaſe, manner of ſickneſs, and the cauſe of the ſaid Ladies death, which were the Dropſie, the Scurvey, and the yellow Jaundies, and that they wondred how ſhe was able to live ſo long, having moſt of thoſe diſeaſes growing on her for many years before; amongſt which evidences the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency of (Mrs. <hi>Levingſtone</hi>) formerly by the confederates maliciouſly aſperſed and beſpattered, was now fully vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, to their great aſtoniſhment, trouble, and diſgrace.</p>
            <p>Then the Court proceeded to the other Indictment, which was for bewitching one <hi>Chriſtopher Wilſon</hi> (who doth not himſelf complain of any ſuch thing, but the Confeder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates only:) and the only materiall evidence that then was againſt her, was one <hi>Margaret Auſtin</hi> (who had formerly been a wandering perſon, but was in charity taken up, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, and kept, by the ſaid <hi>Jone Peterſon,</hi> until ſhee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that the ſaid <hi>Auſtin</hi> had purloined ſome of her goods out of her houſe,) and two Witneſſes more; the ſubſtance of whoſe Teſtimony was as followeth. That the ſaid <hi>Wilſon,</hi> having been a long time ſick, and hearing that the ſaid <hi>Peterſon</hi> had done good to many, ſent for her to come to him, who accordingly did and adminiſtred meanes for his Recovery, which at firſt was conceived to do him good; But he afterwards relapſed, and the reaſon that was urged to induce the Court and Jury to believe that he was Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched, was, that dureing his ſickneſs, ſhee ſent to him for monyes <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Whereupon it was then depoſed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that ſhee did reply, that he had better have ſent her monies, for he ſhould be to times worſe then ever was; And that afterwards he became very ill again, and remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed languiſhing.

Then one came to the Court (a Stranger to the priſoner) and offered to depoſe, that one in black, called <hi>Thomas Southwick</hi> (knowne to be ſervant to <hi>Thomas Cromton</hi> another of the confederats) ſtood in the Seſſions yard, offering money to ſtrangers there, to come in and ſwear) that the ſaid <hi>Peterſon</hi> was a Wtich, and amongſt the reſt offered to give her mony if ſhe would doe the ſame, but he being called for, could not be had, nor would appeare, although Colonell <hi>Okey,</hi> and ſome other Juſtices upon the Bench, deſired the Recorder to take notice of it, and to give Order that the ſaid <hi>Thomas Southwick</hi> might be brought into Court. Whereupon the Jury went forth, and brought in their verdicts, that the ſaid <hi>Peterſon</hi> was not guilty upon the firſt Jndictment of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiching the Lady <hi>Powell</hi> to death; But found her guilty upon the ſecond, for which ſhe was then caſt, and the next day condemned to dye as a witch, And after that the ſaid confederates and their agents went very often to her promiſing her a Repreive or Pardon if ſhe would confeſſe

that Mrs. <hi>Levingſtone</hi> had Imployed her to make away the life of the Lady <hi>Powell,</hi> to which ſhe replyed ſhe could not, becauſe it was altogether falſe. But one of the ſaid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates urging her againe to ſay ſomething againſt Mrs. <hi>Levingſtone,</hi> ſhe told him he was a rogue, and gave him a blow on the face, which made his noſe bleed: Where it is to be noted, that what for love of money they could not tempt her to, they reſolved at laſt for love of her life to force her to, by neceſſitating her either unjuſtly to confeſſe a notorious falſehood againſt the ſaid Mrs. <hi>Levingſtone</hi> or elſe to dye without mercy or Repreive, which otherwiſe was proffered her by the ſaid Confederates, to make her un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt in doing the ſame.</p>
            <p>On the 12 day the ſaid <hi>Jone Peterſon</hi> (being brought to the place of Execution) was by the Ordinary nine or ten times earneſtly preſſed to confeſſe ſomething againſt the ſaid Mrs. <hi>Levingſtone.</hi> Whereupon the Executioner told the Ordinary, he might be aſhamed to trouble a dying woman ſo much, to which he replyed, he was commanded ſo to doe, and durſt doe no otherwiſe And afterwards the ſaid Ordinary ſtill inſiſting in his diſcourſe, and very often preſſing the ſaid <hi>Peterſon</hi> to confeſſe and diſcharge her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience before God and the world; ſhe anſwered that ſhe had already confeſſed before the Bench, all ſhe had to confeſſe; that ſhe had made her peace with God; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore deſired to dye in quiet, for now ſhe was to appeare be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God who preſently would Judge her, and that God was witnes, that ſhe dyed Innocently, and was in no wiſe guilty of what was laid to her charge, and that ſhe hoped he would freely forgive her all her ſins, and to this effect ſhe ſtill replyed to his frequent importunities: And having gone to prayers, ſhe ſhewed her ſelfe very attentive and penitent, and after Prayer called to ſing the 25th Pſalm, which ſhe performed very Chriſtianly and cheerfully, and ſo died, &amp;c.</p>
