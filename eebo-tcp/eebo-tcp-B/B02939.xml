            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>EAST-INDIA TRADE</head>
            <p>ONe of the Opinions of the Committee appointed to conſider how to preſerve the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Trade to the Nation, being (as diſcourſed of abroad) that a Stock not leſs than Fifteen Huudred Thouſand Pounds; and not exceeding Two Millions, ſhall be raiſed by Subſcriptions for the carrying on of that Trade, the true ſettling of which, as it may probably prove to the mighty Advantage of ſuch the Subſcribers to it; ſo it can bring no Benefit but a Prejudice rather, to all others not therein concerned. Now,</p>
            <p>This not yet being Reſolved in the Houſe,</p>
            <p>
               <label>'Tis Humbly Propoſed.</label>
            </p>
            <p>That a New Company may be Eſtabliſhed according to ſuch Regulations as have been Voted in the Committee, and ſhall be Agreed in the Houſe.</p>
            <p>That the ſame ſhall be Managed by a Number of Perſons (not exceeding Forty) to be Choſen by Parliament, to whom they ſhall be Accountable.</p>
            <p>That that Number of Perſons ſhall be Impowered to take up Money at <hi>Intereſt</hi> not exceeding 1500000 <hi>
                  <abbr>l</abbr>
               </hi> for carrying on of the <hi>Trade.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the Stock ſo taken up and Employed, ſhall be liable to pay the <hi>Intereſt</hi> of the ſaid Money and Principal when it can be done, and that there may be no fear of Raiſing Money enough to well carry on thus the <hi>Eaſt-India Trade.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <label>'Tis farther Propoſed,</label>
            </p>
            <p>That there ſhall be ſettled for ever, one ſingle Months <hi>Tax</hi> in a year, after the rate of 70000 <hi>
                  <abbr>l</abbr> per Menſem</hi> as a Fund to a perpetual <hi>Intereſt</hi> at 5 <hi>per Cent</hi> of 1400000 <hi>
                  <abbr>l</abbr>
               </hi> but not to be raiſed but when found needfull by the Perſons appointed to Manage the <hi>Trade.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that beſides the Money Employed in this Trade, and the Profit of it, out of which the <hi>Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt</hi> of the Money to be Borrowed for the carrying it on, may be eaſily paid here will be Land Security as a perpetual Fund for the <hi>Intereſt</hi> ſettled, ſo that ſhould the <hi>Stock</hi> fail, the Lenders will be ſecure, which will give the Conpany ſuch a Credit, they can never want <hi>Money</hi> at the loweſt <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt</hi> that any where it can be had. And,</p>
            <p>Thus the Profits firſt ariſing, may go to clear the <hi>Money</hi> firſt Borrowed, and after that is paid, to the Owners of Land in Proportions to their Eſtates as Rated to this ſingle Months Tax; and it may be hence hoped, that after the firſt five or ſix years, without paying one Penny, the Nation in general may have the whole Benefit of this great <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Trade.</p>
