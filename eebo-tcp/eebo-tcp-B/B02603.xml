            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE CASE OF <hi>Robert Balch</hi> of <hi>Bridgwater</hi> Gent. ſitting Member of Parliament for the Borough of <hi>Bridgwater,</hi> in the County of <hi>Sommerſet,</hi> petitioned againſt by <hi>John Gardner</hi> of <hi>London</hi> Merchant.</head>
            <p>THAT the ſaid Borough of <hi>Bridgwater</hi> did for a long time, <hi>viz.</hi> from the latter end of the Reign of King <hi>James</hi> the I. elect and chooſe Members in Parliament by the Common Council conſiſting of twenty four till the year 1679.</p>
            <p>That from that time the manner of Election of Members for the ſaid Corporation hath been changed on a diſpute between Sir <hi>Francis Roll</hi> and Colonel <hi>Ralph Stawell</hi> for the Right of Electon which was heard before a Committee of Parliament 1679. Where Sir <hi>Francis Roll,</hi> who was choſen by the Inhabitants paying Scot and Lot, was Voted duely Elected, that ever ſince that method of electing hath been uſed, <hi>viz.</hi> by the Voices of all the Inhabitants within the ſaid Borough, that at the time of Election ſtands rated and paid on the Poors Book, and no other Votes allowed, nor never till now attempted, as can eaſily be made out by the Election of Sir <hi>Francis Roll,</hi> Colonel <hi>Stawell,</hi> Sir <hi>Halſwell Tynt,</hi> Sir <hi>Francis Warr,</hi> and others.</p>
            <p>That on the death of Mr. <hi>Bull</hi> the laſt Member, a Writ iſſued out for chooſing ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in his Room and Place, and due notice was publickly given of the time and place of execution of the ſaid Writ, and the Court being aſſembled in the <hi>Guild-Hall,</hi> where Mr. <hi>Gardner</hi> the Petitioner was preſent; the Mayor and Aldermen called for the Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeers of the Poor, (one of whom was for the Petitioner,) and appointed them, (one with the Original Book, and the other with a Duplicate thereof) to attend the Election at the High Croſs to decide any difference that might ariſe on the Election.</p>
            <p>That this Poors Book was made in the life time of Mr. <hi>Bull,</hi> and was no way altered nor any perſon added or diminiſhed.</p>
            <p>That accordingly the Election began, and a Poll prayed and taken by two indifferent perſons agreed on.</p>
            <p>That none but thoſe who were and ſtood charged in the Poors Book, and had paid, attempted to Poll till towards the end of the Poll.</p>
            <p>That the Petitioner (who all along kept an account of the Number of the Voices and the Equallity) finding that his number of Voices was inferiour to Mr. <hi>Balches,</hi> he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon procured ſome Perſons who were not charged in the Poors Book to Poll for him, but were refuſed, on which he grounds his Petition.</p>
            <p>That Proclamation was ſeveral times made, and the Books continued open for ſome conſiderable time after, and none qualified to Vote coming in, the Poll was ſhut up and adjourned back again to the <hi>Guild-Hall,</hi> where were two Perſons of each ſide agreed upon to inſpect the Poll, and on caſting up the ſaid Poll, the majority of Voices were found to be for the ſaid Mr. <hi>Balch,</hi> who was thereupon declared and returned by the Mayor of the ſaid Borough.</p>
