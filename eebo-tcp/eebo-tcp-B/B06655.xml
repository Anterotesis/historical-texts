            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>Sir <hi>John Wintours</hi> Vindication from the Aſperſion of Deſtroying the Ship-Timber of the Forreſt of <hi>Deane.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>WHereas it hath been given out that the deſtruction of the Ship-Timber in the Forreſt of <hi>Deane</hi> was long ſince plotted by Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts upon intelligence with the <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Spanyard</hi> for the weakening of the Naval Force of this Realm, and that in purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance thereof, the ſaid Ship-Timber, hath been very much deſtroyed, and Sir <hi>John Wintour</hi> hath been, and is a principal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moter of the ſaid deſign of deſtroy ing the ſaid Ship-Timber, by vertue of certain Letters Patents obtained from the late KlNG (ot Bleſſed memory) whereby the greateſt part of the Soyl, Woods, Underwoods, Tyrnber-trees, &amp; other trees, of that Forreſt were granted unto him. And whereas the tenderneſs of that ſo precious a Comodity to this Nation as Ship-timber, with the viſible diſtruction of the ſame in that Forreſt, hath made deep &amp; deſerved impreſſion, in the mindes of many Honourable Perſons, Members of <hi>Parliament,</hi> &amp; others, to the great prejudice and ſcandal of the ſaid Sir <hi>John Wintour,</hi> he thought it his duty to vindicate his Reputation, ſo fouly aſperſed thereby, and for the clear ſatisfaction of the ſaid Honourable Members, and others aforeſaid, to publiſh this ſhort enſuing narrative concerning the ſame.</p>
            <p>It may appear by the Records of the Exchequer, That from the firſt cutting of Trees for the uſe of the Iron-works in the ſaid Forreſt, which was about the beginning of King <hi>James</hi> his Reign, till the time that the Earl of <hi>Holland</hi> held the Juſtice ſeat for the ſaid Forreſt, which was in the Year 1636. All the ſeveral grants of the ſaid Woods, and Iron-works of that Forreſt (excepting ſome very inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable quantities) were made under the Great Seal, to <hi>William</hi> Earl of <hi>Pembrock,</hi> and after his death, to Earl <hi>Philip</hi> his Brother, and once for the term of Twelve Years to the Lord <hi>Roberts,</hi> and under thoſe Grants ſo made to the ſaid Lords, the ſaid Woods and Iron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works, were reſpectively managed from time to time, by ſeveral perſons under the Rents, and Conditions, reſerved and agreed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, and the ſaid Lords.</p>
            <p>The ſaid Earle <hi>William</hi> was a perſon of that eminent great honour, wiſdom and integrity, for his Country, as alſo the ſaid Lord <hi>Roberts,</hi> and the ſaid Earl <hi>Philip</hi> ſo oppoſite to Popery, or Spaniſh intereſt, that no prudent perſon after information hereof, can ſuſpect that any of their Lordſhips would willingly, and for ſo many years together, by cutting the ſaid wood and trees, patroniſe a treaſonable deſigne againſt this Kingdom.</p>
            <p>The aforeſaid ſuggeſtion was alleged at the Juſtice ſeat, held by the Earle of Holland as aforeſaid, and in that conſideration, and for the neceſſary preſervation of the ſaid Ship-timber for the future; all the Grants of the ſaid Wood, and workes then in being to the ſaid Earl of <hi>Pembrock,</hi> or any under him, were called in, whereof Sr. <hi>John Wintour</hi> had one, for two thouſand five hundred Coards yearly, and no more, which he had the n enjoyed but for ſix years, and no longer; and ſpecial order was given for an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act Survey, and preſervation of all the ſaid Woods and Trees, to perſons of ſpecial truſt and merit, together wich the ſworn officers of the Forreſt, As appears by the Records of the ſaid Juſtice Seat.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding within one year after, or there abouts, the ſaid woods and trees with their roots and ſpray (<hi>viz.</hi> bowes) were granted withal the Iron-works <hi>viz.</hi> foure Furnaces, and as many Fordges to Sr. <hi>Bainham Throgmorton, Sr. Sackvil Crow</hi> Knights; <hi>John Taylor,</hi> and <hi>John Gunning</hi> Merchants of the City of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> for the tearm of me one and twenty years, at twelve thouſand Coards yearly beſides the ſaid Roots and Spray as by the Records appears. Which yearly proportion in leſſe time then the ſaid twenty one years, would have cauſed the cutting down of every tree then growing in the ſaid Forreſt, as evidently appears, by a Survey taken the year after, (in vertue of his Majeſties commiſſion and inſtructions) by Sr. <hi>William Maſters,</hi> Sr. <hi>Robert Cooke,</hi> Sr. <hi>Walter Pye</hi> Knights. <hi>Na<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>hanial Stephens, James Kerle</hi> then Conſtable of the ſaid Forreſt. <hi>Adrian May</hi> gentleman of his Majeſties privy chamber ſpecially nominated by his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, <hi>Henry Steevens,</hi> Gent, and others.</p>
            <p>If the cutting down of the ſaid woods and trees afterwards were ſuch a diſſervice to the Nation as aforeſaid, it ought rather to be imputed to thoſe Pattentees, then to Sr. <hi>John Wintour,</hi> though <hi>Sr. John Wintour</hi> ſayes this but in diſcharge of himſelf; not that he would aſpearſe or impute any ſuch unworthy deſigne to perſons of honour and worth as they are.</p>
            <p>For by the ſaid Commiſsion and Survey which remains upon Record, it appears that the whole quantity of the Woods and Trees in the ſaid Forreſt (the <hi>Lea Baley</hi> excepted) was One Hundred Fifty Three Thouſand Two Hundred and Nine Coards of Wood or there abouts, and Sixty one Thouſand Nine Hundred Twenty Eight Tuns of Timber or there abouts, or which ſaid quantity of Timber there was but Fourteen Thouſand Three Hundred and Fifty Loads that were Ship-Timber; and that the Trees of that Forreſt, were gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally decayed, and nor above Five Hundred but what were paſt their full growth, as by the return of the ſaid Commiſsion remaining upon record doth appear.</p>
            <p>The Conſideration hereof moved his Majeſty ſhortly after to iſſue a Commiſsion to Sir <hi>Charles Harbert</hi> his Surveyor General, <hi>John George</hi> of <hi>Cirenceſter, William Morgan</hi> then Soliciter to his Majeſties Council of the Marches of <hi>Wales, Jo. Smith</hi> of <hi>Nibley</hi> Eſquires, and <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am Singleton</hi> Alderman of the City of <hi>Glouceſter</hi> with Inſtructions from the Lord Treaſurer and Chancellor of the Exchequer, to make an approvement of his Majeſties ſaid Demeſne Waſts and Soyle, which Commiſsion and approvement was executed and made with much exactneſs and diligence, according to Law, by the ſaid Commſſioners, aſſiſted by expert Surveyors upon oath, after ſundry treaties and meetings (upon publick notice thereof given) with the Inhabitants of the ſeveral Pariſhes and Commoners upon ſeveral viewes of the ſaid Waſts and Soyle.</p>
            <p>The return of the ſaid Commiſſion is upon Record in the Exchequer, and likewiſe the particular inſtrument of the ſaid agreement ſigned by the ſaid Commſſion ers, and Commoners (who were of the ableſt and moſt ſubſtantial of the ſaid Pariſhes) was alſo returned thither, but not now to be found.</p>
            <p>Not long after his Majeſtie iſſued a Commiſſion with particular inſtructions from the Lord Treaſurer and Chancellor as aforeſaid, to <hi>Charles Bridgman</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> one of the Verderours of the ſaid Forreſt, <hi>John a Deane</hi> Gentleman, one of the Regarders of the ſaid Forreſt,</p>

               <hi>Pett and John Ducy</hi> (two of the ableſt and moſt reputed Ship-wrights of that time, particularly deputed by the Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the Navy trom the <hi>Trinity Houſe,</hi>) and others with the aſſiſtance of Ship-Wrights of <hi>Briſtoll,</hi> and other the officers of that For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt upon oath to view all the Trees within the ſaid Forreſt, that contained any Timber in them fit for his Majeſties Shiping, and to mark the ſame with a Stamp, eſpecially ſuch Trees as were fit to be left growing for the future, to certifie the number of ſuch Trees, and the quantity of Ship-Timber as aforeſaid contained in them.</p>
            <p>And by return of the ſaid Commiſſion remaining upon Record, there were marked with the Crown and broad Arrow Nine Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Five Hundred and Ninety, containing in them F<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Hereupon after mature deliberation and publick diſcuſſion at the Council Table, his Majeſty granted under the Great Seal to Sir <hi>Jo. Wintour</hi> all the ſaid improved Soyle, and all his ſaid Woods and Trees within that Forreſt, in conſideration of Ten Thouſand Pounds Fine, Eight Thouſand Pounds advance of Rent, Sixteen Thouſand pounds Ye<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rly for ſix Years, and the Fee Farm rent of Ninteen Hundred fifty PoundsTwelve Shillings and Eight Pence for ever, having firſt under the Great Seal Deaforreſted the ſame: which Defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtation with all others of the like nature by his Majeſty or any of his Predcceſſours was confirmed by Act of Parliament 17. <hi>Carol.</hi> Which Patent of Deaforreſtation by the late King was taken from Sir <hi>John Wintour</hi> by General <hi>Desborow,</hi> or by his appointment.</p>
            <p>There is reſerved in the ſaid Patent to his Majeſty, Fifteen Thouſand Tuns of Ship-Timber without paying for the ſame, with Proviſo if there prove not to be ſo much, that then Sir <hi>John Wintour</hi> was to pay Nine Shillings for every Tun that ſhould be wanting of the ſaid quantity, and if there proved to be more then the ſaid Fifteen Thouſand Tun, his Majeſty was to allow the ſaid Sir <hi>John Wintour</hi> the like rate for ſuch ſurpluſage.</p>
            <p>The like reſervation upon the ſame tearmes was made for the young trees more or leffe that ſhould be left ſtanding as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, wherewith Sr. <hi>John Wintour</hi> was chargeable for the preſervation of ſo many as were growing upon the Lands improved and granted to him as above ſaid, but not of theſe growing on the 4000. Acres ſet out for Common.</p>
            <p>Note that a tun of Timber cut into Coard-wood is not worth by a great deal ſo much as the rate aboveſaid, ſo that ſuch miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converſion of Timber could not but be a great loſſe to the Pattentee.</p>
            <p>Moreover <hi>Sr. John Wintour</hi> was obliged by the ſaid Pattent to grant to Sr. <hi>Bainham Throgmorton,</hi> Sr. <hi>Sackvil Crow, John Tayler</hi> and <hi>John Gunning</hi> thirteen thouſand five hundred Coards of wood yearly, with two of the Furnaces and four Forges for ſix years, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it appears that half of the wood in the ſaid Forreſt was to be cut down by them, though all ſeemed to be done by Sr. <hi>John Wintour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sr. <hi>John Wintour</hi> incoppiced five thouſand acres at leaſt of the ſaid ſoyle for future growth of wood and timber, which afterwards was deſtroyed and burned by ſome diſorderly and unknown perſons.</p>
            <p>Sr. <hi>John Wintour</hi> enjoyed this Pattent but one year and a half, and in that little time preſerved and left lying upon the ground ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven thouſand ſeven hundred ninty eight Loads, and twenty eight foot of Timber, as appears upon record, which was more then had been preſerved in all the cutting in that Forreſt of twenty years before. Sr. <hi>John Wintour</hi> makes no benefit of his Patent at the preſent, nor hath done this nineteen years, ſince which time there hath been cut down about threeſcore and ten thouſand trees, and in all that time but two Ships built, and much of the Timber for the ſaid Ships was taken out of the <hi>Lea Baley</hi> which was totally excepted out of his grant.</p>
            <p>If a better way can be thought on for the preſervation of the Ship-timber preſent or future, or that more will be given his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, then what he is to pay, or that a greater proportion of Common then the four thouſand acres may be allowed to the Country which in ſuch caſe is to be diſcounted to the Pattentee. Sr. <hi>John Wintour</hi> humbly offers to ſubmit all his intereſt to the juſtice and wiſdom of the Parliament upon ſatisfaction for ſo much as he is <hi>bona fide</hi> out of purſs for the ſame, notwithſtanding the profit that he might otherwiſe make thereby.</p>
