            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE CASE OF The Officers, Miniſters and At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants of his Majeſty's late Deſcent Train of Artillery, Commanded by Sir <hi>Martin Beckman.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>HIs Majeſty, by Warrant under his Royal Sign Manual, bearing date the 28th of <hi>February,</hi> 1691/2, was graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly pleas'd to conſtitute and appoint them to be in their reſpective Stations in the ſaid Train; and they accordingly ſerv'd in <hi>Flanders</hi> in the Army commanded by the the then Duke of <hi>Leinſter,</hi> until <hi>October</hi> 1692, at which time they were re-manded into <hi>England,</hi> and paid until the laſt of that month.</p>
            <p>By Order of the Principal Officers of his Majeſty's Ordnance, they gave conſtant attendance at the <hi>Tower,</hi> and were muſter'd from time to time, until the laſt day of <hi>March</hi> 1693, rendring an account of the ſeveral places of their abode, and were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd from being abſent without leave, that they might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually be in a readineſs, in caſe his Majeſty's Service ſhou'd at any time require their immediate appearance.</p>
            <p>They have not yet receiv'd any Allowance or Pay for their Service the ſaid five Months, from the firſt of <hi>November</hi> 1692, to the laſt of <hi>March</hi> 1693, notwithſtanding ſeveral Foreigners, who were upon the ſame foot and eſtabliſhment, have been fully paid and clear'd the ſame, as appears by divers Warrants directed to the Earl of <hi>Ranelagh</hi> for that purpoſe, the Copies of which they can produce.</p>
            <p>Several of them, in performing the Duty of their Attendance, and for want of Pay, were compell'd to contract Debts, which are very urgent upon them, and for which ſome are now lying in Priſon, to the great detriment of themſelves and Families; which they may juſtly attribute to their not duly receiving their Pay, and by being confin'd by ſuch attendance from following other lawful Occupations, whereby they might have earn'd ſubſiſtance.</p>
