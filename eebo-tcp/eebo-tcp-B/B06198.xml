            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>As through the City I paſſed of late</l>
               <l>Plain Dealing I met in a ſorrowful ſtate,</l>
               <l>Both Cold and Dejected, and ſlighted with all,</l>
               <l>His grief it was great, and his comfort was ſmall:</l>
               <l>Poor Conſcience ſtood by him and clearly diſmay'd,</l>
               <l>To think that they would not have him in their trade</l>
               <l>For moſt of the Nation upon them did frown,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Plain-Dealing and Conſcience is clearly run down.</hi>
               </l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>We have been a ranging the Nation all round,</l>
               <l>To ſeek entertainment, yet none can be found;</l>
               <l>The Graziers and Farmers were all in a rage,</l>
               <l>Againſt poor plain-Dealing they vow'd to engage;</l>
               <l>Each Miller came out with a luſty great Club,</l>
               <l>And bid us be gone, or our ſides they would drub,</l>
               <l>And thus we were poſted through every Town,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Plain-Dealing and Conſcience was clearly run down.</hi>
               </l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>For thus ſaid the Millers if Conſcience ſhould ſtay,</l>
               <l>We then muſt give half of our profit away;</l>
               <l>For out of a Buſhel we can't take a Peck,</l>
               <l>But Conſcience will preſently give us a check</l>
               <l>And Plain-Dealing too he is one of the crew,</l>
               <l>that ſtraight way will cry we took more then our due</l>
               <l>For this very reaſon upon us they frown,</l>

            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Our Enemies daily increaſed ſo faſt,</l>
               <l>That up to the City we traveld at laſt,</l>
               <l>For good entertainment we much did not fear,</l>
               <l>But when we come there we were never the near:</l>
               <l>The Miſers whoſe coffers was cram'd well with gold</l>
               <l>Plain Dealing and conſcience they would not behold,</l>
               <l>But knitting their brows, and upon them did frown</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Plain Dealing and Conſcience is clearly run down.</hi>

            <lg>
               <l>The Uſerers cry'd they muſt both be deny'd,</l>
               <l>Should we entertain them then what would beſide,</l>
               <l>Of this our Silver and plentiful ſtore,</l>
               <l>The which we have gotten by grinding the poor:</l>
               <l>We ſhould have no comfort, peace, quiet, nor reſt,</l>
               <l>If conſcience ſhould harbour or lodge in our breaſt,</l>
               <l>For this very reaſon upon us they frown,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Plain-Dealing and Conſcience is clearly run down.</hi>

            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But when we beheld how the Miſers did frown,</l>
               <l>We then went amongſt all the Taylors in Town,</l>
               <l>The Taylors no ſooner of Conſcience did hear,</l>
               <l>But then how they trembled and quaked for fear:</l>
               <l>But yet to poor Conſcience they gave an abuſe,</l>
               <l>And threw at <hi>Plain Dealing</hi> their ſhears &amp; their gooſe,</l>
               <l>Then knitting their brows upon us did frown,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Plain-Dealing, &amp;c.</hi>
               </l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The Taylors diſcourſed and held this diſpute,</l>
               <l>We can't pinch a Coat in the making a Suit,</l>
               <l>But Conſcience will preſently flye in our face,</l>
               <l>With frights and with fears of a future diſgrace:</l>
               <l>And thus he would have our profit but ſmall,</l>
               <l>For Conſcience allows us no Cabbidge at all,</l>
               <l>This is the main reaſon upon us they frown,</l>

               <l>Poor Conſcience he then to the Ale-wives did go,</l>
               <l>But yet they no favour nor friendſhip would ſhow:</l>
               <l>The Hoſt he did fret, and their wives they did ſums</l>
               <l>And would not ſo much as ſhow Conſcience a room</l>
               <l>For fear he ſhould into Extravegance run,</l>
               <l>And tell them of all their old tricks they had done,</l>
               <l>For this very reaſon upon us they frown,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Plain-Dealing, &amp;c.</hi>

               <l>Yet two pots for one they will commonly ſcore,</l>
