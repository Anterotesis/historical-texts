            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>AN ADVERTISEMENT,</hi> Shewing that all former <hi>Objections</hi> AGAINST THE MILLD-LEAD Sheathing Have been Anſwered by the <hi>NAVY-BOARD</hi> themſelves. <hi>And what's lately Objected, is Anſwered, herein, as follows.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>ALthough the Objections againſt this Sheathing have been fully anſwered by the <hi>Mill'd-Lead</hi> Company's Reply, made to the late Navy-Boards Report (which was dated, <hi>Octob.</hi> 28. 1682.) to the then Lords of the Admiralty, printed in the Year 1691. and by the other Papers ſince publiſhed by Mr. <hi>Hale,</hi> the ſame might all have been well enough ſpared, that Board having indeed ſufficiently anſwer'd themſelves by their own Contract with the ſaid Company, dated <hi>March</hi> 3. 1675. and their ſaid Report it ſelf, if nothing but what they ſay therein had been taken notice of: For,</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">1ſt.</note> In the Preamble of their ſaid Contract (after five years Trial upon ten Ships within that time ſheathed) they owned to have entred into the ſame upon ſufficient Proof and Experience of the Goodneſs and Uſefulneſs of the ſaid Sheathing, having forborn to enter into a formal Contract till then, that they might make what Obſervations of any defects they could themſelves, or what its watchful Adverſaries ſhould diſcover to them, a time long enough to have diſcerned its monſtrous eating of the Ruddar-Irons (ſo much complain'd of afterwards) if there had been any ſuch thing.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">2dly.</note> By their ſaid Report, in 1682. made after twelve years Experience upon twenty Ships that had been ſheathed within that time (having nothing to object againſt its keeping on, duration, and certain ſecurity from the Worm, or any thing elſe) they complained only of this Sheathings extraordinary eating and corroding the <hi>Bolts</hi> and <hi>Ruddar-Irons,</hi> and that but of eight of thoſe twenty, ſaying no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the reſt; and, by their Complaints, thoſe eight differed exceedingly amongſt themſelves; ſome laſting above twice as long as others, and ſome of the <hi>Irons</hi> of the ſame <hi>Ruddar,</hi> complain'd of, to be very much eaten, whilſt others were ſaid to remain good and ſerviceable; which different Effects not being poſſible, in the Nature of Things, to proceed from one and the ſame Cauſe, [<hi>Lead-Sheathing</hi>] they ſhould have found out another, or have been willing to have hearkened to thoſe that did, who charged this different duration upon the Smith's better or worſe mixing, welding, and working his Iron with Fire and Hammer, and proved it by an ocular Evidence upon view of the <hi>Henrietta</hi>'s Iron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work, produced at their own Board, as in <hi>Pag.</hi> 14. of their ſaid Reply, that alone, and only that, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to anſwer the great variety of decay that now is, and ever was upon all Ships ſheathed, or not ſheathed, before <hi>Lead-ſheathing</hi> was ever thought of; which could not be, but the decays muſt be always conformable to their Cauſes, if the ſheathing either way, or not ſheathing at all, were any wiſe concerned therein; And thus from their own Act, and the very Complaints annexed to the ſaid Report, they may find all their Objections fully anſwered: So hard a thing it is for Men not to contradict them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, when once they go about to contradict the Truth.</p>
            <p>But ſince theſe Reaſons (being now generally taken notice of) expoſe thoſe Objections to Contempt, another is advanced, which at firſt, ſeeming ſomewhat plauſible, ought to be anſwered as well as the reſt; <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>That there having been ſo many Perſons (ſome of Wealth and good Quality) all along concerned in this Work, till now of late, it could not be, that this Sheathing ſhould be ſo laid aſide all this while, but that it muſt in ſixteen or ſeventeen years time have been reſtored again to the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, if there had been any Truth in what <hi>Hale</hi> ſays, and ſo much real Worth and Excellency in the thing it ſelf, as he pretends.</q>
            <p>This Inſinuation being natural enough, and likely to prevail with ſome, not to trouble themſelves to read, or mind what <hi>Hale</hi> has printed upon this occaſion, he finds himſelf obliged to give ſome An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to it, and hopes he may be excuſed, if in his own Defence he mentions ſome Perſons and Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, that did occurr in this Affair, which he hath hitherto omitted, that the World may judge who, and what ſort of Men they are beholden to, for this delay, and depriving the Publick of the benefit of ſo uſeful an Invention all this while, or whether it be in truth owing to its own Deficiency, and want of Merit in it ſelf; which he proceeds to do by theſe following ſteps; <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="2" facs="tcp:180241:2"/>
            <p n="1">1. While the Complaints about the <hi>Ruddar-Irons</hi> lay before that Navy-Board, the Parties concerned attended them, and thought they had then given them ſufficient Reaſons from the different duration always obſerved in the Iron-work, that the <hi>Lead-ſheathing</hi> could be no wiſe concerned therein; or if they were not preſently ſatisfied, they believed at leaſt (the King having commanded them by the Admiralties Order of <hi>Dec.</hi> 20.1673. printed in <hi>Pag. 6.</hi> of the ſaid Reply, poſitively to ſheath no otherwiſe than with <hi>Mill'd-Lead,</hi> without their Lordſhip's expreſs Order; and they having by ſeveral Orders in <hi>April</hi> and <hi>May</hi> 1678, as in <hi>Pag.</hi> 10. <hi>&amp;</hi> 44. made for their better Enquiry into this Matter, and directed them to demand <hi>Ruddar-Irons</hi> from the <hi>Mill'd-Lead</hi> Company, for ſuch Ships they ſhould af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards ſheath, upon their Propoſal to undertake the making of them) that they would not leave off this Sheathing totally without Order, tho' they had had no Demands from the Board for a long time, when they had heard ſeveral Ships had been ſheathed with Wood, for which, Age, Weakneſs, or ſome reaſon or other was pretended, but never that they had wholly laid it aſide: So that the Company re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in continual Expectation of Demands at one time or other, till they were ſurprized with the ſaid Report, by which means they were abuſed and deluded out of above four years of their time, all which is ſet forth in their Reply, <hi>Pag.</hi> 10. 24, 25.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>Mill'd-Lead</hi> Company having put in their Reply to the ſaid Report, and the Lords of the Admiralty having order'd the Commiſſioners of the Navy to attend, read the ſame to them, telling them, they muſt in ſome convenient time put in their Anſwer in Writing, to which they excuſing themſelves, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they had not leiſure nor skill to write ſuch fine Diſcourſes, but were well aſſured there was Cauſe enough for the Complaints they had exhibited. My Lord <hi>Nottingham</hi> told them, the thing importing ſuch great Pretenſions to His Majeſty's Service, it was too hot for their Fingers, they would lay it before the Council Board, let them get what time they could, or do as they pleaſed there; which his Lordſhip, being one of the Members of that Board, as well as of the Admiralty, accordingly did; and the Council upon hearing both ſides, <hi>Dec.</hi> 22. 1682. (the Particulars being many) referred the ſame back again to the Admiralty to examine and report, as in <hi>Pag.</hi> 51. Whereupon the Company made their farther Addreſs to that Board, printed, <hi>Pag.</hi> 54. but were kept in hand by delays, and one pretence or other, not being able to obtain any Report according to the Reference, before their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion was determined, which was in <hi>May</hi> 1684. ſo that here there was above a year and an half's time more loſt.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Afterwards King <hi>Charles</hi> took the Office of Lord High Admiral into his own hands, managed by the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Pepys</hi> his Secretary, of which the <hi>Mill'd-Lead</hi> Company had great hopes to find the good effects, he having always approved their Sheathing, and himſelf having penned their Reply abovementioned, and Mr. <hi>Hewer</hi> his Chief Clerk being, as he knew, one of their Partners, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended by King <hi>Charles</hi> under his Sign Manual, to avoid Envy, with particular Directions to take care that their Work ſhould be duly promoted in the Navy; but the ſame Navy-Board being continued in Commiſſion the remainder of King <hi>Charles</hi>'s and beginning of King <hi>James</hi>'s, Reign, they pretended not to have Power enough, but doubted not in convenient time to ſee the <hi>Lead-ſheathing</hi> reſtored, which the Company might be ſure they would take all opportunity to promote, ſo that almoſt two years more was ſpent in theſe Expectations.</p>
            <p n="4">4. But now that the oeconomy and method of the whole Affairs of the Navy, and even the Navy-Board it ſelf were new modelled and managed, according to Mr. <hi>Pepys</hi> his Propoſal to King <hi>James,</hi> upon a Commiſſion, dated <hi>April</hi> 17. 16<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>6. (as appears by his Memoirs printed in the year 1690.) when himſelf was in effect Lord High Admiral, and Sir <hi>Anthony Deane</hi> a profeſſed Friend to the <hi>Lead-ſheathing</hi> from the beginning, and Mr. <hi>Hewer,</hi> and others, who Mr. <hi>Pepys</hi> approved, were made Commiſſioners of the Navy: Upon this Project of Reformation and good Husbandry to the Crown, one ſhould have thought that this <hi>Lead-ſheathing</hi> had not been far from its Reſtauration; but whatever occult or corroding Quality there may lye conceal'd in the <hi>Mill'd-Lead</hi> Sheathing, in reſpect of the <hi>Ruddar-Irons,</hi> there ſeems to be ſomething extraordinary in the very Eſſence and Conſtitution of a Commiſſioner or Officer of the Navy, in reſpect of that; for after this new Commiſſion, the Company thought themſelves ſure of a ſpeedy diſpatch, and therefore made little Application for ſome time, depending upon their Partner Mr. <hi>Hewer</hi> (and his known, and their ſeeming Friends, eſpecially it now becoming their Duty, as they knew it to be a great Service to the King) for encouragement to apply themſelves formally to their Board, but were kept in hand, by one pretence or other ſtill, for nine months more; when Mr. <hi>Hewer,</hi> being able to excuſe the delay no longer, adviſed his Partners to make a new Propoſal to their Board, to ſheath at a rate certain <hi>per</hi> yard ſquare, and to wave the old Contract, and all Diſcourſe about the Complaints, ſaying, he believed thoſe that had been concerned therein were now better ſatisfied they had been miſled, and would take it well to hear no more thereof; ſo the Company laid before them their Propoſal, dated <hi>Dec.</hi> 20. 1686. printed <hi>Pag.</hi> 60. But even after this they were (upon the like pretences of unſeaſonableneſs from preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Buſineſs, or want of compliance in ſome of their Members, which they hoped to ſatisfie, though there was but one of thoſe that had ſubſcribed the Report remaining at their Board) delayed about four months more: At length, finding Mr. <hi>Hewer</hi> did nothing, Dr. <hi>Davenant,</hi> one of the Partners, being related to my Lord <hi>Falkland,</hi> prevailed with his Lordſhip to move the Board, that their new Propoſal might be referred to ſome of their own Members, to conſider and Report their Opinions, which could not eaſily be deny'd; and ſo it was referred to Sir <hi>Annhony Deane,</hi> and Sir <hi>Phineas Pett,</hi> Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner at <hi>Chatham,</hi> Sir <hi>Anthony</hi> being there, when Mr. <hi>Hale</hi> writ to them from the Company, to put them in mind of making their Report before they parted, not doubting but it would be a fair one, Sir <hi>Phineas</hi> having alſo certified formerly in favour of the <hi>Lead-ſheathing,</hi> and refuſing to ſign the ſaid Report againſt it, with the reſt of that Board.</p>
            <pb n="3" facs="tcp:180241:2"/>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Hale</hi> waiting upon Sir <hi>Anthony</hi> at his Return, which was about a fortnight after, asked him if they had made their Report? <hi>What Report,</hi> ſays, he, (ſeeming ſtrange!) <hi>Why, yours,</hi> ſays <hi>Hale, and Sir</hi> Phineas Pett's, <hi>upon the Boards Reference to you of our Propoſal: That,</hi> ſays he, <hi>I have reported forty and forty times, That I am ſatisfied your Sheathings an excellent thing, and beſt for the King's Service, but you muſt ſpeak to</hi> Narbrough <hi>and</hi> Berry, <hi>you know that I am always ready to promote it. They mind not</hi> (ſays <hi>Hale) what we ſay; you muſt ſatisfie them with the Reaſons you are ſatisfied your ſelves, or the Board muſt proceed without them; but if you don't report your Opinions in Writing, how can the Board go on with their Reference to contract with us? Why,</hi> ſays he, <hi>you would not have us report it is cheaper? Yes,</hi> ſays <hi>Hale, but I would, it</hi> 150 per Cent. <hi>be cheaper; which you know Mr.</hi> Pepys, <note place="margin">Pag. 57.</note> 
               <hi>Mr.</hi> Hewer, <hi>and your Self found by Calculation, with reſpect to its duration, from the Navy-Books, I being preſent. Ay, duration,</hi> ſays, he, (ſheering off) <hi>you muſt ſpeak <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> them, you may be ſure I'll do what I can.</hi> Thereupon <hi>Hale</hi> having writ to Sir <hi>Phineas Pett,</hi> received his Anſwer, That Sir <hi>Anthony Deane</hi> had the Papers from the Navy-Board in his keeping, ſaying, <hi>You muſt get Mr.</hi> Hewer <hi>to ſpeak to him to diſpatch it; for my part, I am ready to ſign a Report at any time.</hi> Mr. <hi>Hewer</hi> was told this; and Sir <hi>Anthony</hi> ſaid, he would acquaint the Board with what they had to ſay, as well as if 'twere in Writing, all pretending fairly, blaming others, but ſtill with promiſing hopes, whilſt thoſe concerned began now to diſcern how they had been deluded for about two years more, which will appear farther confirmed in the next Paragraph.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The Company now thought it adviſeable to apply themſelves to ſome Perſon of Quality at Court for their aſſiſtance, in hopes of fairer Quarter, as they found at the beginning, while my Lord <hi>Carliſle</hi> was their Partner, which my Lord <hi>Marlbrough</hi> having accepted of, they mentioned it to his Lordſhip to preſent a Petition to the King, that whereas they had ſuch a Propoſal that had lain ſo long before the Navy-Board, His Majeſty would be pleaſed to order them to admit thereof, or to give their Reaſons in Writing why they did not, which his Lordſhip approved, and accordingly ſuch a Petition was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, and by him put into the hands of Mr. <hi>Pepys</hi> to be delivered, not doubting Succeſs if He ſhould but appear ſincere at laſt, who had taken ſuch pains throughly to inform himſelf therein, and had ſo often declared his approbation thereof, upon full Conviction (to uſe his own Words) that it was a great Service to the King, and promiſed the Company at his firſt Return to his Office to promote the Uſe of it, whenever it came in his way to do't; and ſure that could not be queſtion'd now.</p>
            <p n="7">7. But even he alſo appeared plainly to have another Intereſt now to preferr, pretending difficulty to reſtore, it having been ſo long laid aſide, and the Commanders ſo much prejudiced againſt it, fearing the loſs of their <hi>Ruddars,</hi> and conſequently the King's Ships and Subjects. He propoſed alſo a new Trial upon two Ships, to be ſheathed one with <hi>Wood,</hi> the other with <hi>Lead,</hi> and new <hi>Ruddar-Irons</hi> put on together, to ſee which proved beſt, which had been formerly mentioned. To all which he received Anſwers: To the firſt, That 'twas not their fault, but their loſs, as well as the King's that it had been diſcontinued ſo long, as he well knew. Secondly, That it was not likely a Captain would refuſe his Commiſſion, or be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to go in a <hi>Lead-ſheathed</hi> Ship (which he had ſhewn would ſail better) if once that Sheathing had paſſed Approbation above. Thirdly, That it was not reaſonable now after ſeventeen or eighteen years Trials already, to wait three or four years more for the Succeſs of another; which, as he had formerly obſerved himſelf (the <hi>Ruddar-Irons</hi> being liable to ſo much Uncertainty) could not deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the truth of the thing with any certainty at laſt; though when it was firſt propoſed, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany was willing enough to make Trial thereof, the courſe of their Trade being not intended to ſtop till the Trial made: he replied that if thoſe Fears prevailed with the Captains, 'twas no matter how ſelf-convinced ſoever we were that there was no cauſe for't; but he would take ſome opportunity to preſent the Petition, for which he ſhould have time enough, before there could be occaſion for any ſheathing, but never did, nor did they expect (with any advantage to them after theſe Evaſions) he ever would: So that the other Parties concerned ſeeing their whole Intereſt, which they had ſo long depended on, and which was now in power, turned againſt them, they in ſome time afterwards par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with their Concerns to Mr. <hi>Hale</hi> (who had the greateſt ſhare therein, and having exhauſted his Fortune by it, moſt of all depended thereon) upon Terms agreed between them.</p>
            <p>From thenceforwards <hi>Hale</hi> being only concerned, he applies himſelf to the World in Print, by Publications of the great Uſe, Excellency, and preference of the <hi>Mill'd-Lead,</hi> as well for covering of Houſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as ſheathing of Ships, the Plumbers and their Friends having alſo decried it, as the Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrights and theirs do. And, in the year 1691. in a ſmall Book, amongſt other things, he printed the ſaid Reply to the Navy-Board's Report, and the Proceedings that had been thereon before the then Lords of the Admiralty and Council-Board, as the ſame were in Fact, for the ſatisfaction and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement of Merchants, and others, as they ſhould judge thereof.</p>
            <p>Amongſt many that had read the Book, and approved of the <hi>Lead-ſheathing,</hi> ſome eminent Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants having within theſe two years ſheathed ſeveral Ships with it, and <hi>Hale</hi> hearing there were about half a ſcore Ships ordered to be ſheathed for laſt Summer's Service, addreſſed himſelf to the preſent Navy-Board, that they would be pleaſed to ſheath one or two of theſe Ships (at leaſt) with <hi>Mill'd-Lead,</hi> that they might within their own Time, and under their own Order and Obſervations, make ſome Trial thereof themſelves, and encourage the farther uſe of it, as they found it deſerved, and not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend altogether upon the old Complaints and Objections, which ſome think have been fully enough anſwered. Their Anſwer was, that the thing had been long agoe contraſted at that Board by their Predeceſſors, who they believed, being Men of Judgment and Underſtanding in their Buſineſs, had fully examined and conſidered the Matter, and laid aſide the uſe thereof, upon very good grounds, which they had reaſon to be ſatisfied in, and not to queſtion their Proceedings.</p>

            <p>By this time it may appear, who have been the Cauſe that the <hi>Mill'd-Lead Sheathing</hi> was thruſt out, and its Uſe been diſcontinued in the Navy all this while, and what Hardſhip and evil Treatment this unfortunate Invention hath met with ever ſince it came into the World, not only by its Enemies, but its moſt intimate ſeeming Friends, for all the manifeſt Benefits and Advantages it brought, and propoſed to the Publick, by preſerving the Hulls of our Ships from their mortal Enemy the Worm, without hindrance to Sailing, at a Rate above <hi>Cent. per Cent.</hi> cheaper than the <hi>Wood-ſheathing,</hi> as has been proved, and that by imploying and exhauſting the Product and Manufacture of our own Country, inſtead of the foreign hitherto uſed therein: And it were harder yet, if theſe its paſt Sufferings ſhould by Inſinuation be charged upon it as a Crime, to condemn it to a perpetual Baniſhment hereafter, as this ill-natured Objection drives as.</p>
