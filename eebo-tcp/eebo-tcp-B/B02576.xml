            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Y the <hi>Statute</hi> 27 <hi>H.</hi> 8. 26. It is provided, That for that preſent Parliament, and all other future Parliaments for this Realm; For every Burrough being a Shire Town within <hi>Wales</hi> (excepting the Shire Town for the County of <hi>Merionith</hi>) one Burgeſs ſhould be Choſen and Elected for Parliaments in the like manner, form and order as Burgeſſes of Parliament be Elected and Choſen in other Shires of this Realm; and the Burgeſs Fees to be Leavied and gathered as well of the Shire Towns as they be Burgeſſes of, as of all other Ancient Burroughs within the ſame Shires.</p>
            <p>By the <hi>Statute</hi> of 35 <hi>H.</hi> 8. 11. It is Enacted, for as much as the Inhabitants of all Cities and Burroughs in every the Twelve Shires within <hi>Wales,</hi> not finding Burgeſſes for the Parliament themſelves, muſt bear and pay the Burgeſſes Wages within the ſame Shire Towns. That from the beginning of that Parliament, the Burgeſſes of all and every the ſaid Cities, Burroughs and Towns, which be, or ſhall be Contributary to the payment of the Burgeſſes Wages of the ſaid Shire Towns, ſhall be lawfully admoniſhed by Proclamation, or otherwiſe by the Mayors, Bailiffs, and other head Officers of the ſaid Towns, or by one of them to come to give their Elections for the Electing of the ſaid Burgeſſes at ſuch time and place lawful and reaſonable, or ſhall be Aſſigned for the ſame intent by the ſaid Mayors, Bailiffs, and other head Officers of the ſaid Shire Towns, or by one of them: In ſuch Elections the Burgeſſes ſhall have like Voice and Authority to Elect, Name and Chooſe the Burgeſſes of every the ſaid Shire Towns, like and in ſuch manner as the Burgeſſes of the ſaid Shire Towns, have, or uſe. And the Juſtices of the Peace of every the ſaid Shires, by the ſame Act have power to Allot and Tax every of the ſaid Cities, Burroughs and Towns for the Portions and Rates that every of the ſaid Cities and Burroughs ſhall bear and pay towards the ſaid Burgeſſes; and the ſaid Rates ſo ſet in groſs by the Juſtices of the Peace, ſhall be rated on the Inhabitants of the ſaid Cities and Burroughs, by four or ſix Diſcreet Subſtantial Burgeſſes of every the ſaid Cities and Burroughs to be Named by the Head Officers thereof, and to Collect and pay over the ſame to the ſaid Burgeſſes.</p>
            <p>The ſaid Town of <hi>Mountgomery,</hi> by the ſaid <hi>Statute</hi> 27 <hi>H.</hi> 8. 26. is named and appointed the Shire Town of the ſaid County of <hi>Mountgomery,</hi> and the Burroughs of <hi>Llanidloes, Pool</hi> and <hi>Llanvylling,</hi> are three Ancient Burroughs of the ſame County; and the Burgeſſes thereof heretofore uſed to have their Voices at the Elections of the Burgeſſes for the ſaid Shire Town, with, and like as the Burgeſſes of the ſame Shire Town of themſelves, had and uſed: And for that purpoſe convenient notice was uſually ſent from the Bailiffs of <hi>Mountgomery</hi> to the ſaid three other Burroughs, of the time and place, when and where ſuch Elections were to be made.</p>
            <p>The Sheriff of the ſaid County having on the 10th of <hi>February</hi> 1678. received His Majeſties Writ for Summoning His Parliament to be held at <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter</hi> on the 6th. day of <hi>March</hi> following, and for Chooſing a Knight for the ſaid County, and a Burgeſs for the ſaid Burrough, to ſerve in the ſame Parliament; Did immediatly the ſame day ſend away his <hi>Mandate</hi> to the Bailiffs of <hi>Mountgomery,</hi> to do and execute what appertaineth to them in that behalf.</p>
            <p>The Bailiffs of <hi>Mountgomery</hi> being wrought upon by ſome great perſons in that Neighbourhood, on whom they had dependance, to ſurprize the ſaid three other Burroughs of <hi>Llanidloes, Pool</hi> and <hi>Llanvylling,</hi> by not giving them notice of the ſaid Election of a Burgeſs for the ſaid Burrough, and privately by ſome of the Burgeſſes of their own Town to Elect one <hi>Matthew Price</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> to be Burgeſs: And having in proſpect, that if the Burgeſſes of the ſaid three other Burroughs would appear, they would by Majority of Voices Elect another perſon, and not the ſaid Mr. <hi>Price:</hi> They the Bailiffs of <hi>Mountgomery</hi> in purſuance of that unjuſt practice and deſign, did not ſend notice of the ſaid Election to the ſaid other Burroughs, but only made Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation at the Town of <hi>Mountgomery</hi> on the 17th of <hi>February,</hi> that the Election was to be made at 8. of the Clock the next Morning; And by that means ſo ſurprized the Burrough of <hi>Lanidloes,</hi> being 14 Miles diſtant, that none of their Burgeſſes, did, or could attend at the ſaid Election.</p>
            <p>Yet ſome of the Burgeſſes of the ſaid Burroughs of <hi>Pool</hi> and <hi>Lanvelling</hi> being at a nearer diſtanee to <hi>Mountgomery,</hi> having caſually ſome few hours in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timation of the ſaid intended Election, appeared at the ſame Election, and with them joyned alſo ſome of the Burgeſſes of <hi>Mountgomery,</hi> which made up in the whole 219 Voices, all for the ſaid <hi>Edward Lloyd</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> to be Elected for the ſaid Burrough, and ſo declared themſelves, at the ſaid Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and prayed the Poll.</p>
            <p>The Bailiffs of <hi>Mountgomery</hi> perceiving, that if they admitted the Burgeſſes of <hi>Pool</hi> and <hi>Llanvelling</hi> there preſent, to Poll, that then the Majority of Voices would be for the ſaid Mr. <hi>Lloyd,</hi> did only Poll the Burgeſſes of <hi>Mountgomery</hi> upon a Liſt of their own preparation, of whom only 82. Voted for the ſaid Mr. <hi>Price,</hi> being the Major part of the <hi>Mountgomery</hi> Burgeſſes then preſent: And thereupon the Bailiffs cloſed the Poll, and declared and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned the ſaid Mr. <hi>Price</hi> to be Burgeſs, wholly rejecting the Votes of the ſaid Burgeſſes of <hi>Pool</hi> and <hi>Lanvelling</hi> then preſent, pretending for a reaſon for their ſo doing, that none but the Burgeſſes of <hi>Mountgomery</hi> had right, or ſhould be admitted to Vote at the ſaid Election, though the ſaid Burgeſſes of <hi>Pool</hi> and <hi>Lanvylling</hi> inſiſted upon, and earneſtly preſſed to have their Voices received for the ſaid Mr. <hi>Loyd,</hi> who had Voices there for him as they were upon a juſt account, and can be made appear in the whole with thoſe of <hi>Mountgomery</hi> Burgeſſes, who Voted for him 219. whereas there were but 82. Votes in the whole for the ſaid Mr. <hi>Price.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now in regard the ſaid Election was made by ſurprize, whereby the Burgeſſes of <hi>Lanidloes</hi> could not attend the ſame for want of notice, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended if they had been preſent, to Elect to the ſaid Mr. <hi>Lloyd</hi> Burgeſs, and that notwithſtanding the ſaid ſurprize, Mr. <hi>Lloyd</hi> had the Majority of Voices of Burgeſſes preſent at the ſaid Election for him, if the ſaid Votes of the Burroughs of <hi>Pool</hi> and <hi>Lanvylling</hi> had been received and not rejected as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid; and for that by the ſaid undue means and practice of the ſaid Bailiffs of <hi>Mountgomery,</hi> the ſaid three other Burroughs have not only loſt the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of their Voices in a free Election at this time, but the ſame may be drawn in precedent againſt them in future Elections.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding by the very expreſs words of the Statutes (being Ancient Burroughs within the ſaid County) they have an undoubted right to give their Voices in all Elections and are lyable and Contributary to the Wages of the reſpective Members Elected, have alwayes been ſo, and ever from the making of the ſaid Statutes without diſpute or queſtion had notice of, and did give their Voices in all Elections.</p>
            <div type="petition">
               <head>They Humbly Petition.</head>
               <p>That the ſaid Mr. <hi>Price</hi> may not be received to Sit as a Member in Parliament, being unduly Elected as aforeſaid. That the ſaid Mr. <hi>Loyd</hi> who had the Majority of Voices, may be returned, and ſtand Elected Burgeſs for the ſaid Burrough. Or that the ſaid undue Election of Mr. <hi>Price</hi> may be void, and a new free Election granted. Or ſuch other Releif in the Premiſſes as to the great Wiſdom of the Honourable Houſe of Commons ſhall ſeem juſt and meet.</p>
