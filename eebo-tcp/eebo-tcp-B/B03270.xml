            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <lg>
               <l>OUR Prophet's gone: No longer may our Ears</l>
               <l>Be charm'd with Muſick of th' harmonious Spheres.</l>
               <l>Let Sun and Moon withdraw, leave gloomy Night</l>
               <l>To ſhew their Nuncio's Fate, who gave more Light</l>
               <l>To th' erring World, than all the feeble Rays</l>
               <l>Of Sun or Moon; taught us to know thoſe Days</l>
               <l>Bright <hi>Titan</hi> makes; followed the haſty Sun</l>
               <l>Through all his Circuits; knew the unconſtant Moon,</l>
               <l>And more unconſtant Ebbings of the Flood,</l>
               <l>And what is moſt uncertain, th' factious Brood,</l>
               <l>Flowing in civil Broils; by th' Heavens could date</l>
               <l>The Flux and Reflux of our dubious State.</l>
               <l>He ſaw th' Eclipſe of Sun, and change of Moon:</l>
               <l>He ſaw, but ſeeing would not ſhun his own.</l>
               <l>Eclipſ'd he was, that he might ſhine more bright,</l>
               <l>And only chang'd to give a fuller Light.</l>
               <l>He having view'd the Sky, and glorious Train</l>
               <l>Of gilded Stars, ſcorn'd longer to remain</l>
               <l>In earthly Priſons. Could he a Village love,</l>
               <l>Whom the twelve Houſes waited for above?</l>
               <l>The grateful Stars a heavenly Manſion gave</l>
               <l>T' his heavenly Soul, nor could he be a Slave</l>
               <l>To mortal Paſſions, whoſe immortal Mind,</l>
               <l>Whilſt here on Earth, was not to Earth confin'd.</l>
               <l>He muſt be gone: The Stars had ſo decreed,</l>
               <l>As he of them, ſo they of him had need.</l>
               <l>This Meſſage 'twas the blazing Comet brought,</l>
               <l>I ſaw the palefac'd Star, and ſeeing thought</l>
               <l>(For we could gueſs; but only <hi>Lilly</hi> know)</l>
               <l>It did ſome glorious Hero's Fall foreſhow.</l>
               <l>A Hero's faln, whoſe death more than a War</l>
               <l>Or Fire, deſerv'd a Comet. Th' obſequious Stars</l>
               <l>Could do no leſs than his ſad Fate unfold,</l>
               <l>Who had their Riſings, and their Settings told.</l>
               <l>Some thought a Plague, and ſome a Famine near,</l>
               <l>Some Wars from <hi>France,</hi> ſome Fires at home did fear.</l>
               <l>Nor did they fear too much, ſcarce kinder Fate.</l>
               <l>But Plague of Plagues befell th' unhappy State,</l>
               <l>When <hi>Lilly</hi> dy'd. Now Swords may ſafely come</l>
               <l>From <hi>France</hi> or <hi>Rome,</hi> Fanaticks plot at home;</l>
               <l>Now an unſeen and unexpected Hand,</l>
               <l>By guidance of ill Stars, may hurt our Land.</l>
               <l>Unſafe, becauſe Secure, there's none to ſhow</l>
               <l>How <hi>England</hi> may avert the fatal Blow.</l>
               <l>He's dead, whoſe Death the weeping Clouds deplore:</l>
               <l>I wiſh we did not ow to him that Shower,</l>
               <l>Which long expected was, and might have ſtill</l>
               <l>Expected been, had not our Nation's ill</l>
               <l>Drawn from the Heavens a Sympathetick Tear.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>England</hi> hath cauſe a ſecond Drought to fear;</l>
               <l>We have no ſecond <hi>Lilly,</hi> who may die,</l>
               <l>And by his Death may make the Heavens cry.</l>
               <l>Then let your Annals, <hi>Coley,</hi> want this day,</l>
               <l>Think every Year, Leap-Year, or if't muſt ſtay,</l>
               <l>Cloath it in Black, let a ſad Note ſtand by,</l>
               <l>And ſtigmatize it to Poſterity.</l>
