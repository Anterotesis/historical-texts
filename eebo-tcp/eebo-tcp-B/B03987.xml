            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>WHat deep and ſorrowful Impreſſions the great Calamities and Miſeries of the preſent War, which all Chriſtendom groans under, have made on your Mind, as alſo the great and ſpecial Care your Holineſs takes to reconcile the exaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perated Minds of all Chriſtian Princes, in order to the promoting of an univerſal Peace, has been given us to underſtand at large by your Holineſs Letter, from the 8th of the laſt Month. And truly the great and increaſing Miſchiefs, atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a War that has been rais'd under ſo frivolous pretences, moves no leſs ours, than your Holineſs Fatherly Heart. Yet ſince We did not take up Arms till We were forc'd to it by an unavoidable Neceſſity, We have this Conſolation left us, that (calling God and our Conſcience to Witneſs) we are wholly free from the Cauſe of it: Beſides your Holineſs, by a long and ſolid experience, is ſo well acquainted with the remoteſt Inclinations of our Heart, that you'll eaſily conceive, that We can ſuffer nothing with more Uneaſineſs and Impatience, than to ſee the effects of a Natural Tendency to Peace and Quietneſs, obſtructed by the ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and envious Endeavours of <hi>France.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As yet no Obligations, Promiſes, no not the moſt Sacred Oaths could prevail with that Crown to keep it from the breaking of the moſt Solemn Treaties as ſoon as they were made, for to paſs over all the reſt, the Chriſtian World knows it; and future Ages will relate it with aſtoniſhment, that the moſt Chriſtian King has cauſed himſelf to be ſeduced ſo far, as to obſtruct the Glorious Courſe of Our Victorious Arms over the Infidels; and when we were relying on his Friendſhip, but ſo lately renewed, and conſequently not at all ſtanding on Our Guards, to Invade Us upon a ſudden the ſecond time with his Hoſtile Arms, putting all to the Fire and Sword, before he had acquainted Us with his having the cauſe for it, and indeed, all Divine and Humane Laws are Violated, rather than <hi>France</hi> ſhould let ſlip any occaſion of enlarging her Frontiers, or to hinder Us from the ſecuring of Ours, and to deprive Us and Chriſtendom of all Means to end the War with the <hi>Turks</hi> with Succeſs and Advantage.</p>
                  <p>Thus have We been obliged by the Moſt Sacred Ty of Our high Office, by reaſon of that moſt Ignominious League between the moſt Chriſtian King, and the Sworn Enemy of the Chriſtian Name, to Unite Our ſelves with Our Friends and Confederates againſt <hi>France,</hi> to the Defence of Us and Our People; which U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and Confederacy is of ſo high a Nature, that we can do nothing towards the Concluſion of a Peace, without their Advice and Counſel. But ſince We are wholly convinc'd that their Inclinations are no leſs tending than ours to ſuch a Peace, by which all Chriſtendom, according to the <hi>Weſphalian</hi> and <hi>Pyrenean</hi> Treaty (ſince violated by <hi>France</hi>) may be reſtor'd to its former Quietneſs and Tranquillity, all will be reduced to this point, that your Holineſs will be pleaſed to employ to the outmoſt, your Fatherly Care to prevail with the <hi>French</hi> King as the ſole Author of this War, to reſtore both the abovementioned Treaties, which he himſelf has broke.</p>
                  <p>In Caſe your Holineſs can obtain from him theſe ſo juſt Demands, there ſhall be wanting nothing on our ſide to render effectual this ſo Holy Deſign of your Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, tending to the good of Chriſtendom, and your proffered Fatherly Service for the promoting of a General Reconciliation, ſo acceptable to Us, and ſo much wiſh'd for by all the reſt of our Confederates. This We have thought fit to reply to your Holineſs's Letter, according to our Zeal for your Perſon, Praying God Almighty long to preſerve your Holineſs to the benefit of Us and the Church.</p>
