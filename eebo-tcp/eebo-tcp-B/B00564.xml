            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p n="2">2 Any broth or <hi>Colaſe,</hi> that will ſtand cleare and liquid, and not gellie or grow thicke when it is cold, may alſo be preſerued by this lire of Nature from all mouldineſſe, ſowreneſſe, or corruption, to any reaſonable period of time that ſhalbe deſired. A neceſſary ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret for all ſicke and weake perſons at ſea, when no freſh meate can be had, to ſtrengthen or comfort them.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Now for Beuerage: All the water, which to that purpoſe ſhall bee thought needefull to be caried to ſea, will bee warranted to laſt ſweete, good, and without any intention to putrefaction, for 2, 3, or 4 yeeres together. This is performed by a Philoſophicall fire, being of a ſympatheticall nature with all plants and Animals. In the ſpace of one moneth, the Author wil prepare ſo many Tunnes thereof, as ſhall be reaſonably required at his hands.</p>
            <p n="4">4 By this meanes alſo both Wine, Perrie, Sider, Reere, Ale, and Vineger, may be ſafely kept at ſea, for any long voyage, without feare of growing dead, ſowre or muſtie.</p>
            <p n="5">5 And, as for Medicine, if any Nobleman, Gentleman, or Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, ſhall by his Phyſition be aduiſed to cary any ſpeciall diſtilled waters, decoctions, or iuyces of any plant or any other liquid vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table or animall body whatſoeuer with him in any long voyage, this Author will ſo prepare the ſame onely by fortifying it with his owne fire of kinde, that he may be aſſured of the laſting and dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie thereof, euen at his owne pleaſure.</p>
            <p n="6">6 Here I may not omit the preparation of the iuice of Limons with this fire: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It expelleth the diſeaſe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any euacuation or weakening of the Patient.</p>
            <p n="8">8 A ſweete Paſte, for the head-ache: which commonly giueth eaſe, in one houres ſpace, either vpon the firſt or ſecond taking, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is ſpecificall. The doſe is the weight of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="9">9 A ſafe, general &amp; gentle purging Powder, to be taken in white wine, working eaſily without any convulſion, or other offence to the ſtomacke. It is pleaſant, and hath not any common or knowen purgatiue therein. It weakeneth not the Patient, neither doeth the body grow coſtiue after it: which is vſuall in moſt of the common purgatiues. There haue been ſo many trials made vpon all ſorts of complexions with this powder, as that it may well deſerue the name of a generall purge: yet I can leaſt commend it in Cholericke bodies. The doſe is two drammes and an halfe at a time. This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken in warme weather for three dayes together, in the Spring and Fall, will preuent both the Gowte and Dropſie, and moſt of thoſe diſeaſes that ſpring from rheumaticke cauſes: and if it cure them in eight or ten dayes, take it for aduantage. It cureth the Pockes newly taken in fiue or ſixe dayes: and in tenne or twelue dayes, at the moſt, it cureth a deepe rooted Pocke.</p>
