         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <lg>
               <l>UNſluce your Tears for Shame: what can you keep</l>
               <l>Your Eyes within their Sockets, and not Weep?</l>
               <l>Have we a Jewel loſt, more worth by far</l>
               <l>Than <hi>Affrica</hi> and both the <hi>Indies</hi> are?</l>
               <l>And can you ſtop the Currant of your Tears,</l>
               <l>And not Beflood your ſelves o're Head and Ears?</l>
               <l>O Fie! fall down before his holy Shrine,</l>
               <l>And weep as faſt as ever it did Raine,</l>
               <l>Stamp, and with Tears inundate all your Cheeks,</l>
               <l>And ſplit his very <hi>Marble-ſtone</hi> with Streeks;</l>
               <l>For we have loſt that lovely Silver Dove,</l>
               <l>Which was a Pledge of God Almighty's Love:</l>
               <l>'Tis Flown away; and left its Corporal Arke,</l>
               <l>(Until the Reſurrection) in the Dark:</l>
               <l>Our ſplended <hi>Sun</hi> is Set, and gone away,</l>
               <l>And ne'er will Riſe again till Judgment Day:</l>
               <l>The Meekeſt, Sweeteſt, and the Beſt of Kings,</l>
               <l>Is mounted on a pair of Angels Wings;</l>
               <l>And by a Summon ſent from God) is gone</l>
               <l>To ſet upon the Everlaſting Throne:</l>
               <l>O! that I might (if it but Lawful were)</l>
               <l>Whiſper with Reverence at his Sacred Eare,</l>
               <l>And ask if he in earneſt had his Breath</l>
               <l>Stop'd by the Handkerchief of Sawcy Death;</l>
               <l>I can't believe it was; ſure 'tis a Lye.</l>
               <l>The Elect ſhall only Changed be, not Die:</l>
               <l>And he I'm confident was one of thoſe</l>
               <l>Who being almoſt free from Sin was Choſe:</l>
               <l>And ſo he did not Die as ſome Report,</l>
               <l>But went a Live to the Coeleſtial Court;</l>
               <l>There to receive (ſtead of a fading <hi>Crown</hi>)</l>
               <l>One that I'm ſure will never Tumble Down.</l>
               <l>Therefore (when we perpend his Happineſs,</l>
               <l>If we do Mourn) we ought to Mourn the leſs:</l>
               <l>For (tho fond Nature bids us Weep a while,</l>
               <l>When we conſider that) we ought to Smile.</l>
               <l>Truly (to Mourn no more) I hold it Beſt;</l>
               <l>Come draw his Curtains cloſe, and let him Reſt:</l>
               <l>Tho he is gone, yet he has left ins ſtead</l>
               <l>The Braveſt Prince that ever wore a Head:</l>
               <l>Long may he Live to wear the <hi>Crown</hi> and Flouriſh,</l>
               <l>Till all his Enemies Fret, Pine and Periſh.</l>
