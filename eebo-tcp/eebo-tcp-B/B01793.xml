         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Broad-Side againſt Marriage Directed to that Inconſiderable Annimal, Called, A HUSBAND.</head>
            <lg>
               <l>HUsband! thou dull, unpitty'd Miſcreant!</l>
               <l>Wedded to noiſe, miſery, and want:</l>
               <l>Sold an Eternal Vaſſal for thy Life;</l>
               <l>Oblig'd to Cheriſh, and to hate thy Wife:</l>
               <l>Drudge on till Fifty at thy own expence;</l>
               <l>Breath out thy Life in one impertinence:</l>
               <l>Repeat thy Leath'd embraces ev'ry Night,</l>
               <l>Prompted to act by Duty, not delight:</l>
               <l>Chriſten the froward Bantling once a Year,</l>
               <l>And carefully thy Spurious Iſſue rear:</l>
               <l>Go once a Week to ſee the Brat at Nurſe,</l>
               <l>And let the Young Impoſtor drain thy Purſe:</l>
               <l>Hedge-Sparrow like, what Cuckows have begot</l>
               <l>Do thou maintain, incorrigible Sot.</l>
               <l>O I cou'd Curſe the Pimp! who can do leſs?</l>
               <l>He's beneath Pity, and beyond Redreſs,</l>
               <l>Pox on him! let him go; what can I ſay?</l>
               <l>Anathema's on him are thrown away;</l>
               <l>The wretch is Marry'd, and has known the worſt;</l>
               <l>And now his bleſſing is he can't be Curſt.</l>
               <l>Marry'd! O Hell and Furies! Name it not:</l>
               <l>Hence! hence, you Holy Cheats! a plot, a plot!</l>
               <l>Marriage is but a Licenc'd way to Sin;</l>
               <l>A Nooze to catch Religions Woodcocks in:</l>
               <l>Or the Nick-name of ſome malicious Fiend,</l>
               <l>Begot in Hell to perſecute man-kind.</l>
               <l>Tis the Deſtroyer of our Peace and Health,</l>
               <l>Miſ-ſpender of our Strength, our Time and VVealth:</l>
               <l>The Enemy to Mirth, Wit, Valour, all</l>
               <l>That we can Vertuous, Good, or Pleaſant call,</l>
               <l>By Day, tis nothing but a needleſs Noiſe;</l>
               <l>By Night, the Eccho of forgotten Joyes;</l>
               <l>Abroad, the Sport and VVonder of the Crowd,</l>
               <l>At home, the hourly Breach of what we Vow'd:</l>
               <l>In Youth, tis Opium to our Luſtful Rage,</l>
               <l>Which ſleeps awhile, but wakes again in Age:</l>
               <l>It heaps on all men much (but uſeleſs) Care;</l>
               <l>For, with more trouble, they leſs happy are:</l>
               <l>It Checks Youth; ſhortens Life, and taints the mind;</l>
               <l>Our Senſes Palls; and ſtrikes our Reaſon Blind.</l>
               <l>Ye Gods! that man by his own ſlaviſh Law,</l>
               <l>Should on himſelf ſuch inconvenience draw!</l>
               <l>If he wou'd wiſer natures Laws obey,</l>
               <l>Thoſe Chalk him out a far more pleaſant way:</l>
               <l>She bids us freely look, like, and enjoy;</l>
               <l>For Love, when made a Duty, does but Cloy.</l>
               <l>Therefore, when luſty Youth, and Wine conſpire,</l>
               <l>To fan the Bloud into a gen'rous fire;</l>
               <l>We muſt not think the Gallant will endure,</l>
               <l>The prurient Ragings of his Calenture;</l>
               <l>Nor always in his ſingle pleaſures burn,</l>
               <l>Though Natures hand-maid ſometimes ſerves the turn:</l>
               <l>No; He muſt have a ſprightly youthfull Wench,</l>
               <l>In equal Flouds of Love his flame to quench:</l>
               <l>One that will hold him with her Claſping Arm,</l>
               <l>And in that Circle, all his Spirits Charm:</l>
               <l>That with New Motion, and unpractic'd Art,</l>
               <l>Can raiſe his Soul, and re-enſnare his Heart.</l>
               <l>Hence Spring the Noble, Fortunate, and Great,</l>
               <l>Always begot in Paſſion, and in Heat:</l>
               <l>But the dull Off-ſpring of the Marriage bed,</l>
               <l>What is it but a Humane ſhape in Lead?</l>
               <l>A ſottiſh Lump, engendred of all Ills,</l>
               <l>Begot (like Cats) againſt the Parents wills,</l>
               <l>If it be Baſtardiz'd tis doubly ſpoyl'd;</l>
               <l>The Mothers fears entail'd upon the Child;</l>
               <l>Thus, whether Illegitimate or not,</l>
               <l>Cowards and Fools in Wedlock are begot.</l>
               <l>Let no enobled Soul himſelf debaſe,</l>
               <l>By Lawful ways to Daſtardize his Race:</l>
               <l>But, if he muſt pay Natures Debt in kind,</l>
               <l>(To Check the growing danger) let him find</l>
               <l>Some willing Female out; what though ſhe be</l>
