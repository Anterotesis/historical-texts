            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hereas amongſt other Arts uſed by the Promoters of this horrid and deſperate Rebellion againſt Vs, great Induſtry and Subtilty hath been applied to corrupt Our Subjects of Our Cities of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> Firſt by engaging them in Factions and Tumults, to aw the Members of both Our Houſes of Parliament who would not conſent to their ſeditious Deſignes; Then by perſwading them to Loans and Contributions for the maintenance of the Army now in Rebellion againſt Vs, upon pretence that the ſame was raiſed for the defence of Our Perſon, The Proteſtant Religion, The Laws of the Land, and Priviledge of Parliament (Whereas in truth it is for the deſtruction of them all) by their yeelding obedience to, and execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the pretended Ordinance of the <hi>Militia:</hi> And laſtly, by infuſing into them a deſperate ſenſe of their own Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that We are ſo much incenſed againſt them for the Premiſſes, that We intend to plunder, and give up the Wealth of thoſe Our Cities as a prey to Our Souldiers; We do hereby declare, That We are yet far from being ſo much incenſed againſt thoſe Our Cities as theſe men deſire to be beleeved, and in truth have endeavoured to make Vs; but We beleeve that thoſe Tumults were contrived by the Perſons whom We have formerly accuſed of that practice, and raiſed out of the meaneſt and pooreſt People of thoſe Our Cities and Suburbs, without the privity and conſent of the beſt and ſubſtantiall Citizens and Inhabitants, and that the Loans and Contributions which have been ſince raiſed, (though they have paſſed more generally then We expected from the duty and ſobriety of men of Fortunes and underſtanding) have been wreſted and extorted from them by Threats and Menaces, and fear of plundering and violence. And therefore We do hereby offer Our free and gracious Pardon to all the Citizens and Inhabitants of Our ſaid Cities of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> for all offences concerning the Premiſſes committed against Vs before the publiſhing of this Our Proclamation, (except all thoſe Perſons whom We have excepted in Our Declaration of the twelfth of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> and except Alderman <hi>Fulke,</hi> and Captain <hi>Manwaring,</hi> againſt all which We ſhall proceed according to the rules of Law, as againſt Traitors and ſtirrers of Sedition againſt Vs) and We do aſſure them in the word of a King, that no violence ſhall be offered by Our Army, or any part of it to any of them, not doubting but their demeanour will henceforward be ſuch, that We ſhall not compelled to bring Our Army againſt them.</p>
            <p>Provided that this Our Grace ſhall not extend to any Perſon, who after the publiſhing this Our Proclamation ſhall preſume by Loan or Contribution to aſſiſt the ſaid Army of Rebels, to aſſemble and muſter themſelves in Arms without Authority derived from Vs under Our hand, or to enter into any Oath of Aſſociation for the Aſſiſtance of the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> how ſpeciouſly ſoever the ſame be pretended for Our ſafety: for ſince the encounter on Sunday the 23<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> of this Moneth, where they uſed all poſſible means and malice to have deſtroyed Vs, and where it pleaſed God to give Vs ſo great a victroy over them (though with the loſſe of many worthy men) no man can be unſatiſfied in the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief and malice of their Rebelli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And to the end that they may receive all poſſible and particular aſſurance from Vs of Our gracious Intentions to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, We ſhall be willing that ſuch a number of grave and ſubstantiall Citizens be imployed from Our ſaid City to Vs, as ſhall by them be thought fit, who may propoſe ſuch things to Vs on their behalf as ſhall be deſired, to which we ſhall give a gratious and juſt Anſwer. And we do aſſure them and all the world, that as the Scandalls and Imputations upon Vs concerning Our favouring of Papiſts have been groundleſſe, and malitiouſly contrived by the Authours of this Rebellion to beget a miſunderſtanding between Vs and Our Subjects, ſo all the profeſſions We have made in Our ſeverall Declarations for the ſuppreſſion of Popery, and the maintenance of the true reformed Proteſtant Religion eſtabliſhed in the Church of England, and for the defence of the Lawes of the Land, and the juſt Priviledges of Parliament, ſhall be as inviolably obſerved by Vs, as We expect bleſſing from the Almighty God, and obedience from our Subjects.</p>
