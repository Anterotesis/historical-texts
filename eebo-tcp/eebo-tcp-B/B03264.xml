            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>AN ELEGIE UPON Mr. Thomas Hobbes of Malmesbury, LATELY DECEASED.</head>
            <lg>
               <l>IS he then dead at laſt, whom vain report</l>
               <l>So often had feign'd Mortal in meer ſport?</l>
               <l>Whom we on Earth ſo long alive might ſee,</l>
               <l>We thought he here had Immortality.</l>
               <l>As he, like what he wrote, could not expire,</l>
               <l>Whom all that did not love, did yet admire.</l>
               <l>For who his Writings ſtill accus'd in vain,</l>
               <l>Were taught by him, of whom they did complain.</l>
               <l>Some Authors vented have more Truth's; but ſo,</l>
               <l>If Truths they be, 'tis more than we can know.</l>
               <l>He with ſuch Art deceiv'd, that none can ſay,</l>
               <l>If his be Errours, where his Errour lay.</l>
               <l>If he miſtakes, 'tis ſtill with ſo much Wit,</l>
               <l>He erres more pleaſingly than others hit.</l>
               <l>For there are Counterfeits of Truth, which are</l>
               <l>In ſhew more Truths than Truths themſelves appear.</l>
               <l>As Nature in meer ſport hath fram'd ſome Apes</l>
               <l>Neerer to Men, than ſome in humane ſhapes;</l>
               <l>All were by him ſo plauſibly miſled,</l>
               <l>They choſe to loſe the Way with ſuch a Guide,</l>
               <l>And wander pleaſantly, rather than be</l>
               <l>In the right Way with duller Companie.</l>
               <l>With ill ſucceſs, ſome fond Diſputers ſtrove,</l>
               <l>What Doctrines he had planted, to remove;</l>
               <l>And juſtly are they blam'd: for that Diſeaſe</l>
               <l>Is ill remov'd, which more than Health does pleaſe.</l>
               <l>And who delightful Frenzies entertain,</l>
               <l>When undeceiv'd, do of their Cure complain.</l>
               <l>With ſuch ſweet Force he does our Thoughts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade,</l>
               <l>That where he cannot Teach, he does Perſwade.</l>
               <l>And we that read his Writings wiſh them true,</l>
               <l>If we do not believe them to be ſo.</l>
               <l>If he be in the Wrong, we hold it ſtill,</l>
               <l>Becauſe the Right appears not half ſo well.</l>
               <l>Who ſo would mend his Faults muſt make a Blot</l>
               <l>May be more Truth, but moſt will like it not.</l>
               <l>For though fair Vertue <hi>Plato</hi> wiſht to ſee,</l>
               <l>Yet Vice as fair will pleaſe no leſs than ſhe.</l>
               <l>Why are Temptations names for what is ill?</l>
               <l>But that her Charms are moſt prevailing ſtill.</l>
               <l>Or Vice call'd Pleaſures? But to ſhew alone,</l>
               <l>That Vice and Pleaſure in effect are one.</l>
               <l>Hence came our Wit to think there was no Devil;</l>
               <l>Or if he Tempter was, he was not evil:</l>
               <l>And finding him dreſt in a different faſhion,</l>
               <l>According to the humour of each Nation,</l>
               <l>And that the <hi>Indians</hi> were in this ſo civil,</l>
               <l>To Whiten him we Blackned for the Devil.</l>
               <l>He thought that he was Black or White, and Saint or</l>
               <l>Devil, according as it pleaſed the Painter.</l>
               <l>And Vice and Vertue both were our Opinion,</l>
               <l>And vari'd with the Laws of each Dominion.</l>
               <l>To which who did conform was underſtood,</l>
               <l>As their Modes differ'd to be bad or good.</l>
