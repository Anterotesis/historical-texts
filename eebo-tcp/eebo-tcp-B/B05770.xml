            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A ſeaſonble Propoſal for the Benefite and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of <hi>Women-Servants.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THO Projects of this Nature at firſt view are generally ſlighted, yet if it be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red deliberatly, how much theſe Servants are expoſed in an ignominious manner, when through Age, Sickneſs, or Accidents, they are rendered incapable to ſerve; It will be found to have its due weight, ſeing it tends not only to prevent the Abuſes that are committed by ſuch rigid dealing with Servants, who without their own fault are diſabled from working, but alſo will prove a great Encouragement to Servants to be more faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and uſeful in their Service.</p>
            <p>It muſt be a melancholy Proſpect, and diſcouraging for Servants to conſider, that by reaſon of the ſmalneſs of their Fees, they cannot in many years put as much to the fore as will maintain them one Month in Sickneſs, and in caſe any Accident befall them, they foreſee themſelves to be undone, which tempts many of them to take unlawful Means to prevent theſe foreſeen evils to the prejudice of their own Soul, and of the intereſt of thoſe they ſerve.</p>
            <p>And therefore it is unqueſtionably a Duty that proper Methods be fallen upon to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy this Evil; In order to which, a very ſmall part of Servants Fees, not exceeding Twelve pennies of each pound <hi>Scots,</hi> ought to be collected to begin a Fund for erecting an <hi>Hoſpital</hi> for maintaining ſuch Servants, as through Age, Sickneſs, Infirmity, or other Accidents are rendred uncapable to ſerve; And it's certain there is no Servant will grudge at this ſmall Proportion, when they know it is to be applyed only to the uſe foreſaid, ſo much for their Advantage and Encouragement: Neither can it be uneaſie or burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, the Proportion being ſo ſmall.</p>
            <p>The Advantages that will attend this Undertaking are, 1. It will eaſe the Place of a Burden that is otherways more than ſufficiently burdened already. 2. It will encourage Servants to be dutiful and honeſt when they foreſee a Remedy provided for them in caſe of diſtreſs. 3. It will provoke others to go in to the Example. 4. It will prevent the Uncharitable and Inhumane Ejection of Servants when in diſtreſs. 5. When any Servant is advanced to a better Station, ſhe may be provoked to a charitable Contribution for ſuch a good Work in favours of thoſe that are in the Station ſhe once was in. 6. The Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal may be under ſuch a Government as may help to take care of the Souls as well as the Bodies of ſuch as come into it, and ſo prevent the unlawful Means that many take ſh<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>n their Misfortune.</p>
            <p>Some will alledge that ſuch ſmall In-comes will never make a Fund ſuitable to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, and the collecting thereof w<gap reason="illegible: damage" extent="1 letter">

            <p>To which it may be anſwered 1. That many Smalls make a Great. 2. <gap reason="illegible: damage" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> forementioned, and their Numbers vaſtly above any of them. 3. There may be other funds beſides their Fees, out of which theſe Contributions may be made, ſuch as a part of the legal Pains impoſed by Law againſt Profaneneſs and Immoralities of Servants, and many People may be induced to give conſiderable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributions to ſuch a charitable Work, from a plain Senſe of the charitableneſs and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of the Deſign. And Laſtly, there will be no difficulty in collecting, ſeing Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters will readily and cheerfully advance the Proportion from the plain Advantage and Proſpect they will reap by the deſigned Project at any time after the Fee falls due, and the Collector may in a ſhorter time, and with leſs Trouble gather in the whole, than many of the ſmall Branches of the Towns Revenues are collected; conſidering, that it will take no great Time or Pains for the Collector or Theſaurer to viſite all the Families within the City ſometime after <hi>Whitſunday</hi> and <hi>Martinmaſs,</hi> and take up the Names of all the Servants, and thoſe the<gap reason="illegible: damage" extent="1 letter">
