            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head type="sub">Prepared for Celebrating the Univerſal Joy, for the Ineſtimable Bleſſing afforded by God to the King, Queen, and People of theſe Realms, in the happy Birth of the moſt Illuſtrious <hi>PRINCE of WALES,</hi> preſented on the <hi>Thames</hi> over-againſt <hi>White-Hall,</hi> on <date>
                  <hi>Tueſday</hi> Night the 17th of <hi>July,</hi> 1688,</date> before both Their Majeſties, the Queen Dowager, the Prince and Princeſs of <hi>Denmark,</hi> and the whole Court.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE firſt Scene of this <hi>Pyrotechnic Opera</hi> repreſented the Joyful Acclamations of the People, expreſſed in theſe Words, written in Letters of Flame, <hi>Vivat Rex,</hi> ſuſpending between two Stately Columns, with a <hi>Girandola,</hi> containing 100 Rockets, all fired at once: And at the ſame Time, ſeveral Water-Machines diſcharged divers Quantities of Water-Baloons and Water-Rockets playing in the <hi>Thames,</hi> and thence riſing up into the Air, and again falling into the Water, with great Diverſion and Variety; in the mean Time, the Baloons, out of the Mortar-Pieces from the right and left Wings, with the Triumph-Guns, and a Mortar-Piece of Nine Cylinders, threw up Baloons into the Air, to a very great Height, where they broke into ſeveral Sorts of Fire-Works, as Stars, Reports, Fire-drops, and ſmall Rockets.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Repreſentation was the Figure of <hi>Bacchus,</hi> mounted upon a Tun placed on a large Pedeſtal, holding in his right hand a Golden Cup, and in his left, the Arms of the <hi>Prince of Wales:</hi> Over his Head were character'd in Letters of Flame, <hi>Laetitia Populi;</hi> while out of the Figure, Tun, and Pedeſtal, were caſt forth all Sorts of Fire-Works, playing both in the Water and in the Air; and at the ſame Time, on the right and left Side of <hi>Bacchus,</hi> were placed, on two Platforms, Frames of 150 great Rockets, from ſix to twelve Pounds weight each, which played continually.</p>
            <p>The third Scene exhibited the firing the Cyphers of <hi>Their Majeſties Names,</hi> encompaſſed with two Laurel Branches of Fire, having above them an <hi>Imperial Crown,</hi> and above that a <hi>Sun</hi> in his full Luſtre, between the two forementioned Pyramids of forty-five Foot high, ſupported at each Corner with a Lion Couchant, and raiſed upon two large Pedeſtals, the ſaid Pyramids having each, on either of the Tops, a large <hi>Flower-de-luce</hi> burning, environed with burning Laurels, and caſting out divers Sorts of Fire-Works, the Pedeſtals likewiſe throwing out ſeveral Thouſands of Rockets, both up into the Air, and down into the Water; and on the four Corners of the Platform, were placed as many large <hi>Girandola's,</hi> each conſiſting of a Hundred large Rockets; and behind theſe Pyramids, another large Platform, furniſhed with five Hundred great Rockets, which played all the while the <hi>Royal Cyphers</hi> were burning, beſides a Hundred great Rockets which were fired round about the Platform, on which the Pyramids were placed.</p>
            <p>And now the whole Front of the Fire-Works appeared clearly enlightened which was diſpoſed after this Manner: On the right Hand of the Pyramids was placed, at a 100 Foot diſtance, a Figure of twelve Foot high, on a larges Pedeſtal, the Figure reſembling <hi>A Beautiful Woman,</hi> in her right Hand holding a Laurel Wreath, and with her left embracing a Pyramid; on her Head, a Crown, and cloathed in a Scarlet Robe embroidered with Gold, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting the Emblem of <hi>Royal Glory,</hi> which was ſignified by a Motto, raiſed three Foot above her Head, made out in flaming Letters of twenty-two Foot long, and two Foot and a half high, in theſe Words, <hi>Gloria Principis,</hi> ſending forth a continual Fire of all Sorts; and behind the Figure, at 100 Foot Diſtance, was a Platform, upon which all this while played three Hundred great Rockets.</p>
            <p>The next Figure, ſomewhat advanced before the reſt of the Front, was that of <hi>Bacchus,</hi> before deſcribed, repreſenting the Emblem of the <hi>People's Gladneſs,</hi> expreſſing in like large Letters of Flame this Motto, <hi>Laetitia Populi.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the left Hand of the Pyramids, was another Figure of twelve Foot high, at the former Diſtance; this Figure reſembling <hi>A Beautiful Woman,</hi> was veſted in an Azure Robe, richly adorned, on her Head a Crown, with her right Hand graſping the <hi>Britiſh Oak;</hi> twined about with Ivy Branches and Berries, ſtanding upon a Pedeſtal; at her Feet, on one Side a Hare, on the other Side a Hen and Chickens, each on a little Pedeſtal, being all Emblems of Foecundity, and alluding to her Majeſty's happy Fruitfulneſs, expreſſed by the Figure of Foecundity; over whoſe Head, at three Foot Diſtance, burned a Motto in fiery Letters, of twenty-ſeven Foot and a half long, and two Foot and a half high, expreſſing theſe Words, <hi>Fauſra Foecunditas;</hi> which Figure in her left Arm held a Child, repreſenting the <hi>PRINCE of WALES,</hi> over whoſe Head burned a Motto, ſhaped like a half Circle, eight Foot the whole, and four Foot the Semidiameter, in theſe Words, <hi>Propago Imperii,</hi> caſting forth a continual and different Fire of all Sorts, both in the Air and Water, there being alſo three Hundred great Rockets which played up into the Air one after another, during the Time the Figure was burning.</p>
            <p>By this laſt Deſcription of the Front of the Fire-Works, and the ſeveral Motto's, will be clearly underſtood the Deſign and Intent of the Whole, which imports this Senſe or Meaning, <hi>viz. <hi>That the Glory of the King, and Gladneſs of the People,</hi>
               </hi> had been happily augmented <hi>By the bleſſed Fruitfulneſs of Her Majeſty,</hi> having brought forth (in the moſt Auſpicious Birth of His Royal Highneſs) <hi>A Prince,</hi> to propagate the Honour and Greatneſs of the <hi>Britiſh Empixe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The laſt Firing afforded not an unpleaſing Spectacle, by the playing off of three Thouſand Rockets out of ſix <hi>Girandola's,</hi> which were played upon two Platforms, upon the right and left of the abovementioned Figures, each at two Hundred Foot Diſtance, in a ſtrait Line with the ſaid Pyramids, concluding with the Diſcharge of forty-five Baloons out of the aforeſaid Mortar-Pieces and Triumph Guns from their Platforms, upon the right and left Wings. The end of this ſplendid Diverſion was made known by the Noiſe of His Majeſty's Trumpets and Kettle Drums, ſeconded by the People's repeated <hi>Huzza's,</hi> expreſſing the Satisfaction they had received in the happy and ſucceſsful Performance of what had been undertaken, which was cloſed by the Diſcharge of the Great Ordnance from the Tower.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Deſcription</hi> of the <hi>Royal Fire-works,</hi> now made publick, in Memory of the great Occaſion for which they were firſt deſigned, is, in all humility, Dedicated to the Growing Glory of <hi>His Royal Highneſs</hi> the <hi>PRINCE of WALES,</hi> by</p>
