            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>For naked Truth received a papal Wound:</l>
               <l>And therefore dares not venture on the Stage,</l>
               <l>Leaſt ſhe become the Monſter of the Age.</l>
               <l>But yet, ſuppoſe there is ſuch Streams, then know,</l>
               <l>That our Advice will profit much below.</l>
               <l>Look too't then <hi>Rodamanthus,</hi> for now ſhe,</l>
               <l>Who has Exhauſted <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Normandie;</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Deſcends thy Shades, and like <hi>Bohemoth</hi> will,</l>

               <l>And yet ne'r find a Cordial for their Pain.</l>
               <l>But ſince ſhe's gone, our Tiplers need not fear;</l>
               <l>For whilſt ſhe liv'd true <hi>Nants</hi> was monſtrous deer.</l>
               <l>Yet <hi>Brandy-Merchants,</hi> ſure have cauſe to grieve;</l>
               <l>Becauſe her Fate admits of no Reprieve.</l>
               <l>Die in their Debts ſhe could not, yet they'l find,</l>
               <l>Their Trad's decay'd, for none is left behind;</l>
               <l>That in one Day could twenty Quarts conſume,</l>
               <l>And bravely vaunt, ſhe durſt it twice preſume.</l>
               <l>Bounteous ſhe was, unto her ſelf and wou'd;</l>
               <l>Be ſure to taſte, what e'r ſhe fancied good.</l>
               <l>As for the Plot, none e'r could tax her (why?)</l>
               <l>Becauſe her Soul did Active thoughts defye:</l>
               <l>She hated Treaſon, and was always bent;</l>
               <l>To pleaſe her ſelf, with Liquid Element.</l>
               <l>Nor could a ſuperſtitious Thought prevail,</l>
               <l>To make her in Religious Notions fail.</l>
               <l>No Tranſubſtantiations would ſhe know,</l>
               <l>But what deſtill'd from Pallid Wines did flow.</l>
               <l>Nor any Relict wou'd ſhe own but that,</l>
               <l>Which good St. <hi>Brandy</hi> did from <hi>France</hi> Tranſlat.</l>
               <l>Her Care was always to adore the Shrine,</l>
               <l>Or Tavern-Buſh, that had the briskeſt Wine.</l>
               <l>One thing of her, I almoſt had forgot;</l>
               <l>She oft wou'd praiſe a ſeaſon'd <hi>Brandy</hi> Pot.</l>
               <l>And with ſuch fervent Kiſſes grace the Cup,</l>
               <l>That it conſented, when ſhe toſt it up</l>
               <l>Theſe are not half her vertuous Deeds, for ſtill,</l>
               <l>She would a Pipe with Expedition fill.</l>
               <l>And then cou'd force the Vapours to abound,</l>
               <l>That Clouds of Smoak would oft invade her round</l>
               <l>And ſo like <hi>Juno,</hi> undeſcerned ſit,</l>
               <l>By pleaſing Arts, not Charms of Magick Wit.</l>
               <l>But Fortune to the braveſt is a Foe,</l>
               <l>When leaſt deſerv'd, ſhe does moſt envy ſhow.</l>
               <l>And often vers, at laſt ſhe joyns with Fate,</l>
               <l>And perſecutes with undeſerved Hate.</l>
               <l>For this good Matron, that ſo well was fed;</l>
               <l>By lean-jaw'd Death, was into Bondage led.</l>
               <l>I will not ſay with <hi>Typhon</hi>'s her waſt Bulk,</l>
               <l>O'reſpread nine Acres, yet her mighty Hulk;</l>
               <l>Six Foot in Compaſs was ſuppos'd to be,</l>
               <l>Too ponderous for a common Deſtinie.</l>
               <l>No Fate when ſhe was ſober durſt aſſail,</l>
               <l>Her well-built Structure, nor could ought prevail.</l>
               <l>Too ſtrong the Baſis were, whereon ſhe ſtood;</l>
               <l>That ſollid Maſs, compos'd with Fleſh and Blood</l>
               <l>Had not perfidious Legs and Feet betray'd;</l>
               <l>The Element could not have Conqueſt made.</l>
               <l>But here's the Plot! As Jeſuits aſſiſt each other,</l>
               <l>So pow'rful <hi>Brandy,</hi> help'd its weaker Brother.</l>
               <l>And both together did effect, what none</l>
               <l>Could have perform'd; had it been left alone.</l>
               <l>So Joynt-Conſpiracies oft ruine States,</l>
               <l>Which are too ſtrong, and brave the Vulgar Fates</l>
               <l>But ſince this good Matrona's gone, lets pay</l>
               <l>Her Obſequies, and weep without delay.</l>
               <l>Let Briny Tears, from watry Fountains flow,</l>
               <l>And all the Paths with mournful <hi>Ciprus</hi> ſtrow.</l>
