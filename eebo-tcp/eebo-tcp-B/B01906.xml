         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The CASE of the Honourable <hi>Fytton Gerard</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> Returned to Serve in Parliament for the Borough of <hi>Clitheroe,</hi> againſt <hi>John Weddall</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> appointed to be heard on <date>the 15th Day of this Inſtant <hi>January.</hi>
               </date>
            </head>
            <p>MR. <hi>Wilkinſon,</hi> Uncle to Mr. <hi>Weddall,</hi> deſigning (as appears by many of his, and his Agents foul Practices) to make a Return of his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew to ſerve in Parliament for the ſaid Borough, in the room of <hi>Anthony Parker</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> put in to be Choſen one of the Bayliffs of the Town, and Treated for that purpoſe, as ſince, and before, he has been at the whole Charge for Mr. <hi>Weddall,</hi> whom he ſet up to be Recorder of the Town; and by the Voices of a few, without the Conſent of the Majority of the Burgeſſes and Freemen, he got him declared Recorder, and ſworn Clandeſtinely in an Alehouſe.</p>
            <p>The next point which they thought eſſential to gain to ſerve their turn, was to keep Men off from being found by a Jury according to Cuſtom to have right to be Burgeſſes or Freemen; in order to which, ſome of the Jury were practiced upon to abſent themſelves, and force was uſed, ſo that there could not be a full Jury, though the Fore-Man, with others, met and ſtayed in the Court ſome Hou<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s, and ſeveral Summons were ſent to the reſt, who were fined for their Non-appearance. Upon which the Court was Adjourned to the next Day, but <hi>Chippendale,</hi> one of the Bayliffs, pretended to have diſmiſs'd the Enquiry Jury, tho' without the Conſent, or Privity of Mr. <hi>Stock</hi> the other Bayliff, and without cauſing Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation to be made of the Diſmiſſion, by Colour only of an Inſtrument ſigned out of Court by Mr. <hi>Chippendale,</hi> which Mr. <hi>Weddall</hi> ſitting as Recorder, ordered to be read: By which Trick ſeveral who had right to Vote in the Choice of Bayliffs, and had offered their Deeds to Evidence their right, were not found by the Jury, but their Votes, though they had a right, were denied at the Election of Bayliffs: Notwithſtanding which Mr. <hi>Mainwaring,</hi> a Gentleman of Four or Five Hundred Pounds a Year, within a Mile of the Place, beſides Houſes in the Town, and a good Eſtate in the County, and in <hi>Cheſhire,</hi> was in his Abſence, without his ſeeking, or privity, duly Choſen out Bayliff, whoſe place has always been accounted the Chief.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Mainwaring</hi> ſoon after offered himſelf to be Sworn according to the Cuſtom, but being refuſed, he brought two ſucceſſive <hi>Mandamus</hi>'s from the <hi>King</hi>'s-<hi>Bench,</hi> which were diſobeyed: And Mr. <hi>Wilkinſon,</hi> though never Choſen, pretending that Mr. <hi>Mainwaring</hi> was incapable, as being under Age, was Sworn by Mr. <hi>Liſter,</hi> who himſelf had been Sworn but by one Bayliff, though the Cuſtom requires that both the old Bayliffs, if Alive and Well, ſhould joyn in Adminiſtring the Oath. Upon this Mr. <hi>Wilkinſon</hi> took upon him to Act as Out-Bayliff, and he and Mr. <hi>Liſter,</hi> that they might diſcourage and ſtrike a Terrour into thoſe who had declared for Mr. <hi>Gerard,</hi> came with <hi>Ambroſe Pudſey</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> 
               <hi>Thomas Liſter</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> and others Arm'd into a Publick Houſe, where ſome of Mr. <hi>Gerard</hi>'s Friends were peaceably Drinking together, and fell violently upon them: <hi>Thomas Liſter</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> and <hi>Ambroſe Pudſey</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> ſet Piſtols to the Breaſts of ſeveral of them, and Mr. <hi>John Liſter</hi> Bayliff, threw one of them to the Ground, and Trampled upon him, and for this the pretended Bayliffs Mr. <hi>Wilkinſon</hi> and Mr. <hi>Liſter</hi> Committed them to Priſon, and ordered them to be laid in a Dungeon, without any Warrant or Mittimus. After this, ſeveral who had right, ſome to Burgages, others to Freedoms, proffered themſelves at ſeveral Court Days to be admitted and Sworn, but were refuſed: Whereupon they brought ſeveral Writs of <hi>Mandamus,</hi> but to defeat them of the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage thereof, and their Votes at the ſaid Election, no return has been made of either of the ſaid <hi>Mandamus</hi>'s.</p>
            <p>A Writ for the Choice of a Burgeſs being delivered to the High Sheriff, he being informed of theſe Irregularities, himſelf carryed his Precept for an Election, and coming to the Town on the 24th of <hi>November,</hi> ſent to ſpeak with Mr. <hi>Liſter,</hi> who declined ſpeaking with him, but being acquainted by the Under Sheriff, while Mr. <hi>Wilkinſon</hi> was by, that a Precept was brought for Electing a Burgeſs, Mr. <hi>Liſter,</hi> with ſome Burgeſſes, and Mr. <hi>Wilkinſon</hi>'s Clerk, without his Maſter, came to the Sheriff, who in preſence of a great many of the Burgeſſes, demanded who was the Out-Bayliff, and they cryed out, Mr. <hi>Mainwaring</hi> is our Out-Bayliff. Upon this the High Sheriff delivered the Precept to Mr. <hi>Mainwaring,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Liſter,</hi> as Bayliffs of the Town, and told them he expected a return of it: And Mr. <hi>Mainwaring</hi> ask't Mr. <hi>Liſter</hi> when they ſhould meet with ſome of the Burgeſſes to conſider of a Day for the Election; but he, notwithſtanding he had been ſollicited with all Civility by Mr. <hi>Mainwaring,</hi> refuſed to joyn; upon which, on the 25th of <hi>November,</hi> Mr. <hi>Mainwaring</hi> meeting with ſeveral of the Burgeſſes, by their Advice appointed the Election to be on the 30th, and cauſed it to be proclaimed in two places of the Town, upon a Market Day, and publiſhed Papers to the like ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect: but Mr. <hi>Wilkinſon</hi> and Mr. <hi>Liſter,</hi> in Contempt of the Precept, cauſed Proclamation to be made by way of Countermanding the Election. When the Day of Election came, Mr. <hi>Mainwaring</hi> came to the Town-Hall, and to prevent diſorders adjourned into a Penthouſe in the open Street where the Precept was read: But Mr. <hi>Liſter</hi> who was perſent, being deſired by Mr. <hi>Mainwaring</hi> to joyn with him, without proclamation pronounced, the Court Adjourned to the Town Hall, where he proceeded without a Precept, to have a Poll taken for Mr. <hi>Weddall,</hi> while Mr. <hi>Mainwaring</hi> with the Precept, proceeded on to the Election: And though Mr. <hi>Liſter</hi> admitted perſons unqualified, to Vote for Mr. <hi>Weddall,</hi> Mr. <hi>Gerard</hi> had the Majority: Therefore the Sheriff annexed to the Precept an Indenture Signed by Mr. <hi>Mainwaring</hi> and ſeveral of the Burgeſſes who Choſe Mr. <hi>G<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
