         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>DEar Mother I reckon to marry,</l>
               <l>I hope you will give your conſent:</l>
               <l>For as I am told, full Eighteen Years old,</l>
               <l>I was in the midſt of laſt <hi>Lent.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>'Tis time I was marry'd you know,</l>
               <l>Three Winters and Summers agoe,</l>
               <l>I then did diſcover the Ioys of a Lover:</l>
               <l>When <hi>Roger</hi> he tickl'd me ſo,</l>
               <l>O! he is as pretty a Fellow I vow,</l>
               <l>As ever was train'd up to follow the Plough.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Why Huswife what mean you by <hi>Roger,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>the paſſionate Mother reply'd,</l>
               <l>A Country Clown, the ſcorn of the Town,</l>
               <l>you may be a Gentleman's Bride:</l>
               <l>For, Daughter, i'll make it appear,</l>
               <l>That now in fair <hi>Somerſetſhire,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Beſides Gold and Treaſure, and Wealth out of meaſure,</l>
               <l>My Rents are Two Hundred a Year,</l>
               <l>And do you imagine, that I will allow,</l>
               <l>My Daughter to marry a Fellow at Plough.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The Plough is a Staff to the Kingdom,</l>
               <l>a Pillar and Prop to the Throne:</l>
               <l>On every hand it fattens the Land,</l>
               <l>with Plenty, 'tis very well known,</l>
               <l>For if we had Guinea's untold,</l>
               <l>More than a whole Kingdom could hold,</l>
               <l>What Man would be quiet without any Diet,</l>
               <l>For who ever liv'd upon Gold?</l>
               <l>No Creature, dear Mother, and therefore I'll vow,</l>
               <l>To marry a Husband that follows the Plough.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But Gold is a beautiful Metal,</l>
               <l>this City and Court to adorn,</l>
               <l>To ſatisfie you, a handful or two,</l>
               <l>is worth many Buſhels of Corn:</l>
               <l>The farmers where ever they dwell,</l>
               <l>Their Corn they will readily ſell,</l>
               <l>For Money to any, ſo ſweet is the Penny,</l>
               <l>Without it, there's none can live well,</l>
               <l>And therefore, dear Daughter, conſider this now,</l>
               <l>And take not a Fellow that follows the Plough.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>I ſhall have hereafter, dear Mother,</l>
               <l>two Hundred a Year, and above,</l>
               <l>A plentiful ſtore, I'll covet no more:</l>
               <l>but marry the Man that I love;</l>
               <l>Tho' in a poor Ierkin he goes,</l>
               <l>And Patches, perhaps on his Hoſe,</l>
               <l>Dear Mother pray hear me, when e'er he comes near me,</l>
               <l>His Breath is as ſweet as a Roſe:</l>
               <l>If ever I marry, I ſolemnly vow,</l>
               <l>It ſhall he a Fellow that follows the Plough.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Dear Daughter I ſtrange at your Fancy,</l>
               <l>this 'Squire that Courts you, I know,</l>
               <l>Will make you his Wife, and love you as Life,</l>
               <l>in Iewels and Gemms you may go:</l>
               <l>He's wealthy, and handſome, withal,</l>
               <l>Both luſty, ſtrait, proper, and tall,</l>
               <l>And you'll be attended, and likewiſe befriended,</l>
               <l>Have Servants to come at your Call,</l>
               <l>Pray why will you ſlight ſuch a Happineſs now,</l>
               <l>And take a poor Fellow that follows the Plough.</l>

            <lg>
               <l>A Fig for the Bully young 'Squire,</l>
               <l>a Crack he do's conſtantly keep;</l>
               <l>He'll revel and Sport, with Ladies at Court,</l>
               <l>while I in my Chamber may weep,</l>
               <l>To think of my ſad Overthrow:</l>
               <l>But <hi>Roger</hi> will never do ſo,</l>
               <l>He's honeſt I know it, and cannot foregoe it,</l>
               <l>And Mother he loves me I know:</l>
               <l>And therefore, it ever I marry, I vow</l>
               <l>It ſhall be with <hi>Roger</hi> that follows the Plough.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Dear Daughter, if that be the Reaſon,</l>
               <l>thy Wiſdom I needs muſt commend,</l>
               <l>A right honeſt Man will get what he can,</l>
               <l>but others will waſtfully ſpend,</l>
               <l>And ruine their Families quite,</l>
               <l>I think thou art much in the right:</l>
               <l>I will not deny thee, let <hi>Roger</hi> lye by thee,</l>
               <l>Since he is thy Ioy and Delight,</l>
               <l>And when thou art marry'd, my Love ſhall be ſhown;</l>
               <l>I'll give him a Farm, and Two Ploughs of his own.</l>
