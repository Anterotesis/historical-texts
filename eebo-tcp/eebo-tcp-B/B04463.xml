            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> 
               <hi>York</hi> Herald, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Senior</hi> Herald, in theſe words:</p>

            <p>Which being ended, and the Trumpets ſounding a Flouriſh, was anſwered by ſeveral repeated Shouts of the People.</p>
            <p>And Directions being given to proclaim the ſame within <hi>Temple-Bar,</hi> in <hi>Cheap ſide,</hi> and at the <hi>Royall-Exchange,</hi> the Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing marched in this manner:</p>
            <p>Firſt, the ſeveral Beadles of the Liberties of <hi>Weſtminſter;</hi> Next the Conſtables of the ſaid Liberties, all on foot, with the High-Conſtable on Horſe-back; After them the Head Bailiff of <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and his Men, all with white Staves, to clear the way, on Horſe-back; Then the Knight-marſhals Men, alſo on Horſe-back; Next to theſe a Claſs of Trumpets, Nine in all <hi>viz.</hi> 2, 2, 2, and 3. followed by the Sergeant-Trumpeter, carrying his Mace on his ſhoulder, all likewiſe on Horſe-back; Then a Purſuivant of Arms ſingle; Then a Purſuivant and a Sergeant at Arms: Anorher Purſuivant and a Sergeant at Arms; Then four Heralds of Arms, one after another, each with a Sergeant at Arms on his left hand, the Heralds and Purſuivants being all in their Rich Coats of the Royal Arms, and the Sergeants at Arms, each carrying his Mace on his ſhoulder, and all on Horſe-back, Then Garter King of Arms in his Rich Coat of Arms, carrying the Proclamation, accompanied by Sir <hi>Tho. Duppa,</hi> Kt. Gentleman-Uſher of the Black-Rod, in his Crimſon Mantle of the Order of the Garter, and his Black-Rod of Office, likewiſe on Horſe-back.</p>
            <p>Theſe immediately preceded the Marqueſs of <hi>Halifax,</hi> who executed the Place of Speaker in the Houſe of Lords, in his Coach, attended by Sir <hi>Roger Harſnet,</hi> eldeſt Serjeant at Arms, with his Mace. Then follow'd <hi>Henry Powle</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> Speaker of the Houſe of Commons, in his Coach, attended by <hi>John Topham</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> Serjeant at Arms to the ſaid Houſe, with his Mace. After the two Speakers of the Houſes, followed the Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> Earl Marſhal, and Primier Duke of <hi>England</hi> in his Coach, with his Marſhals Staff in his hand. And next to him all the Peers in order in their Coaches. And laſt of all the Members of the Houſe of Commons in their Coaches. In this Order they proceeded towards <hi>Temple-bar:</hi> and being come as far the <hi>Maypole</hi> in the <hi>Strand,</hi> two of the Officers of Arms with a Sergeant at Arms, and Two Trumpets went before to <hi>Temple-bar,</hi> and the Lord Mayor, Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and Sheriffs, being by this time arrived there, and having ordered the Gates to be ſhut, the Herald at Arms knocked thereat, whereupon the Sheriffs, being on Horſe-back, came to the Gate, and the ſaid Herald acquainting them, <hi>That he came by Order of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal aſſembled at</hi> Weſtminſter, <hi>to demand Entrance in that Famous City, for the Proclaiming of</hi> William <hi>and Mary, King and Queen of</hi> England, France, <hi>and</hi> Ireland, <hi>and the dominions and Teritories thereunto belonging; and therefore required their ſpeedy Anſwer.</hi> The ſaid Sheriffs ordered the Gates to be opened. Whereupon leaving the Head-Bayliff, Conſtables, and Beadles of <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> without the Barr, the reſt of the Proceeding entred, where they found the Lord Mayor, Aldermen, Recorder, and Sheriffs, all in their Formalities and on Horſe-back, except the Lord Mayor who was in his Coch, attended by the Sword-bearer, and other of his Officers, who joyfully receiving them, they made a ſtand between the two Temple-Gates, and Proclaimed their Majeſties a ſecond time. From whence they marched towards <hi>Cheap-ſide,</hi> a Claſs of the City-Trumpets, and the Lord Mayor's Livery-men leading the way, and the ſaid Aldermen, and Lord Mayor falling into the Proceeding: And near <hi>Wood-ſtreet</hi> end (the place where <hi>Cheap-ſide</hi>-Croſs formerly ſtood) they made another ſtand, and Proclaimed their Majeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es a third time. And arriving at the <hi>Royal Exchange</hi> about Two of the Clock, they Proclaimed them a fourth time; and at each Proclamation the vaſt multitudes of Spectators who thronged the Streets, Balconies and Windows, filled the Air with loud and repeated ſhouts and expreſſions of Joy. Within <hi>Temple-bar,</hi> and all along <hi>Fleetſtreet,</hi> the <hi>Orange</hi> Regiment of the City Militia, lined both ſides of the way, as did the <hi>Green</hi> Regiment within <hi>Ludgate</hi> and St. <hi>Paul's Church-yard;</hi> the <hi>Blew</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment in <hi>Cheap-ſide,</hi> and the <hi>White</hi> in <hi>Cornhil.</hi>
