            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The CASE of <hi>Nathaniel Herne</hi> relating to his Election at <hi>Dartmouth</hi> in <hi>Devon.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat it being the Cuſtom of the ſaid Town to chooſe their Burgeſſes for Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by the Votes of the Freemen of the ſaid Burrough; they were accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly ſummoned to appear at the Guild-hall of the ſaid Burrough the 15 day of <hi>February</hi> laſt. And then and there Mr. <hi>Joſias Child</hi> was, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jority of Votes elected to be a Burgeſs for the ſaid Burrough, in the place of <hi>Will. Gould.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the Mayor and 28 of the Burgeſſes of the ſaid Town have returned an Indenture under their Hands and Seales, by which they declare that they have choſen Mr. <hi>Nath. Herne</hi> Burgeſs, in the place of the ſaid <hi>Will. Gould.</hi> And withall a Certificate under their Hands, directed to the Knights, Citizens and Burgeſſes of Parliament, Repreſenting their Choice of Mr. <hi>Herne,</hi> and declaring that they conceive the choice of Mr. <hi>Child</hi> to be Illegal. For that though it were by the majority of Voyces: Yet very many of the perſons that ſo gave their Votes, had received Rewards and Money for their Votes in the ſaid Election.</p>
            <p>At the Election Mr. <hi>Child</hi> had 43 Voices, Mr. <hi>Herne</hi> had 29, which is leſs by 14.</p>
            <p>But it will be made Evident and proved, That Mr. <hi>Child,</hi> by his Agents, hath by ſeveral indirect and unlawful wayes procured a greater number of Voices for his Election, and that out of thoſe very perſons who (before Mr. <hi>Child's</hi> Agents had tampered with them) had publickly and reſolvedly declared themſelves for Mr. <hi>Herne:</hi> As,
<list>
                  <item>1. That there are eight of the 43. who have (by their own Confeſſion) actually receiv'd Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, upon the Condition they ſhould give their Votes for Mr. <hi>Child.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. That there are other eight of the 43. that were taken off, and gave their Votes for Mr. <hi>Child,</hi> by Money lent <hi>gratis,</hi> or advanced before hand for Wares, or prevailed with by Offers of other Advantage upon the ſame Condition of voting for Mr. <hi>Child.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>3. That two more of the ſaid number of 43. were prevailed with by Mr. <hi>Child's</hi> procuring a Ship to be cleared without charge to them whereof they were owners, and this too upon the ſame Condition.</item>
                  <item>4. That there was an offer of 500 <hi>l.</hi> to the Corporation to be ſetled upon them freely to do therewith as they ſhould pleaſe, in caſe they would chooſe Mr. <hi>Child.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>5. And endeavours uſed by Offers of Money to draw off others from giving their Votes for Mr. <hi>Herne,</hi> who refuſed to take money on that account.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>So that it will appear Mr <hi>Child</hi>'s Election was an Undue Election.</p>
            <p>And that there were ſo many Voyces illegally procured for Mr. <hi>Child,</hi> as that if they be declar'd invalid, The majority of Votes will then be on Mr. <hi>Hern's</hi> part, if that will make his <hi>Election</hi> a good <hi>Election.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And to this it may be added, That this way of offer to buy Voices, and purchaſe an Election, is a Practice which the ſaid <hi>Joſias Child</hi> hath uſed, not only here, but elſewhere: As for inſtance, He offer'd at the Town of <hi>Ipſwich,</hi> a conſiderable Summe to the Corporation there, upon condition they would chooſe him Burgeſs for that place, as Mr. <hi>Wright</hi> who now ſerves for the Town will witneſs, if required.</p>
            <p>And further, that the great Argument uſed by Mr. <hi>Childs</hi> Agents to draw off the reſt of thoſe Voices which would not be tempted with Money, That he was the Inſtrument of procuring the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of Indulgence from his Majeſty to the Diſſenters; and of the continuance thereof.</p>
