         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>REASONS <hi>Humbly offered to the Conſideration of</hi> PARLIAMENT, <hi>why</hi> STOCK-FISH <hi>and Live</hi> EELS <hi>ſhould be Imported into</hi> ENGLAND: <hi>Notwithſtanding the ſame being at preſent Prohibited by the</hi> ACT, <hi>which Prohibits the Importation of Iriſh</hi> CATTLE <hi>and Forreign</hi> FISH.</head>
            <p>
               <label>Firſtly,</label> 
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE ſaid <hi>Cod-fiſh, alias Stock-Fiſh,</hi> is Caught and Cured in <hi>Iſeland,</hi> which is in the King of <hi>Denmarks</hi> Dominions, and no where elſe; and is Cured without Salt, by the Coldneſs of the Air and Froſt; only which Fiſh is made uſe of by all our Ships trading to the <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>Weſt Indies, Guinney,</hi> and other parts, where no other s;ort of <hi>Fiſh</hi> will keep good, but decay.</p>
            <p>
               <label>Secondly,</label> The ſaid <hi>Stock-Fiſh</hi> is never made uſe of in any other place then where our own <hi>Fiſh</hi> will never keep or hold good: So that there is never the leſs of our Engliſh <hi>Fiſh</hi> ſpent, by the <hi>Stock-Fiſh</hi> imported into the Kingdom; in as much as no Perſon will Eat that if they can get our <hi>Engliſh Cod</hi> or <hi>Ling.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <label>Thirdly,</label> This ſort of <hi>Fiſh</hi> is abſolutely neceſſary for our <hi>Seamen;</hi> and is obſerved and allowed to have been of great uſe and benefit to them, by preſerving them in their long Voyages from the <hi>Scurvey,</hi> which they are ſubject unto, by reaſon that all other of their Proviſions are extreamly ſalt: So that divers Commanders have affirmed that for want of that ſort of <hi>Fiſh,</hi> two thirds of their Men have in ſome Voyages fallen down with the <hi>Scurvey,</hi> to that degree that they have hardly had Men enough on Board able to ſtand on their Legs for managing their Sails.</p>
            <p>
               <label>Fourthly,</label> If our Shipping cannot be furniſhed with <hi>Stock-Fiſh</hi> here, they will have it from other parts beyond the Seas, <hi>Holland,</hi> or ſome other places: And therefore better for the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to Import it than <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>As for the Live Eels prohibited in the ſame</hi> Act, <hi>they are taken at or near</hi> Copenhagen, <hi>within the ſaid Kingdom of</hi> Denmark, <hi>and brought to</hi> London <hi>Market.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <label>Firſtly,</label> The ſaid <hi>Eels</hi> are taken in Freſh Water within the Land, and are of the Natural Growth of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey; and therefore no way prejudicial to the <hi>Fiſhery</hi> of this Kingdom.</p>
            <p>
               <label>Secondly,</label> That the Trade of bringing Live <hi>Eels</hi> from <hi>Denmark</hi> to <hi>London</hi> Market, is but for one Voyage in the year, which time is about <hi>Michaelmaſs,</hi> and that but only for two Ships or Hoys which are built on purpoſe for that Trade.</p>
            <p>
               <label>Thirdly,</label> That formerly (as Ancient Men affirm) there hath been Fourteen Ships or Hoys at one time in the <hi>River</hi> of <hi>Thames</hi> (all <hi>Foreigners</hi>) all which <hi>Eels</hi> were ſold in <hi>London</hi> Market, although the number of People then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habiting in and about the City, not half ſo many as now; which Places where thoſe Ships or Hoys were Laden, are ſince drained, and great Towns built in the room thereof.</p>
            <p>
               <label>Fourthly,</label> That our <hi>Fenns</hi> in <hi>England</hi> being now drained alſo, there is not the hundredth part ſufficient taken in <hi>England</hi> to ſupply the Kingdom. And whereas there can be but two Ships imployed upon that Trade, if there were Lading to be had for more than twenty, they would be all ſold in <hi>London</hi> Market.</p>
            <p>
               <label>Fifthly,</label> That the aforeſaid Trade of bringing live <hi>Eels</hi> into <hi>London</hi> Market, hath been Practiſed time out of mind, as will appear by all the Ancient Mapps of the City of <hi>London,</hi> where you will find the <hi>Eel</hi>-Ships alwayes figured out in the River of <hi>Thames,</hi> lying at Anchor over againſt <hi>Queenhithe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <label>Sixthly,</label> That the ſaid Live <hi>Eels</hi> are Eſteemed (as in Truth they are) moſt Excellent Food (The Price being ſet by the Right Honourable the Lord Mayor of <hi>London</hi>) are bought and ſold, at very reaſonable Rates.</p>
            <p>
               <label>Seventhly,</label> That the ſaid Trade hath heretofore been managed by <hi>Dutchmen</hi> who Sayled from <hi>Holland</hi> to <hi>Denmark,</hi> and bought them there, and brought them to <hi>London</hi> Market, but is now ſolely managed by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> who are Fiſhmongers in <hi>London</hi> (No Forreigner being concerned with them.)</p>
            <p>
               <label>Eighthly,</label> That the aforeſaid <hi>Stock-Fiſh</hi> and <hi>Eels</hi> are the Returns and Effects of our own Manufactories and Growth of this Kingdom, Our Woollen Cloth, Serges, Perpetuanes, <hi>Norwich</hi> Stuffs, Stockings, Pewter, Cheeſe, and Spirits; going out of this Land in Exchange for the ſame.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wherefore it is moſt humbly prayed, That the ſaid</hi> Stock-Fiſh <hi>and Live</hi> Eels <hi>may be Imported, notwithſtanding the Prohibitions aforeſaid, or any new Act that ſhall be made to perpetuate the aforeſaid Acts.</hi>
