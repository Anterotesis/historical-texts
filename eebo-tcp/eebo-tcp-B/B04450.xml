            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>Here's a pretty new Ditty will make you to ſmile;</l>
               <l>The truth of the buſineſs you néed not to fear</l>
               <l>Of a notable Ieſt was done in <hi>Harford-ſhire:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>A luſty brave Malt-man in that Country did dwell</l>
               <l>That lov'd a fair woman, many people can tell;</l>
               <l>But if you'l be pleas'd to attend here and mind,</l>
               <l>He was fitted very finely and ſerv'd in his kind.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>A dainty brave Ale wife that lived him near,</l>
               <l>That bought her Malt of him to brew her ſtrong Beer,</l>
               <l>For he was kind hearted, and loving, and frée,</l>
               <l>But ſhe paid him in's ear, as you plainly ſhall ſee:</l>
               <l>She was run Twenty pounds for Malt on the ſcore,</l>
               <l>But he aimed a Barrel of Beer for to bore;</l>
               <l>But he was deceived, he was caught in a ſnare,</l>
               <l>She was too cunning for him now I do ſwear.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>One day he did chance to look for ſome money,</l>
               <l>But for fear he ſhould fail he deſir'd ſome Coney;</l>
               <l>The Ale-wife was beautyful and very fair,</l>
               <l>And the Malt-man his ſenſes was all on a fire</l>
               <l>With ſeeing ſweet Babies in the Ale-wife's eyes,</l>
               <l>That <hi>Cupid</hi> had ſtruck him with a luſtfull ſurprize;</l>
               <l>He put forth a queſtion, and did her ſalute;</l>
               <l>She anſwer'd him honeſtly with a civil diſpute:</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>For all you'r my Malt-man your ſute's all in vain,</l>
               <l>I'le ne'r wrong my Conſcience my Credit to ſtain,</l>
               <l>That I ſhould defile my own Husbands Bed,</l>
               <l>To be ſuch a Whore to ſet Horns on his Head.</l>
               <l>Thou needs not to fear, that will be no diſgrace,</l>
               <l>There will be no body near us in this place.</l>
               <l>She hearing him eager, and ſo earneſtly bent,</l>
               <l>Thought ſhe, I will fit him, ile his purpoſe prevent.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>And now ſhe contrives an invention I ſwear,</l>
               <l>To pay him the money, and trap him in a ſnare</l>
               <l>And tells him if he will but ſtay till next day</l>
               <l>He ſhould have his deſire to ſport and to play:</l>
               <l>My Husband to morrow he will be from home,</l>
               <l>And then Sir again (if you pleaſe) you may come;</l>
               <l>And reſt your ſelf ſatisfied, and be content,</l>
               <l>Keep every thing cloſe, and all dangers prevent.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Then the Maltſter was pleas'd in the ſtory we find,</l>
               <l>He was ſweetly contented, it pleaſed his mind:</l>
               <l>He ſaid, ile be a good friend if thou be to me true;</l>
               <l>But ſhe was an honeſt woman I tell unto you:</l>
               <l>Then ſhe to her Husband did tell all her mind,</l>
               <l>Be ruled by me, and we'l fit him in's kind:</l>
               <l>And ſo then the Ale-wife laid for him a ſnare,</l>
               <l>To make her husband acquainted it was all her care.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>

               <l>Next day then this Maltſter did come to this Dame,</l>
               <l>But he was well rewarded I think for the ſame:</l>

               <l>And the Maltſter fell to embrac<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

               <l>But before he could his work then begin,</l>
               <l>Her husband immediately fell upon him.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>What ſirrah, do you mean to make a whore of my wife?</l>
               <l>Muſt I be a Cuckold all the days of my life?</l>
               <l>And with a good Cudgel he banged his bones,</l>
               <l>And made him believe he would cut out his ſtones;</l>
               <l>So by head and by ears he pull'd him o' th' Floore,</l>
               <l>That the Maltſter bepiſt him; he loudly did roar,</l>
               <l>All the money you owe me i'le freely forgive,</l>

               <l>No ſirrah, i'le Geld you and put you to ſorrow,</l>
               <l>You had enough of your own, you need not to borrow:</l>
               <l>O then he did beg on his knees very ſore,</l>
               <l>If you'l forgive me i'le do ſo no more.</l>
               <l>O now faith the Ale-man i'le do it for once,</l>

               <l>And take for a warning or he ſhall pay for it dear.</l>
               <l>He went ſneaking away, and was ſorely decoyed,</l>
               <l>And paid for the thing that he never injoyed:</l>
