            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Character of a WILLIAMITE.</head>
            <p>HE is One, who being lately Bug-bear'd out of his Wits, fancies himſelf ſtill haunted by the frightful Ghoſt of Popery. He is always in Company tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting a Man's Ears with ſome diſmal Story; and tells you more Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantick Lyes than ever ſtood on Popiſh Legend for the Holy Promotion of Proteſtant Religion. Three times a Day at leaſt he ſays over little <hi>Chiſwell</hi>'s News-Book with much more Devotion than his Prayers; and by a ſtrong Faith, and the hungry Fryars Bleſſing <hi>[Be thou Fiſh]</hi> enters it into his Creed. He piouſly commends Treachery and Rebellion to <hi>THE LORD'S DOING;</hi> and will not be ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, unleſs Providence work another miraculous Defection to make <hi>IT MORE MARVELOUS IN OUR EYES.</hi> He derives his venerable Name from a Rigid Presbyterian, and by conſequence does not hold himſelf obliged to Solemn Oaths, or any Sacred Tyes whatever. He has entertained ſo deep a Love for the Second Commandment, that he is willing to part with any of the reſt in Exchange for it. Under pretence of rooting out Idolatry from off the Earth, he encourages Children to commit Paricide, and in bold Defiance to the Fifth Commandment Prays, <hi>That their Days may be long in the Land.</hi> He roundly maintains the Doctrine of <hi>Paſſive Obedience,</hi> by quietly ſuffering his Lawful Sovereign to be drove out of his Dominions by Troops of Treacherous Subjects, and Crueller Strangers. With <hi>David</hi> he ſometimes complains (on a ſudden Gripe of his Spirit) <hi>That ye have not kept the Lord's Anointed;</hi> but it is only, becauſe ye have given him a fair Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to recover his own juſt Rights again: As appears by his late ſtrange Defending the King's Title, that is, by taking a New Oath of Allegiance to the <hi>Uſurper</hi> with a formal Declaration, that has no other meaning in it, that I know of, than <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

He never ſpeaks of the Biſhops being ſent to the Tower without Horror and Amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but is now very well contented to have them <hi>Suſpended,</hi> and Doubts not to ſee them <hi>Deprived,</hi> for their malignant Scrupling to Perjure themſelves in their own Preſervation. He is a mighty Stickler for the Liberty and Property of the Subject, and yet tyrannically commands us to make a New Covenant with the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for what all the Laws of the Land have already aſſured us, is <hi>Meum</hi> and <hi>Tuum:</hi> And all this to give us no better a Title to our Eſtates than One has to the Crown he wears; which is to laſt ſo long as we give the Dutch Task-makers leave to Lord it over our Souls and Bodies. He confirms every Body in the Belief, that Things are too far gon ever to think of King <hi>JAMES</hi>'s Return into <hi>England;</hi> and at the ſame Time has a Diſturſt he may prove no <hi>Conjurer:</hi> And therefore repreſents Him as a Common Enemy, the Hater of his People, and ſcares you with Fire and Fagot, and the Lord knows what, to call in your help to fulfil his malitious Prophecy. You will find him Flattering and Fawning upon every little Seclary, and has quite worn off that ſtiff, rugged Humour of admitting none into his Communion but upon the Terms of Chriſt's Inſtitution, that he is now willing to depart from all the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian Rites of Decency; and ever ſince he has heard of the Reſtitution of Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters into the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> begins to talk with a great deal of Indifferency about his very Epiſcopal Ordination, (well knowing the <hi>Reforming</hi> Spirit of our Governours.) Nay, he is grown ſo Gentle and Complying, that he has laid aſide <hi>the diſtinguiſhing Character of the Church of</hi> England, (I mean his Loyalty) as a Title too Invidious and Unſafe for a Proteſtant Church to glory in; and does now with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Bluſh own himſelf as Religious a Rebel as the greateſt Fanatick Zealot in <hi>England,</hi> to <hi>hold the Faith in Unity of Spirit, in the Bond of Peace.</hi>
