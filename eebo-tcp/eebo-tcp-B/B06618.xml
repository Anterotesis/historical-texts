            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>My Lords and Gentlemen,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THE War, which I Entred into by the Advice of My People, is, by the Bleſſing of God, and their Zealous and Affectionate Aſſiſtance, brought to the End We all Propoſed, an Honourable Peace; which I was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to Conclude, not ſo much to Eaſe My Self from any Trouble or Hazard, as to free the Kingdom from the Continuing Burden of an Expenſive War.</p>
            <p>I am heartily ſorry My Subjects will not at firſt find all that Relief from the Peace which I could wiſh, and they may expect; but the Fonds intended for the laſt years Service have fallen ſhort of Anſwering the Sums for which they were gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, ſo that there remain conſiderable Deficiencies to be Provided for.</p>
            <p>There's a Debt upon the Account of the Fleet and the Army.</p>
            <p>The Revenues of the Crown have been anticipated, by My Conſent, for Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Uſes, ſo that I am wholly deſtitute of means to ſupport the Civil Liſt; and I am never diſtruſt you'l ſuffer this to turn to My diſadvantage, but will provide for Me during My Life, in ſuch a manner as may be for My Honour, and for the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Government.</p>
            <p>Our Naval Force being increaſed to near double what it was at My Acceſſion to the Crown, the Charge of maintaining it will be proportionably augmented, and it is certainly neceſſary for the Intereſt and Reputation of <hi>England,</hi> to have always a great ſtrength at Sea.</p>
            <p>The Circumſtances of Affairs Abroad are ſuch, that I think My Self obliged to tell on My Opinion, That for the preſent, <hi>England</hi> cannot be ſafe without a Land force; and I hope We ſhall not give thoſe who mean Us ill, the opportunity of Effecting that, under the Notion of a Peace, which they could not bring to paſs by <gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 word">

            <p>I doubt not but you, Gentlemen of the Houſe of Commons, will take theſe Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars into your Conſideration, in ſuch a manner as to provide the neceſſary Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, which I do very Earneſtly Recommend to you.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lords and Gentlemen,</hi>
               <lb/>
That which I moſt delight to think of, and am beſt pleaſed to own, is, That I have all the Proofs of My Peoples Affection that a Prince can deſire; and I take this Occaſion to give them the moſt ſolemn Aſſurance, That as I never had, ſo I never <gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ill nor can have any Intereſt ſeparate from theirs.</p>
            <p>I Eſteem it one of the greateſt Advantages of the Peace, That I ſhall now have <gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">
