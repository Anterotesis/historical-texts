            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Tradeſman's Lamentation: OR THE Mechanicks Complaint.</head>
            <lg>
               <l>WHat Learned Doctor hath ſuch Skill profound,</l>
               <l>Can raiſe up <hi>Trade</hi> which now lies on the ground</l>
               <l>Gaſping for breath? Except ſome courſe be taken</l>
               <l>I fear, of it we ſhall be quite forſaken;</l>
               <l>Which holds not onely up our <hi>City's</hi> Wall</l>
               <l>But <hi>Cititiz'ns</hi> too, who ſhortly elſe will fall:</l>
               <l>For <hi>Trading</hi> Chiefly doth uphold the Land,</l>
               <l>And <hi>Money</hi> gives it Legs whereon to ſtand;</l>
               <l>Both which are fled, and left's in deſperation,</l>
               <l>Which is the Subject of this Lamentation.</l>
               <l>Walk any where, in Shops, i'th'Streets, or Lanes;</l>
               <l>Not <hi>One</hi> alone, but <hi>All</hi> in <hi>One</hi> complains,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Money</hi>'s ſo ſcarce, and <hi>Trading</hi> is ſo dead,</l>
               <l>That <hi>Tradeſmen</hi> now can ſcarſly buy them bread,</l>
               <l>And to maintain them decent, and their Charge</l>
               <l>From beggery and want; it were a task too large</l>
               <l>For to recount their miſery, I proteſt</l>
               <l>By this rude Pen it cannot be expreſt.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But ſtay; Methinks it ſeemeth ſomewhat ſtrange,</l>
               <l>Though each thing's turn'd, that <hi>Trading</hi> too ſhould change:</l>
               <l>For though Diſtractions we have had great ſtore,</l>
               <l>Such <hi>Trade</hi> as then was, never will be more.</l>
               <l>We hop'd thoſe Flames had buryed been in aſhes,</l>
               <l>But they (like Lightning ſtill break out in flaſhes;</l>
               <l>'Tis greatly fear'd (<hi>Trade</hi> making ſuch a ſtand)</l>
               <l>Some greater Revolution's nigh at hand.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Then what's the reaſon <hi>Trading</hi>'s ſuch a ſlave,</l>
               <l>Seeing we great Peace with every Nation have:</l>
               <l>The <hi>Spaniard</hi> ſends us Gold, the <hi>Ruſſian</hi> Silks good ſtore,</l>
               <l>Methinks 'tis very ſtrange that <hi>Trade</hi> ſhould be ſo poor!</l>
               <l>I fear, 'tis this whereat the <hi>Tradeſman</hi> frets,</l>
               <l>Great men are grown ſo high, they ſcorn to pay their debts:</l>
               <l>Then <hi>Tradeſmen</hi> ſurely, muſt of force be poor,</l>
               <l>When as the Rich, run on the Poor-man's ſcore.</l>
               <l>Nay, that's not all, for it is daily known,</l>
               <l>A man dares ſcarcely ask them for his own.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Tradeſmen</hi> muſt needs be poor I really think,</l>
               <l>When they are only paid with Dam and Sink;</l>
               <l>Who make a man believe they'd run him through:</l>
               <l>But God be thank'd there's Law for ſuch as you;</l>
               <l>Such Tricks as theſe ſeem very much unfit,</l>
               <l>T'eat Poor mens Meat, and give them ne'r a bit.</l>
               <l>This, this is it, that makes our <hi>Trading</hi> ſhake,</l>
               <l>And cauſe us poor Mechanicks for to quake.</l>
               <l>Well, I could wiſh ſome courſe with't might be taken,</l>

            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Another reaſon's here worſe then the other,</l>
               <l>We are ſo hateful grown towards one another;</l>
               <l>Which cauſed is by ſome Phanatick brain,</l>
               <l>That does both Truth and Juſtice now diſdain;</l>
               <l>Whether they be <hi>Trapanners, Pimping Sectiſts, Nippers,</hi>

               <l>They break the Peace and ſpoile our daily <hi>Trade.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Well, I do hope ere long, that by degrees,</l>
               <l>Our Nation may be purg'd of ſuch as theſe.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>To find a fourth, I need not long to ſtand,</l>
               <l>We have ſuch Grand Intruders in our Land,</l>
               <l>Who take our <hi>Money,</hi> and our <hi>Trading</hi> too</l>
               <l>Out of our hands, and poor <hi>Tradeſmen</hi> undoe;</l>
               <l>Who do our daily <hi>Trading</hi> much entrench,</l>
               <l>Ask who they be? I anſwer, th' <hi>Dutch,</hi> and <hi>French:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Theſe take our maintainance from out our hands,</l>
               <l>Th' <hi>Dutch</hi> Fiſh our <hi>Sea,</hi> th' <hi>French</hi> fiſh our <hi>Trade</hi> by land</l>
               <l>Now Fellow-Subjects, theſe things are not fair,</l>
               <l>That nothing will go off that's <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ware:</l>
               <l>But if a <hi>French man</hi> puts it out to ſale</l>
               <l>Though ne'r ſo bad, of 's price he ſhall not faile;</l>
               <l>Our <hi>Engliſh</hi> muſt them give (oh 'tis a grief to tell!)</l>
               <l>One portion of their Wares, the other for to ſell.</l>
               <l>Our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Subjects, by ſuch means as theſe</l>
               <l>(Without a ſpeedy help) their Freedome ſoon will leeſe.</l>
               <l>But to Concluſion I muſt haſte a pace,</l>
               <l>And on this ſubject will no longer trace:</l>
