         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Sir William Waller's KINDNESS TO THE <hi>Cities of London and Weſtminſter,</hi> Particularly Expreſt.</head>
            <lg>
               <l>SIr <hi>Edmondbury Godfrey</hi> was much taller,</l>
               <l>Than the Right Worſhipful Sir <hi>William Waller.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>But what of that? at high and low they aim,</l>
               <l>No rank from them a priviledge can claim.</l>
               <l>Well may <hi>Goliah</hi> ſmite you with his Sling,</l>
               <l>He will not ſpare an inoffenſive King.</l>
               <l>You have been zealous to ſupport our Nation,</l>
               <l>And <hi>Rome</hi> has found you a ſevere vexation.</l>
               <l>Ten thouſand times their old unerring Pope,</l>
               <l>Has wiſh'd you <hi>Godfrey</hi>'s Cravat, or a Rope.</l>
               <l>How wou'd they clap their wings, their hearts and hands,</l>
               <l>To ſee you bound with Inquiſition bands?</l>
               <l>How wou'd they drown themſelves in good rich Sack,</l>
               <l>Might they but ſee you on a <hi>Frenchmans</hi> Rack?</l>
               <l>No wonder you and <hi>Rome</hi> are now at odds,</l>
               <l>Alas! they cry out, you have burn'd their gods.</l>
               <l>And now what do they do? ſtudy, and wait,</l>
               <l>To heap the worſt of miſchiefs on your pate.</l>
               <l>Revenge doth boyl, it is exceeding hot,</l>
               <l>Fain wou'd they have your Worſhips Head i'th Pot;</l>
               <l>But they're ſupplanted yet, as is their Plot.</l>
               <l>Revenge cryes <hi>Rome,</hi> revenge cryes <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>For all the Images that he has ſlain.</l>
               <l>Revenge your ſelves for theſe and ſuch like deeds,</l>
               <l>Seek out revenge for all your late burnt Beads.</l>
               <l>Give <hi>London</hi> yet another ſixty ſix,</l>
               <l>For burning both your Beads and Crucifix.</l>
               <l>And in the midſt of theſe great flames, remember,</l>
               <l>'Twas ſuch as he that made a <hi>fifth November</hi>
               </l>
               <l>To be a Holiday: make up the pyle</l>
               <l>Higher and hotter, then you'll make us ſmile.</l>
               <l>Baniſh your love, your kindneſs and your pity,</l>
               <l>As they do Jeſuits from their great City.</l>
               <l>Thus little <hi>Waller,</hi> theſe enraged Cattle,</l>
               <l>Do at a diſtance give your Worſhip Battle.</l>
               <l>Revenge delays; and they are even ſick,</l>
               <l>To ſuck the blood of ſuch a Heretick.</l>
               <l>The Pope wou'd almoſt give his triple Crown,</l>
