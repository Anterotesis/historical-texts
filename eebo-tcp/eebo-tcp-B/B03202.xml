         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>WHAT ſtill more breaches! is <hi>Cokayn</hi> dead?</l>
               <l>Who was ſo deſirous the Goſpel ſhould be ſpread.</l>
               <l>Who made it his conſtant ſtudy to promote,</l>
               <l>That he might gain Souls that were remote.</l>
               <l>And to build up thoſe that were already call'd,</l>
               <l>That he might finiſh his Miniſterial Work to all,</l>
               <lg>
                  <l>Whoſe heart was ſtill ingaged in Paſtoral Care.</l>
                  <l>That he ſtill the Flock of Chriſt might feed here,</l>
                  <l>In which the Lord had made him Overſeer:</l>
               </lg>
               <l>Studying with great pain upon his Bed with care,</l>
               <l>That he might ſtill be brought on Sabbath in his Chair.</l>
               <l>Praying to God that he might ſtill hold out,</l>
               <l>Till he had by his Providence found out</l>
               <l>One that <hi>Jehovah</hi> hath promiſed to ſend in need,</l>
               <l>His People with knowledge and underſtanding feed,</l>
               <l>The Lord was pleas'd to grant him his deſire,</l>
               <l>That all his Church in one mind was intire</l>
               <lg>
                  <l>In fixing their eye whom Providence found out in all,</l>
                  <l>They fixed on <hi>Nesbit,</hi> and give him a Goſpel-call,</l>
                  <l>Which hath proved himſelf a Goſpel-preacher to all.</l>
               </lg>
               <l>A Workman that needs not be aſhamed to none,</l>
               <l>Preaching forth Free Grace in Chriſt to all that come.</l>
               <l>Following him who was his Patron, but now is high</l>
               <l>Above the reach of all his Enemy.</l>
               <lg>
                  <l>Whereby his Soul doth reap the fruit of all,</l>
                  <l>While we are ſtill labouring in Sins Thrall</l>
                  <l>In bondage where <hi>Satan</hi> would deſtroy us all.</l>
               </lg>
               <l>The very Elect if poſſibly he might</l>
               <l>But Chriſt have praid that he might give them ſight.</l>
               <l>Whereby he hath reſcued them out of <hi>Satan</hi>'s Gin,</l>
               <l>Wherein they were caught by <hi>Adam</hi>'s Sin.</l>
               <l>But by Free Grace they were repriev'd,</l>
               <l>And by the Imputed Righteouſneſs of Chriſt reliev'd,</l>
               <l>And by that like pretious Faith was found,</l>
               <l>Which was by our dear Paſtor ſound,</l>
               <l>That through the knowledge of God, and of Jeſus Chriſt,</l>
               <l>Grace and Peace ſhould be multiply'd to the higheſt.</l>
               <l>To all thoſe that were looking high</l>
               <l>For the light of his Countenance to keep them by.</l>
               <l>And that it is a contrary ſtrain in thoſe</l>
               <l>Who are crying for any worldly good to oppoſe.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Cokayn</hi> he would divide the Word aright,</l>
               <l>Preaching the Goſpel with all his might.</l>
               <l>And that Chriſt would come as a Thief in Night</l>
               <l>To thoſe that are found his Enemies in deſpight,</l>
               <l>They would be found naked, and their ſhame appear,</l>
               <l>When Conſcience will be awaken'd with greater fear.</l>
               <l>Still he was harping on that ſtrain,</l>
               <l>That Sinners might be brought to God by Chriſt again.</l>
               <l>He was always mindful of the Churches poor,</l>
               <l>And not unmindful to others in Diſtreſſes more.</l>
               <l>Conſtantly he was mindful of Church-Order, there</l>
               <l>According to what the Scriptures made appear,</l>
               <l>And not to keep that in his own Power alone,</l>
               <l>Which does belong to more than one.</l>
               <l>Which does rely in the whole Church, that thoſe</l>
               <l>Which are Enemies to Goſpel-Order might be oppos'd.</l>
               <l>And that all might agree, as Members not dead,</l>
               <l>Of that Myſtical Body, whom Chriſt is the only Head.</l>
               <l>It is to be lamented in Elegy this day;</l>
               <l>That there be ſo many of thoſe that haſt away.</l>
               <l>The Lord grant thoſe that ſtay behind,</l>
               <l>Do mind their Duty, as in the Word they find.</l>
               <l>Power in Heaven and Earth was given to Chriſt alone,</l>
               <l>That all the Father had given to him, might be brought home.</l>
               <l>We are but Strangers and Pilgrims here.</l>
               <l>Where no continuing City does appear;</l>
               <l>But we muſt ſeek for one that is to come;—</l>
               <l>And that it might be our conſtant care</l>
               <l>To walk amongſt the Tombs while we are here;</l>
               <l>That Death might not be a ſurpriſe to none,</l>
               <l>That we might be haſtning to our home.</l>
               <l>Endeavouring to mortify the deeds of the Body while here,</l>
               <l>That Sin which is the ſting of Death might not appear;</l>
               <lg>
                  <l>That by free Grace in Chriſt alone, I tell:</l>
                  <l>By faith you may walk through the Valy</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Of the ſhadow of Death,</hi> and fear no ill.</l>
               </lg>
               <l>When this <hi>Mortal ſhall put on Immortality,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>We ſhall be bleſt to all Eternity;</l>
               <l>And enjoy that Region which is above,</l>
               <l>Where bleſſed Souls are ſtill in love;</l>
               <l>Where there is no Strife, nor Envy found at all,</l>
               <l>But all with one accord ever agree ſhall,</l>
               <l>Singing the praiſes of God with <hi>Halelujah.</hi>—</l>
               <l>But you that ſtay behind in this lower Region ſtill;</l>
               <l>Be not dejected, it is our heavenly Fathers will:</l>
               <l>Who knows beſt what his Churches need,</l>
