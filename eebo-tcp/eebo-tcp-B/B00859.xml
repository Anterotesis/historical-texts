            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <l>With her three daughters of fauor ſo ſweet,</l>
            <l>Whoſe beauty the loue of ſo many had wonne,</l>
            <l>With her daughters three for ſuccour went ſhe,</l>
            <l>Vnto the kings counſaile of Noble degree,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Now fie vpon falſhood and forgerie fraile,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>For great is the truth and it ſhall preuaile.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>¶Her ſonne by a writ now ſommoned is,</l>
            <l>At the Starchamber with ſpeed to appeare:</l>
            <l>To anſwere there the abuſes of his,</l>

            <l>This news was brought his wits he ſought,</l>
            <l>Which may his villanie beſt might be wrought.</l>
            <l>¶Then vp and downe the Citty ſo faire,</l>
            <l>He ſeeketh companions to ſerue his turne:</l>
            <l>A ſort of vacabonds naked and bare,</l>

            <l>He hired for witneſſe his lyes to vphold, &amp;c.</l>
            <l>¶My maiſters quoth he, my mother by name,</l>
            <l>To be a lewd ſtrumpet accuſed I haue:</l>
            <l>And hauing no witneſſe to proue that ſame,</l>
            <l>Your ayde and aſſiſtance herein I do craue:</l>
            <l>Therefore without feare, before the Lords there</l>
            <l>yet this thing is certaine, you fixe ſhall it ſweare.</l>
            <l>¶The firſt two quoth he, ſhal ſweare on a booke</l>
            <l>That ſixteene yeares paſt they plainely did ſee,</l>
            <l>As they through the garde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hedge ſadly did looke</l>

            <l>And how it feel, as they markt it wel:</l>
            <l>That iuſt nine Moneths after ſhe had hir firſt girle</l>
            <l>¶The ſecond couple ſhall ſweare in this ſort,</l>
            <l>That at Briſtow faire about xvii. yeares paſt,</l>
            <l>She w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> her owne apprentiſe did fal in ſuch ſport</l>

            <l>Or any thing elſe for money this day, &amp;c.</l>
            <l>And thus y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> third couple their oath now that take</l>
            <l>That as a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t he Bath ſhe ſtaid on a day.</l>
            <l>For ach in her bones as the ſcuſe ſhe did make,</l>
            <l>How ſhe with a Courtier the wanton did play:</l>
            <l>And how well you wot in the pleaſant plot,</l>
            <l>her deareſt yong daughter for certaine was got,</l>
            <l>But now you maſters your names let me know:</l>
            <l>That I may prouide you apparell with ſpeed,</l>
            <l>Like ſixe graue Cittizens ſo muſt you go,</l>
            <l>The better your ſpeeches the Lords will heed,</l>
            <l>So ſhal I with ſcorne, ere Saturday morne,</l>
            <l>Prove her a Harlot, my ſiſters baſe borne, &amp;c.</l>
            <l>¶My name is make ſhift, the firſt man did ſay,</l>
            <l>And Francis light-finger the ſecond likewiſe,</l>
            <l>Cutbert creepe-window the third to diſplay;</l>
            <l>And Rowland Rob-man, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> foule ſtaring eyes:</l>
            <l>Iack ſhameles comes then w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Hary ſteale-hen,</l>
            <l>You are <abbr>qd</abbr>. the widdow ſome right honeſt men.</l>
            <l>¶Before the Lords moſt prudent and graue,</l>
            <l>This wretch doth with his witneſſe come:</l>
            <l>The mother complains &amp; Iuſtice doth craue,</l>
            <l>Of all the offences that he hath her done:</l>
            <l>My Lords then <abbr>qd</abbr>. ſhe, I pray you heare me,</l>
            <l>The Law for my deeds my warrant ſhall be.</l>
            <l>I ſay ſhe is a Harlot moſt vilde,</l>
            <l>And thoſe be her baſtards that ſtandeth is place,</l>
            <l>And that ſhe hath often her body defilde,</l>
            <l>By very good witnes ile proue to her face:</l>
            <l>This thing of thy Mother y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> oughtſt for to ſmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</l>
            <l>Tis ſhame for a child to ſpeake of his Mother.</l>
            <l>¶ But if this matter be proued vntrue,</l>
            <l>And thou a falſe lyar be found to thy face:</l>
            <l>Worſe then an Infidell, Pagon, or Iew,</l>
            <l>Thou oughtſt to be puniſht &amp; plagd in this caſe,</l>
            <l>And therefore draw neere, and now let vs heare,</l>
            <l>What ſaies the witnes that here doth appeare?</l>
            <l>¶When the firſt couple did come for to ſweare</l>
            <l>They quiuerd and quakt in moſt wondrous ſort,</l>
            <l>The lords very cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tenance did put them in feare</l>
            <l>And now they knew not what to report:</l>
            <l>The ſecond likewiſe ſtard ſo with his eyes,</l>
            <l>They ſtamberd and knew not what to deuiſe.</l>
            <l>¶ The Lords perceiuing the caſe how it went,</l>
            <l>Did aſke the laſt couple what they had to ſay,</l>
            <l>Who fell on their knees incontinent,</l>
            <l>Saying they were hir'd for mony that day:</l>
            <l>Quoth they it is ſo, the truth for to ſhow,</l>
            <l>Againſt a good widow no harme we do know.</l>
            <l>¶Thus was the widow deliuered from blame,</l>
            <l>With her three daughters of beauty moſt bright</l>
            <l>Her ſonne reproached with ſorrow and ſhame,</l>
            <l>Hauing his iudgment appointed him right:</l>
            <l>To looſe at the leaſt the goods he poſſeſt,</l>
            <l>To looſe both his eares, and baniſht to reſt.</l>
            <l>When he heard this iudgment pronou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced to be</l>
            <l>The teares full bitterly fell down from his face,</l>
            <l>To mother and ſiſters he kneeled on his knee,</l>
            <l>Confeſſing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Lucre had wrought his diſgrace,</l>
            <l>That for my own gaine, I ſought to detaine,</l>
            <l>My ſiſters three portions this lye I did faine,</l>
            <l>Therefore deare Mother forgiuenes I craue,</l>
            <l>Of you and my ſiſters offended ſo ſore:</l>
            <l>My body from perill if you will but ſaue,</l>
            <l>I ſweare I will grieue and offend you no more,</l>
            <l>The Lords then replide, the Law iuſtly tride,</l>
            <l>the puniſhment now thou are like to abide,</l>
            <l>¶Therefore to priſon now thou ſhalt go,</l>
            <l>Where thou ſhalt the kings pleaſure abide,</l>
            <l>From thence to be brought w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſhame &amp; with wo,</l>

            <l>Then out of hand, thou ſhalt vnderſtand,</l>
            <l>That preſently thou ſhalt be baniſht the land.</l>
            <l>¶Now while in priſon this priſoner did reſt</l>
            <l>Himſelfe he hanged in deſperate wiſe:</l>
            <l>Such horror of conſcience poſſeſſed his breſt,</l>
