            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>JOHN Walwyn</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> the Petitioners Husband being but Tenant for life of an Eſtate of 400 <hi>l. per annum</hi> in the County of <hi>Hereford</hi> and having by the Petitioner two Sons both Lunaticks or Ideots, in whom the Inheritance of the ſaid Eſtate was; and having two Daughters unprovided for, he being indebted and weak in Body, conſidering the ſad condition of his ſaid Family, and being not able to make any Joynture or Proviſion for his Wife and young Children, or payments of his Debts after his deceaſe he out of a pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential care to prevent his Sons falling into the hands of Strangers, and the better to ſecure his Creditors the Payment of their reſpective Debts did in his life time, <hi>viz.</hi> 26. <hi>June</hi> 1684. obtain a Patent to the Petitioners Mr. <hi>Serg. Geeres,</hi> and <hi>Robert Dobyns</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> for the Cuſtody of the Perſons and Eſtates of his ſaid Sons, the better to enable the Petitioner after his death to pay his Debts; and to make ſome Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for her ſelf, and other Children out of the Remainder of the Profits of the ſaid Eſtate; which ſaid Patent was afterwards renewed by the ſame Patentees, in the Reign of the late King <hi>James,</hi> but being made only during pleaſure, it became void by the Demiſe of the ſaid late King <hi>James:</hi> Whereupon one of the ſaid Sons being then dead, the ſame Patentees obtained a new Order from the Lords Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners of the great Seal, for renewing the ſaid Patent as to the ſurviving Ideot; but before the Patent was paſſed, the Right Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable the Earl of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> preferred a Petition to the ſaid Lords Commiſſioners for the Cuſtody to be granted to him; whereupon Council were heard on both ſides before the then Lords Commiſſioners; who, upon due conſideration had to your Petitioners own and her Families circumſtances, and the value of the Eſtate, did not think fit to grant the Cuſtody away from the Petitioner; but afterwards the ſaid Earl procured a Warrant from his Majeſty for the ſame to be granted to him the ſaid Earl, and then the Lords Commiſſioners in obedience to His Majeſties Commands, did 29. <hi>Jan.</hi> 1689. Order and direct that the Petitioner ſhould have the keeping of the ſaid Son, and that there ſhould be allowed and paid to the Petitioner out of the ſaid Eſtate, for the maintenance of her Self and the ſaid Ideot, and towards the Relief of his ſaid Siſters (which Siſters are both married and have between them 9 ſmall Children) the annual Summ of 200 <hi>l.</hi> and the Surpluſage of the Rents and Profits to be anſwer'd and paid to the ſaid Earl of <hi>Monmouth;</hi> and with theſe directions the ſaid Lords Commiſſioners did order a Grant to be paſſed the great Seal, which Grant paſſed accordingly <hi>durante beneplacito</hi> as is uſual. But the ſaid Earl, not ſo contented, did afterwards obtain another Warrant from His Majeſty, bearing date on or about 5. <hi>Apr.</hi> 1690. directed to the ſaid Lords Commiſſioners for paſſing another Patent unto his ſaid Lordſhip, for the ſaid Cuſtody during the life of the Ideot: And the ſaid Lords Commiſſioners in obedience to His Majeſties Commands did order ſuch Grant ſhould paſs, but ſubject to the aforeſaid Order of the 29. <hi>Jan.</hi> then laſt paſt, which was ordered ſhould ſtand and be obſerved in all things, ſave only as to the duration of the Ideocy. Which ſecond Patent paſſed the Seal ſoon after under the Reſtrictions aforeſaid.</p>
            <p>Tho during the time of the aforeſaid Proceedings his Lordſhip was pleaſed to promiſe, in regard the thing was harder on the Family than his Lordſhip at firſt apprehended; That he would ſtop his Proceedings: Notwithſtanding his Lordſhip ſoon after ſent his Agents in to the Country, to gather up the Rents of the ſaid Eſtate, and not only that, but the Arrears of Rent due before his ſaid Patent, and took no Care for the maintenance of the Petitioner and her ſaid Son and numerous Family, according to the aforeſaid Order: By reaſon of which the Petitioner and the Tenants of the Eſtate being well adviſed, refuſed to deliver up Poſſeſſion, or to attorn Tenants to him: And thereupon in <hi>Trinity</hi> Term 1690. petition'd the Lords Commiſſioners to grant him a Writ of Aſſiſtance to put him in Poſſeſſion of the ſaid Eſtate. But their Lordſhips well remembring the Matter ſo often before them declared; That the Petitioners Caſe was a Caſe of very great Compaſſion, and that the Petitioner ſhould have what was ordered her: And their Lordſhips appointed a Day to hear all Parties firſt, which Hearing the ſaid Earl was pleaſed to decline, as it may be preſumed, fearing their Lordſhips would not grant him what he by violence and force of Arms ſoon after poſſeſſed himſelf of. And by reaſon of his Lordſhips Peerage, the Petitioner durſt not proceed before the ſaid Lords Commiſſioners, to have a performance of the ſaid Order: And ſo matters reſted till the 11 th. day of <hi>Aug.</hi> laſt paſt. On which day the ſaid Earl of <hi>Monmouth</hi> with a great number of Attendants, in a forcible manner entred the Capital Meſſuage of the ſaid Eſtate called <hi>Hellens,</hi> in the ſaid County of <hi>Hereford,</hi> where the Petitioner with her ſaid Son and his Siſters, and their Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands then lived; and having got into the lower Rooms of the ſaid Houſe, and put the ſaid Siſters Husbands under a Guard, his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip the ſaid Earl of <hi>Monmouth</hi> with the Aſſiſtance of other Perſons, broke open the two Doors of the Chamber, where the Petitioner and her ſaid Son and his Nurſe then were, and ſeized her ſaid Son, and ſo from that day being <hi>Tueſday</hi> till <hi>Monday</hi> following kept him in the ſaid Chamber under a Guard, and afterwards carried him away, contrary to the ſaid Lords Commiſſioners Order, upon which his Patent was grounded. After which Surpriſal of the ſaid Houſe, the Tenants of the ſaid Eſtate were ſent for by the ſaid Earl of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi> whom he threatned what he would do to them if they did not pay to him the Rents and Arrears, as well due before as ſince his ſaid Patent: By which means moſt of them paid his Lordſhip ſome Rents and Arrears, out of which he paid the Petitioner only 100 <hi>l.</hi> whereas there was then due to her above 400 <hi>l.</hi> for the maintenance of her ſaid Son and Family by vertue of the ſaid Order.</p>
            <p>Whilſt theſe things were carried on by his Lordſhip, his Lordſhip was pleaſed with one hand to ſeize the Perſon of the Petitioners Daughter, with a Piſtol in the other hand, commanding her to ſhew to his Lordſhip the Chamber where the Ideot her Brother was, which ſhe being in extreme fright did do, and for what Reaſon is beſt known to his Lordſhip, likewiſe kick'd with his Foot the Petitioners Siſter; and his Lordſhip being asked by what Authority his Lordſhip did all theſe things, he one while told them he had a VVrit of Aſſiſtance, and that one <hi>Pennington</hi> was gone for the Sheriff; and at other times told them, that in Caſe they had given him any Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, he would have blown the Houſe up.
