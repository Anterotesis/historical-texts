            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>Of his hopeful Son we'll tell:</l>
               <l>Fair <hi>Gerardo</hi> he was named,</l>
               <l>Mild, and of ſweet Temper framed.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>

               <l>In Vertues School fit to engage,</l>
               <l>His wiſe Father, he choſe rather</l>

            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Thither he was ſent to get,</l>
               <l>Fair Learning and accompliſh'd Wit;</l>

               <l>So alike in every place,</l>
               <l>One was not known from the other,</l>

               <l>Kind and Pritty, both like witty,</l>

               <l>Not like others that are roving,</l>

               <l>Like the Sun-Beams in the Morning,</l>

               <l>For his Pleaſure, to this Treaſure,</l>
               <l>And he ask'd <hi>Gerardo</hi> too,</l>

            <lg>
               <l>And along with him he went,</l>

               <l>her bright Eyes, did ſo ſurprize,</l>
               <l>The faithful youth, and did torment.</l>
               <l>She with Graces ſo abounded,</l>
               <l>And his gentle Heart ſo wounded.</l>

               <l>After this perplex'd in Mind,</l>
               <l>His Friend him in deſpair did find;</l>
               <l>And requeſted, and proteſted,</l>
               <l>That the cauſe thereof he'd find:</l>
               <l>He then told in mournful faſhion,</l>
               <l>That the Lady caus'd his Paſſion.</l>

               <l>Courage then, dear Friend, quoth he,</l>
               <l>This Beauty I'll reſign to thee,</l>
               <l>She divine, ſhall be all thine,</l>

               <l>Go and put on my Apparel,</l>
               <l>And of her I'll take my Farewel.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Go to Church and in my ſtead,</l>
               <l>You ſhall the lovely Lady wed,</l>
               <l>Do not languiſh, eaſe your anguiſh,</l>
               <l>Since we both alike are free'd,</l>
               <l>None can know us from each other,</l>
               <l>Not ſo much as our own Mother.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Then next day as they decree'd</l>

                  <hi>Gerardo</hi> wedded her indeed,</l>
               <l>After Feaſting, Mirth and Ieſting,</l>

               <l>Did give theſe Lovers loud Alarms,</l>

               </l>
               <l>And now all the Plot is undone,</l>

            <lg>
               <l>All the matter's plainly prov'd</l>

               <l>Baniſh'd thus from <hi>London</hi> quite,</l>

               <l>Fortune froward and untoward,</l>

            <lg>
               <l>Then in Grief he drew his Knife,</l>

               <l>Sighing, moaning, ſadly groaning;</l>
