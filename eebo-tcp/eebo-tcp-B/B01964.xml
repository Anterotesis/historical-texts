            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>To the ſame Tune.</opener>
            <lg>
               <l>WHat is this I hear ſtill by all I do meet,</l>
               <l>A <hi>complaint againſt Celia is Sung in the ſtreet,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Where ſhe ſcornful is made, and cruel does prove</l>
               <l>To <hi>Strephon</hi> who is with <hi>Celia</hi> in Love.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Nay likewiſe they ſay for Love he will dye,</l>
               <l>Unleſs that his <hi>Celia</hi> to have does comply,</l>
               <l>He further complains that my hearts made of ſtone,</l>
               <l>And yet he'l have <hi>Celia,</hi> or elſe he'l have none.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>And ſince I muſt give him an Anſwer indeed,</l>
               <l>He ſpeak from my Heart as I am a true Maid,</l>
               <l>He Courted me long, and I ſlighted him ſtill,</l>
               <l>Tho twas not perhaps for any ill will.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But caution did make me to uſe him like one,</l>
               <l>That came as a viſit and ſo to be gone,</l>
               <l>Tho he often would ſigh, then his Eyes they would dart</l>
               <l>Which many a time I felt at my heart.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But men are deceitful which made me ſtill ſhie,</l>
               <l>What their tongue often ſpeaks, yet their hearts gives the lye</l>
               <l>And few there are found of Men to be true,</l>
               <l>VVhich made me always be ſcornful to you.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>For daily I ſee that young <hi>Maidens</hi> are wrong'd,</l>
               <l>By Batchellors with their fine flattering Tongue,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>They ſwear they do love till they've gain'd their deſire,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Which when once poſſeſt then ſoon they retire.</hi>
               </l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Thus Men being falſe cauſes me to beware,</l>
               <l>Leaſt I by ſuch Men ſhould be drawn in a ſnare,</l>
               <l>As thouſands there be that by young men's undone,</l>
               <l>In believing what's ſaid by a lying Tongue.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>
                  <hi>But if that I thought that young</hi> Strephon <hi>was true,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>And would love in earneſt I would do ſo too,</l>
               <l>I mean not for time, but for ever and ay,</l>
               <l>I am not for love that holds but a day.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>There fore if you come with intent for to wed,</l>
               <l>Nere fear but a loving kind VVife may be had,</l>
               <l>I love you tis true, I declare on my life,</l>
               <l>And happy ſhould be if I once were your wife.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Oh what i'ſt I ſay, I have here told my mind,</l>
               <l>Oh now I am ruin'd if <hi>Strephon</hi>'s unkind,</l>
               <l>My love I cant hide, but muſt let the world know,</l>
               <l>Tis <hi>Strephon</hi> I love tho I tortur'd him ſo.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>If he now ſhould leave me for what I have done,</l>
               <l>Then for love of him I diſtracted ſhall run,</l>
               <l>Oh why did I uſe him ſo cruel before,</l>
               <l>VVhen at the ſame time I did him adore.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Now come lovely <hi>Strephon</hi> my Heart is thy own,</l>
               <l>VVith grief I have heard all thy ſorrow and moan,</l>
               <l>And if you will wed, then this I will ſay,</l>
               <l>Since <hi>Strephon</hi> conſents then to morrow's the day.</l>
