            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Caſe of R. Gee, <abbr>Eſq</abbr>
            </head>
            <head type="sub">Humbly recommended to the Commons of <hi>England,</hi> aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in Parliament.</head>
            <p>IN the laſt Seſſion of Parliament, there was exhibited a Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Houſe of Commons, by the Hackney Coach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men againſt <hi>R. Gee,</hi> and other Commiſſioners for the Regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Coaches, complaining againſt the ſaid <hi>R. Gee</hi> for ſeveral Miſdeameanors by him committed, contrary to the Directions of a late Act of Parliament, Entitled, <hi>An Act for Licencing and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulating Hackney Coaches and Stage Coaches,</hi> &amp;c. charging the ſaid <hi>R. Gee,</hi> one of the Commiſſioners, as follows.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. For refuſing Licences to perſons qualified by the Act.</item>
               <item>2. For granting Licences to perſons not qualified by the Act.</item>
               <item>3. For licenſing above 700.</item>
               <item>4. For exacting more Money than the Law allows.</item>
            </list>
            <p>The matter was taken into Conſideration, but ſo intricated, with a Confuſion and Contradiction of Witneſſes, falſe Sugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions in the Evidence, and other Irregularities in the manner and order of the Proceeding, that <hi>R. Gee</hi> addreſt himſelf, by Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to the Honourable Houſe of Commons for Redreſs, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining of hard meaſure (to fall under a Sentence that looks like a Conviction of Perjury, without ſo much as one Witneſs upon Oath) and only deſiring to be heard upon the matter in Queſtion, the ſaid Petition was tender'd to the Houſe, but other buſineſs intervening, it fell to the ground.</p>
            <p>By this diſappointment the Petitioner finds himſelf, now in a manner forced upon a Second Application to the ſame Authority, and upon the ſame Account, not doubting of ſuch Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the Wiſdom and Equity of the Houſe, as ſhall be found agreeable to Honor and Juſtice at leaſt if theſe following Articles, which the ſaid <hi>R Gee takes upon himſelf to make good, may be admitted in proof of his inocency.</hi> As under favour for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. There is a dead man produced for a Witneſs.</item>
               <item>2. A Witneſs ſaid to be ſummoned and appear, that was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſummoned, nor did appear.</item>
               <item>3. A Charge exhibited impoſſible to be true.</item>
               <item>4. Witneſſes heard <hi>ex parte.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>5. A Copy of the Defendants Charge promiſed them, and then forced to an Anſwer without it.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Theſe are ſome few Exceptions, of many, to ſave time and trouble; and <hi>R. Gee</hi> humbly ſubmits himſelf upon the whole to this Impartial Equity, <hi>either to be repair'd in his reputation, if he make good his charge, or to ſuffer if he does not.</hi>
