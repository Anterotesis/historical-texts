            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>That he is one, whom God and Nature have mark'd for want of Common Honeſty, and his own Contemptible Rhimes for want of Common Senſe, that thoſe Rhimes have found great Succeſs with the Rabble, which is a Word almoſt as comprehenſive as Mankind; but that the Town, which ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports him, will do by him, as the Dolphin did by the Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack'd <hi>Monkey,</hi> drop him as ſoon as it finds him out to be a Beaſt, whom it fondly now miſtakes for a Human Creature. 'Tis, ſays he, a very little, but very comprehenſive Creature, in whom all Contradictions meet, and all Contrarieties are reconcil'd; when at one and the ſame time, like the Ancient <hi>Centaurs,</hi> he is a Beaſt and a Man, a Whig and a Tory, a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rulent <hi>Papiſt,</hi> and yet forſooth, a Pillar of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> a Writer at one and the ſame time, of GUARDIANS and of EXAMINERS, an aſſertor of Liberty and of the Diſpenſing Power of Kings; a Rhimeſter without Judgment or Reaſon, and a Critick without Common Senſe; a Jeſuiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal

Profeſſor of Truth, a baſe and foul Pretender to Candour; a Barbarous Wretch, who is perpetually boaſting of Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and Good Nature, a lurking way-laying Coward, and a Stabber in the Dark; who is always pretending to Magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, and to ſum up all Villains in one, a Traytor-Friend, one who has betrayed all Mankind, and ſeems to have taken his great Rule of Life from the following Lines of <hi>Hudibras.</hi>

               <l>By vermin Impotent and Blind.</l>
            </q>
            <p>He is a Profeſſor of the worſt Religion, which he laughs at, and yet has moſt inviolably obſerv'd the moſt execrable Maxim in it, <hi>That no Faith is to be kept with Hereticks.</hi> A Wretch, whoſe true Religion is his Intereſt, and yet ſo ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidly blind to that Intereſt, that he often meets her, without knowing her, and very groſly Affronts her. His Villainy is but the natural Effect of his want of Underſtanding, as the ſowerneſs of Vinegar proceeds from its want of Spirit; and yet, <hi>ſays my Friend,</hi> notwithſtanding that Shape and that Mind of his, ſome Men of good Underſtanding, value him for his Rhimes, as they would be fond of an <hi>Aſſeinego,</hi> that could ſing his part in a Catch, or of a <hi>Baboon</hi> that could whiſtle <hi>Walſingham.</hi> The groſſer part of his gentle Readers be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lieve the Beaſt to be more than Man; as Ancient Ruſticks took his Anceſtors for thoſe Demy Gods they call <hi>Fauns</hi> and <hi>Satyrs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was the Character, which my Friend gave of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of this miſerable Libel, which immediately made me ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend that it was the very ſame Perſon, who endeavour'd to expoſe you in a <hi>Billinſgate</hi> Libel, at the very time that you were doing him a Favour at his own earneſt Deſire, who attempted to undermine Mr. <hi>PHILIPS</hi> in one of his <hi>Guardians,</hi> at the ſame time that the <hi>Crocodile</hi> ſmil'd on him, embrac'd him, and called him Friend, who wrote a Prologue in praiſe of <hi>CATO,</hi> and teas'd <hi>Lintott</hi> to publiſh Remarks upon it; who at the ſame time, that he openly extoll'd Sir <hi>Richard Steele</hi> in the higheſt manner, ſecretly publiſh'd the Infamous Libel of Dr. <hi>Andrew Tripe</hi> upon him; who, as he is in Shape a <hi>Monkey,</hi> is ſo in his every Action; in his ſenſeleſs Chattering, and his merry

Grimaces, in his doing hourly Miſchief and hiding himſelf in the variety of his Ridiculous Poſtures, and his continual Shiftings, from Place to Place, from Perſons to Perſons, from Thing to Thing. But whenever he Scribbles, he is emphatically a <hi>Monkey,</hi> in his awkard ſervile Imitations. For in all his Productions, he has been an <hi>Imitator,</hi> from his Imitation of VIRGILS <hi>Bucolicks,</hi> to this preſent Imitation of HORACE.—His <hi>Paſtorals</hi> were writ in Imitation of VIR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GIL,—His <hi>Rape of the Lock</hi> of BOILEAU,—His <hi>Eſſay on Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticiſm,</hi> of the preſent Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> and of my Lord <hi>Rofcommon.</hi>—His <hi>Windſor-Foreſt</hi> of Sir <hi>John Denham,</hi>—His <hi>Ode upon St. Caecilia</hi> of Mr. <hi>Dryden,</hi> and—His <hi>Temple of Fame,</hi> of CHAUCER.</p>
            <p>Thus for fifteen Years together this Ludicrous Animal has been a conſtant <hi>Imitator.</hi> Yet he has rather mimick'd theſe great Genius's, than he has Imitated them. He has given a Falſe and a Ridiculous Turn to all their good and their great Qualities, and has, as far as in him lies, Burleſqu'd them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out knowing it. But after having been for fifteen Years as it were an <hi>Imitator,</hi> he has made no Proficiency. His firſt Imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, tho' bad, are rather better than the Succeeding, and this laſt Imitation of HORACE, the moſt execrable of them all.</p>

            <p>If you ſhould chance, Sir, to ſhew this LETTER to any of your Acquaintance who have perus'd his Senſeleſs Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, they may think perhaps that we follow his Example, and retort Slander upon him. I deſire that you would have the Goodneſs to aſſure ſuch, that in the Moral part of his Character, and all that relates to matter of Fact, there is no manner of Rhetorick us'd, all is exactly and literally true,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0903200100:4"/>
for which we appeal to thoſe Poetical Perſons, with whom we have been moſt converſant in <hi>Covent-Garden.</hi> We have always been of Opinion that he who invents, or pretends, or falſifies Matter of Fact, in order to ſlander any one, deſerves an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous Puniſhment, and we have always had before our Eyes the following Verſes out of <hi>Horace.</hi>

            <p>As to what relates to the <hi>Perſon</hi> of this wretched Libeller, if in that there may be ſome trifling Exaggerations, yet even that is not deſign'd to Deceive or Impoſe upon any to whom you mey happen to ſhew it, but is intended to lead them to an exact Knowledge of the Truth by a very little enlarging upon it.</p>
            <p>But if any one appears to be concern'd at our upbraiding him with his Natural Deformity, which did not come by his own Fault, but ſeems to be the Curſe of God upon him; we deſire that Perſon to conſider, that this little Monſter has up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braided People with their Calamities and their Diſeaſes which are either falſe or paſt, or which he himſelf gave them by adminiſtring Poiſon to them; we deſire that Perſon to conſider that Calamities and Diſeaſes, if they are neither falſe nor paſt, are common to all Men; that a Man can no more help his Calamities and his Diſeaſes, than a Monſter can his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity; that there is no Misfortune, but what the Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Mankind are liable too; and that there is no one Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, but what all the reſt of Men are ſubject too; whereas the Deformity of this Libeller is Viſible, Preſent, Laſting, Unalterable, and Peculiar to himſelf. 'Tis the mark of God and Nature upon him, to give us warning that we ſhould hold no Society with him, as a Creature not of our Original, nor of our Species. And they who have refus'd to take this Warning which God and Nature have given them, and have in ſpight of it, by a ſenſeleſs Preſumption, ventur'd to be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0903200100:5"/>
with him, have ſeverely ſuffer'd for it, by his Perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs. They tell me, he has been lately pleas'd to ſay, <hi>That 'tis Doubtful if the Race of Men are the offspring of</hi> Adam <hi>or of the</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">The WORMS a Satire, Stanza 4.</note> Devil. But if 'tis doubtful as to the Race of Men, 'tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain at leaſt, that his Original is not from <hi>Adam,</hi> but from the <hi>Devil.</hi> By his conſtant and malicious Lying, and by that Angel Face and Form of his, 'tis plain that he wants nothing but Horns and Tail, to be the exact Reſemblance, both in Shape and Mind, of his Infernal Father. Thus, Sir, I return you Truth for Slander, and a juſt Satire for an Extravagant Libel, which is therefore ridiculouſly called an Imitation of <hi>Horace,</hi> you know very well, Sir, that the Difference between <hi>Horace,</hi> and ſuch an Imitation of him, is almoſt Infinite; and I leave you to conſider what Influence ſuch an Imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion muſt have upon his Readers of both Kinds, both upon thoſe who are acquainted with that Great Poet, and with thoſe that know him not; how contemptible it muſt render <hi>Horace</hi> to the latter, and his Imitator to the former, who when they ſhall behold the Ghoſt of their old and their valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Friend, raiſed up before them, by this awkard Conjurer, in a Manner ſo ridiculouſly frightful, when they behold him thus miſerably mangled, and reflect at once with Contempt and Horrour, upon this Barbarous Uſage of him, will not be able to refrain from exclaiming in the moſt vehement Manner.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Qualis adeſt, Quantum mutatus ab illo, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </l>
            </q>
            <p>They muſt think that their old and valued Friend had a Prophetick Spirit, and ſeem'd to foretel the Uſage, which he has lately received from this Barbarian and his Brethren, when in the fourth Ode of his Third Book he cryed,</p>
            <q>
               <l>Viſam Britannos Hoſpitibus feros.</l>
            </q>
            <p>But as for the other ſorts of Readers, the Readers who have no knowledge of <hi>Horace,</hi> but from this contemptible Imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; what muſt they think, Sir, of thoſe great Men, who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tol him, for the ſecond Genius of the <hi>Roman-Empire,</hi> Illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous for ſo many great Qualities which are to be ſound in him
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0903200100:6"/>
alone. Muſt they not look upon all his Admirers, as ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Learned Ideots, and upon the <hi>Roman-Empire</hi> it ſelf, as a vaſt Nation of Fools.</p>
            <p>You know very well, Sir, that as <hi>Horace</hi> had a firmneſs of Judgment, and a ſureneſs and truth of Taſte; he never once form'd a wrong Judgment to himſelf, either of the Actions of Men in general, or of the particular Worth and Merit of Authors; he had an Honour and a Rectitude of Soul, that would have oblig'd him to die a thouſand times rather than to Write any thing againſt his Conſcience.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Pejuque letho flagitium timet.</l>
            </q>
            <p>He was capable indeed of being provok'd to expoſe either a Fool or a Knave, whom otherwiſe he might have ſuffer'd to have remain'd in Obſcurity; but the moſt barbarous Uſage of his moſt Malicious Enemy, could never urge him to ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that Enemy. From this Force and Clearneſs of his Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, and this Noble Rectitude of his Will, it has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded that all his Cenſures are like ſo many <hi>Decrees,</hi> that have been all affirm'd by Poſterity, the only Supream Court of Judicature, for the Diſtribution of Fame and Infamy, from which Mankind can have no Appeal. That Supream, Impartial, Incorruptible Judicature, has the ſame Opinions of Perſons and Things, and eſpecially of Authors that he had. The ſame high Value for <hi>Tibullus,</hi> for <hi>Pollio,</hi> for <hi>Varius,</hi> for <hi>Virgil</hi>; and the ſame Contempt for <hi>Bavius,</hi> for <hi>Maevius,</hi> for <hi>Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpinus,</hi> for <hi>Alpinus,</hi> for <hi>Fannius,</hi> and for a Thouſand more.</p>
            <p>The ſame Juſtneſs and Fineneſs of Diſcernment and the ſame noble Rectitude of will, appear in the <hi>French Satiriſt,</hi> which make the moſt conſiderable Share of his Merit, and the moſt Diſtinguiſhing part of his Character, if we will believe what he ſays of himſelf, in his Admirable Epiſtle to <hi>Monſieur</hi> SEIGNELEY. You know, Sir, that what <hi>Boileau</hi> ſays there of himſelf is exactly true in Fact. The Perſons whom he has attack'd in his Writings have been for the moſt part Authors and moſt of thoſe Authors Poets. The Cenſures which he has paſs'd on them have been confirm'd by all <hi>Europe.</hi> But at the ſame time that judicious Poet, has been as liberal of his Praiſe to his Contemporaries, who were excellent in their Kinds, as <hi>Corneille, Racine, Moliere,</hi> and <hi>La Fontaine</hi>; Nay, he

was generous enough to defend <hi>Racine,</hi> and to ſupport and ſtrengthen him, when a Clamorous croud of miſerable Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors endeavoured to oppreſs him, as appears by his Admirable Epiſtle addreſt to that Tragick Poet.</p>
            <p>You, and I, both know very well, Sir, that there has been never wanting a Floud of ſuch Authors, neither in <hi>England</hi> nor <hi>France,</hi> who being like this Imitator, in ev'ry Reſpect, the reverſe of <hi>Horace,</hi> in Honour, in Diſcernment, in Genius; have always combin'd to atack any thing that has apear'd above their own dull Level, while they have hug'd and admir'd each other, Authors who have thought to be too hard for their Adverſaries by oppoſing <hi>Billinſgate</hi> to Reaſon, and Dogmatical Aſſertion to Moral Demonſtration; and who have been Ideots enough to belive that their Noiſe and Impudence could alter the Nature of Things, and the Notions of Men of Senſe.</p>
            <p>Of all theſe Libellers, the preſent Imitator is the moſt Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent, and the moſt Incorrigible, who has lately peſter'd and plagued the World with Five or Six Scandalous Libels in Proſe, that are all of them at once ſo ſtupid and ſo Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious, that Men of Sence are Doubtful, if they ſhould at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute them to the Libellers Native Idiotiſm or to Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental Madneſs.</p>
            <p>In all theſe Libels, the chief Objects of his Scandal and Malice, have been Perſons of diſtinguiſh'd Merit and among theſe he has fallen upon none ſo foully as his Friends and Benefactors. Among theſe latter, he has attack'd no one ſo often, or with ſo much ridiculous, impotent Mallice, as Sir <hi>Richard Blackmore</hi>; who is Eſtimable for a thouſand good and great Qualities. And what time has he choſen to do this. Why juſt after that Gentelman had laid very great Oblega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on him; and juſt after he had oblig'd the World with, ſo many Editions of his Excellent <hi>Poem</hi> upon CREATION, which <hi>Poem</hi> alone is worth all the <hi>Folios,</hi> that this Libeller will ever write and which will render its Author the Delight and Admiration of Poſterity. So that 'tis hard to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine whether this Libeller is more remarkable for his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or his Gratitude.</p>
            <p>I dare venture to affirm, that there is not an Author living ſo little Qualified for a Cenſurer as himſelf. I know nothing for which he is ſo ill Qualified as he is for Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

unleſs it be for Tranſlating HOMER. He has neither Taſte nor judgment, but is, if you will pardon a Quibble, the very neceſſity of <hi>Parnaſſus</hi>; for he has none of the Poetical Laws; or if he has the Letter of any, He has it without the Spirit. Whenever he pretends to Criticiſe, I fancy I ſee <hi>Sham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi> or <hi>Cheatly</hi> in the Squire of <hi>Alſatia,</hi> cutting a Sham or Banter to abuſe ſome Bubble. The <hi>Preſace</hi> is full of groſs Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, and he has ſhewn himſelf in it, a Dogmatical, Ignorant Impudent Second Hand Critick. As for the <hi>Poem,</hi> however he may cry up HOMER for being every where a <hi>Graecian</hi>—<hi>Trumpeter</hi> in the Original, I can ſee no <hi>Trumpeter</hi> in the <hi>Tranſlator,</hi> but the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s. But ſince his Friends will alledge 'tis eaſie to ſay this, I deſire it may go for nothing till I have ſo plainly prov'd it, that the moſt Fooliſh, and the moſt Partial of them ſhall not be able to deny it.</p>
            <p>As for what they call his <hi>Verſes,</hi> he has, like Mr. <hi>Bayes,</hi> got a notable knack of Rhiming and Writing ſmooth verſe, but without either Genius or Good Senſe, or any tolerable Knowledge of <hi>Engliſh,</hi> as I believe I ſhall ſhew plainly, when I come to the reſt of his Imitations. As for his Tranſlation of <hi>HOMER,</hi> I could never borrow it till this very Day, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to read it over to Morrow; ſo that ſhortly you may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to hear more of it. I will only tell you beforehand, that <hi>HOMER</hi> ſeems to me to be untranſlatable in any Modern Language. That great Poet is juſt in his Deſings, admirable in his Characters, and for the moſt part exact in his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning and correct in his Noble Sentiments; but theſe are Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies, which may be already ſeen in the Proſe Tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Him.</p>
            <p>The Qualities which ſo admirably diſtinguiſh <hi>HOMER</hi> from moſt other Writers, and which therefore a Tranſlator in Verſe is particularly oblig'd to ſhow, becauſe they cannot be ſhown in Proſe, are the Beauty of his Diction, and the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Harmony of his Verſification. But 'tis as Ridiculous to pretend to make theſe Shine out in <hi>Engliſh</hi> Rhimes, as it would be to Emulate upon a <hi>Bag-pipe,</hi> the Solemn and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtick Thorough Baſſe of an <hi>Organ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But you may ſuddenly expect more of this, if what I have already ſaid, happens to entertain you.</p>
