            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE Faction now having loſt all
Hopes of Succeſs by their unnatural
Rebellion, they apply themſelves
with the utmoſt Induſtry and Malice
to cry down the Proceedings of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
againſt the Rebels who are taken, as Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
and cruel, and having no Precedent in Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory.
This Clamour is ſo very ill founded, and
ſo remote from Truth, that it might be juſtly
thought needleſs to give it any Anſwer; but
ſince it is made uſe of by the Party farther to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe
the ignorant Mob againſt the Government,
it can't be thought amiſs to convict our Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of Falſhood, by putting them in mind of the
barbarous Cruelty of the late King <hi>James</hi> II. a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
thoſe who took Arms under the Duke of
<hi>Monmouth,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Argyle</hi> in <hi>Scotland</hi>;
and likewiſe of that Prince's Barbarity to the
Proteſtants in <hi>Ireland,</hi> after the Revolution.</p>
            <p>Theſe Things are ſtill remember'd by Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands
of Eye-Witneſſes, and therefore can admit
of no Contradiction, but from ſuch as have bid
Defiance to Truth, becauſe they know the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
of Tyranny and Popery, which they eſpouſe,
can never be ſupported by any other Methods
than Cruelty and Falſhood.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0535601400:3"/>
I ſhall begin with the Proceedings in that
King's Reign againſt thoſe who took Arms in
the Weſt of <hi>England</hi> under the Duke of <hi>Monmouth.</hi>
The Liſts of thoſe who were executed, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
puniſh'd on that Account, are in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Treatiſe, and more large and exact than
what has yet been publiſhed; ſo that I ſhall ſay
nothing of them here, but proceed to give ſome
Account of the Difference betwixt that and the
preſent Rebellion.</p>
            <p>Every one knows, that thoſe who join'd the
Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> did not do it till after King
<hi>James</hi> II. had declared himſelf a Papiſt, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to Law encourag'd thoſe of his own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion
to ſet up their Worſhip publickly; and
he had likewiſe in an arbitrary and tyrannical
Manner invaded our Civil Liberties, as may be
ſeen by the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi>'s Declaration, and
that of the Earl of <hi>Argyle.</hi>
            </p>

                        <head>The DECLARATION of <hi>James</hi>
Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> and the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemen,
Gentlemen, and others,
now in Arms for the Defence and
Vindication of the <hi>Proteſtant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi>
and the <hi>Laws, Rights,</hi> and
<hi>Privileges</hi> of England.</head>
                        <p>' AS Government was originally inſtituted
by God, and this or that Form of it
choſen and ſubmitted to by Men, for the Peace,
Happineſs, and Security of the Governed, and
not for the private Intereſt, and perſonal
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:0535601400:4"/>
Greatneſs of thoſe that rule; ſo that Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
hath always been eſteemed the beſt, where
the Supreme Magiſtrates have been inveſted
with all the Power and Prerogatives that might
capacitate them, not only to preſerve the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
from Violence and Oppreſſion, but to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
their Proſperity; and yet, where no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
was to belong to them by the Rules of
the Conſtitution, that might enable them to
injure and oppreſs them. And it hath been the
Glory of <hi>England,</hi> above moſt other Nations,
that the Prince had all entruſted with him that
was neceſſary, either for the advancing the
Welfare of the People, or for his own Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
in the Diſcharge of the Office; and withal
ſtood ſo limited and reſtrained by the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
Terms of the Conſtitution, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a Violation of his own Oath, as well as the
Rules and Meaſures of the Government, he
could do them no Hurt, nor exerciſe any Act of
Authority, but through the Adminiſtration of
ſuch Hands as ſtood obnoxious to be puniſhed
in caſe they tranſgreſſed: So that according to
the primitive Frame of the Government, the
Prerogatives of the Crown, and the Privileges
of the Subject, are ſo far from joſtling one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
that the Rights reſerved unto the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
tended to render the King Honourable and
Great, and the Prerogatives ſettled on the
Prince were in order to the Subjects Protection
and Safety. But all Human Things being ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to Perverſion, as well as Decay, it hath
been the Fate of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Government to be
often changed, and wreſted from what it was
in the firſt Settlement and Inſtitution. And
we are particularly compelled to ſay, that all
the Boundaries of the Government have of late
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0535601400:5"/>
been broken, and nothing leſs unattempted for
turning our limited Monarchy into an abſolute
Tyranny: For ſuch hath been the Tranſaction
of Affairs within this Nation for ſeveral Years
laſt paſt, that though the Proteſtant Religion
and Liberties of the People were fenced and
hedged about by as many Laws, as the Wiſdom
of Man can deviſe for their Preſervation againſt
Popery and Arbitrary Power, our Religion
hath been all along countermined by popiſh
Counſels, and our Privileges raviſhed from us
by Fraud and Violence. And more eſpecially
the whole Courſe and Series of the Life of the
<hi>D.</hi> of <hi>Y.</hi> hath been but one continued Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy
againſt the Reformed Religion, and the
Rights of the Nation: For, whoever conſiders
his contriving the burning of <hi>London,</hi> his inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating
a Confederacy with <hi>France,</hi> and a War
with <hi>Holland,</hi> fomenting the Popiſh Plot, and
encouraging the Murther of Sir <hi>Ed. Godfrey,</hi>
his charging Treaſon againſt Proteſtants, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orning
Witneſſes to ſwear the Patriots of our
Religion and Liberties out of their Lives; his
hiring execrable Villains to aſſaſſinate the late
Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> and cauſing thoſe others to be
clandeſtinely cut off in Hopes to conceal it;
his adviſing and procuring the Prorogation and
Diſſolution of Parliaments, in order to prevent
their looking into his Crimes, and that he might
eſcape the Juſtice of the Nation; ſuch can i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine
nothing ſo black and horrid in it ſelf,
or ſo ruinous and deſtructive to Religion and
the Kingdom, which we may not expect from
him.'</p>
                        <p>' The very Tyrannies which he hath exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
ſince he ſnatched the Crown from his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
Head, do leave none under a Poſſibility
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:0535601400:6"/>
of flattering themſelves with Hopes of Safety,
either in their Conſciences, Perſons, or E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates:
For, in Defiance of all the Laws and
Statutes of the Realm, made for the Security
of the Reformed Proteſtant Religion, he not
only began his Reign with a bare-fac'd Avow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himſelf of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion, but call'd in
Multitudes of Prieſts and Jeſuits, for whom the
Law makes it Treaſon to come into this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;
and hath impower'd them to exerciſe I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatries:
And beſides his being daily preſent
at the Worſhip of the Maſs, he hath publickly
aſſiſted at the greateſt Fopperies of their Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition.
Neither hath he been more tender
in trampling upon the Laws which concern
our Properties, ſeeing in two Proclamations,
whereof the one requires the collecting of the
Cuſtoms, and the other the continuing that
part of the Exciſe which was to expire at the
late King's Death; he hath violently, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
all the Law of the Land, broken in up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
our Eſtates. Neither is it any Extenuation
of his Tyranny, that he is countenanced in it
by an extrajudicial Opinion of ſeven or eight
ſuborned and forſworn Judges; but rather de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring
the Greatneſs and Extent of the Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy
againſt our Rights; and that there is no
Means left for our Relief, but by Force of
Arms: For, advancing thoſe to the Bench that
were the Scandal of the Bar; and conſtituting
thoſe very Men to declare the Laws, who are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed
and branded in Parliament for pervert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them, we were precluded all Hopes of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
in <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall:</hi> And by packing Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
together by falſe Returns, new illegal
Charters, and other corrupt Means, he doth at
once deprive us of all Expectations of Succour
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:0535601400:7"/>
where our Anceſtors were wont to find it; and
hopes to render that which ought to be the
People's Fences againſt Tyranny, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervator
of their Liberties, the Means of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting
all our Laws, and of eſtabliſhing of his
Arbitrarineſs, and confirming our Thraldom.
So that unleſs we could be contented to ſee the
Reformed Proteſtant Religion, and ſuch as
profeſs it, extirpated, Popiſh Superſtition and
Idolatry eſtabliſh'd, the Laws of the Land
trampled under Foot, the Liberties and Rights
of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> People ſubverted, and all that is
Sacred and Civil, or of Regard amongſt Men of
Virtue or Piety, violated; and unleſs we could
be willing to be Slaves as well as Papiſts, and
forget the Example of our Noble and Generous
Anceſtors, who conveyed our Privileges to us
at the Expence of their Blood and Treaſure;
and withal, be unmindful of our Duty to God,
our Country and Poſterity; deaf to the Cries
and Groans of our oppreſſed Friends, and be
ſatisfied not only to ſee them and our ſelves
impriſon'd, robb'd, and murdered, but the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
Intereſt throughout the whole World,
betrayed to <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi>; we are bound, as
Men and Chriſtians, and that in Diſcharge of
our Duty to God, and our Country, and for
the Satisfaction of the Proteſtant Nations round
about us, to betake our ſelves to Arms; which
we take Heaven and Earth to witneſs, we
ſhould not have done, had not the Malice of
our Enemies deprived us of all other Means of
Redreſs; and were not the Miſeries that we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
feel, and thoſe which do further threaten
us, worſe than the Calamities of War. And it
is not for any perſonal Injuries, or private Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents,
nor in purſuance of any corrupt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt,
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:0535601400:8"/>
that we take our Swords in our Hands;
but for vindicating our Religion, Laws and
Rights, and reſcuing our Country from Ruin
and Deſtruction, and for the preſerving our
ſelves, Wives and Children, from Bondage and
Idolatry. Wherefore, before God, Angels and
Men, we ſtand acquitted from, and do charge
upon our Enemies, all the Slaughter and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſtations
that unavoidably accompany inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine
War.'</p>
                        <p>' Now, therefore, we do hereby ſolemnly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
and proclaim War againſt <hi>J.</hi> D. of <hi>Y.</hi> as
a Murderer, and an Aſſaſſin of innocent Men,
a Traytor to the Nation, and a Tyrant over
the People: And we would have none that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
under his Banner to flatter themſelves with
Expectation of Forgiveneſs, it being our firm
Reſolution to proſecute him, and his Adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
without giving Way to Treaties and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodations,
until we have brought him
and them to undergo what the Rule of the
Conſtitution, and the Statutes of the Realm,
as well as the Laws of Nature, Scripture, and
Nations, adjudge to be Puniſhment due to the
Enemies of God, Mankind, their Country, and
all Things that are Honourable, Virtuous, and
Good.'</p>
                        <p>' And though we cannot avoid being ſenſible
that too many have, from Cowardiſe, Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs
and Ambition, co-operated to the
ſubverting of our Religion, and enſlaving their
Country; yet we would have none, from a
Deſpair of finding Mercy, perſevere in their
Crimes, nor continue the Ruin of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom:
For we exclude none from the Benefit
of Repentance, that will join with us in retrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
that they have been acceſſary to the Loſs
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:0535601400:9"/>
of: Nor do we deſign Revenge upon any, but
the obſtinate, and ſuch as ſhall be found at this
Juncture yielding Aid and Aſſiſtance to the ſaid
<hi>J.</hi> D. of <hi>Y.</hi>'</p>
                        <p>' And that we may both govern our ſelves in
the Purſuit of this glorious Cauſe wherein we
are engaged, and give Encouragement to all
that ſhall aſſiſt us in ſo righteous and neceſſary
an Undertaking, we do, in the Preſence of the
Lord, who knoweth the Secrets of all Hearts,
and is the Avenger of Deceit and Falſhood,
proclaim and publiſh what we aim at; and for
the obtaining whereof, we have both determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to venture, and are ready to lay down our
Lives. And though we are not come into the
Field to introduce Anarchy and Confuſion, or
for laying aſide any Part of the Old <hi>Engliſh</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
yet our Purpoſes and Reſolutions
are, to reduce Things to that Temperament
and Ballance, that future Rulers may remain
able to do all the Good that can be either deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
or expected from them: and that it may
not be in their Power to invade the Rights, and
infringe the Liberties of the People.'</p>
                        <p>' And whereas our Religion, the moſt valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
thing we lay claim unto, hath been ſhaken
by unjuſt Laws, undermined by Popiſh Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels,
and is now in Danger to be ſubverted, we
are therefore reſolved to ſpend our Blood for
preſerving it to our ſelves and Poſterity: Nor
will we lay down our Arms till we ſee it eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed
and ſecured beyond all Probability of
being ſupplanted and overthrown, and until
all the Penal Laws againſt all Proteſtant
Diſſenters be repealed, and legal Proviſion
made againſt their being diſturbed, by reaſon
of their Conſciences, and for their enjoying
<pb n="xi" facs="tcp:0535601400:10"/>
an equal Liberty with other Proteſtants.'</p>
                        <p>' And that the Meekneſs and Purity of our
Principles, and the Moderation and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs
of our End may appear unto all Men,
we do declare, That we will not make War up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
or deſtroy any for their Religion, how
falſe and erroneous ſoever: So that the very
Papiſts, provided they withdraw from the
Tents of our Enemies, and be not found Guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of conſpiring our Deſtruction, or Abettors
of them that ſeek it, have nothing to fear or
apprehend from us, except what may hinder
their altering our Laws, and endangering our
Perſons in the Profeſſion of the Reformed Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
and Exerciſe of our Chriſtian Worſhip.'</p>
                        <p>' Our Reſolution in the next Place is, To
maintain all the juſt Rights and Privileges of
Parliament, and to have Parliaments annually
choſen and held, and not prorogued, diſſolved,
or diſcontinued within the Year, before Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
be firſt anſwered, and Grievances redreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.'</p>
                        <p>' And ſeeing many of the Miſeries under
which the Nation doth groan, ariſe from diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placing
ſuch out of the Number of Judges as
would not, for the promoting Popiſh and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary
Deſigns, wreſt and miſapply the Laws,
and from conſtituting Corrupt and Mercenary
Men in their Rooms, on purpoſe to ſtretch the
Laws beyond the Reaſon and Intention of them;
and to declare that for Law which is not; we
can neither with Silence paſs over the mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of them; nor ſhould we have Peace in our
ſelves, if we did not endeavour to prevent the
like Miſchief in Time to come. For by Reaſon
of ill Men's being advanced to the Bench, and
holding their Places only <hi>durante bene placito,</hi>
                           <pb n="xii" facs="tcp:0535601400:11"/>
many Perſons have been condemned in exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
Fines for no Crimes, or for very ſmall
ones: Many Statutes made for the Safety of the
Subject, particularly the <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> Act,
have been wickedly eluded, to the Oppreſſion
of the Innocent and Loyal Men. The Popiſh
Lords that were impeached in Parliament for
a moſt helliſh Conſpiracy, have, to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting
the Rights of the Houſe of Lords, been
diſcharged, and ſet free. The impoſing a
Mayor and Sheriffs upon the City of <hi>London,</hi>
by Fraud and Violence, have been juſtified,
and thoſe who in diſcharge of their Duty op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
it, illegally proſecuted, and arbitrarily
puniſhed. <hi>London,</hi> and other Cities and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porations,
have been robbed of their Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
upon unrighteous Judgments of pretended
Forfeitures. Sir <hi>Thomas Armſtrong</hi> executed
without being allowed the Benefit of a Tryal.
Colonel <hi>Algernoon Sidney</hi> condemn'd to die up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Depoſition of one ſcandalous Witneſs.
And that Loyal and Excellent Perſon, the late
<hi>William</hi> Lord <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> murthered for alledged
Crimes; in reference to which, if all had been
true which was ſworn againſt him, yet there
was nothing which according to Law could
have reached his Life. Upon the Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
aforeſaid, we further declare, that we will
have Care taken for the future, for the debar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
ignorant, ſcandalous, and mercenary Men
from the Adminiſtration of Juſtice; and that
the Judges ſhall hold their Places by the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Tenure of <hi>quam diu ſe bene geſſerint</hi>; and to
leave it to the Wiſdom of a Parliament, to ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
ſome Way and Method for the Approbation
of ſuch as ſhall be advanced to the Degree and
Dignity of Judges.'</p>

' And foraſmuch as the Invaſion made on the
Right of Cities, Burroughs, and Towns Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate;
the Seiſure of their Charters, whether
by Surrender, or upon pretence of Forfeiture,
have been wholly arbitrary and illegal; we
likewiſe therefore declare, we will, to our ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt,
endeavour to ſee them repoſſeſſed in what
they formerly had, and could legally lay claim
to; and that we do eſteem all Judgments given
againſt them, and all Surrenders made by a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
and perjured Party amongſt them, null and
void in Law; and do hold and declare their
old Charters, notwithſtanding the new ones
lately granted, to be good and valid: And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
we do invite and encourage all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
Burgeſſes and Free-men to re-aſſume the
Rights and Privileges, which by Virtue of the
ſaid old Charters, belonged to their ſeveral and
reſpective Corporations; and to deliver them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves

                        <p>' Moreover, for the reſtoring the Kingdom to
its Primitive Condition of Freedom and Safety,
we will have the <hi>Corporation</hi> and <hi>Militia Acts</hi>
repealed: And all Outlawries of Treaſon againſt
any Perſon whatſoever, upon the late pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Porteſtant Plot, reverſed; and alſo, all other
Outlawries, Baniſhments, Warrants, Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
Impriſonments, and injurious Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
againſt any other Perſons, upon any of
the Penal Statutes made againſt Proteſtant Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters,
made null and void. And we will
have new Laws enacted for placing the Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Sheriffs in the Freeholders of the ſeveral
Countries, for ſettling the Militia in the ſeveral
Shires, and for preventing all Military ſtanding
Forces, except what ſhall be raiſed and kept up

by Authority and Conſent of Parliament.'</p>
                        <p>' And whereas ſeveral Gentlemen and others,
who have been worthy and zealous Aſſertors
of the Proteſtant Intereſt, and Laws of the
Kingdom, are now in Cuſtody in divers Places
within the Realm, upon moſt unjuſt Accuſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,

we do hereby further declare the ſaid Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to be illegal; and that in caſe any Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
ſhall be offered to them, or any of them,
we will revenge it to the utmoſt upon ſuch of
our Enemies as ſhall fall into our Hands.'</p>
                        <p>' And whereas the ſaid <hi>J.</hi> D. of <hi>Y.</hi> in order to
the expenditing the Idolatrous and Bloody De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns
of the Papiſts, the gratifying his own
boundleſs Ambition after a Crown, and to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Enquiry into the Aſſaſſination of <hi>Arthur</hi>
Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> hath poyſon'd the late King, and
thereby manifeſted his Ingratitude, as well as
Cruelty to the World, in murthering a Brother
who had almoſt ruin'd himſelf to preſerve and

further declare, That for the aforeſaid
villanous and unnatural Crime, and other his
Crimes before mentioned, and in purſuance of
the Reſolution of both Houſe of Parliament,
who voted to revenge the King's Death, in

him to ſuffer what the Law adjudged to be

                        <p>' And in a more particular manner, His Grace
the Duke of <hi>Manmouth,</hi> being ſenſible of the
barbarous and horried Parricide committed upon
his Father, doth reſolve to purſue the ſaid <hi>J.</hi>
D. of <hi>Y.</hi> as a mortal and bloody Enemy; and

by the Aſſiſtance of his Friends, and the Law,
to have Juſtice executed upon him.'</p>
                        <p>' And the ſaid <hi>James</hi> Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> the

End aforeſaid, from the Generouſneſs of his

prefers to whatſoever concerns himſelf,
doth not at preſent inſiſt upon his Title, but
leaves the Determination thereof to the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,

legally choſen, and acting with Freedom;
and in the mean time doth profeſs and declare,
by all that is ſacred, That he will, in Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
with the People of <hi>England,</hi> employ all
the Abilities beſtowed upon him by God and

                        <p>' And whereas the Nobility and Gentry, and

their Zeal and Courage, expecting their,

and promiſing our Aſſiſtance, for carrying on
that Glorious Work we are jointly engaged in;
being obliged, avoiding Tediouſneſs, to omit the
recounting many Oppreſſions under which that
Kingdom hath groaned, and the giving a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
of the ſeveral Steps that have been ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
for introducing of Popery and Tyranny. We
think fit, therefore, to ſignifie both to our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-men
and Foreigners, that we intend a larger
Teſtimony and Remonſtrance of the Grievances,
Perſecutions, Cruelties and Tyrannies, we have
of late lain under; and therein a full and more

of the D. of <hi>Y.</hi> And we make our Appeal unto
GOD, and all Proteſtant Kings, Princes, States,

and the Neceſſity we are reduced unto of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
our Recourſe to Arms. And as we do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech,
require and adjure all ſincere Proteſtants,

of obtaining the utmoſt Aid and Succour
which they can yield us with their Prayers,

and Truſt is upon the Lord of Hoſts,
in whoſe Name we go forth, and to whom we
commit our Cauſe, and refer the Deciſion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt

<hi>Now let us play the Men for our People, and for

Title to the Imperial Crown of theſe Realms,
and of endeavouring to get the Poſſeſſion of
that Right which is devolved upon Us by the
Laws of God and Man; ſo muſt We, in Juſtice
to the Sentiments of Our own Heart, declare,
That nothing in the World can give Us ſo great
Satisfaction, as to owe to the Endeavours of
Our Loyal Subjects both Our own and their
Reſtoration to that happy Settlement which
can alone deliver this Church and Nation from
the Calamities which they lie at preſent under,
and from theſe future Miſeries which muſt be
the Conſequences of the preſent Uſurpation.
During the Life of Our dear Siſter, of Glorious
Memory, the Happineſs which our People
enjoyed, ſoftened, in ſome Degree, the Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
of our own Fate; and we muſt further
confeſs that when we reflected on the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of her Nature, and her Inclination to Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
We could not but perſwade Our ſelf, that
ſhe intended to eſtabliſh and perpetuate the
Peace which ſhe had given to theſe Kingdoms,
by deſtroying for ever all Competition to the
Succeſſion of the Crown, and by conſenting
to us, at laſt, the Enjoyment of that Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
out of which we had been ſo long kept,
which her Conſcience muſt inform Her was our
Due, and which her Principles muſt lead her
to deſire, that We might obtain. But ſince the
Time, it pleaſed God to put a Period to her
Life, and not to ſuffer Us to throw Our ſelf,
as We then firmly purpoſed to have done, upon
Our People; We have not been able to look
upon the preſent Condition of Our Kingdoms,
or to conſider their future Proſpect, without all
the Horror and Indignation which ought to
fill the Breaſt of every <hi>Scotſman.</hi> We have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
<pb n="xxi" facs="tcp:0535601400:20"/>
a Foreign Family, Aliens to our Country,
diſtant in Blood, and Strangers even to our
Language, aſcend the Throne. We have ſeen
the Reins of Government put into the Hands of
a Faction, and that Authority which was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd
for the Protection of all, exerciſed by a
few of the worſt, to the Oppreſſion of the
beſt and greateſt Number of Our Subjects.
Our Siſter has not been left at Reſt in her
Grave, her Name has been ſcurrilouſly abuſed,
her Glory, as far as in theſe People lay, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
defaced, and her faithful Servants inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manly
perſecuted. A Parliament has been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
by the moſt unwarrantable Influences,
and by the groſſeſt Corruptions to ſerve the
vileſt Ends, and they, who ought to be the
Guardians of the Liberties of the People, are
become the Inſtruments of Tyranny: Whilſt
the principal Powers engaged in the late Wars,
do enjoy the Bleſſings of Peace, and are atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive

People; <hi>Great Britain,</hi> in the midſt of Peace,
feels all the Load of War. New Debts are

into which theſe Kingdoms have been betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
under Pretence of being reſcued and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
from Dangers purely imaginary; and
theſe are ſuch Conſequences of abandoning
<pb n="xxii" facs="tcp:0535601400:21"/>
the old Conſtitution, as we perſwade Our ſelves
very many of thoſe who promoted the preſent
unjuſt and illegal Settlement never intended.'</p>
                        <p>' We obſerve, with the utmoſt Satisfaction,
that the Generality of Our Subjects are awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken'd
with a juſt Senſe of their Danger, and
that they ſhew themſelves reſolv'd to take ſuch
Meaſures as may effectually reſcue them from
that Bondage which has, by the Artifice of a
few deſigning Men, and the Concurrence of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
unhappy Cauſes, been brought upon them.'</p>
                        <p>' We adore the Wiſdom of Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
which has opened a Way to our Reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
by the Succeſs of thoſe very Meaſures
that were laid to diſappoint Us for ever: And
We muſt earneſtly conjure all Our Loving
Subjects, not to ſuffer that Spirit to faint or
die away, which has been ſo miraculouſly rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
in all Parts of our Kingdom; but to purſue,
with all the Vigour and Hopes of Succeſs,
which ſo Juſt and Righteous a Cauſe ought to
inſpire, thoſe Methods, which the Finger of
God ſeems to point out to them.'</p>
                        <p>' We are coming to take Our Part in all the
Dangers and Difficulties to which any of Our
Subjects, from the Greateſt down to the Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt,
may be expoſed, on this important Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
to relieve our Subjects in <hi>Scotland</hi> from
the Hardſhips they groan under, on account of
the late unhappy Union; and to reſtore the
Kingdom to its Ancient, Free, and Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
State. We have before our Eyes the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of Our Royal Grandfather, who ſell a
Sacrifice to Rebellion; and of Our Royal Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
who, by a Train of Miracles, eſcaped the
Rage of Barbarous and Blood-thirſty Rebels, and
lived to exerciſe his Clemency towards thoſe
<pb n="xxiii" facs="tcp:0535601400:22"/>
who had waged War againſt his Father and
himſelf; who had driven him to ſeek Shelter
in Foreign Lands, and who had even ſet a
Price upon his Head.'</p>
                        <p>' We ſee the ſame Inſtances of Cruelty renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
againſt Us, by Men of the ſame Principles,
without any other Reaſon, than the Conſciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of their own Guilt, and the implacable Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
of their own Hearts: For in the Account
of ſuch Men, it's a Crime ſufficient to be their
King; but God forbid that we ſhould tread in
theſe Steps, or that the Cauſe of a Lawſul Prince,
and an Injuried People, ſhould be carried on like
that of Tyranny and Uſurpation, and owe its
Support to Aſſaſſins. We ſhall copy after the
Patterns above-mentioned, and be ready with
the former of Our Royal Anceſtors, to Seal the
Cauſe of our Country, if ſuch be the Will of
Heaven, with Our Blood: But we hope for
better Things, we hope for the latter, to ſee
our juſt Rights, and thoſe of the Church and
People of <hi>Scotland,</hi> once more ſettled in a Free
and Independent <hi>Scots</hi> Parliament, on their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Foundation; to ſuch a Parliament, which
we will immediately call, ſhall we entirely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
Our, and their Intereſts, being ſenſible that
theſe Intereſts rightly underſtood, are always
the ſame: Let the Civil, as well as Religious
Rights of all our Subjects, receive a Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in ſuch a Parliament; let Conſciences tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
tender be indulged; let Property of every
Kind be better than ever ſecured; let an Act
of General Grace and Amneſty, extinguiſh the
Faults, even of the moſt Guilty; if poſſible,
let the very Remembrance of all which have
preceeded this happy Moment, be utterly blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
out, that our Subjects may be united to Us,
<pb n="xxiv" facs="tcp:0535601400:23"/>
and to each other, in the ſtricteſt Bonds of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
as well as Intereſt.'</p>
                        <p>' And that nothing may be omitted, which is
in Our Power to contribute to this deſirable
End; we do, by theſe Preſents, abſolutely
and effectually, for Us, Our Heirs and Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors,
Pardon, Remit and Diſcharge all
Crimes of High-Treaſon, Miſpriſion of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
and all other Crimes and Offences what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
done or committed againſt Us, or Our
Royal Father of bleſſed Memory, by any of Our
Subjects, of what Degree or Quality ſoever, who
ſhall, at, or after Our Landing, and before they
engage in any Action againſt Us, or Our For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
from that Time, lay hold on Mercy, and
return to that Duty and Allegiance they owe to
Us, their only Rightful and Lawful Sovereign.'</p>
                        <p>' By the joint Endeavours of Us and Our Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
urged by theſe Motives, and directed
to theſe Views, we may hope to ſee the Peace
and Flouriſhing Eſtate of this Kingdom, in a
ſhort Time reſtor'd; and we ſhall be equally
forward to concert with our Parliament ſuch
further Meaſures as may be thought neceſſary
for leaving the ſame to future Generations.'</p>
                        <p>' And we hereby require all Sheriffs of Shires,
Stewarts of Stewartries, and their Deputies,
and Magiſtrates of Burghs, to publiſh this Our
Declaration, immediately after it ſhall come
to their Hands, in the uſual Place and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
under the Pain of being proceeded againſt
for Failure thereof, and forfeiting the Benefit
of our General Pardon.'</p>

It is to be obſerved, That the Declarations by
the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Argyle,</hi>
inſiſt on ſuch Acts of Tyranny committed by
<hi>James</hi> II. as all the World knew to be true,
whereas the Pretender, and thoſe who have now
rebell'd for the Support of his Claim, have no
ſuch Thing to charge upon King <hi>GEORGE,</hi> but
traiterouſly miſrepreſent the legal Methods
which he has taken, with Conſent of Parliament,
for the Defence of our Religion and Liberties,
and retrieving the Honour of the Nation, on
purpoſe to inflame the High-Church Mob.</p>
               <p>It alſo deſerves a Remark, that tho' the Duke
of <hi>Monmouth</hi> was ſo weak as to be prevail'd on
by the Importunity of thoſe who join'd him,
to take the Title of King, yet he did not poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
aſſert this Title to the Crown in his Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
but left it to be Determined by Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
whereas King <hi>James</hi> II. never offer'd to
ſubmit the Examination of the Pretender's Birth
to a Parliament, to whom the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>
referr'd it, but on the contrary, abandon'd the
Kingdom, with his Queen, the Pretender, and
all the material Witneſſes, as if he had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious
to himſelf, that ſuch an Examination
wou'd have fully diſcover'd the Cheat. Nor has
the Pretender offer'd to make any Proof of his Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimacy,
or even to give ſuch a feign'd Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
for our Religion and Liberties as <hi>James</hi> II.
did, but on the contrary did abſolutely refuſe
the <hi>Scots</hi> Coronation Oath that was in Force be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Union of the Crowns, becauſe it oblig'd
him to maintain the Proteſtant Religion, as eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd
in that Nation in the Reign of <hi>Mary</hi>
Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> and confirm'd by her Son <hi>James</hi>
VI. of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the Firſt of <hi>Great Britain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="xxvi" facs="tcp:0535601400:25"/>
This is enough to ſhew the Difference betwixt
the Cauſes of the Rebellion againſt King <hi>James</hi>
II. and that againſt King <hi>GEORGE</hi>; and tho'
the latter has been much more univerſal and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable
than the other, it will appear by the
following Accounts, that the Proceedings againſt
the preſent Rebels, have been kept within the
due Bounds of Law, and temper'd with great
Clemency, whereas thoſe againſt the Rebels in
the Time of <hi>James</hi> II. did not only exceed Law,
but were carred on with ſuch Barbarity as is
ſhocking to Human Nature.</p>

            <p>IT is proper in the next Place, to give a brief
Account how the <hi>Scots,</hi> who took Arms in
their own Country againſt the Tyranny
of King <hi>Charles</hi> and King <hi>James</hi> II. were treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
There were ſeveral Inſurrections there, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion'd
by the barbarous Oppreſſion of the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians,
for not conforming to the Tyranny
in Church and State then ſet up, which they
proteſted they could not in Conſcience do, ſince
that Government was not only contrary to the
Fundamental Laws of the Nation, but to their
Principles, and the ſolemn Obligations which
the King and Kingdom lay under by Oaths a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
it; and that it was attended by ſuch an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited
Prerogative given the King by a pack'd
Parliament, as empower'd him by Virtue of his
Supremacy, which they called <hi>an inherent Right</hi>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:0535601400:58"/>
               <hi>to the Crown,</hi> 
               <q rend="inline">' That he and his Succeſſors might
ſettle, enact, and emit ſuch Conſtitutions,
Acts, and Orders, concerning the Adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the External Government of the Church,
and the Perſons employed in the ſame, and
concerning all Eccleſiaſtical Meetings, and
Matters to be propoſed and determin'd there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
as they in their Royal Wiſdom ſhould think
fit.'</q> Theſe are the very Words of the firſt Act
of the 2d Seſſions of the firſt Parliament of <hi>Charles</hi>
II. and of the firſt Act of the ſecond Parliament.</p>
            <p>To force a Conformity to this ſort of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in Church and State, which King <hi>Charles</hi> II.
had ſolemnly abjur'd at his taking the Crown of
<hi>Scotland</hi> upon him, High Commiſſion Courts
were not only ſet up by the Prerogative, which
acted contrary to Law, but Soldiers were em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd
to oppreſs, pillage, harraſs, impriſon,
fine, and confine, beat and bind like Beaſts,
thoſe who refus'd it. Sir <hi>James Turner,</hi> a bloody
and atheiſtical Man, commanded in three ſuch
Expeditions againſt the <hi>Weſtern</hi> Shires of <hi>Scotland,</hi>
in 1663, 1665, and 1666. where he and his
Troops exacted from the poor People of <hi>Galloway</hi>
and <hi>Nithſdale,</hi> for their Nonconformity, betwixt
4 and 5000 <hi>l.</hi> Sterling, beſides the great Charge
they were at by giving free Quarters, and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
to the Soldiers, to forbear the Barbarities
which they practiſed on their Perſons and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies.
There was alſo levied by way of Fine,
without any Crime alledged, from 132 Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
and others, near 7000 <hi>l.</hi> Sterling, beſides
free Quarters to the Soldiers ſent to levy it,
which amounted to as much; and notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Money which was paid to thoſe barbarous
Troops to make them forbear Cruelties, it was
their common Cuſtom to deſtroy all the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0535601400:59"/>
and Subſtance of thoſe they quartered upon,
and to fill the Bellies of their Servants and Dogs,
before they would ſuffer the poor Families to eat
any of their own Proviſions; nor did they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have
themſelves thus only to thoſe who did not
conform, but to many Gentlemen and others
who did; it being plainly the Deſign of the Court
to ruin the Weſt of <hi>Scotland</hi>; becauſe that Part
of the Kingdom had always, from the Time of
the Reformation, ſignalized their Zeal for their
Religion and Liberty. It was uſual with them af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
they had ruin'd the Tenants to quarter upon
their Landlords; and thus they harraſs'd and
plunder'd that Part of the Country three Times
ſucceſſively in the Years above-mention'd: And
beſides the Money thus exacted, they forced Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to give Bonds for ſuch other Sums as they
thought fit, by which they beggar'd abundance
of Families. And when any complain'd to the
commanding Officer of thoſe Inhumanities, they
were commonly beaten, or otherwiſe barbarouſly
treated. The Soldiers did likewiſe behave
themſelves ſo atheiſtically, that they publickly
mock'd at all Religion, utter'd moſt horrible
Curſes and Oaths, raviſh'd Women, and in ſhort,
their Behaviour was more like Savages and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans
than civilized Men and Chriſtians: and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
they had thus ruin'd the Country, they extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Certificates from the People, That they had
been civilly uſed, on purpoſe to prevent their
making Application to the Government for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs;
and when they had nothing left to pay
what the Soldiers demanded, they were barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly
uſed in their Perſons, and carried to Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
tied Hand and Foot, like Beaſts. After
the Country had been 7 Months thus oppreſs'd in
Sir <hi>James</hi>'s third Expedition, three Country-men
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0535601400:60"/>
met four of his Soldiers carrying a poor old Man,
one of their Neighbours, in that Manner to
<hi>Dumfries</hi>; they begg'd the Soldiers to unty him,
who, inſtead of doing it, attack'd the Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
with their Swords, but were worſted in the
Scuffle, one of them wounded, and the other
three threw down their Arms. This encourag'd
theſe Men, with ſome others, to attack 10 or 12
more of the Soldiers, who were in like manner
oppreſſing the People in that ſame Pariſh, and
theſe they alſo diſarmed, having kill'd one that
made an obſtinate Reſiſtance. The Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
knowing that Sir <hi>James</hi> would take a terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Revenge upon them, about 54 of them took
Horſe, and with a few Footmen marched to
<hi>Dumfries,</hi> where they took Sir <hi>James,</hi> and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arm'd
his Men. Having done this, they march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the <hi>Weſt,</hi> where the People were oppreſs'd
in the like Manner, and being join'd by others,
came at laſt to be 7 or 800. Upon this Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
General <hi>Dalzeel</hi> was ordered to march a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
them with the regular Troops, they were
declared Rebels, and order'd to lay down their
Arms within 24 Hours after the Proclamation
was publiſhed, without the leaſt Aſſurance of
Pardon, and all the Subjects were ordered to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
the General, on pain of Rebellion. This poor
Handful being thus made deſperate, they march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
within two Miles of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and a Ceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was agreed between the General and them
for one Night, until their Grievances and Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
might be preſented by him to the Council.
This made them ſecure, and the General, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to Agreement, ſurpriz'd them juſt at the
Time when his Meſſenger was delivering their
Petition to the Council. They made a ſtout Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance,
and repuls'd his advanced Troops three
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0535601400:61"/>
Times, but being vaſtly inferior in Number, and
fatigued with long Marches, Hunger, Rain and
Cold, they were defeated on the 28th of <hi>Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi>
1666. 40 of 'em kill'd, and above 130 of
them taken, many of whom were executed with
the greateſt Cruelty and Barbarity, and ſome of
them tortured by an Engine called a Boot, to
make them diſcover others, and ſuch as had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
them any Aſſiſtance or Relief. Beſides, it
was made Treaſon for any one to harbour ſuch
of them as had eſcaped. This was the firſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection
in <hi>Scotland,</hi> known by the Name of
<hi>Pentland-Hills,</hi> which was the Place where they
fought.</p>
            <p>Theſe Barbarities ſerved only to incenſe the
Country, and to make the People of the Weſtern
Shires more averſe to Conformity than before.
This occaſion'd many ſevere Laws to force them
to a Compliance, which not having the deſign'd
Effect, an Army of barbarous Highlanders was
twice brought down upon the Country, which
they plunder's, treated the People with all ſort
of Inhumanity, garriſon'd Gentlemen's Houſes
contrary to Law, impos'd Bonds and Oaths upon
the People without Authority of Parliament,
and committed ſuch other Outrages, as if they
had been in an Enemies Country. But all this
not prevailing with the People to conform, or to
abſtain from Worſhip in the Fields, when they
could not do it in Houſes, Troops were employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to attack the People where-ever they were aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled,
which oblig'd them frequently to ſtand
on their Defence, and all that did ſo being made
Guilty of Death, this brought on the ſecond In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection
at <hi>Bothwell-bridge,</hi> in 1679. where the
poor oppreſſed People being vaſtly out-number'd
by the King's Army, under the Command of the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0535601400:62"/>
Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> about 300 of 'em, after a
ſtout Reſiſtance, were kill'd, the reſt put to
flight, and above 1000 taken, and carried to <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinburgh,</hi>
where they were a long time kept in
an open Church-yard without any Shelter from
Cold or Rain; ſeveral Miniſters and others were
executed, and about 1700 taken there, and at
other Places before, ſold for Slaves to <hi>America,</hi>
and other Parts, 200 of which were caſt away
near <hi>Orkney,</hi> thro' the Barbarity of the Captain
of the Ship, who order'd them to be kept under
Hatches, when his Ship ſtruck, otherwiſe they
might have eſcaped as well as he, and his Men,
and about 50 others of their Fellow Priſoners.</p>
            <p>The Country was made a perfect Scene of Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
and Cruelty, by the Purſuits which were
made after thoſe who eſcaped from the Field,
and the proſcribing, or putting to Death ſuch
as were found to give them any Relief, though
their neareſt Relations. And Acts were made
to make it Death for any Presbyterian Miniſters
to preach, or People to hear them, in Houſe or
Field.</p>
            <p>Theſe barbarous Oppreſſions made a Part of
the People ſo mad, that ſome of them thought
themſelves abſolved from giving any further O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
to King <hi>Charles</hi> II. or thoſe commiſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
under him; and therefore took upon them to
declare, That he had forfeited his Crown by his
Perjury and Tyranny, and that they would no
more own him as their Sovereign. Though this
was known to be contrary to the declared Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of the Presbyterians, and perfectly inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent
with what they held themſelves to be obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to by the <hi>Solemn League and Covenant,</hi> which
bound them to maintain the King's juſt Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
and the Authority of Parliaments, from
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0535601400:63"/>
whom their Kings derived their Authority, and
without whoſe Conſent they held they could not
be depriv'd of it; yet the Practice of thoſe few
deſperate Men was made a Handle to oppreſs all
the Presbyterians, and to impoſe new Oaths and
Bonds upon them. In the mean time that Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
of Men who had thus thrown off the King's
Authority, were purſued from Place to Place,
and kill'd without any Tryal, where-ever they
were found; and the Soldiers had an illegal
Power given them by the Council to tender a
Bond or Oath, to all that they pleaſed, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>own
the Declaration of thoſe Men; and if they
refuſed it, they were preſently to kill them; and
thus they murder'd, without any Trial, about 78
People, in ſeveral Parts of the Country, and in
ſuch a barbarous Manner, that they would not
allow thoſe poor People Time to recommend
themſelves to God, before they were ſhot or
ſtabb'd, but anſwer'd them with this atheiſtical
Sarcaſm, <hi>What the Devil have you been doing ſo
many Years? Ha'n't you had Time enough to pray in
the Caves and Mountains!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The murmuring Faction cannot pretend that
the preſent Rebels were forced by any ſuch Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities
as theſe, to take Arms, nor have they
any Ground to complain of any ſuch Inquiſitor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
Proceedings againſt their Friends; and 'tis
well for them 'tis ſo; otherwiſe there had been
ſuch a Havock long e'er now among the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Church
Party, that few or none of them would
have been left to belch out Lies and Treaſon eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Day againſt the Government.</p>
            <p>I come now to the laſt Inſurrection in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
before the Revolution, which was that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Earl of <hi>Argyle,</hi> already mention'd: The
Cauſes of it are to be ſeen in his Declaration,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0535601400:64"/>
as above, ſo that there's little more to be ſaid of
it, but that his Lordſhip not being able to raiſe
above 2000 Men, becauſe of the Precautions

abundance of his Men deſerted; and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at laſt towards <hi>Dumbarton</hi> and <hi>Glaſgow,</hi> he
was intercepted by a numerous Army; and his
Men perceiving that the Enemy was ten times
their Number, and being alſo wearied out with
long Marches, want of Proviſions, and Sleep,
moſt of them withdrew in the Night, and the
few that kept together, were, after ſome Skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhes
with a Party of the Enemy, whom they
defeated, obliged likewiſe to diſperſe; the Earl

at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> as about 20 of his Men were
at his Seat at <hi>Innerary</hi> in the Highlands; and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
others taken up afterwards on Suſpicion, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe,

            </p>
            <p>'Tis obſervable, That the Earl was not execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

of an Explanation which he offered of the

that ſeveral of the Epiſcopal Party had been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
to take it with ſuch Explanations, becauſe
it was contradictory in it ſelf, and were never
called in queſtion for it: But the Reaſon why
the Earl was pick'd out to be a Sacrifice, was
the Greatneſs of his Quality and Power, which
the Court knew would make it difficult for them

               <hi>Tyrconnel</hi> fully anſwered their Expectations,
and in a little Time caſhier'd the Proteſtant Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
in <hi>Ireland,</hi> which conſiſted of about 7000
Men, and form'd another of Papiſts, moſt of
whom were the Deſcendants, or near Relations
of thoſe that had been attainted for the Rebellion
and Maſſacre in 1641, or had ſignalized them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
by notorious Villanies, and implacable
Hatred to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and Proteſtant Intereſt in
that Nation.</p>
            <p>In the next Place he ſet up Judges there, who
were engaged by Intereſt and Inclination to
deſtroy the Proteſtant Religion; and one of
them, called <hi>Rice,</hi> a proſligate Papiſt, who was
advanced to be Lord Chief Baron, had the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence
to declare, he would draw a Coach and
ſix Horſes through the Act of Settlement, which
was the Chief Security the Proteſtants had in that
Kingdom. Sir <hi>Alexander Fitton,</hi> who had been
convicted of Forgery at <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall,</hi> and
<hi>Cheſter,</hi> and fin'd for it by the Lords in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
was taken out of Goal, and made Lord
High Chancellor of <hi>Ireland,</hi> becauſe he turned
Papiſt; and was ſo zealous to ſhew himſelf a true
Convert, that he ſeveral times declared with the
Height of Impudence from the Bench, <hi>That the
Iriſh Proteſtants were all Rogues, and that there was
not one among</hi> 40000 <hi>of 'em, but was a Traytor, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel
and Villain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Privy Council in <hi>Ireland</hi> was compos'd of
a Majority of Papiſis; ſo that the Proteſtants na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
as Members of it, declined to act; becauſe
they were ſenſible that they could do their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Intereſt no manner of Service.</p>
            <p>There wanted nothing elſe but to model a
Houſe of Commons to the Deſigns of the Court,
and in order to that the Charters of all Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0535601400:67"/>
were ſeiz'd by <hi>Quo Warranto</hi>'s, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Cauſe or Shadow of Law; ſo that the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracies
of Corporations were fill'd up with Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts,
and Men of deſperate, or no Fortunes; and
the new Charters had a Clauſe by which the
chief Governour was impower'd to turn out and
put in whom he pleaſed, without ſhewing a Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
            <p>The
Proteſtant Clergy were oppreſſed by <hi>Tyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>connel,</hi>
and the Popiſh Prieſts did openly demand
the Tythes belonging to them, and forbad their
People to pay the Tythes to the Proteſtant In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbents,
on Pain of Damnation. This paſs'd
afterwards into an Act, by which the Papiſts
were to pay their Tythes only to their own
Prieſts; and afterwards, as any Proteſtant Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
or Clergyman died, Papiſts were put into
their Places by the King's Privy Signet, or Sign
Manual.</p>
            <p>In the next Place <hi>Tyrconnel</hi> ſtopp'd the Salaries
of the Univerſity of <hi>Dublin,</hi> becauſe they would
not, contrary to the Laws and their Oaths, admit
a vicious ignorant Papiſt into a vacant Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip;
and when King <hi>James</hi> arrived there after
the Revolution, the Proteſtant Vice Preſident,
Fellows and Scholars, were all turn'd out, their
Furniture, Library, Communion Plate, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
thing belonging to the College was taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
the Houſe made a Garriſon, and their
Chambers made Priſons for Proteſtants; tho'
King <hi>James</hi> had promiſed to preſerve their
Liberties and Properties, and rather augment
than diminiſh the Privileges which had been
granted them by his Predeceſſors. At laſt moſt
of the Churches in and about <hi>Dublin,</hi> were ſeiz'd
on by the Government, and an Order was iſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
forbidding more than 5 Proteſtants to meet,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0535601400:68"/>
under Pain of Death, ſo that all religious Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies
through the whole Kingdom, were prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited
to Proteſtants.</p>
            <p>To complete their Ruin, an Act of Attainder
was paſs'd in Parliament, in order to which, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Member of the Houſe of Commons returned
the Names of all ſuch Proteſtant Gentlemen as
lived near them, or in the County or Borough
for which he ſerved; or if he was a Stranger to
any of them, he ſent to the Country for Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
about them. When the Bill was preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the King for his Aſſent, the Speaker told
him, That many were attainted in that Act up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſuch Evidence as ſatisfied the Houſe, and the
reſt upon Common Fame.</p>
            <p>In this Act, no fewer were attainted than two
Archbiſhops, one Duke, 17 Earls, 7 Counteſſes,
28 Viſcounts, 2 Viſcounteſſes, 7 Biſhops, 18 Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons,
33 Baronets, 51 Knights, 83 Clergymen,
2182 Eſquires and Gentlemen, <hi>and all of 'em un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard,</hi>
declared and adjudged Traytors, convict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and attainted of High-Treaſon, and adjudged
to ſuffer the Pains of Death and Forſeiture. The
famous Proſcription of <hi>Rome</hi> during the laſt Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umvirate,
came not up in ſome Reſpects to the
Horror of this; for there were condemned in this
little Kingdom more than double the Number
that were proſcribed through the vaſt Bounds of
the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. And to make this of <hi>Ireland</hi>
yet the more terrible, and to put the Perſons at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainted
out of a Poſſibility of eſcaping, the Act
it ſelf was concealed, and no Proteſtant allow'd a
Copy of it, till four Months after it was paſt:
Whereas in that of <hi>Rome,</hi> the Names of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
proſcribed were affixed upon all the publick
Places of the City, and the very Day the Proſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was concerted; and thereby Opportunity

               <p>And as the Difference betwixt the Cauſes is
