            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <lg>
               <l>A Grecian bard, two thouſand years ago,</l>
               <l>Plan'd this ſad fable, of illuſtrious woe;</l>
               <l>Waken'd each ſoft emotion of the breaſt,</l>
               <l>And call'd forth tears, that would not be ſuppreſt.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Yet, O ye mighty ſirs, of judgement chaſte,</l>
               <l>Who, lacking genius, have a deal of taſte,</l>
               <l>Can you forgive our modern ancient piece,</l>
               <l>Which brings no chorus, tho' it comes from Greece;</l>
               <l>Kind ſocial chorus, which all humours meets,</l>
               <l>And ſings and dances, up and down the ſtreets.</l>
               <l>— Oh! might true taſte in theſe unclaſſic days,</l>
               <l>Revive the Grecian faſhions, with their plays!</l>
               <l>Then rais'd on ſtilts, our player's would ſtalk and rage,</l>
               <l>And at three ſteps, ſtride o'er a modern ſtage;</l>
               <l>Each geſture then would boaſt unuſual charms,</l>
               <l>From lengthen'd legs, ſtuff'd body, ſprawling arms!</l>
               <l>Your critic eye would then no pigmies ſee,</l>
               <l>But buſkin's make a giant, ev'n of <hi>Me.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>No features then the poet's mind would trace,</l>
               <l>But one blank vizor blot out all the face.</l>
               <l>O! glorious times, when actors thus could ſtrike</l>
               <l>Expreſſive, inexpreſſive, all alike!</l>
               <l>Leſs change of face, than in our Punch they ſaw,</l>
               <l>For Punch can roll his eyes, and wag his jaw;</l>
               <l>With one ſet glare they mouth'd the rumbling verſe,</l>
               <l>Our <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> look not half ſo fierce!</l>

               <l>Of raillery then, ye modern wits beware,</l>
               <l>Nor damn the Grecian poet, for the player.</l>
               <l>Theirs was the ſkill, with honeſt help of art,</l>
               <l>To win by juſt degrees, the yielding heart.</l>
               <l>What if our Shakeſpear claims the magic throne,</l>
               <l>And in one inſtant makes us all his own,</l>
               <l>They differ only, in the point of view,</l>
