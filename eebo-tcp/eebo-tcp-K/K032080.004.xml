            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>The shell figured in the annexed Plate is unique; it formerly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to the late Duchess of Portland, by whose permission Mr. Pennant described it in the British Zoology. This author has given two figures of it, one in Plate 77, and the other in the Frontispiece of the fourth volume.</p>
            <p>The existence of this species being only proved by a solitary speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, various conjectures have arisen amongst Conchologists respecting it. Some have been inclined to admit it as an undoubted species, and others as a mere accidental variety of growth of the Linnaean Murex Antiquus. How far we may be authorized to abide by the former opinion must rest with the critical Naturalist.</p>
            <p>To argue that it cannot be a distinct species, because only one shell of the kind has been hitherto found, is absurd; since the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istence of many other species has been asserted upon the evidence of a single specimen only, and its relation to Murex antiquus is not so obvious as might he at first imagined. It certainly approaches it in the general outline, but the tidges of Murex Antiquus is most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely raised into tubercules, whereas those of Carinatus are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly smooth and even, nor is there that strict correspondence in the angulations of the contour in general that should induce us to consider it a variety of Murex Carinatus.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:0622700304:5"/>In deciding a question of some moment to the English Concho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logist, it has been thought advisable to give an additional Plate of Murex Antiquus, by which the difference between the two shells may be more easily discriminated. We must however observe, that the latter is not absolutely known as a British shell; it is a native of the North Seas, and has been supposed to inhabit some of the remote northern islands of the British dominions. The Murex Antiquus of Pennant is a very different shell, and by no means allied to that of Linnaeus, whose name it bears.</p>
            <p>It is now uncertain from what part of our coast the Duchess of Portland received this shell; Pennant is silent in this respect, but we cannot dispute that her Grace received it as a British shell, since it was inserted upon her authority in the British Zoology.</p>

            <p>Some Conchologists imagine that Da Costa has confounded this species with his Solen Siliqua, but it is more probable that he had never met with it, or the character of the teeth at the hinge could not have escaped his notice. In its general appearance it is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Solen Siliqua, but has one end marginated, and only a single
<pb facs="tcp:0622700304:8"/>tooth in each valve; on the contrary Solen Siliqua has two teeth in one valve, and one in the other; the single one being inserted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two others when the shell is shut.</p>
            <p>This is very scarce. Pennant says it inhabits Red Wharf, Anglesea, —This is not Solen Vagina of Linnaeus, as Pennant describes it.</p>

            <p>This is perhaps the rarest species of the Solen genus found upon the British coasts, and as Pennant observes, seems to connect the Solen with the Mya genera. It borders on the Chama of Da Costa,
<pb facs="tcp:0622700304:19"/>who therefore calls it Solen Chama-Solen. Pennant notes it from Weymouth, and Da Costa received it from the shores of Dorset<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire and Hampshire.</p>
            <p>Pennant has mistaken this for a very distinct shell, described by Linnaeus, under the name of Solen Cultellus.</p>

               <p>Da Costa says, all the shells of this species he knew, were fished up near Weymouth in Dorsetshire, and not any where else on the British coast; they are even not frequent there; so that it seems a rare as well as curious shell.—To this we may add, that they are
<pb facs="tcp:0622700304:33"/>rare only because they are local: in one part of the sandy bay of Caermarthen, below Tenby, we found them in abundance.</p>
               <p>It is called "the Bubble" by this writer; who observes that it exactly resembles a bubble or bladder of water. The aperture is so extremely large that the whole shell lies open to view. The contour is somewhat oval, and slightly involuted; and the shell is not umbilicated.</p>
               <p>This is certainly not Bulla patula of Pennant (Brit. Zool. No. 85. A.) as Da Costa and Gmelin imagine. The figures in that work are sometimes calculated to mislead the most attentive; but as we are in possession of the shell Pennant describes, we can venture to say the two former writers are mistaken. The species Aperta was unknown to Pennant, and the shell he figured from the Portland Cabinet, under the specific name of Patula, is extremely rare.</p>

               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:0622700304:34"/>This is a very scarce species on our coasts, and approaches so nearly to Bulla pallida of Da Costa (Voluta pallida. <hi>Linn.</hi>) described and figured in Plate LXVI. of this Work, that it may easily be confounded with it, unless the two shells be compared. Bulla Cylindrica differs in being rather more compressed, and has the pillar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip perfectly smooth; while on the contrary the other has plaits or wrinkles upon this part as before observed: a circumstance that constitutes one character of the Voluta genus in the system of Linnaeus.</p>
               <p>In the description of the Voluta pallida we were led to think with Da Costa, that the shell figured by Pennant in the British Zoology, No. 85. A. might be of the same species. Since that time we have been favoured with the specimen figured in the annexed Plate; and as it seems to correspond more clearly with Pennant's shell than the other, there can be no impropriety in removing the reference from the former to the preſent species. Gmelin takes not the slightest notice of this figure of Pennant; so that we must remain ignorant of his opinion respecting it. And it is certain the shell before us was altogether unknown to Da Costa.</p>

                  <pb facs="tcp:0622700304:45"/>The Common Cockle is abundant on all sandy shores: they lurk in the sand, and their hiding-place is known by a little round depressed spot upon the surface. Cockles are in season from autumn till spring: they are a wholesome and palatable food; and thoſe from Selſea, near Chichester, are esteemed the most delicious in England.</p>
               <p>These Shells vary a little both in shape and colour: the two ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimens figured on the annexed Plate differ, one being more orbicular than the other. They are generally whitish, sometimes they have a blueish, and sometimes a yellowish tint.</p>

               <p>Notwithstanding the endless variations to which the shells of the common Cockle are liable, this appears too remote to be admitted as one of them. It passes for Cardium rusticum with some concholo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſts, and though it may not strictly agree with that specific descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Gmelin, it approaches nearer to it than to edule. That author
<pb facs="tcp:0622700304:46"/>notices the affinity <hi>rusticum</hi> bears to the other species; but observes that the grooves are deeper and the ribs fewer, and more convex in rusticum: he remarks also that the latter has a ridge on the anterior margin when the valves are closed, and a narrow depressure behind the beaks, "ano evidente, sed angusto," which is not in the other. The grooves in our Shell are not so deep as "sulcis profundioribus" implies, but they are both deeper and wider than in the common sort; the ribs are rather more convex also, fewer in number, and rugged, as Gmelin describes it.—The colour exactly corresponds: he says it is sometimes ferruginous, with livid bands and sometimes white, with the anterior part fuscous: another variety of it is white, fasciated with a ferruginous yellowish or blueish colour.</p>

            <p>This is a new species as a British shell; and the conchologist is indebted to Miss Pocock for the discovery of it on our coaſt. The attention with which this lady has honoured the science has not been rewarded by this new species only: we have been favoured with several others, besides many rare kinds that have been found by
<pb facs="tcp:0622700304:49"/>her on different parts of the sea-coast, and especially on that of Cornwall, as will appear hereafter. A few shells of the species before us were met with by her in the summer of 1801, on Hale sands under Lelant in that county, and it is said by the country people they are at times found on that coaſt in some plenty.</p>
            <p>Though hitherto unknown as a British shell, it has been before discovered in the Mediterranean sea; for there can be no hesitation in admitting it to be the shell figured by Chemnitz, as above quoted. Gmelin refers to the two figures in that Work, No. 232, and 233, for his species glauca; and the description corresponds in general with them, though not exactly in the colour of the rays.—Gmelin has another species of Mactra, <hi>grandis,</hi> which we at first suspected to be the same as our shell. It agrees precisely in the colour of the rays, but from the figure in Chemnitz's work, quoted by Gmelin for that species, these rays, it appears, are far more minute, than in our shell, and are also decussated by others in a concentric direction; —the outline of the latter is also different.</p>

            <p>Da Costa acquaints us that he received "some few of these shells from Cornwall (in a great quantity of others, natives of that coast) by an intelligent gentleman of veracity and curiosity; but" adds that
<pb facs="tcp:0622700304:55"/>writer, "must own I have never met with this species since on any other British coasts." We have since seen it among parcels of shells from the Mediterranean, and also find that it has been discovered by the late Dr. Pultney, on the North shore, Poole; and at Weymouth.</p>

                  <pb facs="tcp:0622700304:58"/>Few species of the shell tribe are more generally diffused through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the European and Indian seas than the Mytilus edulis; and few indeed exhibit such an infinite number of varieties, differing in size, in form, and colour; but which the critical Conchologist will yet perceive cannot with propriety be assigned to any other species.</p>
               <p>On the Plate annexed to this description, one shell of the shape more uniformly prevalent is figured in its natural state, and another, which, having been divested of the epidermis, displays a beautiful variety of irregular purple stripes: an appearance very common in the uncoated shells, and in some sorts observable even when the epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermis is upon them. The upper and lower figures are of two shells, which, we are inclined to think, differ too widely from the common kind to be considered as a variety: the outline appears at the first sight obviously dissimilar; and the characters in general seem to mark most decidedly another species. They are both worn shells, but which we have compared with perfect specimens of My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilus ungulatus, and apprehend there can be no doubt that they belong to that species.</p>
               <p>Within the tropics, the common Muscle is known to attain a much larger size than in northern climates. They are found in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mense beds, and adhere to other substances, or to one another, by means of a beard of a strong and silky texture, which the fish throws out. The Muscle affords a rich and palatable food; though they are not deemed wholesome by many people, who after eating them are sometimes afflicted with great swellings and convulsive motions, with eruptive blotches, shortness of breath, and even with delirium. These dreadful effects are usually attributed to some malignant poison in the little pea crab which is occasionally found in the Muscle, and
<pb facs="tcp:0622700304:59"/>may be accidentally eaten with it: others think it is in consequence of swallowing the silky byssus, or beard; and again many deem the Muscle itself poisonous. It is, however, pretty generally agreed, that they affect some constitutions more than others, and that much depends on the state of the body at the time of eating them. The disorder may be cured, or at least its malignity mitigated, by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministering to the affected person a spoonful of vinegar: some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend sweet oil, or salt and water. Da Costa observes that su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorifics, vomits, oils, &amp;c. are the usual remedies; and the Dutch give two spoon's-full of oil, and one of lemon-juice; or, in defect of that, a little more vinegar, well shaken together, and swallowed immediately.</p>
               <p>The Muscle is the prey of many kinds of fishes, and other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that inhabit the sea. On the coast of Greenland, Fabricius tell us, they are so abundant, that the dogs and ravens commonly feed on them; as do also the white game, (Ptarmigan) Eider Duck, and many others.</p>
               <p>The seed-pearls found in the shell of the Muscle was formerly in some esteem, for medicinal purposes: these, it is well known, are the effects of a disease in the fish, unalogous to the stone in the human body.</p>
               <p>Mr. Pennant informs us, that the finest Muscles on the English coasts (where they are found in great abundance) are those called Hambleton Hookers, from a village in the county of Lancashire. They are taken out of the sea, and placed in the river Wier, within reach of the tide, where they grow very fat and delicious.</p>

            <p>The Common Garden Snail is, we think, without doubt, the Helix lucorum of Linnaeus, and most other writers. Gmelin calls it hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensis,
<pb facs="tcp:0622700304:68"/>and defines the specific character of lucorum to be "testa imperforata subrotunda laevi fasciata: apertura oblongo fusca." It more generally inhabits the southern parts of Europe; is larger, and whiter than hortensis; and the lip is brown.</p>
            <p>This is a most variable species in its colours and markings, and it may still be doubted whether hortensis and lucorum be perfectly distinct. They have certainly been confounded by almost every Conchologist.</p>
            <p>On the manners of a creature which is so generally known, as the Common Garden Snail, it is surely needless to enlarge: its mode of courtship is, however, so curiously related, that it should not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely escape remark; and were it not attested by writers of the first authority, with the reader, we might be guilty of no small degree of scepticism, as to believing it. Each of these animals, it seems, are furnished, at a certain season, with a number of little pointed darts, which are contained within a cavity on the right side of the neck. When the Snails approach within two or three inches of each other, a scene of hostility is observed to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence: each discharging at its antagonist these darts, with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable force, at the other; this battle continues till the reservoir be exhausted of these offensive weapons, and then a perfect re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation takes place between them. The eggs are about the size of peas, and perfectly round.</p>
            <p>Snails are used with success in some consumptive cases, and an excellent cement, to fasten china, may be made of the saliva, or hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, mixed with quick lime and white of eggs, according to
<pb facs="tcp:0622700304:69"/>Lister, &amp;c. It feeds on all kinds of vegetables and fruits, and is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently very destructive in orchards and gardens. Snails couple about May or June.</p>

            <p>The Sabella tubiformis of Pennant is believed by some concholo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gists to be the same species as Linnaeus names <hi>granulata,</hi> but this must certainly admit of doubt: the latter, from the description, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apears
<pb facs="tcp:0622700304:75"/>to be slightly incurvated, whilst Pennant's shell is perfectly straight; a difference, perhaps, sufficient to constitute two distinct species. <hi>Martini</hi> figures a kind of Sabella, which he considers as the S. granulata of Linnaeus, and in that figure the curvature at the narrowest end is very apparent: with Martini we consider that as the true Sabella granulata of Linnaeus, and not having observed the same character in any of those shells that have occurred to notice on our own coasts, have thought it most adviseable to retain the name Mr. Pennant had previously given it.</p>
            <p>Gmelin seems to be under some doubts respecting this shell, for he entirely omits the Linnaean <hi>granulata</hi> among the species of this genus.—Sabella Belgica of Gmelin, which some have conjectured to be the <hi>S. tubiformis</hi> of Pennant, is undoubtedly different, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Klein</hi> and <hi>Martini.</hi>

            <p>There does certainly exist among conchologists a strange dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordance of opinion, respecting the species of Arca before us: some believing it to be the very shell which Linnaeus described under the name of <hi>lactea,</hi> and others maintaining the contrary. Dr. Solander, and Dr. Pultney, were persuaded that Linnaeus intended a shell in some particulars not unlike this, but specifically different: the same shell in fact which Lister figures No. 67, in his Conchology. The opinions of two such respectable naturalists deserve every considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but however we may be disposed to abide by their authority in some instances, we cannot, for the following reasons, assent to it in the present.</p>
            <p>Dr. Pultney premises his description by naming this species Arca crinita, a name which it appears Dr. Solander had previously given to it, in his catalogue of the Portland Museum: he observes very justly, that it is the <hi>A. barbata</hi> of Pennant, but not the barbata of Linnaeus: refers to Da Costa's figure, Plate 11, fig. 5; and calls it in English the HAIRY ARK-SHELL. His description is in these words, "A small oblong subrhomboidal shell: in its recent state covered with a brown epidermis. Undemeath the shell is minutely striated in the longitudinal direction; commonly not much larger than a horse-bean. I found one on the North shore at Poole, more than half an inch long, and seven-eights wide. It is said to be more frequent on the shores of Guernsey island; but is very rare on
<pb facs="tcp:0622700304:82"/>our coasts. This shell has commonly been described as the <hi>A. lactea</hi> of Linnaeus; but that shell is much larger, and is strongly striated in a reticulated manner."</p>
            <p>In the first place, this does not so clearly agree with the Linnaean description as might be expected. In the early editions of the <hi>Systema Naturae,</hi> Linnaeus expressly describes his shell as being of a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhombic form, with obsolete decussating striae, diaphanous, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curved beaks, and crenulated margin; and the only alteration in the specific character to the last edition of that work, by <hi>Gmelin,</hi> is, that the beaks and margins are not mentioned. It hence is evident that Dr. Pultney is mistaken in the Linnaean <hi>lactea,</hi> when he says it is <hi>strongly striated</hi> in a reticulated manner; for Linnaeus exactly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes it as having the reticulating striae <hi>obsolete;</hi> and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing that the longitudinal striae in the shell found on our coast are rather prominent in some specimens, they far more frequently appear altogether obsolete, and are decussated by fine transverse striae, precisely as Linnaeus mentions. There is another circumstance equally remarkable, Linnaeus exactly tells us his <hi>lactea</hi> is the size of a horse-bean, and Dr. Pultney, after observing that his British shell <hi>crinita</hi> "are commonly not much larger than a horse-bean," adds, that the <hi>lactea</hi> of Linnaeus is "much larger."</p>
            <p>That there may have been some erroneous references among authors to the two shells figured by Lister, No. 67 and 69, of which we are not aware, is not impossible, but <hi>Gmelin</hi> refers to <hi>List. Conch.</hi> 69. <hi>A. T. Guernsey,</hi> for the Linnaean <hi>lactea,</hi> and that shell clearly corresponds both with our specimen, and the shell described by Linnaeus, pectunculus exiguus albus admodum tenuiter striatis. <hi>List.—Petiver</hi> is equally satisfactory, Mytilus Garnseiae
<pb facs="tcp:0622700304:83"/>albus, parvus tenuiter cancellata. Da Costa is not so very clear, nor is his figure expressive, because it represents the transverse ridges too prominent. Chemnitz gives a larger specimen of it than any we have seen; and notwithstanding his references to Da Costa and others, may not be of the same species.—The shell figured by Lister, No. 67, which seems to have occasioned the confusion before alluded to, it should be observed, is described by Gmelin, in these words: testa subrhomboidea decussatim striata alba: natibus approxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matis, vulva cordata, <hi>Arca reticulata.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hence it is presumed the shell found on our coast ought still to be considered as the <hi>Arca lactea</hi> of Linnaeus, and that the shell which is strongly striated in a reticulated manner, and so much larger; and has been hitherto regarded by some as that species, was never described, or even noticed by Linnaeus. Nothing can be more evident than that this is the opinion of his editor Gmelin, both from his references to the figures of lactea, and by his giving a new name and character to that very shell in Lister which has been mistaken for it, and which he conceived Linnaeus had omitted.</p>
            <p>This kind is generally considered as an inhabitant of Dorsetshire, Devonshire, and Cornwall.</p>

            <p>Like the two species of Helices, nemoralis and hortensis, this shell varies exceedingly in its colours and markings in different shells; but the single narrow spiral band very uniformly distinguishes it from any other. According to Lister and Petiver, it is found in shady hedges, and is frequent in rushy, moist, or marshy meadows. Da Costa says, it is also found in coppices and shrubberies; but, from his own observations, it is not a common kind: we have seen it in woods, though not often.</p>
            <p>It may deserve remark, that this shell is generally found empty. Muller accounts for this, by acquainting us, that the animal is the prey of young Newts. Sometimes when the animal is living, the shell is of a light chesnut colour, finely marbled, mottled, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise variegated, with a deep chocolate coloured brown.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:0622700304:89"/>that circumstance, is supposed to be the same species as was formerly worn by pilgrims, who visited the holy-land. Da Costa received it from Scarborough in Yorkshire, and also from the coasts of Cornwall and Dorsetshire.

            <p>This curious little Volute has not we believe been either figured or described by any Author. In its general appearance it approaches pretty nearly to the shell figured by Walker, as above quoted; but if the same, that writer has certainly described it with no very great degres of accuracy; for he speaks only of two plaits, or teeth in the
<pb facs="tcp:0622700304:92"/>aperture, and calls it the double-toothed Turbo; although from its plaited pillar, it is evidently a Volute: and the third plait, which with the two others, characterize the species, is obviously too large to have been overlooked. Da Costa, we are persuaded, though they were both the same, for in a <hi>MS. note</hi> attached to this shell in his collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he says, "This shell is figured by Walker," and certainly no figure in the volume of that Author corresponds with it, except that to which we refer above.</p>
            <p>Walker speaks of his shell as being very common on the roots of rushes, in marshes, near Faversham: The <hi>habitat</hi> of our shell we have not been able to ascertain, having never found it in a living state.</p>

               <pb facs="tcp:0622700304:95"/>We have constantly observed this kind of Sabella to be an inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant only of low rocky shores, that lie within reach of the tide at high water; and although it is composed entirely of broken shells and sea sand; and those apparently very slightly agglutinated by the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals that form and inhabit it, in its native element it acquires a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable comparative degree of tenacity from the saline particles with which it is impregnated, and is capable of resisting the reiterated dashing of the waves without material injury.</p>
            <p>In the more sheltered crevices of the rocks, where the animal has ample scope to expand its sandy dwelling secure from mutilation, the upper surface of a mass of these shells has a very elegant appearance; the whole being beautifully foliated with the single or bipartite funnnel. shaped lip, which each animal forms at the opening of his cell. This appearance is represented in the plate subjoined, and is a circumstance the more deserving attention, because it has entirely escaped the notice of Mr. Pennant, and perhaps of every other Naturalist, except Mr. Ellis; who in his History of Corals, figures it with a foliated surface, under the title of Tubularia arenosa anglica, from a specimen brought from Dieppe. The latter does not however agree precisely in figure with any that have occurred to our notice. Mr. Pennant evidently represents a poor mutilated fragment, in which the openings of the cells are shewn like so many rounded perforations, in a somewhat uneven sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, and is just as it appears in masses on the sea-beach, that have been trodden under-foot; or pieces that have been much worn, and thrown loose upon the shore.</p>
            <p>These shells are three or four inches in length, and where they are found are generally abundant, but they seem to be very local. Mr. Pennant says it is found on the Western coasts of Anglesea, near Cric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
<pb facs="tcp:0622700304:96"/>in Caernarvonshire, and near Yarmouth. We have seen it on other parts of the sea coast of North Wales, and in equal plenty on those of South Wales likewise. On the coast of Dorsetshire, according to Dr. Pultney, fragments are found very frequently, but none very perfect. In the History of that County the following ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count is given of it.—"GREGARIOUS SABELLA. This is composed of a mass of fine sand, and particles of broken and finely comminuted shells, aggregated by vermiform animals of the Nereis genus, each lodged in its separate tube close to, but not interfering with each other. All the tubes end in orifices on the upper or the same surface. I but once saw a mass of this kind, about the size of a large apple, on the beach, a mile east of Weymouth; but I suspect it is not very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common, as fragments are very frequent."</p>

            <p>Da Costa and some other Conchologists have very erroneously been led to conclude, that this, and Mactra lutraria, are the same species, although they differ in almost every particular. The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent shell is much wider in proportion to the length than <hi>M. lutraria;</hi> and of a more incurvated shape: it is also a thicker and coarser shell, and has the hinge placed much further back than in the other species. Dr. Solander, who described it in the catalogue of the Portland Museum, gave in the specific name of hians, from its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
<pb facs="tcp:0622700304:99"/>gaping at the anterior end, and a name so applicable we thought it best to retain.</p>
            <p>The cicatrix of the animal, in this kind, is different from that of M. lutraria, a circumstance that has not escaped the observation of Dr. Pultney. This author tells us, the Mactra hians is thrown up in considerable quantities on all the smooth beaches he has seen on the coast of Dorsetshire, particularly on the North shore at Poole, opposite Branksea isle; and that he has also seen it on the beaches at Studland, Swanage, and Weymouth. We have observed it, but not in abundance, on other sea-coasts.</p>

            <p>The Mytilus rugosus is rather a rare species on our coasts. Lister notes it from Hartlepool in Durham, and Da Costa says on the coast of Yorkshire, about Scarborough, Whitby, &amp;c.

            <p>Pennant seems to be the only author who has noticed this species. Da Costa imagined, from the description given by that author, that it was of the same kind as that which he inserted in his British
<pb facs="tcp:0622700304:108"/>Conchology, under the name of Bulla, the Bubble (Aperta, Linn.) and refers to the figure in the work of Pennant accordingly; but in this instance he was much mistaken, for the two shells are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly distinct; and it appears certain, that the shell described by Da Costa was as much unknown to Pennant, as that of Pennant was to Da Costa. The shell of the latter is figured in Plate 120 of this work, and the true Bulla patula of the other is figured in the Plate annexed.</p>
            <p>This we apprehend to be one of the rarest of the British shells hitherto discovered; Pennant notes it from Weymouth, and refers for his specimen to the Portland Cabinet: our shell is from Wey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth likewise.</p>
