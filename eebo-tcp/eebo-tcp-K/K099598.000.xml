            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </p>
            <p>I was conceived in <hi>Sin</hi> and brought forth in <hi>Iniquity, Anno</hi> 1680, ſo that I am double the Age of my Couſin <hi>Stephen Duck,</hi> and have therefore, you may rationally ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, <hi>Ploughed, Harrowed,</hi> and <hi>Threſhed,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:0153000500:6"/>
twice as long, and all to no Purpoſe, unleſs the good Earl of <hi>Macclesfield</hi> will likewiſe read ſome of my <hi>Parnaſſian</hi>-Labours to our moſt Gracious Queen; but, I live in hopes that his Lordſhip will grant me this humble Boon, and that my Kinſman and I, may ſhare one equal Fate.</p>
            <p>As to my Education, the moſt learned Dr. <hi>Arthur Duck,</hi> being my Godfather, I was by his Intereſt got upon the Foundation of <hi>Eton</hi>-College, and having gone through my School-Studies, I was, as well as my Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <hi>Thomas Tuſſer,</hi> for ſometime a Student in the Univerſity of <hi>Cambridge.</hi> In this ſeminary of the Muſes, our <hi>Alma-Mater</hi> being peeviſh, fretful, and generally out of Humour, I could not ſo much as Rhime my ſelf into a College-Fellowſhip. This I took, as <hi>Hudibras</hi> ſays, in great <hi>Dudgeon,</hi> more eſpecially, ſince it is well known that the whole <hi>Race of the DUCKS were born Poets.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I left <hi>King's</hi>-College, and came to aſſiſt my Parents in their Farming-Buſineſs at <hi>Ipſwich</hi>; where I ſoon found that <hi>Corn</hi> and <hi>Hops</hi> came to a much better Market than <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:0153000500:7"/>
Tho' in this firſt Part of my Ruſtic-Miſcellany,<q>
                  <l>I hope th' impartial Reader will diſcern,</l>
                  <l>I ne'er invok'd the Muſes in a Barn.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Upon the Death of my inteſtate Parents, being an only Child, there fell to me, by right of Inheritance, a very decent Country-Legacy, <hi>viz.</hi> Good ſtore of Grain, the Paſtures well ſtockt with Cattle, Provender for their Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-Suſtenance, and a round ſum of Money. But, as <hi>Horace</hi> ſays,<q>
                  <l>My Way-ward, wandring Mind did not approve,</l>
                  <l>My happy State; I was inclin'd to rove:</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And ſoon experienced the fatal Conſequences attending ſuch a Temper. In ſhort, I had no Notion of foreign Travel; nothing would ſerve me, but making the Tour of <hi>Change-Alley</hi>; where, in that memorable Year of Chronology 1720, I fell a Victim on the Altar which made a daily Sacrifice both of <hi>Cit</hi> and <hi>Bumpkin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus having ſunk the <hi>Scholar</hi> in the <hi>Farmer</hi>; and the <hi>Farmer</hi> having undergone a <hi>South-Sea</hi>

Ship wreck; I am now reduced to my Kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's Priſtine Vocation of <hi>God ſpeed the Plough.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My Wages, are indeed, five Shillings and Six-pence <hi>per</hi> Week, our County of <hi>Suffolk</hi> giving one Shilling more than they do in <hi>Wilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire</hi>; tho' alas, at this Price, it is with great Difficulty that <hi>Buckle</hi> and <hi>Throng,</hi> as we ſay, are brought together. However, I am in hopes of ſeeing better Days,<q>Redeunt <hi>Saturnia</hi> Regna.</q>
            </p>
            <p>To conclude, in one Word, my ſole Truſt is in my noble Patron, therefore<q>
