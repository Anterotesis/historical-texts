         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. XIII.</hi> Of the Circle of Bavaria.</head>
                  <p>BAVARIA not only contains the proper do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions of the dukedom of that name, but alſo the territories of the Archbiſhop of Saltzburg, and the biſhoprics of Paſſau, Ratiſbon, and Frieſengen. It is divided into Upper and Lower Bavaria, bounded by Franconia, Voitland and Bohemia, on the N. by Bohemia and Auſtria, E. Carinthia, Brixen and Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rol, to the S. and by Swabia on the W. extending about 200 miles from N. to S. and 120 from E. to W.</p>
                  <p>The Elector of Bavaria and the Archbiſhop of Saltzburg, are the joint ſummoning princes. Ratiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon or Waſſerburg are the two places where the diet of the circle is uſually held, though ſometimes it is convened at Landſhut or Muldorf. The Elector is hereditary commander in chief, and has the direction
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0161700110:6"/>
of all military affairs. With reſpect to religion, this circle is one of the mixed.</p>
                  <p>Upper Bavaria is partly mountainous and woody, and partly marſhy, abounding in large and ſmall lakes, and, having a good deal of level ground, is fitter for paſturage than tillage. Lower Bavaria is more level and more fruitful. But Bavaria in general abounds in grain, paſtures, foreſts, and plenty of cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, game, and wild fowl. It produces alſo in differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent parts, ſalt, copper, ſilver, lead, and marble, and here are medicinal ſprings and baths. The Danube, which has its ſcource in Swabia, waters the electorate from eaſt to weſt, receiving other rivers in its courſe. Out of the Danube and two other rivers, a ſmall quantity of ſand is collected. There are ſixteen large inland lakes, and 160 ſmall ones, all which afford a number of fiſh.</p>
                  <p>In all Bavaria are reckoned thirty-five cities, and ninety-five open and encloſed market-towns, 1000 caſtles and ſeats, or eſtates inveſted with lower town juriſdiction over the vaſſals, and 11,704 villages, ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets, and deſarts, which laſt alone are computed at 4000. In the Upper Palatinate are thirteen cities and twenty-eight market-towns. The computation of vaſſals or families in the electorate, which eſtimates them at four millions, and thoſe in Bavaria alone at near 3,400,000, exceeds the truth, as this would
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0161700110:7"/>
make the number of people 24,000,000, they do not amount to more than one million and a half, and the income of the Duke is 1,000,000l. ſterling.</p>
                  <p>In Bavaria no other religious doctrine is tolerated than the Roman-catholic. The pariſhes in the elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torate are about 1500, the vicarages and chapels near 2000, and the number of churches, it is ſaid, amount to 28,709. The remarkable convents are eighty-ſix, and the collegiate foundations twelve.</p>
                  <p>Solid knowledge and good learning muſt be owned, to the honour of this electorate, to be on a better footing, and to receive more countenance here now than ever. The Benedictines diſtinguiſh themſelves in both, and Ingoldſtadt boaſts a univerſity.</p>
                  <p>Manufactures are alſo encouraged and improved here, particularly coarſe cloths, woollen ſtuffs, and ſtockings, ſilk ſtuffs, velvets, tapeſtry, good clocks, watches, and other neceſſaries, though its chief ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports conſiſt of cattle, grain, wood, ſalt, and iron. At Munich, from ſpring to June, is brewed a kind of white beer, called ambock, very ſtrong, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like fine Engliſh ale, but won't keep. The monopoly of this liquor brings in yearly above a mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion of guilders.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="6" facs="tcp:0161700110:8"/>Agriculture here is at a very low ebb; not more than half the country is in tenure, or occupancy, and fallows are kept open three, four, or five years to ſtrengthen the ſoil, e're they ſow the land for a crop.</p>
                  <p>The title of the Elector is, "By the grace of God, Duke of Upper and Lower Bavaria, as alſo the Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Palatinate, Pfalſgrave of the Rhine, Arch-ſteward of the Holy Roman Empire, and Landgrave of Leuchtenberg." The arms are quarterly, an eſcut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheon of pretence; in one, a topaz in a field ruby, in another, a lion ruby, crowned topaz, and in the other two lozenges, ſapphire and pearl.</p>
                  <p>There are five hereditary ſtate-officers in this elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torate; that of the maſter of the houſhold has been veſted in the Barons Haſiangs, ſince 1618, and they have been ambaſſadors at the court of London for many years. The knights of the Bavarian order of <hi>St. George,</hi> muſt produce unqueſtionable proofs of their nobility for eight generations back in both lines. Its enſign is a blue enamelled croſs with a <hi>St. George</hi> in the middle, worn pendant to a broad ſky blue rib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, with a black and white border, and a ſtar on the breaſt. The military force of the Elector conſiſts of regulars and militia; the former, in time of peace, amounts only to 12,000, in war to 30,000.</p>

                     <pb n="7" facs="tcp:0161700110:10"/>Of the cities, we ſhall ſpeak only of Munich, Saltſburg, Ratiſbon, Paſſau, and Ingoldſtadt. Munich is a fortified city, ſeated on the Iſer, and the capital and reſidence of the Elector.</p>
                  <p>Ratiſbon and Munich are the principal cities, but the latter is conſidered as the capital. It is pleaſantly ſituated on the river Iſar, which, divided into ſeveral channels, waters all parts of the town, ſo that little ſtreams run through many of the ſtreets, confined in ſtone channels, which have a moſt clean and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able effect. The ſtreets, ſquares, and courts are ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and airy, which make all the buildings appear more magnificent than thoſe in other cities, which have been built with much more coſt and expence. The ſtreets in particular are ſo ſtraight, that many of them interſect each other at right angles, and are very broad and extremely well built. The ſplendour and beauty of its buildings, both public and private, eſpecially the electoral palace, may compare with any in Europe. The magnificence of the churches and convents are ſuch, that they are equal, if not ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to any in Germany.</p>
                  <p>The electoral palace is not ſo noble an edifice out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, as its internal beauty demands. This vaſt ſtructure being built at various periods by ſucceſſive princes, ſeveral fancies were indulged in the taſte of it; and it has many valuable paintings, and the Duke
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0161700110:11"/>
of Marlborough, after the battle of Hochſtet, brought away a great many to England.</p>
                  <p>It is ſeated at the extremity of the town, and contains 2060 windows, twenty large halls, eleven courts, nine galleries, ſixteen kitchens, and twelve cellars. It is thought to be one of the moſt magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, large, and commodious palaces in Europe, and of the four principal courts, one is adorned with ſeveral braſs ſtatues; another, the Emperor's, is ſo conſtructed, that combats of wild beaſts may be exhibited in it. In the kitchen-court, which is the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>argeſt, at the nuptials of an elector, a very magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent tournament was held. The aſcent from the Emperor's court to the hall, is a flight of wide and beautiful red marble-ſteps. The hall is 118 feet long, and fifty-two wide. In it ſtands a ſtatue of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue made of one ſingle piece of porphyry; here is alſo a bath, conſiſting of a grotto, and three rooms, a muſeum, a chamber of curioſities, and a noble li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary.</p>
                  <p>In the muſeum are ſome hundred ſtatues and buſts of the old Roman emperors, with 500 other antiques, as lamps, inſcriptions, baſſo relievos, &amp;c. moſt of which were brought from Italy. Among other things to exerciſe curioſity, is a ſmall ſtatue of braſs, weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeventy odd pounds, and yet hardly to be lifted by the ſtrongeſt man, unleſs he places himſelf ſo as
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0161700110:12"/>
to give it a certain equilibrium, but by advancing the left foot before the ſtatue, it is ſo eaſily managed, as to be lifted up, without any effect, by a ſingle fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger put into the hole. In the Elector's treaſury, ſhewn by his firſt gentlemen of the bed-chamber, are a number of valuable articles, that have but few equals in all Europe, as, 1. A hill with a caſtle on it, all of oriental pearls. 2. Several veſſels of green jaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. 3. A cabinet of many large pieces of chryſtal work; among the reſt, a ſhip, ſome ſpans long, the pilot, and all the tackling of the pureſt gold. 4. A large lagule bowl. 5. Patterns of a gold ſervice of the fineſt gold, for three large tables, and in mort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage at Auſburg. 6. A ruby, as large as a walnut. 7. <hi>St. George,</hi> on horſeback, cut from a fine piece of red agate, his armour of diamonds, ſet in gold. 8. A double brilliant diamond, the ſize of a middling nut. 9. A larger, which coſt 100,000 guilders. 10. A ſet of buttons and loops of diamonds, with rubies ſet between. 11. A like ſet of diamonds only, the but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons of exceeding beauty, and in ſize not inferior to thoſe which were worn by <hi>Lewis</hi> XIV. when he gave public audience to the Perſian Ambaſſador, and of a ſuperior luſtre to the French, having been twenty years in collecting, and at an incredible ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence. 12. The images of the Bavarian family, in blue chalcedony. 13. An ivory cloſet, of uncommon curious workmanſhip, containing 1144 gold Roman medals.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="10" facs="tcp:0161700110:13"/>Near a wall in one of the palace courts, is a large black ſtone, with the following inſcription on it, "In 1409, the illuſtrious Duke <hi>Chriſtopher,</hi> the renowned hero of Bavaria, lifted this large ſtone, weighing 340 lb. and threw it to ſome diſtance." A Bavarian country girl ſome few years ſince raiſed this ſtone a hand high from the ground. Near the ſame place are alſo three iron nails driven into the wall, with this inſcription: "Let every leaper behold with wonder theſe three nails; the firſt of which is twelve feet from the ground, and indicates a leap of the noble Duke <hi>Chriſtopher;</hi> the ſecond nail, which is ten feet and a half, was reached by <hi>Zundritt;</hi> the third, though but nine feet and a half, ſhews the activity of <hi>Philip Springer.</hi> He who can outdo theſe leaps, let him try."</p>
                  <p>Count <hi>Preiſing,</hi> maſter of the horſe, has built op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to the palace, a hotel, the four ſides of which anſwer to ſo many ſtreets, and is a great ornament to the city. The pillars of his ſtable are red marble, and every horſe feeds out of a particular marble of twenty-five guilders value.</p>
                  <p>The cathedral church of our lady has two large towers, contains twenty-five chapels, thirty altars, and twenty-four large columns. Not far from one of the doors, is a ſtone, with a mark on it; and to him who ſtands there, the multitude of pillars takes away the ſight of every window of the church, of courſe the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0161700110:14"/>
church is rather dark. It has a large organ of box wood, and a ſtately black marble monument of the Emperor <hi>Lewis,</hi> of Bavaria, with ſix large, and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral leſſer ſtatues of braſs.</p>
                  <p>The palace and other electoral buildings, together with the brew-houſes, 16 monaſteries, churches, and other religious ſtructures, take up near half of the city; the precinct of the Auguſtines alone, conſiſts of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſtreets, which bring them in an annual rent of 3000 guilders.</p>
                  <p>The Elector's court is very numerous and ſplendid. The late elector had thirty-ſix lords of the bed-cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, (I am ſpeaking now from <hi>Keyſler,</hi> who was there about ſixty years ago). The ſame elector kept 1200 or 1400 horſes; his ſucceſſor was contented with 700, but ſixty-five footmen are kept in conſtant pay. At the court of Bavaria, from its numerous family and alliances with the Imperial houſe, there are no leſs than thirty-three ſtate feſtivals, and theſe are increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing; but at the feſtival of <hi>Corpus Chriſti,</hi> there is a proceſſion of ſeveral thouſand perſons; deputies of all trades and handicrafts aſſiſt at it, with coſtly flags carried before them; the ſame is done alſo by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious orders, every member of which joins the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion. All manner of religious hiſtories are exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited on a great number of triumphal cars, by child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, richly dreſſed. At the head of their reſpective
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0161700110:15"/>
fraternities, ride St. <hi>George</hi> and St. <hi>Maurice,</hi> in Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man habits. St. <hi>Maurice</hi> is repreſented by a young lady, in the attire of a Roman veſtal, leading after her a large dragon, in which two men are encloſed, to give it the neceſſary movements. The four men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicant orders precede the venerable hoſt, carried un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a ſplendid canopy. Immediately after rides the Elector in perſon, and his conſort on his left, both holding a lighted taper. Next to the Electreſs comes her maſter of the houſhold, followed by ſome court ladies, and after theſe, the whole court, dreſſed after the Spaniſh faſhion. The ſtreets are boarded, ſtrew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with flowers and herbs, and the proceſſion laſts an hour and a half.</p>
                  <p>The late elector was immoderately fond of hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the electreſs was ſo fond of him, that ſhe entered into the ſpirit of his amuſement. She ſhot very well, and at hunting, made nothing of tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pling up to her knees in a moraſs. Her dreſs was a green coat, and a little fair wig. She was extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fond of dogs, particularly the Engliſh grey-hounds, they were always with her in her beſt apartment, and ſurrounded her in bed and at table. At their hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeat, the electreſs's bed-chamber was under the elector's, had a kennel in one corner, and a much larger one in a fine cloſet adjoining. The complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the court ladies viſibly ſuffered from their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance on her in all weathers. There goes a ſtory,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0161700110:16"/>
that <hi>Lewis</hi> XIV. ſaid, jeſting, to Baron <hi>Freybzerg,</hi> the Elector's great huntſman, which is a ſtate officer in Bavaria, concerning a bitch, which the Elector parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly valued; "I am told your bitch often loſes ſcent of the game," to which the Baron, piqued at a reflection on the flower of his pack, warmly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, "How!—She's as true as the goſpel."</p>
                  <p>They have here a remedy for the bite of a mad dog, which the late elector himſelf often made uſe of with ſucceſs for his officers, and once for one of the chief princeſſes of the court, <hi>viz.</hi> to make the patient eat the raw liver of the dog that did the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief.</p>
                  <p>The chapel of the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> is finiſhed with every ſpecies of riches, ſuch as gold, ſilver, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſtones; nor does it want for its ſhare of relicks, for the religious pretend to have a good part of the ſkirt of the mohair gown which the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> wore, when <hi>Chriſt</hi> was crucified!—Be this at it may, yet it is certain, the moſt profound veneration is paid to this choice piece of an old garment.</p>
                  <p>In the largeſt market-place ſtands a marble pillar, with a braſs ſtatue of the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> upon it, and two large fountains on each ſide; fronting of which is the town-houſe, a very elegant building, with a great number of hieroglific paintings on the front.</p>

                     <pb n="14" facs="tcp:0161700110:17"/>This city is ſaid to contain 40,000 inhabitants, moſt of which are Roman-catholics; and although very polite in manners and addreſs, yet very ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, and are led into many errors, by the art of the Friars, who are too numerous for the ſize of this place.</p>
                  <p>Of the general maxims or leading principles of the people of this court, we can ſay but little. Immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate ſelf-intereſt is apparently the purſuit of every one; or if they do profeſs any principles, they are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the moſt pliant and verſatile in the world. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, if we may judge by the way of thinking of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriors, many of the principal people have adopted the moſt execrable theory in politics; for inſtance, that religion ſerves only for the purpoſe of keeping the crowd of mankind ſlaves to them. That a cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier muſt put on the externals of religion, but leave the practice to the vulgar. That men are by nature wicked, ſeditious, turbulent, and only to be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by being kept in perpetual ſervitude, and not being permitted to uſe their faculties. Finally, that too much knowledge is dangerous, and that the great hold their rights over their people from God, and are no ways accountable for their conduct, nor under any obligation to their ſubjects. Every thing here is venal.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="15" facs="tcp:0161700110:18"/>A few years ago, a certain miniſter of this court would have ſold half Bavaria to the houſe of Auſtria, if the Pruſſian and Ruſſian courts, and the miniſter of the court of Deux-Ponts, had not prevented the purchaſe.</p>
                  <p>In every project propoſed, a ſmall part only is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for any good purpoſe; the greater part has the intereſt of the projector in view.</p>
                  <p>Every thing here is calculated for ſhew<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and as a ſpecimen, the court keeps a great admiral for two or three veſſels on the Rhine. The army conſiſts of thirty regiments, although not above 15,000 ſtrong, and the fourth of theſe are officers, amongſt which are ſeveral general field-marſhals.</p>
                  <p>The titles and embroidered cloaths of the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants (ſays <hi>Reiſbec</hi>) by no means ſecure a ſtranger from their begging from him; the following anec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dote, from that author, we ſhall lay before our read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers:—"One day (ſays he) I went to ſee the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome jeſuit church, where that I might not appear an idle ſpectator, I knelt down by ſome people in a pew; immediately a man, whom, by his dreſs, I ſuppoſed to be a perſon of conſequence, moved nearer to me, and preſenting me with a pinch of ſnuff, and prefacing his intentions, with a few re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks on the beauty of the building, then entered
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0161700110:19"/>
into a detail of his neceſſities and requeſted charity! The ſame thing happened to me at another church, where the beggar was a well dreſſed woman."</p>
                  <p>Here there are no pains taken to correct the people from their inclination to theft and robbery, by good education, improved morals, and encouragement to induſtry. Sumptuous places of public amuſements, expenſive collections of curioſities, palaces, gardens, and innumerable ſwarms of glittering ſervants, are the only faſhionable errors to be acquired. Prieſts, and the frail ſiſterhood, lead the higher claſſes into all the ſlaviſh ſhackles of vice, folly, and exceſs. Or, in the words of <hi>Reiſbec,</hi> "ſince the time that a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puchined daemon has had ſufficient influence in the direction of the Bavarian politics, to miſlead the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, little elſe than anarchy and confuſion have pervaded the political ſyſtem of this ſtate."</p>
                  <p>A picture of the Bavarian character and manners, by <hi>Hogarth,</hi> was he now living, would be extremely intereſting. Great ſingularity of character is often to be met with in England; but what Bavaria offers, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds any thing to be ſeen elſewhere.</p>
                  <p>The Bavarian men in general are ſtout bodied, muſcular and fleſhy. The women extremely hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, well ſhaped, and lively in converſation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="17" facs="tcp:0161700110:20"/>The characteriſtic, ſays <hi>Reiſbec,</hi> of a Bavarian man, is a very thick round head, a little peaked chin, a large belly, and a pale complexion. Many of them look like caricatures of man, they have great fat bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, ſhort clubbed feet, narrow ſhoulders, and ſhort necks. They are heavy and aukward in their carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, and their ſmall eyes betray a great deal of rogue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. The women are ſome of the moſt beautiful crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in the world, rather groſs, but their ſkin ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes all the carnation ever uſed by painters, the pureſt lily white is ſoftly tinged with purple, as if by the hands of the graces. Some of the peaſant girls have ſuch clear complexions, as to appear quite tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent. They are well ſhaped, and more lively and graceful in their geſtures than the men. The pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants wives, of Weild, eight leagues from Munich, wear broad felt hats or bonnets, with a ſmall knob behind, towards the neck, no bigger than a walnut. On holidays, the maids of the principal inns and public-houſes at Munich, wear about their necks, a ſilver chain, of three rows, and their breaſts are alſo laced with two ſuch other chains; a piece of finery, that coſts them fifty guilders.</p>
                  <p>In the capital, they dreſs in the French ſtyle, or, at leaſt, they imagine that they do ſo, for the men are ſtill too fond of gold and mixed colours. The coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try gentry, dreſs without any taſte at all. The chief ornament of the men, is a long, broad waiſtcoat,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0161700110:21"/>
ſtrangely embroidered, from which their breeches hang very low and looſe, probably to give free play to their bellies, which is the chief part of a Bavarian. The women diſguiſe themſelves with a ſort of ſtays in the ſhape of a funnel, which cover the breaſt and ſhoulders, ſo as to hide the whole neck. This ſtiff dreſs is covered with ſilver beads, and thickly overlaid with ſilver chains. In many places the houſewife has a bunch of keys and a knife, appendant to a girdle, which reach almoſt to the ground.</p>
                  <p>As to the characters and manners of the Bavarians, the inhabitants of the capital naturally differ very much from the country people. The manners of the people of Munich are corrupt, as muſt be the caſe with 40,000 men, depending entirely upon a court's growing generally idle at its expence.</p>
                  <p>Among the great nobles here met with, as well as elſewhere, there are ſome very well-bred and polite perſons, but the people in general, taking the words in their full extent, are in a high degree deſtitute of every ſenſe of honour, without education, without any attachment to the conſtitution, or generous feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whatever. The fortunes of this place are from 1500 to three or four thouſand pounds a year, but the poſſeſſors know no other uſe for their money, than to ſpend it in ſenſual gratifications. Many good houſes have been ruined by play. The faſhionable
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0161700110:22"/>
game at court was formerly called <hi>zwicken,</hi> or <hi>perich,</hi> but ſince <hi>Hambeſch,</hi> the miniſter of Finance, has pinched their ſalaries ſo much, they call it <hi>hambeſch.</hi> Many of the court ladies know no other employ, than playing with their parrots, their dogs, or their cats. One of the principal ladies, whom I was acquainted with, ſays Baron <hi>Reiſbec,</hi> kept a hall full of cats, and two or three maids to attend them; ſhe converſed half the day long with them, often ſerved them herſelf with coffee and ſugar, and dreſſed them, according to her fancy, differently every day.</p>
                  <p>The little nobleſſe and ſervants of the court, have ſuch a paſſion for titles, as is to be pitied. Before the preſent Elector came here, the place ſwarmed with excellencies, honourable and right honourable. The Emperor made an order to aſcertain the different ranks of nobleſſe; all thoſe whom it deprived of titles, and, particularly the women, ſunk into de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair, and, for the firſt time, complaints were made of tyranny, of which none before ſeemed to have any conception.</p>
                  <p>The remainder of the inhabitants are immerſed in the moſt ſcandalous debauch; every night the ſtreets re-echo with the noiſe of drunkards, iſſuing from the numerous taverns, where they have open revelling and dancing. Whoever is at all noble here, muſt keep his miſtreſs, and the reſt indulge in promiſcuous
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0161700110:23"/>
love. In this reſpect, things are not much better in the country; ſo that Bavaria well deſerves the charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter given of it, by an officer of Gaſcony, of being the greateſt brothel in the world.</p>
                  <p>The country people are extremely dirty; a few miles diſtant from the capital, one would hardly take the hovels of the peaſants for the habitations of men. Many of them have large puddles before their doors, and are obliged to ſtep over planks into them. The thatched roofs of the country, in many parts of France; have a much better appearance than the wretched huts of the Bavarian peaſants, the roofs of which are covered with ſtones, in order that the ſlates may not be carried away by the wind. Mean as this looks; cheap as nails are here, and often as half the roof are torn away by ſtrong winds, yet cannot the rich far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer be perſuaded to nail his ſhingles properly toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. In ſhort, from the court to the ſmalleſt cottage, indolence is the moſt predominant part of the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the Bavarian.</p>
                  <p>As I ſtrolled, continues the ſame author, through the country, I ſhuddered at the ſight of the ravages which war had made. There is no town of any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance throughout all Bavaria, but the capital. You would never imagine what pitiful little holes Landſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg, Waſſerberg, Landſhut, and many other places are, which make a great figure in the map. To al
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0161700110:24"/>
appearance, neither Ingoldſtadt nor Shaubingen, or any of the greater towns, except Munich, contains above 4000 people. Excepting the brewer, baker, and innkeeper, you may ſeek in vain for a rich tradeſman. There is not a veſtige of induſtry either in town or country, but every body ſeems to conſider idleneſs and beggary as the happieſt ſtate of man.</p>
                  <p>The country people and farmers are divided into four claſſes; into whole, half, and quarter-farmers, and into thoſe called <hi>hauſler.</hi> The whole farmers plough with eight horſes, and are termed <hi>einliedler,</hi> that is, hermits, becauſe their farm-houſes are at a diſtance from any cottage. Many of theſe farm-houſes command a territory of three miles in length and breadth, and the owners employ from ten to fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen horſes in their tillage, reckoning two horſes to every plough. Of ſuch farmers, there may be about 40,000. A half-farmer ploughs with four, and a quarter-farmer, with two horſes. The <hi>hauſler</hi> are day labourers to the reſt, and till their bit of property with cattle belonging to others. Having no idea of meadow land or ſtall-food for cattle, the farmers ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe their ignorance and inattention to it, by pleading the want of manure. In a word, both court and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſeem blind to their own intereſt, and a ſlothful indolence pervades the whole nation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="22" facs="tcp:0161700110:25"/>This great indolence is contraſted in an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary manner, with a ſtill higher degree of bigotry, as was before obſerved, and a ſtory of the facetious baron will exemplify the appellation. "I happened (ſays he) to ſtroll into a dark, filthy beer houſe, in the outlets of Munich, where, on my entrance, I beheld a cloud of ſmoke, but as ſoon as the vapour was a little cleared, I could diſcern a loud company of the lower order of the people headed by a drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en prieſt. His black coat was bedaubed with greaſe and filth, having many appertures in its fabrick, and, in either hand, emblems of his devotion, that is to ſay, cards in the one, and a jug of ale in the other. After the aſſembly were tolerably plied with ſtrong drink, the ſun-ſhine of conviviality gave way to the ſtorms of inebriety, and pots, bottles, and glaſſes flew thick at each others heads. Preſently the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bell rang for prayers, when off went their bonnets, and down fell the company on their knees, repeating <hi>Ave Maria, Pater noſter, &amp;c.</hi> After prayers, they aroſe, with determined reſolution, to end the diſpute by the aid of mugs and glaſſes, upon which I thought it high time to decamp, as I foreſaw there might be danger to be within reach of the things in motion; and perceiving the prieſt took a lower ſeat, as he thruſt in his weighty carcaſe, under the table, for ſhelter, leaſt one of the bottles ſhould come in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tact with his noddle."</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="23" facs="tcp:0161700110:26"/>The ſame ſcenes occur in the inland towns among the citizens, officers, clergymen, and ſtudents. They all ſalute each other with abuſive language, all vie in hard drinking, and cloſe to every church, there is regularly a brew-houſe and a brothel. A ſtudent of the univerſity of Ingoldſtadt, muſt carry a thick cud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, and wear a neat cut hat, he muſt be able to drink from eight to ten quarts of beer at a ſitting, and be always ready to fight, right or wrong, with the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of the garriſon. No pen, continues <hi>Reiſbec,</hi> can deſcribe the ridiculous mixtures of debauchery and devotion, which every day happen. The moſt notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous is that which took place in the church of St. <hi>Mary Oettingen,</hi> a few years ſince, when a prieſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually deflowered a girl whom he had long purſued, and could only make a prize of there, before the altar of the Virgin.</p>
                  <p>The country people join to their indolence and devotion a certain ferocity of temper, which often gives riſe to bloody ſcenes; when they mean to praiſe a church holiday, or ſome public feſtival, which has lately been kept, they ſay.—It was a charming day, there were ſix or eight perſons killed, and many bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken legs and arms. If no accident happened, they call it a fiddle-faddle buſineſs, a mere nothing. In the beginning of this century, the Bavarian troops maintained the firſt reputation among the German forces. At the battle of Hochſtadt, they kept their

There have been inſtances of oppoſing the military, under bold leaders, to the very laſt man. But the pooreſt peaſants conſider it as a hardſhip to be drafted into the regular troops of his prince.</p>
                  <p>The inhabitants of the capital are very timid and ſubſervient, but the unadulterated Bavarian peaſant is groſs, fat, dirty, lazy, drunken and undiſciplined, economical and patriotic, yet he is brave, and ſuch a ſlave to his word, that when he has once given it, it is never to be broken. The imitative zeal is ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly ſtrong in theſe people, for whatever character the Elector aſſumes, from the higheſt to the loweſt, they are religiouſly devoted to its obſervance.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="25" facs="tcp:0161700110:28"/>It is the religious contagion only that unfits the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of this circle, from thoſe proper exerciſes in life, that could tend to the advancement both of their credit and fortune. Monks are the directors of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral concerns as well as ſpiritual diſcipline. They alone are to be thanked for that wildneſs of manners uſual among the Bavarians. Their cowls contain the eſſence of chriſtianity and all morality. They preach nothing but maſſes, which are profitable to them, and the roſary, the ſcapulaire, and ridiculous morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the body, are the means by which many blockheads have got the name of ſaints.</p>
                  <p>Thus the deceived layman believes, that confeſſion and a maſs, which only coſts fifteen pence, will wipe away the fouleſt ſins, and conſiders the telling of his beads, as the moſt eſſential duty of this life.</p>
                  <p>The ſecular prieſts are as few in number, as the monks are many. Theſe ought naturally to form the manners of the country; but they are held in much leſs veneration than the others, becauſe their dreſs and appearance is not ſo extraordinary. In Bavaria, however, they do not deſerve more reſpect than the monks, for though their pariſhes are four miles in compaſs, and producing from four to 600l. a year, the greater part of them differ only from the peaſants, by wearing a black coat, keeping a more expenſive table, and a handſomer and better dreſſed houſe-keeper:
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0161700110:29"/>
In other things they are equally lazy, unlearned and ignorant.</p>
                  <p>The air of this electorate is conſidered as very ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lubrious, for, notwithſtanding the inconſiderate mode of living purſued by the generality of people here, few die of epidemical diſtempers; health and longe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity being the diſtinguiſhed characteriſtics of this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured country.</p>
                  <p>Near Munich is a town called Reichen-hall, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable for its curious ſalt ſpring, the water of which worked by a mill, has a wheel thirty-ſix feet in diameter, which, by means of a chain-pump, raiſes the fluid into a reſervoir, and thence into pipes for the diſtance of fifteen Engliſh miles, over a lofty mountain, to a ſalt-houſe, where fuel is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, and there it is boiled. On the mountains over which it paſſes, there are little houſes, at proper diſtances, in order to throw the water higher; for the conveyance alſo of a ſtrong freſh ſpring uſed in turning the wheels and other engines, and likewiſe for carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off any ſuperfluous ſalt water, there is a moſt aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing and durable aqueduct of ſquare flints, three Engliſh miles in length, and five feet broad, with an arched roof, being made upwards of 300 years, at a vaſt expence. It is in many places overlaid with hard roſin. After running to a depth of twelve fathoms un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

the town, and from thence under the gardens and fields, it at laſt ejects the water in a ſtrong torrent.</p>
                  <p>This aqueduct is in general between three and four feet in depth, and runs ſo ſwiftly, that in a boat, with torches, one may ſail from one end to the other in about a quarter of an hour. In order to proceed on this ſubterraneous voyage, there is a deſcent, by means of a ſunk tower. There are five apertures in the form of towers, through each of which a perſon may ſpeak from the ramparts of the tower with thoſe who ſail on the canal.</p>

                     <p>The church of the abbey dedicated to St. <hi>Emmeran,</hi> is a very ſtately as well as ancient building, erected A. D. 649. This building is ſaid to contain many adored relicks, but the moſt material is, that of the whole body and limbs of <hi>Dionyſius,</hi> the Areopagite,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0161700110:32"/>
except the middle finger of his right hand, which the palace chapel of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> at Munich, carefully retains, rolled up in a piece of the Virgin <hi>Mary's</hi> mohair gown, already mentioned.</p>
                     <p>The authenticity of this relick has been confirmed by Pope <hi>Leo</hi> XI. but notwithſtanding this, the monks of St. <hi>Denys,</hi> near Paris, inſiſt that the body of this Saint is actually in their poſſeſſion, and his head is ſhewn in the third ſhrine of their treaſury. His head is alſo devoutly worſhipped in the cathedral of Bam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg, and at Prague another head is kept in the church of St. <hi>Vitus</hi> in the caſtle. The monks of St. <hi>Emme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran</hi> ſay, this relick was purloined from the abbey of St. <hi>Denys</hi> in France.</p>
                     <p>This free Imperial city contains five different ſtates within its circuit, namely, the cathedral of Ratiſbon, the Imperial abbey of St. <hi>Emmeran,</hi> the Lower Min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, the Upper Minſter, and the city itſelf. The ladies in the Upper and Lower Minſter, live in a free manner, and are under little or no reſtraint in theſe two abbeys. They go abroad when they pleaſe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive viſits from gentlemen, appear at balls in the city, and generally ſtay till the laſt dance, and that no liberty may be wanting to indulge their deſires, they have always the privilege of quitting the abbey by marrying. The abbeſſes avoid public aſſemblies as
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0161700110:33"/>
if they were princeſſes, becauſe the envoys ladies will not allow them the honour of precedence.</p>
                     <p>There is a convent here in which Roman-catholics only are admitted, that are natives of Scotland, and thoſe of the greateſt abilities are ſelected from the reſt, and ſent as miſſionaries to their native country. There is alſo ſuch a ſeminary at Wurtſburg, and another at Erfurt. In the hoſpital of St. <hi>Catherine,</hi> the proteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants have a chapel, where a Lutheran miniſter preaches every Monday, which is not tolerated in any other part of Bavaria. The perſons received into this hoſpital are half proteſtants and half Roman-catholics.</p>
                     <p>As Ratiſbon is where the diet of the empire meets, one would ſuppoſe, that the number of envoys from the different princes, who conſtantly reſide here, would give life to the place. No.—Every thing is dull and dead. If it was not for the Prince of Thurn, who is the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror's principal commiſſary, one would not believe the town to be the ſeat of the diet; but this gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, whoſe income is about 40,000l. a year, gives operas, comedies, wild beaſt bailings, balls, and fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works. The reſt of the ambaſſadors, on account of the ſmallneſs of their incomes, are obliged to live very economically, and many of them go about in hackney coaches. As every thing for their uſe comes into the city duty free, the people of the place make heavy complaints of their ſervants for carrying on a
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0161700110:34"/>
large contraband trade. Indeed they conceive that what they loſe by this, is more than an equivalent for what they gain by the diet in other reſpects. The fact is, that the ambaſſadors, from the greateſt pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, who have large incomes, and ſeem to be paid for holding great ſtate, hold none; and as the other miniſters regulate themſelves by their example, one may be ſeveral weeks in town, without knowing that the diet is aſſembled.</p>
                     <p>The buſineſs of the diet is very tedious, owing to the prevalence of party on all great occaſions. The diet, as has been obſerved, conſiſts of three colleges, the electoral, the prince's, and the ſtates. All aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in a hall to receive the Emperor's propoſitions, thence they retire to ſeparate apartments to diſcuſs the buſineſs. The majority decides in each chamber, and ſo does the majority of the three colleges, as to the determination of the whole. When they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, it is laid before the Emperor, or his prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal commiſſary. The firſt college has nine voices; the ſecond one hundred; and that of the ſtates fifty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one.</p>
                     <p>The Imperial court has great influence in all the three colleges. The three eccleſiaſtical electors have been almoſt conſtantly creatures of the Emperor, who ſpares neither gold threats nor promiſes to inſpire the canons of Mentz, Treves, and Cologne, in the choice
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0161700110:35"/>
of a new archbiſhop. The Emperor has the ſame weight in the college of princes; almoſt all the eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical princes are his true ſons; beſides, it has always been the maxim of the Imperial court to raiſe the members of the hereditary dominion, who poſſeſſed the ſmalleſt fief in the empire, to the dignity of princes, in order to give them a ſeat in the diet. In the college of towns or ſtates, he rules almoſt without controul, for as theſe are almoſt all encompaſſed by moſt powerful princes, they require the particular pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of the court of Vienna, to prevent their being totally cruſhed. But it being enacted, that the majority in the Imperial colleges ſhall not be deciſive either in religion or thoſe matters, in which the ſtates could not be conſidered as one body, or where the catholics are of one, and the proteſtants of another opinion; in ſuch caſes the colleges divide into parties, and how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſmall in number one party may be, its decree is held equal to the other more numerous one. Thus the Emperor is ſometimes oppoſed by the proteſtants, and the Roman-catholics have found a benefit in it. Though Saxony has the apparent government of the proteſtant party, the King of Pruſſia's power is got to that pitch as to be at the head of the party, and he often proteſts vehemently againſt things in which religion is not the leaſt concerned.</p>
                     <p>The principal Imperial commiſſioner who is at the head of the diet, by virtue of his office, takes place
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0161700110:36"/>
of all the emperors, ambaſſadors, and others, except only the envoy from the court of Rome, being here the repreſentation of the head of the German empire. He returns no viſits, nor does he give the title of <hi>Excellence</hi> to any of the envoys, not even to thoſe of the electors. When an envoy from an electoral prince pays him a viſit, he orders him to be received at his coach-door by four gentlemen, two pages and a har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binger, and meets him at the door of the ſecond anti-chamber, walking back, a little before, on the right hand of the envoy. The ſame ſuperiority he aſſumes in reconducting him. His audience chair is under a canopy, on which is the Emperor's picture. His annual income is 24,000 guilders, paid out of the Imperial treaſury, and 12,000 out of the Emperor's privy purſe, that is about 4200l. ſterling.</p>
                     <p>The envoys of Ratiſbon, as repreſentatives of elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, &amp;c. have very lofty ideas of their office, and aſſume ſuch ſtate, that when the widow of Duke <hi>Frederick Henry,</hi> of Saxe Zeitz, a princeſs of the Houſe of Holſtein Wieſenburg, came to pay a viſit to the Cardinal <hi>Saxe Zeitz,</hi> her brother-in-law; her highneſs could appear but very ſeldom in public company, becauſe the ladies of the electoral envoys claimed the precedency of her. If ſovereign German princes at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the diet themſelves, they ſit above all the envoys of other princes, except thoſe of Auſtria, Burgun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and Saltzburg, who have maintained the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0161700110:37"/>
by preſcription. It is on account of theſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes about precedency, that the Holſtein envoys never attend any of the ſeſſions.</p>
                     <p>All the envoys receive preſents of wine, fiſh, &amp;c. from the city on their firſt arrival, and the Imperial commiſſary, a much larger one. In the college the envoys ſit with their hats on, but uncover themſelves when they ſpeak.</p>
                     <p>I have already obſerved, that the envoys having every article for their conſumption, duty free, is a diſadvantage to the city. Theſe envoys are numerous, and they each give a great number of protections. Some will have, in general, forty or fifty perſons in their retinue, none of whom either pay duty, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributions, imports, or any of the common city-taxes, though ſome at the ſame time will keep ſhops and carry on trade. Under this ſanction, coachmen and lacqueys ſet up public-houſes, and draw yearly ſome hundreds of hogſheads of beer, which, as they pretend, are all of his excellency's houſehold. It is the ſame with regard to wine, which theſe pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileged publicans import clear of all duty. So that they may eaſily underſell the fair trader. The quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of proviſions brought over the bridge, on the Danube, in ſeven days, with permits for the uſe of the envoys, frequently amounts to 1800 or 2000 guilders.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="35" facs="tcp:0161700110:38"/>As the Danube directs its courſe from Ratiſbon to Vienna, it gains this city an advantageous opportunity of ſending there, wheat, wood, and ſeveral kinds of proviſions. The diſtance between theſe two cities is about 200 miles, and yet the common people pay no more for their paſſing down the river, than a creutz or a farthing a mile, ſo that the whole fare, at this rate, does not exceed four or five ſhillings. <hi>Keyſler</hi> ſays two ſhillings and four-pence. This cheap way of travelling induces great numbers of young artificers and handicraftſmen to go and try their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune at Vienna; but they do not find it ſo eaſy to return home, as they generally ſpend what they earn by their trades, and are often obliged to enliſt for ſoldiers.</p>

                     <head>ARCHBISHOPRIC OF SALTZBURG.</head>
                     <p>On the eaſt, this biſhopric is bounded by Auſtria and Stiria; by Corinthia and the Tyrol on the ſouth; and by Bavaria on the weſt and on the north. Its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent from eaſt to weſt is about five and twenty Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man miles, and from north to ſouth, in ſome parts, ſixteen, and in others, five and twenty.</p>
                     <p>The country is defended on all ſides by mountains and narrow paſſes, or rather conſiſts entirely of moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains and vallies. No manner of grain being ſown here, it is ſupplied with all its corn from Bavaria;
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0161700110:39"/>
but every part of it produces hay of a peculiar good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and this proves a fund for breeds of excellent cattle. The horſes in particular are eſteemed for their beauty, hardineſs and vigour, being able to travel full ſpeed up the higheſt mountains, and that ſupported by no other food than hay and graſs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any oats.</p>
                     <p>In this archbiſhopric are ſix cities and twenty-five towns. All the peaſants are allowed the uſe of fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arms, and are from their earlieſt youth trained up to ſhooting at a mark, and practiſing military exerciſes. The nobility were formerly very numerous, but the policy of the princes ſet ſo many ſprings at work to oppreſs and exterminate them, that at preſent there is not one remaining, and their eſtates are in the hands of the church. With reſpect to the few no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles at court, or belonging to the cathedral, they are all foreigners, ſome Auſtrians, ſome Bohemians, and others from Bavaria. Though the Roman catholic worſhip is the only one tolerated, yet at the time of the reformation, Lutheraniſm was embraced by great numbers. So late as the year 1732, permiſſion was granted to the Lutheran Saltzburgers to leave the country, and take their property with them; accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly above 30,000 perſons accepted this indulgence, and diſperſed themſelves in the other proteſtant coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries of Germany, Pruſſia, and even in the Engliſh colonies in America. In all which places they were
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0161700110:40"/>
received with that benevolence and encouragement which their magnanimity deſerved; and ever ſince that time, theſe emigrations have continued.</p>
                     <p>His revenues are eſtimated by <hi>Keyſler</hi> at 800,000 rix-dollars; <hi>Buſching</hi> affirms they are not leſs than between three and four millions of guilders. <hi>Reiſbec</hi> on the contrary ſays, they are not above 120,000l. which is leſs than <hi>Keyſler</hi> makes them; as eight hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand rix-dollars, at three ſhillings and ſix-pence each, makes above 200,000l. But according to <hi>Buſching</hi> reckoning the guilder at two ſhillings and four-pence, which is the average of the German guilder, the income then would be near 400,000l.</p>
                     <p>The extent of the country is eſtimated at two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and forty German ſquare miles. There are only ſeven or eight towns, ſays <hi>Reiſbec,</hi> ſome of which are not to be compared with a Suabian village. The total number of inhabitants is computed at two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty thouſand. There is only one manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture in the whole country, which is a ſmall one at Hallein for cotton ſtockings and night-caps.</p>
                     <p>The inhabitants live chiefly by breeding cattle. In many places you may find very rich farmers, who own from ſixty to fourſcore head of great cattle. They export ſome cheeſe and butter, but not ſo much as they might do, if the inhabitants were as induſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0161700110:41"/>
frugal, and diſpoſed for trade as the Swiſs. Beſides horned cattle, they alſo breed great numbers of horſes, which are very ſtrong, and are exported to great diſtances for the purpoſe of heavy draught and burthen.</p>
                     <p>The ſalt-works at Hallein are without compariſon the moſt conſiderable. The internal parts of the mountain which is about four miles diſtant from this place, conſiſt of cryſtals of ſalt, mixed with a great deal of earth. In order to clean it, they dig large, hollow chambers within ſide, and fill them with water, which waſhes the ſalt, and lets the earth ſink to the bottom. The water thus impregnated, is conveyed into pens and boiled off. In courſe of time the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers fill, of themſelves, with ſalt, and the treaſure is inexhauſtible. One of theſe chambers, when lighted, makes the prettieſt ſight in the world. Conceive to yourſelf a hall about a hundred feet ſquare, the walls and ground of which are compoſed of cryſtal of every earthly colour, and which reflect the light ſo wonderfully, that you would think yourſelf in ſome enchanted palace. In order to carry on this work, the woods of the foreſts along the Saltza and other rivers is floated down them.</p>
                     <p>From the unfavourable ſituation of this country, it cannot uſe the whole of this treaſure for itſelf, but is obliged to give the moſt part to foreigners. All
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0161700110:42"/>
the country round about belongs either to Auſtria or to Bavaria. In Auſtria they have ſalt ſufficient for their own uſe, and have prohibited the importation of foreign ſalt. Bavaria, on the other hand, has ſo productive a ſalt work at Ratiſbon, that it not only provides ſufficient for that country, but alſo can af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford a conſiderable quantity to foreigners. The arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of Bavaria have conſequently found them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves obliged to enter into an agreement with the Dukes of Bavaria, by virtue of which theſe take a certain quantity of ſalt every year, at a very mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate price, with which they furniſh Switzerland and Suabia. By this means, the ſalt trade of Saltzburg is properly in the hands of Bavaria, which gains full three times as much by it as the Princes of Saltzburg. The value of the ſalt which Bavaria ſtipulates to take yearly, amounts to about 20,000l. What is diſpoſed of in the country itſelf, or carried clandeſtinely into Auſtria, makes in the whole about 35,000l. of which two thirds may be clear gain.</p>
                     <p>The gold and ſilver mines of this principality make a great figure in the geography of Germany; but compared with the ſalt-works, are not worth mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The roads through this mountainous country are not in general very good. Notwithſtanding, the paſſage is now and then on wooden bridges hung by chains over ſome dreadful abyſſes, the heavieſt car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages have nothing to fear, except, perhaps, the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0161700110:43"/>
being overſet by a violent blaſt of wind, or being co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by a fall of ſnow in the ſpring.</p>
                     <p>About ſix miles from Saltzburg there is a long nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row valley bounded by high mountains, which ſtretches itſelf ſome miles ſouthward and then weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. At the entrance of this valley is the paſs of Lueg or Luhk, a word, which in Engliſh means look, or watch-tower. This paſs is a deep narrow hollow between naked, and perpendicular rocks of granate, which hang over the road, on each ſide, to an amazing height, and between which the river Saltza runs like a torrent. Above the river a path has been cut along the ſide of a rock, and there is a gate with ſcarce room for a carriage to paſs, which is protected by a battery, ſo that a few people here could withſtand a whole army. The other approaches to this valley, which conſtitute the greateſt part of the principality of Saltzburg, are equally well guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and defended.</p>
                     <p>The country about Saltzburg forms a ſtriking con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traſt with the barren, deſolate wilds of Munich. For ſeventeen long miles, the diſtance between theſe two cities, there is no place of note, but the dark Waſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerburg, which ſtands on one of the barren ſand-hills, round which the river Inn winds. Near the frontiers of Saltzburg, the proſpects become varied, the habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0161700110:44"/>
of the peaſants appear nearer, and the cultiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the country improves.</p>
                     <p>Saltzburg is a fine city. The houſes are high and built with ſtone. The roofs are in the Italian taſte, and you may walk out upon them. Before the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace is a fountain, which paſſes for the fineſt in all Germany; the figures are all of white marble. The reſervoir is an hundred and ſeven feet in circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, four large horſes ſpout the water out of their mouths and noſtrils; the height of the whole work exceeds fifty feet, and is ſurmounted by a column of water, ſome inches in diameter, and eighteen feet high.</p>
                     <p>The palace is magnificent, abounding with fine pictures, tables of inlaid marble, and ſuperb ſtones of all colours, and ornamented with ſtatues: the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture has nothing remarkable; and though the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſtries are valuable on account of the gold and ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, yet age has deprived them of the greateſt part of their beauty. The meuſe is in three very long and high arched diviſions; the horſes, whoſe num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber amounts to a hundred and fifty, eat out of white marble mangers; and twice a week a running water is turned in through both ſides of the ſtalls, and carries away any filth which may have gathered there; the number of the Archbiſhop's horſes in the city, and at his country palaces, are ſaid to be two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0161700110:45"/>
and fifty. Over this ſtable is the fencing ſchool, and before it a pond for watering the horſes, ninety-three feet in length; within it ſtands a very large horſe, made of one piece of marble, with water guſhing out of his mouth.</p>
                     <p>The winter riding-ſchool is very lofty, placed with ſeats on both ſides of the walls, between the windows, for the accommodation of ſpectators of diſtinction, that the riders may not be incommoded in their exerciſes. The ſummer riding-ſchool, which alſo ſerves for baiting wild beaſts, is in the open air; it has three diſtinct galleries, one ſide of which are cut out of the rock.</p>
                     <p>In the cathedral all the altars are of beautiful mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of different kinds; under the cupola are four altars with an organ over each; the fifth and fineſt organ is over the chief entrance, and conſiſts of three thouſand two hundred and ſixty pipes, of which the longeſt is thirty-three feet; to this organ belong four keys and forty-two regiſters, of which ſeventeen are of clock-work. The roof of this church is covered with copper; the gallery between the cathedral and the palace, is of white marble; and nothing of the kind can make finer muſic, than the chimes of this cathedral.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="43" facs="tcp:0161700110:46"/>In St. Sebaſtian's church lies the famous Switzer, <hi>Theophraſtus Bompaſt,</hi> ſurnamed <hi>Paracelſus,</hi> of the greateſt puffers that ever lived, with the following oſtentatious epitaph:</p>
                     <p>

On the 24th September, 1741, he departed this life."</p>
                     <p>A little above the city, ſprings the Gaſtein bath, whoſe waters are very hot, and have a very ſtrong taſte of different minerals. They are ſaid to be a remedy for the ſtone, the venereal diſorder, and for the cholic, and this too only by bathing in them, without drinking them.</p>
                     <p>The city of Saltzburg is remarked for having the beſt accommodations for travellers of any city in Germany.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="44" facs="tcp:0161700110:47"/>The inhabitants in general appear very ſocial, open, and lively, and uncommonly attached to ſtrangers. Every thing in this city breathes the air of pleaſure and joy. They eat, drink, laugh, dance, ſing, and gamble in the extreme, nor is there any place when you can enjoy ſo many pleaſures for a little money. The people converſe upon religion and politics, with a freedom that does honour to the place, and with reſpect to books, all German publications may be had without the leaſt reſtraint.</p>
                     <p>The upper nobility of the place is made up chiefly of Auſtrian families, who diſtinguiſh themſelves by their affability, their knowledge of the world, and their manners. On the other hand, the ſwarm of little court gentry render themſelves ridiculous by their pitiful luſts after titles and their pride. You muſt viſit about a hundred of there <hi>Gnadige herren,</hi> which title, in German, means Gracious Sir, who live upon three or four hundred florins a year, which they receive from court, but whom you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not offend more than by calling them plain Sir, and their wives plain Madam. A man who lives here muſt accuſtom himſelf to put in <hi>Gnadige herren</hi> at every third word, unleſs he chooſes to paſs for being ill-bred. Moſt of them have neither eſtates nor mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; the court is therefore compelled to make their appointments as ſlender as poſſible, to keep them from ſtarving; though above two-thirds of them are
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0161700110:48"/>
ſuperfluous ſervants. Many of them amuſe themſelves with French and German literature, particularly with all that relates to the ſtage. The rage for the theatre here is very great, and they look for the coming of a company of ſtrolling players, with as much eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as the inhabitants of Siberia look for the return of the ſpring. Give this claſs of people their right titles, and you will find them the beſt kind of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures living.</p>
                     <p>The country people are uncommonly lively and gay. The young women of theſe ſequeſtered vales, freſh as roſes, and lively as a roe, underſtand the art of coquetry as well as any Pariſian lady, except that the allurements they diſplay are more natural; they know how to employ the ornamental part of dreſs to the beſt advantage If they are diſpoſed to make their lover happy, neither the ſhame of an illegiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate birth, nor the fear of being obliged to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it, is of any conſideration. Cuſtom ſets them above the firſt, and the eaſe of maintaining a child above the latter. Murder of infants here is extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uncommon, they all yield, without reſtraint or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, to the impulſe of nature. The young girls kiſs and ſhake hands in the open church on Sundays, with thoſe they love. On a nightly viſit, however, the lover is rather in a hard ſituation, for let the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be ever ſo unfriendly, he is not admitted, until a certain watch-word is given, which, in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0161700110:49"/>
conſiſts of long rhimes, that in a myſterious manner expreſs his ſufferings and his ſmart. This cuſtom is very old, and in many of the remote parts of the mountains, ſacred and inviolable.</p>
                     <p>The inhabitants of theſe mountains are ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, that they conſider their country as a kind of paradiſe. Thoſe who lived in Dintner valley, a fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful gap, between naked rocks, through which the river Dintner runs, have a ſaying, "That when any one falls from heaven, he muſt fall into Dintner val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley." Which is as much to ſay, that this valley is a ſecond heaven.</p>
                     <p>Many of the peaſants ſtill wear long beards, and go with their heads uncovered, and their breaſts open, at all ſeaſons of the year. As they are extremely hairy, and very much ſun-burnt, this gives them a very formidable look, but when you come near them, their friendly air and appearance of integrity ſpeak very ſtrongly in their favour. They are courageous and ſtrong, and would, no doubt, make a brave de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence in their own country; but out of it they are ſaid not to make good ſoldiers. Like all the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of mountains, they cannot ſtand a change of climate. Beſides the peculiarity of their diet, and which they muſt renounce in the field, their not being able to bear fatigue, makes them unfit for ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. Man reſembles his ſoil, unleſs education and
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0161700110:50"/>
ſociety change him. The peaſant of this country bears the ſtamp of nature upon him. His movements are quick, like the ſtream in the wood; he is boiſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous in his paſſions, like the atmoſphere; he breathes ſtrong as the oak which ſhades him; and is faithful, firm, and true, as the rock which bears his hut. The life and variety of the ſcenes which nature offers him here, render his head richer in conceptions, and his heart warmer than it would be, if he dwelt upon an uniform plain, and gave himſelf up to nature as he does here. His diſtance from populous cities, and the ſcattered ſituation of the huts, preſerve his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners pure, and make him more attentive to his own concerns.</p>
                     <p>Mountainous ſituations have, unqueſtionably, in many reſpects, a preference over the plains. The pulſe of nature beats ſtronger; every thing diſcovers more life and energy; every thing more loudly and emphatically ſpeaks an Almighty power at work. The ſtream which meanders through the plain, makes through the mountains, and grows impetuous in its courſe; the motion of the clouds, the revolutions of the ſky, and the peals of thunder, are all more ſtrongly animated. The vallies in the fair ſeaſon of the year, are filled with finer perfumes of flowers and herbs, than thoſe of the plains, whoſe ſoil is not ſo fit to preſerve their radical moiſture, and where their exhalations are diſſipated more widely in the air.
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0161700110:51"/>
Nature here is more varied, and infinitely more pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tureſque. Of her different ſhades, an inhabitant of the plain can form no conception. Here at once nature preſents the peculiarities of every ſeaſon, and the moſt diſtant climes. Whilſt the ſummer laſts, in the bottom of the valley is felt the heat of Africa; the middle of the mountain has the temperature of ſpring, and the top reminds you of Siberia.</p>
                     <p>This country is ſingularly intereſting to a botaniſt, or mineralogiſt; but having the misfortune to be very little known, the diſcovery of its treaſures is reſerved for futurity, till either ſome man of genius ſhall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict himſelf to theſe purſuits, or the ſwarm of idle travellers, who hover, like cock-chafers, about the Apennines, Alps, Aetna, and the Pyreneans, ſhall take their flight to theſe parts, and excite ſome fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign genius to the taſk. The Zillerthal is particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly rich in different ſorts of variegated ſtones, and in many parts of the hills you meet with very ſcarce European plants. In fine, there is room for weaving many an hypotheſis on the plants of the hills, on the work and production of the waters in them, and on the revolutions of nature that may ſtill be expected in them.</p>
                     <p>It was with great pleaſure, ſays <hi>Reiſbec,</hi> I wandered over this romantic country, and ſometimes ſtanding on ſome immenſe peak, I viewed under me the clouds,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0161700110:52"/>
towered on clouds, boundleſs plains, innumerable lakes, rivers and brooks, vallies of tremendous depth, and the bare ſummits of huge granate rocks, with ſenſations peculiar to their heavenly regions. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, ſays he, I took my abode in the deep hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brow of a mountain, in a ſhepherdeſs's hut, who dwelt the whole ſummer through, with her flock in this ſubtereſtrial region, and is viſited only by her lover, who clambers up two or three miles of the mountains to her, or by ſome wild-goat hunter, or ſtrayed knight, like myſelf; there I live a day, like an ancient patriarch, on milk and cheeſe, count the flock which in the evening aſſembles round the hut, at the ſound of a flute, and which, for the moment I can think my own; ſleep upon a heap of hay far more tranquil than upon the moſt luxurious down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, and enjoy the beauties of the riſing ſun, with a luxury and delight, which at operas, comedies, balls, and ſuch like entertainments are looked for in vain.</p>
                     <p>The Saltzburg peaſant clothes himſelf from head to foot; every family weaves a ſort of coarſe, dark, grey cloth, from wool which they grow and prepare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. They alſo make their own ſhoes and ſtock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. Their dreſs is by theſe means clean, ſimple, and graceful. The face of the peaſants of this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try is better than that in moſt others. The Saltz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burger cannot content himſelf with cheeſe and pota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toes like the Swiſs, but muſt always have his meat,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0161700110:53"/>
which, however, fat it may be, he conſtantly dips in hogs lard. He muſt likewiſe have bread, beer, and brandy, good of the kind, and in plenty. If this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagance was not counterbalanced by their admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble economy in other reſpects, they would be the pooreſt people in Europe.</p>
                     <p>The military force of this archbiſhopric conſiſts only of one regiment of foot, containing 1000 men. Every bailiwick has its rendezvous, to which, on ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals given, by means of cannon planted on the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, they repair completely armed. The number of peaſants who can hit a mark of an hand's-breadth, are computed at 25,000.</p>
                     <p>The univerſity is kept up by the congregation of Benedictines, who ſupply it with profeſſors. As the having ſtudied here is a kind of requiſite for eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical preferment in the circle of Suabia, it is a place of ſome reſort for ſtudents from that quarter; but thoſe excepted, and a few of the natives, there are no others, though the chairs of the profeſſors are filled with very able men. The funds of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity are too ſmall, they do not in the whole exceed 500l. per annum.</p>
                     <p>The civil and military officers of Saltzburg have a very great advantage over thoſe of other countries, which is, that half their ſalaries are continued to
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0161700110:54"/>
their widows during their life, or till they change their condition.</p>
                     <p>From the top of the <hi>Unterberge,</hi> a mountain near Saltzburg, there is a proſpect over all Bavaria. Nine lakes may be reckoned up in one view. The moſt charming part of this proſpect, however, is the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipality of Berchtolſgaden, which lies to the ſouth of the mountain. It conſiſts of a ſmall narrow vale, encompaſſed around with vaſt heights of the moſt pictureſque granate, and hardly contains 3000 inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants. The nature of this country being favourable neither to agriculture nor paſture, the inhabitants have given themſelves to works of art, which fail mankind in no part of the earth, and are mighty and powerful enough to turn the hardeſt ſtones into bread. It is in theſe remote vallies that they make the greateſt part of the toys with which Nuremberg and Augſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg carry on ſo conſiderable a trade. The horſes with ſpurs, little raſps, cukows, wooden mannakins, rats and mice, and all the play-things for little chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; alſo the crucifixes, ſtraw quadrille boxes, pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and pomatum boxes, and all the play-things for great children, in a word, the greater part of the articles which go amongſt us, under the name of Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man toys. It is a pretty ſight to behold two or three families in a hut, and to ſee the great plump hands of the farmers occupied in giving a finiſh to the ſmalleſt articles. Here is occupation for the old as
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0161700110:55"/>
well as the young. The ſmall price theſe commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ſell for, makes it impoſſible for them to accumu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late riches; but they have enough, and are happy. Theſe good people little think their productions are diſperſed all over Europe, and that the Spaniards drive a very profitable trade with them in both Indies.</p>
                     <p>Hellbrunn is a palace of the Archbiſhop, near the city, the building of which has nothing in it remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, but the gardens are very pleaſant; they are laid out in the manner of a wilderneſs, and abound with the fineſt water-works, reſervoirs, ponds and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, ſo clear that trouts and other fiſh may be ſeen ſporting in them, and nibbling the calves and ox li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers with which they are fed. By theſe waters all kinds of little figures of mills, ſciſſar-grinders, &amp;c. are thrown about the garden; and in the grotto you are ſure of being ſprinkled by the artificial play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the water. Over one of the many ſprings in this garden, is the ſtatue of a monſter, which might be taken for a ſavage or wild-man, were it not for its cock's-comb and eagle's feet. Under it is this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription. Anno 1531.</p>
                     <p>"The original of this monſtrous figure, called a <hi>foreſt devil,</hi> was caught a hunting near Stavenburg; his ſkin was yellowiſh, he had all the marks of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vageneſs, and never looked at any one, but hid him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0161700110:56"/>
in corners; he had the face of a man with a beard, eagle's feet with lion's claws, the tail of a dog, and on his head grew a large cock's-comb; he ſoon died with hunger, as no alurements nor violence could make him eat or drink."</p>

                     <head>THE BISHOPRIC OF PASSAU.</head>
                     <p>This city is ſituated ſixty miles South-Eaſt of Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſbon, at the confluence of the three rivers, Danube, Inn, and Iltſz. It is divided into four parts, the town of Paſſau, Innſtadt, Iltſzſtadt, and the quarter in which the Biſhop's palace is ſeated. The firſt three are fortified, but the laſt, which is only a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urb, has nothing but an old caſtle, in which the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop generally reſides. It was in this city that peace was concluded between Charles V. and the proteſtant princes in 1552, by which the Lutherans were to enjoy the free exerciſe of their religion. Paſſau is but a very miſerable, ill-built town, thoſe parts ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted which lie near the Danube, and the prince's palace. It is well ſituated for trade, but its chief ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence comes from the court, the income of which is about £.22,000 a year, and on the canons, whoſe benefices are the richeſt in Germany. A ſtall here being ſuppoſed to be worth about 3000 florins a year, and what with the income of other benefices, there are few of them who have not nearly double that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="54" facs="tcp:0161700110:57"/>The inhabitants of theſe ſeveral holy cities are all much alike, as drinking and intriguing conſtitute their principal occupation; and the poverty and good humour which ſeldom forſake thoſe who are thus addicted, render them affable, obſequious and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. The cathedral is a fine Gothic building which merits well to be viewed. There are fine china ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactories and potteries in this country; the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce of the former is carried as far as the Rhine.</p>
                     <p>Many attempts have been made to plant vines on the Iſer and Danube below Ratiſbon, but hitherto they have produced grapes only for eating; this whole tract of country being too full of wood and water for the vine to ripen in. But what was Suabia in the times of <hi>Tacitus?</hi> Little did the Romans think the vine would grow in Germany when they doubted whether even fruit would grow there. And yet Suabia produces ſome noble vines now, which may rival the Falernian and Roman wines for their excellence.</p>
                     <p>The reaſon to be aſſigned is, that the air of a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try changes with its cultivation. The drying up of marſhes renders it warmer. The evaporation too occaſioned by numbers who live together may work upon the air. The ſlopes of the hills on the left ſide of the Danube, between this place and Ratiſbon, promiſe a good place to plant vines in, as they are
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0161700110:58"/>
well guarded from the noxious winds; and the wine made near Paſſau truly merits the name of wine.</p>
                     <p>This large vale of the Danube produces likewiſe the beſt kind of corn and would very eaſily nouriſh twice the number of inhabitants it does at preſent.</p>
                     <p>Corn is often ſo cheap in Bavaria as hardly to pay the farmer for the trouble of raiſing it: one hundred and ſeventy pounds of rye are frequently ſold for about two ſlorins.</p>
                     <p>Navigation is by no means ſo well underſtood in this country as it is upon the Upper Rhine; they do not yet underſtand how to ſail by the direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the river. Moſt of the veſſels which come down the Danube from Ratiſbon and Ulm are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out decks or maſts; they are built only of fir-boards, and are ſold again either at Vienna or elſewhere. The Emperor has promiſed great encouragement to thoſe perſons who will build their veſſels like thoſe on the Rhine; but in this, as in every thing elſe, it is difficult to make the mechanical part of the public tread the track, to which they have not been accuſtomed.</p>
                     <p>Though Bavaria is a rich, plentiful country and lies well ſituated for trade, from the Danube and ſeveral other navigable rivers paſſing through it, yet the inhabitants in general are not rich, which is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0161700110:59"/>
to proceed from the Elector's monopolizing the moſt conſiderable articles of commerce, particularly that of ſalt, which he prohibits his ſubjects either from importing or from purchaſing of any perſon except himſelf. A ſecond monopoly is that of corn, the farmer is obliged to ſell all his corn to the Elector's agents who retail it out again to the people. This prince, like the Czar of Muſcovy, is Premier-General for his dominions; none may brew or ſell ſtrong beer but the Elector's factors. There is only an indifferent ſmall beer which the peaſants and citizens are allowed to brew in their own houſes. The Biſhop of Paſſau, whoſe territories lie within this circle, likewiſe imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates the Elector in this tyranny. The chief ſubſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the peaſants of this circle is their herds of ſwine, which are fed in their woods; and the wild beaſts and game which they meet with there, though it is penal to meddle with the game: but in moſt parts of Bavaria, corn, beer, and ſalt are ſo exceſſive dear that a peaſant can ſcarce afford to purchaſe them. After what has been remarked reſpecting theſe mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polies, it is needleſs to obſerve that the Elector is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute in his dominions. There are ſome general laws in the empire that all princes and ſtates are governed by, but they are often diſobeyed where there is not a force to compel the obſervance of them. The Elector and the Archbiſhop of Saltzburg are joint di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectors of the circle. The Elector of Bavaria ſtiles himſelf Duke of the Upper and Lower Bavaria, and
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:0161700110:60"/>
of the Upper Palatinate, Duke and Count Palatine of the Rhine; Elector and Vicar of the Empire, and Grand Maſter of the Houſhold.</p>
                     <p>In the lower part of Bavaria there are many more nobility who reſide conſtantly on their eſtates than in any parts of Germany: and to this may be attributed the advantage of their ſuperior cultivation; for as the nobles are farmers, it is no wonder that eſtates are managed better under the maſter's eye than in his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. Though there are not many of them who are great proficients in agriculture, yet a life paſſed in the midſt of it, muſt yield a greater inſight into the means of its improvement than one ſpent in the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rade of a court. Beſides, the nobles themſelves will naturally treat their peaſants better than the race of bailiffs, agents, &amp;c. who oppreſs and ſqueeze them for their own emolument, and it is an indiſputable fact that thoſe landlords are richeſt, and their eſtates beſt cultivated, where the peaſants are allowed ſome degree of liberty and property.</p>
                     <p>Though the peaſants in this country are in a ſtate of villenage, they are treated in a kinder man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and have more property and better houſes than in other parts of Germany; and many of them are alſo farmers, who, by induſtry and frugality, have ſaved many. Much of this country is encloſed, than which there cannot be any improvement of ſo great
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0161700110:61"/>
conſequence. Sheep ſeems to be a principal article in their huſbandry. Every farm of any ſize has a large ſheep-houſe, with a roof, but open on one ſide to the ſouth; in this houſe they fold their ſheep every night the year round, and depend on it princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally for manuring their lands: when they begin to fold, they ſpread over the floor light, virgin ſoil, turf, ſand, or peat-earth, and fold upon it, till it is very moiſt and dirty, then they make a freſh layer and ſo go on; but to every eighteen inches of depth they litter with ſtraw, for they remove the heap but once a year, and in extreme wet or ſnowy weather they do the ſame. This is an excellent ſyſtem for raiſing manure, but it might be imagined that the ſheep lying on a dunghill would be prejudicial to their health, this the Bavarians deny, and on the contrary aſſert that not only the health of the animal is the better for it, but likewiſe that the wool is much finer than if the ſheep were expoſed to the weather.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>SWABIA is bounded by Franconia on the north, Bavaria on the eaſt, Switzerland on the ſouth, and Alſace on the weſt. It contains the duchies of Wurtemberg, the Margravate of Baden, the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pality of Hohen-Zollern, that of Oetringen, and that of Mindelheim; the biſhopricks of Augſburg, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and Coire, with ſeveral baronies, abbies, and free towns. It derives its name from the Sueir who were ſo called from their long hair, which <hi>Tacitus</hi> mentions as a peculiarity belonging to them, by which a Swabian was known.</p>
                  <p>This country prides itſelf, not a little, in the ſource of that famous river the Danube: its courſe is not leſs than four hundred German miles; it flows by fifty large cities, and takes in twelve great rivers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides above eighty leſſer ſtreams, ſo that few rivers can be brought into competition with it, not even the Nile itſelf.

<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0161700110:64"/>
at a chapel built on an eminence near Burla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingen, a hunting ſeat of the prince of Hohen-Zol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lern; its being ſituated ſo that the rain which fell on one ſide of the chapel went into the Danube, and that which fell on the other, into the Rhine. On the chapel is a very ſuitable inſcription taken from the pſalms.</p>
                  <q>Sit nomen domini laudabile ab oriente ad occidentem.</q>
                  <p>Bleſſed be the name of the Lord from the riſing to the ſetting of the ſun, or from the eaſt to the weſt.</p>
                  <p>The Rhine, the principal ſource of which took its riſe on one ſide of the chapel, emptying itſelf in the German Ocean; and the Danube, running in a quite contrary direction, and loſing itſelf in the Black Sea.</p>
                  <p>In fertility of ſoil the territories of the circle of Swabia vary very much, which is a conſtant ſource of complaint to the aſſemblies of the circle, from diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricts, which imagine themſelves aggrieved in their aſſeſſments. The higheſt parts in Swabia are the Alps and the Schwarzwald or Black Foreſt; the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of which are ſtill ſomewhat higher than the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The Schwarzwald has probably been ſo called from the thick foreſts of fir with which it is covered; and, according to the deſcription given us by <hi>Julius
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0161700110:65"/>
Caeſar</hi> of the <hi>Sylva Hyrcinia,</hi> this was the beginning of it. This wood is by much the largeſt in Germany, being ſixty days journey in length and nine in breadth. The inhabitants ſubſiſt chiefly by graziery, wood, and pitch, which they trade in for exportation. In many parts of it, there are two kinds of land, one like the common ploughed fields, and the other rendered fertile by the following method. The peaſants lay billets of fir about ſix feet long at a proper diſtance, and between them vine branches covered with ſods pared off the ſame field. One of theſe heaps is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a <hi>roſs</hi> or <hi>horſe;</hi> and the number of them is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned to the dimenſions of the field. Theſe they kindle, leaving them to conſume ſlowly, and the aſhes and earth are then ſcattered over the ground, to which they communicate an extraordinary ferti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; but this laſts only for three or four years. It is then left for ſome years fallow, and yields good graſs, till it becomes again fit to undergo the above ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
                  <p>This circle contains 720 ſquare German miles. Under the emperor <hi>Frederic</hi> III. the circle of Swabia was divided into four quarters, which diviſion ſtill continues and on many occaſions has been found to be very beneficial. The duke of Wurtemberg is head of the firſt, the Margrave of Baden the ſecond, the Biſhop of Conſtance and the Abbot of Kempten heads of the third, and the Biſhop of Auguſburg head of the fourth.</p>

                     <head>OF THE TERRITORIES OF THE DUKE OF WURTEMBURG.</head>
                     <p>The greateſt part of this dukedom conſiſts in an extenſive valley, which is bounded on the eaſt by a chain of hills, called the Alps; on the weſt by the Black Foreſt, on the north by a part of the mountain of Oden Wald, and an arm of the Black Foreſt. On the whole it inclines to the northward, and is watered in the middle by the river Neckar. Several ſmaller arms run off from the ſurrounding chain of hills to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the centre, croſs each other in various direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and form little vallies, which are watered by an infinity of rivers. The land is rendered exceedingly fruitful by theſe leſſer hills, which ſhelter the vallies from the cold hills, and collect the heat of the ſun between them.</p>
                     <p>The ſouthern ſides of theſe mountains and hills are planted with vines very high up, and above them there is excellent dyers and bruſh-wood; and at the bottom is a grey coloured, light mould, which yields all kind of corn, but particularly barley, in aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing plenty. Upon the whole, this country reſembles the middle part of Lorrain; but the ſoil is much better, and there are not ſo many ſtones in it. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting ſalt, which it is obliged to have recourſe to Bavaria for, it abounds in all the neceſſaries of life.
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:0161700110:67"/>
What corn is not conſumed in the country is ſent to Switzerland, and the wine goes as far as England. The whole extent of the country does not contain more than two hundred, German ſquare miles. In this circuit there are about five hundred and ſixty thouſand inhabitants, that is, about two thouſand eight hundred to every German ſquare mile. Thoſe parts of Germany excepted, which are in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood of ſome capital cities, and ſome diſtricts of Italy and the Netherlands, there is certainly no country in Europe ſo populous in proportion to its extent as this. It is however ſo fruitful as to be able to ſupport as many more inhabitants.</p>
                     <p>The income of the Duke amounts to about three hundred thouſand pounds a year. Some calculations make the ſum ſmaller; but as there are few parts of Germany in which the taxes are not eſtimated at five florins per head, and in ſome they pay much more, why ſhould it not be ſo in Wurtemberg, which is one of the largeſt territories in Germany, and in which the ſubject is not more ſpared?</p>
                     <p>After the electors, the Duke is beyond compariſon the greateſt Prince in Germany, though the land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave of Heſſe Caſſel, who has not above two thirds of the ſubjects or yearly income, is of more conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence in the Empire, on account of his connection with England.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="64" facs="tcp:0161700110:68"/>The government of this dukedom is not ſo ſimple and unmixed as that of the territory of Baden. Here are ſwarms of counſellors, ſecretaries, proctors, and advocates, of which more than half might be ſpared; but the nature of the government allows them to enjoy their appointments in idleneſs. Many of them, it is true, belong to the ſtate, whoſe duty it is to limit the authority of the Prince; but not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the many reductions in the houſehold itſelf, it is ſtill much too large for the Duke's cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances.</p>
                     <p>In all the cities, towns, and large villages in this duchy, there are certain officers, called private over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeers, who inſpect into the offences and miſdemea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of their fellow-citizens, and make a report of them to the magiſtracy of the place, in order that they may be further enquired into, if the magiſtrates ſhall think fit. Theſe inquiſitors are private, and ſwear to the faithful execution of their office; inſtead of a ſalary, they are generally rewarded with a counſellor's place, or ſome other office in the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. No one knows his accuſer, as <hi>Keyſler</hi> obſerves, from whom this peculiar circumſtance in the police of Wurtemberg is taken, which may be an inlet to many abuſes, if their information alone paſſes for ſufficient proofs, and they are conſidered in any other light than as premonitions for the judge, or as incentives to greater cautions for the future. This cuſtom is ſimilar
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0161700110:69"/>
to the <hi>Denuncie ſecrete</hi> at Venice, but is practiſed in no other part of Germany.</p>
                     <p>Though the country throughout is proteſtant, and the Duke alone a catholic, there ſtill prevails a great deal of ſuperſtition and bigotry. The clergy are members of the ſtate, theſe have a juriſdiction of their own, and are very wealthy.</p>
                     <p>After the repeal of the edict of Nantz, the Duke of Wurtemberg might have reaped very conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able advantages by affording ſhelter and encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the French refugees, there being among them many rich people, and thoſe profitable manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures would have been introduced here which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched Brandenburgh, and other countries; but a blind zeal for orthodoxy and the clamours of the clergy, that it would be ſetting up altar againſt altar, and that even Mahometaniſm was preferable to Calvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm, filled the aſſembly of the ſtates with ſuch jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies and apprehenſions, that the court was diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed in its good intentions. An after-reflection opened peoples eyes, when it was ſeen what a valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble opportunity they had rejected.</p>
                     <p>The Duke's army conſiſted formerly of fourteen thouſand men, and if his debts were paid, and his other expences moderated, ſuch an eſtabliſhment might always be ſupported; as the population and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0161700110:70"/>
of the country appear to allow it. At the time of the change, however, they were reduced to about five thouſand men, and thoſe ſeem to be none of the beſt troops. The late Duke of Wurtemberg, ſome few years ſince, made himſelf the topic of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation all over Europe for his ſumptuous feaſts, his magnificent balls, the ſplendor of his illuminations, in which immenſe foreſts were lighted up, his ſuperb hunting parties, and his brilliant operas, where all the firſt-rate dancers from Paris were procured, with <hi>Noverre</hi> at their head, when his fame was at the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt; together with all the principal Italian ſingers, at a moſt enormous expence. The conſequences were ſuch as might naturally have been foreſeen; debt, oppreſſive taxes, reſiſtance on the part of the ſtates of the country, and finally a commiſſion of enquiry iſſued from the Imperial court. The debts, upon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination, were found to amount to twelve hundred thouſand pounds. The evil counſellors, as it may eaſily be imagined, were removed; but this would have done but little, had not an alteration about this time taken place in moſt of the leſſer courts of the Empire, the princes of which, from being oppreſſive and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant tyrants, ſuddenly contracted a taſte for po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical economy, and philoſophical purſuits. The Duke of Wurtemberg is now quite a philoſopher, he founds ſchools, farms, cultivates arts and ſciences, and eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhes manufactures; in ſhort, he has endeavoured, in every way poſſible to make up for what has been wrong.
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:0161700110:71"/>
This change has taken place ever ſince the year 1778; the Prince took the opportunity of his birth-day to publiſh a manifeſto, of which the following is the ſubſtance: "That being a man, and from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of human nature, far removed from the ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard of perfection, it could not but fall out, that part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from human frailty, ever prone to err, and partly from the want of ſagacity, and from other cauſes many events had taken place which had they not hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, things would have been very different from what they now are, or are likely to be hereafter. This I acknowledge freely, and I aſſure my loving ſubjects, that every ſucceſſive year of my life, which it ſhall pleaſe the divine Providence to beſtow, ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated to the promotion of their happineſs. Hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forwards the proſperity of Wurtemberg ſhall be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed on the joint and firm baſis of the ſovereign's love for his people, and of the people's confidence in the affection of their ſovereign. And we truſt, that every man will, for the future, live in confidence, that he has a provident and anxious father in his prince, and that the only conteſt that ſhall ariſe here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, ſhall be which ſhall do moſt to make his native country happy and flouriſhing."</p>
                     <p>The affection of the people towards their prince was very remarkable. Even when the Duke ſeemed to have no other care than how he ſhould load them with new taxes, he did not forfeit their attachment.
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0161700110:72"/>
The curſes of the people fell on his ſervants, and the crew of projectors who led him aſtray. But as ſoon as they were baniſhed, he became the idol of his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; and very deſervedly ſo.</p>
                     <p>All the princes of the Houſe of Wurtemberg Stut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard are brave, and as it were born for military at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievements. Prince <hi>Maximilian</hi> eſpecially gave the greateſt hopes of himſelf, when ſcarce fourteen years of age, he entered into the ſervice of <hi>Charles</hi> XII. of Sweden, and continued to attend that Prince in all his campaigns. At the ſurprize of the town of Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tawa in 1703, though ſo young, he attacked ſword in hand an old Saxon trooper, who turning about in ſome aſtoniſhment, ſaid to him, "Thou little ſon of a whore, what art thou already for cracking a ſtout fellow's ſkull?" And was going to diſpatch the Prince, had not <hi>Charles</hi> XII. came to his aſſiſtance. And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, in a dark night, the Prince riding full ſpeed before the King, ſuddenly ſtopped at a deep pit; the King ſuppoſing it was from fear of the enemy, called out, <hi>forward, forward,</hi> upon which the Prince, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardleſs of the danger, clapped ſpurs to his horſe, and fell into a pit; the King, being cloſe behind, had the ſame fate, and, with his horſe, fell upon the Prince, who was half dead. This ſo endeared him to <hi>Charles,</hi> that he ſet up a whole night with him. At the unfortunate battle of Pultawa, he was taken pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner. The Czar offering him a commiſſion, his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0161700110:73"/>
was, "That whilſt he had a drop of blood, it ſhould be employed in the ſervice of his Swediſh majeſty as his benefactor." This ſo charmed the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous Czar, that on certain conditions he gave him his liberty, and preſented him with the ſword he then wore. Whether from a miſtaken gratitude he drank too freely at taking leave of the Ruſſians, or whether his activity in the former, fatiguing campaign had hurt his conſtitution, this heroic Prince, on his return to his native country, was ſeized with a fever, which proved fatal to him, in the twenty-firſt year of his age, dying in the bloom of his youth, and in the certain hopes, that by his marriage with the King's ſiſter <hi>Ulrica,</hi> he ſhould come one day to fit on the throne of Sweden.</p>
                     <p>Stutgard, the capital of the duchy, is not a large city, but contains two well-built ſuburbs, and has been the reſidence of the dukes ſince 1321, the new ducal palace was built in 1746, in a delightful country, full of gardens and vineyards, in the Miſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bach (which at about one league diſtance, runs into the Neckar), and contains about 20,000 inhabitants. They are a handſome people. The women are tall and ſlender, with fair and ruddy complexions. The natural riches, and the eaſe with which a maintenance is acquired, either in town or country, cauſe them to live exceedingly well. The Stutgarder is ſo attached to his home, that remove him but thirty miles from
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:0161700110:74"/>
it, and he is ſeized with the <hi>maladie du pais.</hi> At pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent little notice is taken of the noble palace of Stut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, and this is more particularly felt in the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure-houſe, where formerly the Ridottos were held. This edifice, were it only on account of its hall, which has few equals in all Europe, very well deſerves no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice. It is two hundred and twenty feet in length, eighty broad, and ninety high, without a ſingle pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar; its roof, which is arched, being faſtened in a maſterly manner, with wooden ſcrews. In the year 1707, Marſhal <hi>Villars,</hi> coming into this hall, miſtook it for a place of worſhip, and ſaid, with ſome admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, <hi>voici un beau temple! i. e.</hi> This is a fine church! On the roof are painted ſeveral ſcriptural hiſtories, but on the ſides are views of all the foreſts of the duchy of Wurtemberg, and ſome merry ſcenes, which happened, at different times, in the hunting parties. Near it is the orangery, which is compoſed of very large and high trees, but not well contrived; want of height occaſioning many of the trees to bend at the top. The new building, as it is called, is of fine free-ſtone, with a grand ſtair-caſe of the ſame, and a ſpacious hall, whoſe galleries reſt on twelve pillars of a great height; on theſe are painted the twelve months; the roof ſhews the moſt ancient tranſactions of the family of Wurtemberg, and the ſides are filled with maſquerades and public entries.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="71" facs="tcp:0161700110:75"/>In the muſeum are ſeveral portraits of the ducal fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, with petrifactions, mechanical and mathematical inventions, curious ſpecimens of penmanſhip, gems, coſtly veſſels, mummies, old medals, &amp;c. Among other curioſities, you ſee the picture of a woman with a large beard, apparently in her twenty-fifth year, and ſhe is again painted in her old age. This ſeeming contradiction of a bearded woman is accounted an error of nature, which commonly proceeds from an exceſs of humidity. In this caſe it is poſſible for bearded women to enjoy a laſting health, an inſtance of which we have in <hi>Margaret,</hi> formerly governeſs of the Low Countries, whoſe great beard was a very ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular ornament to her robuſt ſtrength. Few traits in hiſtory are more known than the bearded amazon, who ſerved as a grenadier in all the campaigns of <hi>Charles</hi> XII. of Sweden, and gave more than maſculine proofs of courage till ſhe was taken priſoner in the battle of Pultawa. She was brought from Siberia to Peterſburg, and introduced to the Czarina with a beard an ell and an half long. There is alſo the pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a Swiſs country-woman, which is drawn with a very venerable beard, to be ſeen in the Breflaw col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection.</p>
                     <p>The ducal palace offers nothing intereſting but the grand ſtair-caſe which aſcends gradually without ſteps, ſo that any one may ride up and down it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="72" facs="tcp:0161700110:76"/>The palace of Ludwigſburg two leagues from Stut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, was formerly but a farm-houſe for breeding cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, but is now acknowledged to be one of the fineſt edifices in all Germany. The looking-glaſs and lackered cloſet are very curious, and ſo is the great ſtair-caſe for the ambaſſadors, with its magnificent cieling and the gallery of pictures; among theſe are ſome admirable night-pieces, and a great many pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of horſes and dogs, and likewiſe the picture of a black wolf, which was kept for a long time at court, he was called <hi>Melac,</hi> and followed the Duke wherever he went, and even ſlept at the foot of his bed. The chapel belonging to the palace is very elegant, but ſomething rather too ſmall: here is alſo a curious menagery of foreign fowl. The Duke's band of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic may be ſaid to equal that of any court in Europe.</p>
                     <p>The green-houſe is one of the fineſt to be met with any where. The Duke likewiſe employs conſiderable ſums of money for his ſtuds and his hunters. He has at preſent three ſets of horſes of eight in each ſet, which one coachman can manage without a poſtilion; ſo that, in travelling, they perform all the paces and curvettings of the manage, and ſometimes the Duke himſelf has been the coachman.</p>
                     <p>In the beginning of this century an order of hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was inſtituted in this duchy. The enſign of this knighthood is a hunting-horn. One privilege of the
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:0161700110:77"/>
companions is that they are preferred in the nomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to commanderies, each of which is worth five hundred guilders. The knights of this order may be preſent at all the public entertainments, beſides an unlimited number of princes and perſons of high birth; this order has alſo twelve ancient Imperial counts, thirty knights and a ſecretary. The device of the order is a gold Malteſe croſs, ſet with rubies; four golden eagles at its four angles, and between the middle and lower point a hunting-horn; in the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is a round, green enamelled ſhield, on one ſide of which is a golden W, with a ducal coronet, and on the other three golden hunting-horns ſlung together. This croſs is faſtened to a crimſon, watered ribband of a hand's breadth, and is worn over the left ſhoulder down to the right ſide. On the left breaſt of the coat is alſo a ſilver ſtar, with the device of the order, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with it's motto <hi>Amicitiae virtutiſque foedus, i. e.</hi> the band of virtue and friendſhip; embroidered with gold in a green circle. All the knights are obliged to wear theſe enſigns of the order; thoſe only excepted who are of higher orders, and have already a ſtar in that place; theſe, nevertheleſs are obſerved to wear the Wurtemberg ſtar on their waiſtcoat, and a little croſs of the order hanging on a narrow, red ribband round their neck. Every knight is to put the croſs and collar of the order under the coat of arms of his family; this collar conſiſts of green, enamelled little ſhields, on which are alternately the golden W, with
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:0161700110:78"/>
the ducal coronet, and three golden hunting-horns; between each ſhield ſtands a golden eagle with its wings extended, and its talons on each ſhield. The feſtival for a general chapter of the order is held an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually on St. <hi>Hubert</hi>'s day, at whatever place the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign happens to be, when there is always a great hunting match. The companions, who are prevented from making their appearance, are obliged, if it be any ways poſſible, and they are not diſabled by ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or prevented by affairs of very great concern, to celebrate the day in honour of the order, wherever they are, with a hunt and other entertainments. If a knight is ſeen in public without the croſs of the order, he forfeits a handſome pair of piſtols to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>former, and twenty dollars to the poor; but he who neglects to wear the order for a year and a day is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graded.</p>
                     <p>The Duke of Wurtemburg has ſeveral hunting ſeats, which he viſits alternately in the deer or boar ſeaſons, ſo that every five years he ſees his principal foreſts. The multitude of deer in this country may be eſtimated by conſidering that above ſeven thouſand of them periſhed in one ſingle hard winter.</p>
                     <p>It is a cuſtom over all the country of Wurtemburg to adorn chambers and galleries with large branches of deer's horns. At Waldenburg, over moſt of the remarkable branches is inſcribed the name of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:0161700110:79"/>
who ſhot the deer; and the dexterity of a late duke has filled ſome rooms with them. At the hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeat of Einſidel are two remarkable branches, which in rutting time, the deer to whom they belonged thruſt into each other, and twiſted together with ſuch force, that they cannot be diſengaged; and the creatures died on the ſpot. The like is alſo ſhewn in the royal chamber of curioſities at Copenhagen. At Einſidel is alſo a large hawthorn, grown from a twig, which was brought above two hundred years ago from the Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land by <hi>Everhardus Barbatus</hi> on his hat, and afterwards planted here with his own hands. In <hi>Cruſius's</hi> time this ſhrub had ſpread to a circumference of fifty-two ells, its branches were ſupported by forty-three pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, and no ſingle perſon could graſp its ſtock.</p>
                     <p>In the year 1700 were found above ſixty different <hi>fruſta</hi> of large teeth, ſhoulder-blades, ribs, and joints of back-bones, the moſt remarkable of which are ſtill kept in the muſeum at Stutgard; ſome of them appear to have belonged to fiſhes of prey, others to bears, tygers, lions, horſes, &amp;c. and ſome, particularly the largeſt teeth, to elephants. Near Boll in Wurtemberg, is found an abundance of ſkeletons, which are petrified and changed to a perfect ſtone, whoſe ſpine not being tubulous, and conſequently without marrow, ſhews them to have belonged to fiſhes. A ſpecimen of theſe is in the hands of D. <hi>Mauchart</hi> of Tubingen; but
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:0161700110:80"/>
a larger piece may be ſeen in the gallery of natural curioſities at Dreſden, and for which an apothecary of Tubingen received fifty rixdollars.</p>
                     <p>Tubingen the ſecond city in Wurtemberg, about twenty miles from Stutgard, is of ſuch antiquity that its aera is unkown. This place was once the ſeat of the emperor <hi>Caracalla,</hi> who entertained the Germans with public games in this city, The high court of juſtice is held here, beſides the univerſity, which is in great repute; there is a <hi>collegium illuſtre</hi> for the education of princes and young noblemen. In the town-houſe is a very curious clock, which deſerves the attention of travellers.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Keyſler</hi> relates a very ſingular adventure which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to a tame ſtork that was kept ſome years ago in the <hi>collegio illuſtri.</hi> As an inſtance of rationality in animals, this bird had lived very quietly in the Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard till Count <hi>Gravenitz,</hi> a ſtudent, ſhot at a ſtork's neſt near the college, and moſt probably wounded the ſtork that was in it, as for ſome weeks after he was not ſeen to ſtir from his neſt. This happened in autumn, when the foreign ſtorks ſet out on their periodical emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gration. The following ſpring a ſtork was obſerved upon the roof of the college, and by its continual chattering, gave the tame ſtork, which was walking in the college court to underſtand, that it was deſirous

of its company; but this being impracticable by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of its wings being clipped, the ſtranger with the greateſt caution came down to the upper gallery, the next day ſomewhat lower, and laſtly, after abundance of ceremonies, alighted in the court. The tame ſtork not conſcious of any crime went and met him with a ſoft chearful note, a ſincere indication of courteſy and friendſhip, when, to his aſtoniſhment, the other fell furiouſly upon him. Some ſpectators of this interview, for that time immediately put the foreign ſtork to flight; yet was it ſo little diſcouraged, that the very next day, it returned to the charge, and during the whole ſummer frequent ſkirmiſhes paſſed between theſe birds; orders being given that the tame ſtork having only one antagoniſt ſhould not be aſſiſted. Being thus put to its ſhifts, it began to ſtand better upon its guard, and made ſuch a vigorous reſiſtance that at the end of the campaign the ſtranger had little to boaſt of; but the ſpring enſuing, inſtead of a ſingle ſtork, came four, which, without any of the foregoing ceremonies, lighted at once in the college-court, and made at the tame ſtork. This peaceable fowl, in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of many ſpectators from the galleries, performed exploits, if the expreſſion may be permitted, above the valour of man, defending itſelf and aſſaulting its enemies with the moſt vigorous intrepidity, till at length overpowered, and its ſtrength being ſpent, it was falling under the redoubled ſtrokes of the enemy, when ſome very unexpected auxiliaries appeared. All

the turkey-cocks, ducks, geeſe, and the whole poſſe of fowls, which were brought up in the court, and to whom this gallant ſtork had unqueſtionably en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deared itſelf, by its mild and friendly carriage, braving the danger, formed as it were a rampart, by means of which it might make an honourable retreat from ſo an unequal a fight; even a peacock, which before would never be upon good terms with it, on this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion ſided with oppreſſed innocence, and was, if not a ſtaunch friend, at leaſt a favourable judge on the ſtork's ſide. This occaſioned a ſtricter watch to be kept againſt all ſuch treacherous incurſions, and a ſtop was put to any further blood-ſhed, till in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the third ſpring, above twenty ſtorks made a ſtoop into the court, and before the poor ſtork's life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guards could form themſelves, or any people come to its aſſiſtance, murdered it; however, under ſuch diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parity, it exerted all its former heroiſm, and made the ſtorks pay dear for their baſe aſſaſſination.

the readers conſideration the adventure of D. <hi>Gahrliep's</hi> tame fox, as a further inſtance of their combination and reflection. Every evening D. <hi>Gahrliep</hi> had his tame fox carefully chained up, a confinement which this beaſt, uſed to liberty, could not well digeſt; and it was not long before he found by frequent trials, that he could ſlip his collar over his head. In the night he was not wanting to take advantage of ſuch a fine opportunity, and made a terrible havock among the neighbouring fowls and geeſe, but always took care to be at home before day-break, and immediately ſlipt his neck into the collar again, imagining he ſhould thus avoid the ſuſpicion of being thought the author of theſe depredations. Amidſt all the heavy complaints of the neighbours, the innocence of the fox ſeemed the more certain, as <hi>Gahrliep's</hi> poultry had enjoyed an uninterrupted repoſe. At laſt the ſpoiler being caught in the fact by a vigilant neighbour, the doctor was condemned in coſts and damages, and he in revenge made a ſkeleton of the perpretator of this miſchief.</p>
                     <p>There is another celebrated town in this duchy called Hailbron, or the fountain of health, from the virtues of the medicinal waters. It is a free Imperial city under the Duke's protection, ſituated in a plain, twelve miles ſouth-eaſt of Tubingen. This water at preſent is not uſed medicinally as formerly, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues

in great repute for its extraordinary clearneſs and ſalubrity. To the uſe of this ſpring, the emper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or <hi>Charles</hi> V. attributed his recovery from a dangerous fit of ſickneſs, in 1547. <hi>Keyſler</hi> gives a remarkable inſtance of its numerous and fertile vineyards, by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving laſt year, (this was in 1727,) that ſuch plenty of wine was made in this country, and further up the banks of the Neckar, that the inhabitants had not a ſufficient number of caſks to put it in, and ſuch wine of the growth of 1725 as could be ſpared, was ſold for half a <hi>creutzer,</hi> or a farthing a quart, when at the ſame time a quart of <hi>Seltzer</hi> mineral water coſt eighteen creutzers, or thirty-ſix times as much.</p>
                     <p>In the diſtrict of Urach is a curioſity worth notice. In an high and ſteep mountain near the town of Urach is the famous wood-ſlider, which conſiſts of one thick iron pipe, about three feet broad, two high, and about nine hundred long. This pipe begins at the top of the mountain and reaches almoſt down the valley near the town of Urach and the river Erms. Into its upper opening the wood, which has been felled on the mountain and cut into hillets is put, and being carried down the pipe, is thrown into the river Erms, which forwards it into the Neckar, and by this means furniſhes Stutgard with fuel at a ſmall expence; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the great impetuoſity with which it muſt naturally move in coming from an eminence above

                     <p>The deſcription which <hi>Reiſbec</hi> gives of the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants in the Black Foreſt forms a very different con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traſt to the reſt of the Duke's ſubjects. The men, ſays he, are clumſy, and the women yellow, ill ſhaped, and wrinkled at the age of thirty. They diſtinguiſh them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from their neighbours by a moſt frightful taſte in dreſs, and a ſhocking want of cleanlineſs. I am not able, he adds, to account for the uglineſs of this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Need, labour, and little food may contribute to it, but cannot be the only reaſon; for in the country of <hi>Furſtemberg,</hi> and particularly in the Auſtrian parts of this great chain of hills, are very handſome people who do not ſeem to live better than the Wirtembergers. Poſſibly the uglineſs of the latter may be owing to the ſituation and depth of the vallies, to the air and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps to the water. Theſe journies, ſays <hi>Reiſbec,</hi> over the mountains had particular charms for me. I fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied myſelf in a new world. One enchanting proſpect ſucceeded another in variety and beauty, mountains and chains of mountains of the moſt extraordinary forms, cataracts, woods, ſmall lakes in the deep hollows, precipices, in ſhort every thing I ſaw, was in ſo grand a ſtile as to exceed all deſcription. The Duke of Wir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temberg enjoys one very great privilege that there lies no appeal from his courts of judicature to the Aulic or
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:0161700110:87"/>
any other foreign tribunal. He ſits and votes in the college of princes by virtue of the duchy of Wirtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg and has demanded the ſame privilege as duke of Teck. This is an old caſtle now in ruins with a town adjoining. The firſt duke of Teck, known with any certainty, lived towards the end of the twelfth century. The duke's title, is duke of Wirtemberg and Teck, count of Mompelgard, lord of Heydenheim and Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinjen. He is joint director of the circle of Swabia with the biſhop of Conſtance.</p>
                     <p>His office in the empire is to carry the Imperial ſtandard; this office of ſtandard-bearer of the Holy Roman empire, was conferred on the Counts of Wirtemberg in 1336. The dukes of Wirtemberg are alſo grand huntſmen of the empire; and in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion to this honour, Duke <hi>Eberhard Lewis,</hi> in 1702, founded the order of hunting, of which we have already treated, and in the year 1719, renewed and increaſed its ſtatutes, the reigning duke of Wir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temberg being always grand-maſter.</p>

                     <p>Is about ninety miles in length, but not above twenty in breadth. It lies near the banks of the Rhine, and extends from Bale almoſt to Philipſburg, and from thence, through part of Alſace to the Moſelle. It produces corn, hemp, flax, turnips,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:0161700110:88"/>
peaſe, and other vegetables; and the villages along the <hi>Rhine</hi> abound in hay, and breed great quantities of cattle, beſides which they enjoy the conveniency of good fiſheries in the <hi>Rhine.</hi> Veniſon and wild fowl are ſo plentiful in the foreſts, that it is the ordinary food of the peaſants; and they have woods of cheſnuts, where there are very excellent bacon-hogs. Here are alſo quarries of marble of all colours, and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, with which materials the inhabitants build magnificent houſes at a trifling expence. They carry on a large trade in cattle, wood and wine, which laſt is extremely good in the environs of Bale. The mildneſs of the government ſecures to the people, the quiet enjoyment of the rewards of their induſtry. There are not indeed opportunities of making great fortunes, as the court is very economical, but the ſame cauſe prevents the preſſure of extreme poverty. The felicity of exporting merchandize by the navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation on the Rhine, is a great incitement to induſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. The manufactures in conſequence, increaſe every year, and ſome of them, particularly that of ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then ware, at Durloch, are in high eſtimation. They have likewiſe made ſome ſucceſsful experiments in manufacturing of ſilk.</p>
                     <p>The Prince, in ſhort, endeavours by every poſſible means to introduce induſtry, and manufactories among his ſubjects. There are a conſiderable number of Engliſh tradeſmen here, ſays <hi>Moore,</hi> who make Bir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingham
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:0161700110:89"/>
work, and inſtruct the inhabitants in that buſineſs. He has alſo engaged many watchmakers from Geneva to ſettle here, by granting them en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragment, and privileges of every kind, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows no opportunity to ſlip, by which he can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the comfort, and happineſs of his people: a prince of ſuch a character is certainly a public bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and the people are fortunate who are born un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his government. But far more fortunate they, who are born under a government, which can protect them, independent of the virtues, and in ſpite of their Sovereign.</p>
                     <p>Baden, the capital of the marquiſate, takes it name from the multitude of hot baths about it, which are ſaid to amount to near three hundred. The town is ſituated in the midſt of vineyards, upon a moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainous rocky ground, which renders the ſtreets very uneven. The baths are ſcalding hot, and as they iſſue from rocks of ſalt, allum and brimſtone, taſte ſtrongly of thoſe minerals. One of them boils and bubbles up, as if it ſtood over a hot furnace. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other diſtempers, theſe waters are famous for curing the cramp and gout, which brings a great reſort of company to this place, during the ſummer months. The only public buildings, are the caſtle, built on an adjoining hill, and a palace belonging to the Margrave, which, however, is uninhabited. The reſidence of the court being principally at Carlſrube.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="85" facs="tcp:0161700110:90"/>The town of Carlſrube is well built on a regular plan. It conſiſts of one principal ſtreet of about an Engliſh mile in length. This ſtreet is at a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able diſtance in front of the palace, and in a paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel direction with it. All the other ſtreets go off at different angles from the principal one, in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as, that which ever of them you enter, walking from it, the view is terminated by the front of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace. The length of their ſmaller ſtreets is aſcertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, none of them being allowed to encroach on the ſpacious area, which is kept clear before the palace.</p>
                     <p>The principal ſtreet may be extended to any length, and as many additional ſtreets as they pleaſe may be built from it, all of which will have, according to this plan, the palace for termination.</p>
                     <p>The houſes of this town are as uniform as the ſtreets, being all of an equal ſize and height; ſo as to give the appearance, that none of the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants are in any conſiderable degree richer or poorer than their neighbours. There are, indeed, a few new houſes more elegant than the reſt, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to ſome of the officers of the court, and are built on one ſide of the palace; but they are not, properly ſpeaking, in the town.</p>
                     <p>It ſtands in the middle of a large foreſt, the rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of that, which in the time of <hi>Tacitus,</hi> covered
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:0161700110:91"/>
all Germany. Through this foreſt there are thirty-two regular avenues, extending to a great diſtance; and the town which is built in the ſhape of a fan, ſtands upon nine of theſe. The firſt ſtone of the palace was laid in 1715, half of the right wing is wanting, the building having for ſome years been diſcontinued. The firſt object of attention here, and for which no expence has been thought too great, is the turret on the body of the building, from whence we have not only a view of all the principal ſtreets, but alſo of five and twenty walks, ſome ſet with trees, and others cut through the woods, which no other princes ſeat can rival, and ſtill heightened by a proſpect of other variegated walks in the ſame woods. Some of theſe walks bear the names of thoſe miniſters who ſerved his highneſs at the time of theſe improvements; and the ſtreets in the town are called by the names of different German princes. The gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, though ſmall, is very elegant, and contains above four thouſand orange, lemon, bay, and other ſuch kind of trees.</p>
                     <p>In ſome of the lower parts of the garden, are eſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers of young lemon trees; here is alſo an aviary for three hundred canary-birds, which in ſummer-time uſed to fly about the gardens all day, and at night re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair to their habitation. Behind the palace is a decoy, where above two thouſand wild fowl are daily fed. The chief defect in Carlſrube is want of water. The
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:0161700110:92"/>
neighbouring country is a ſandy level, which in ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer makes travelling very diſagreeable. All the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for the garden is conveyed by hand-pumps, but what is moſt ſingular, is, that the whole town conſiſts entirely of wooden buildings.</p>
                     <p>A traveller who paſſed through it, expreſſing his ſurprize one day to the Margrave, to ſee a palace en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely of wood. 'True, Sir,' ſaid the Prince, <q>you may think it ought, at leaſt, to have been built of brick; but I could not have been more magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently lodged, without laying expenſive taxes on my ſubjects, and I wanted only a roof to lay my head under.</q> This court has been much reflected upon for its economy. The fact is, the debts of the family were numerous and great. Thoſe in the here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary dominions have ariſen from frequent wars, and the neceſſary proviſion for the younger branches of the family; and in the laſt adminiſtration, every thing had been ſuffered to go to ruin, becauſe the ſucceſſor was a proteſtant. Under theſe circumſtances, the Prince's mother carried her economy ſo far, as to cauſe the flowers which grew in the gardens of the palace to be ſold, inſtead of permitting her daughters to wear them in their boſoms. For this, though without the ſtricteſt economy, the family muſt have been ruined, ſhe was laughed at, perhaps in ſome degree, not undeſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly.</p>

                        <pb n="88" facs="tcp:0161700110:93"/>From Carlſrube, it is two ſtages and a quarter to Radſtadt; but it is worth while to turn off a little on the left hand to the <hi>Favorita,</hi> built by the widow of a late margrave of <hi>Baden-Baden,</hi> in the neweſt taſte of architecture. Here is a chamber of very beautiful porcelain, and a cabinet lined with looking-glaſs, with many curioſities of art and nature, particularly, above forty very good pictures of the ſaid counteſs in different maſquerade dreſſes, which in her juve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nile years, ſhe had at various times appeared in. Amidſt the gradual alterations of the complexion and features in ſuch a long ſucceſſion of time, the ſame look is every where diſcernable. 'I know not,' ſays <hi>Keyſler,</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>The height of the lower hall reaches through all the ſtories, and its cupola, round which is a baluſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trade, leading into the different apartments, is very light, and the top beautifully painted. Some of the apartments are hung with a Chineſe manufacture of paper and ſilk, others with lace-work, and bed cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of the ſame. The cieling of one or two is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched with gems, as agate, jaſper, cornelians, ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiſts, &amp;c. imitating fiſhes, birds and flowers.

On the left, at the end of the little orangery, is a pleaſant garden, and on the right, a wild thicket, leading to the hermitage. In the centre of it ſtands the houſe, the outward walls of which are covered with large pieces of bark. The door ſeems to reſt upon the trunks of old trees; and all that is to be ſeen within, are the coarſe images of <hi>Jeſus, Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Mary;</hi> a mean bed without curtains, an altar without decorations; and at the angles of the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row walks in the garden, ſtand wooden images of old hermits, as big as life, ſome of them in an hairy ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit: the niches, like the door, are ſupported by old decayed trunks of trees.</p>
                     <p>A league from the Favorita, lies Radſtadt, a place regularly built, with a ſtately palace, from the centre of which there is a view of all the ſtreets, the middle of which terminates in a long walk.</p>

                     <p>After the electors, and the houſes of Wurtemburg, and Heſſe Caſſel, the Margrave of Baden is one of the greateſt potentates in Germany. His reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:0161700110:95"/>
are about one hundred and twenty thouſand pounds a year. 'I reckon,' ſays <hi>Reiſbec,</hi> 
                        <q>the few days I ſpent at Carlſrube among the happieſt of my life. I ſaw a prince who truly lives only for his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and ſeeks for his happineſs in theirs; one whoſe active and enlightened mind, pervades the whole country, and by its influence, makes all thoſe who have a ſhare in the adminiſtration, patriots like himſelf. Education, police, encouragement to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, and agriculture; every thing, in ſhort, here, breathes a ſpirit of philoſophy, and the warm love of mankind.</q> 
                        <q>O that I could make,</q> ſays he, <q>many millions as happy, as the Margrave of Baden makes two hundred thouſand men.</q> He adds, the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave is as amiable in private life, as he is reſpectable in public, and the margravine is poſſeſſed of every po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite accompliſhment; ſo that the court, to which ſtrangers eaſily get admiſſion, is the beſt ſociety in Carlſrube.</p>
                     <p>The German princes are minute obſervers of form. The ſame eſtabliſhment for their houſhold, and the like number of officers in their palaces are to be found among them, as in the court of the moſt powerful monarch of Europe. The difference lies more in the ſalaries, than in the talents requiſite for theſe places; one paymaſter of the forces in England, has greater emoluments, than a grand marechal, a grand chamberlain, two ſecretaries of ſtate, and
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:0161700110:96"/>
half a dozen more of the chief officers of a Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man court.</p>
                     <p>The Margrave of Baden, like every other ſovereign prince in Germany, has body-guards, who do duty in the palace; foot-guards, who parade before it, alſo horſe-guards and huſſars, all of whom are perfectly well equipped, and exactly diſciplined; a piece of magnificence, which ſeems to be adopted by this prince, merely in conformity with the cuſtom long eſtabliſhed in this country.</p>
                     <p>He keeps on foot no other troops beſides the few which are neceſſary for this duty at the palace, though his revenue is more conſiderable, and his finances are in much better order than thoſe of ſome princes in Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many, who have little ſtanding armies in conſtant pay. He has too juſt an underſtanding, not to perceive, that the greateſt army he could poſſibly maintain, could be no defence to his dominions, ſituated as they are between the powerful ſtates of France and Auſtria; and probably his principles and diſpoſition prevent him from thinking of filling his coffers by letting out his ſubjects to foreign powers.</p>
                     <p>If he was ſo inclined, there is no doubt that he might ſell the perſons of his ſubjects as ſoldiers, or employ them in any other way he might think pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; for he, as well as other ſovereign princes in
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:0161700110:97"/>
Germany, has an unlimited power over his people. If you aſk the queſtion, in direct terms, of a German; he will anſwer in the negative, and will talk of certain rights which the ſubjects enjoy, and that they can ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to the great council, or general diet of the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire for relief. But after all his ingenuity and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctions, you find that the barriers which protect the peaſant from the power of the prince, are ſo very weak, that they are hardly worth keeping up; and that the only ſecurity the peaſant has for his perſon or property, muſt proceed from the moderation, good ſenſe, and juſtice of his ſovereign.</p>
                     <p>Happy, adds <hi>Moore</hi> with <hi>Reiſbec,</hi> would it be for mankind, if this unlimited power were always placed in as equitable hands as thoſe of the preſent Margrave of Baden, who employs it entirely for the good of his ſubjects, by whom he is adored!</p>
                     <p>Among his other eſtabliſhments, a late margrave had the following ſingular one: and this was a noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſeminary of young women, where, by an unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural whim of his, above thirty female creatures were maintained, ſome of whom were always walking by his coach in the garb of hey dukes, and others at night, keeping guard in the palace. The general proviſion for them on their diſcharge, was to be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to ſome petty officer of the houſhold.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="93" facs="tcp:0161700110:98"/>Self-love has ever ſhewn great addreſs in recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciling licentious inclinations, with religion, and in making a compact, as it were, with God, by which favourite vices are retained, and all due homage paid to the Deity in other reſpects. The voluptuous comfort themſelves with the numerous concubines of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi> and imagine God will not be ſo ſtrict, but that a punctual obſervance of many exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal duties, will compenſate for giving way to ſome one frailty; but this too, muſt be ſuch as ſuits their natural diſpoſition. If the revealed truths of our holy religion were liable to ſuch perverſions, it is viſible how ſenſuality would prevail, under no other reſtraint than natural religion. We readily believe what we wiſh, and in ſuch a caſe under the moſt flagitious profligacy, any weak palliatives would be embraced for quieting the clamours of conſcience.

This is by much the largeſt lake in Germany. The <hi>Rhine</hi> which runs through this lake has ſo ſtrong a current, that it is ſaid it does not mix with the waters of the lake. Near Lindau and Brugentz, beſides the fiſh uſually caught in theſe parts, there is alſo a kind of ſalmon-trouts which being taken and pickled, when full grown are exported as a great rarity. They are
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:0161700110:100"/>
generally an ell and an half or two ells long, weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing between thirty and forty pounds. As the fiſhermen cannot always make a market of ſuch large fiſh, they tie a bit of wood to a line, which having paſſed through the fiſh's gills, or the hinder part of the head cloſe up to the wood, they faſten the other end of the line to a ſtake on the ſhore, near their huts: thus, without any danger of loſing it, they can allow the fiſh a range of thirty or forty paces to ſwim in, and keep it alive and ſound, till they meet with a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of purchaſers, or have an opportunity of ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling it for ſome marriage, or other great entertainment, where a fiſh of that ſize is required.</p>
                     <p>The city of Conſtance is well built, populous, and finely ſituated, it lies on the other ſide of the Rhine, over which there is a large wooden bridge, and near it the river turns ſeveral mills. The fortification of the city are ſufficient to defend it well. Here are two mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets every week, to which the people of the towns and villages near the lake reſort with their goods. The town is not very large, but it has a tolerable trade, from the convenience of water-carriage along the lake and the <hi>Rhine.</hi>

                     <p>The emperor <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> called a council here in the year 1414 for preventing a ſchiſm in the church, from three popes pretending to the holy ſee at the ſame
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:0161700110:101"/>
time, but they were all depoſed, and <hi>Martin</hi> V. elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in his room. In the eighth ſeſſion of this council Dr. John <hi>Wickliffe</hi> of Oxford and his doctrines were condemned as heretical, and his bones ordered to be dug up and burnt forty years after his death. In the fifteenth ſeſſion <hi>Huſs</hi> was condemned and delivered over to the ſecular power to be burnt, though he had the emperor's letters of ſafe conduct. And the ſame ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence paſſed upon <hi>Jerome</hi> of Prague, who was likewiſe burnt in this city and the natives ſtill ſhew the place to ſtrangers. This council laſted few years, during which time there were in the city of Conſtance four patriarchs, twenty-nine cardinals, three hundred and forty-ſix archbiſhops and biſhops, five hundred and ſixty four abbots and doctors, ten thouſand ſecular princes, and noblemen, four hundred and fifty common whores, and three hundred and twenty fidlers. The inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants are proteſtants. Conſtance was formerly a free Imperial city but the religious commotions, and the <hi>interim</hi> in 1551 brought it under the power of the houſe of Auſtria; ſo that the Biſhop has little or no authority there, and accordingly reſides at Merſpurg on the other ſide of the lake of Conſtance. The pulpit of the cathedral is ſupported by a ſtatue of <hi>John Huſs;</hi> mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a repreſentation of him to ſerve as a pedeſtal to the pulpit, was intended as a mark of further diſgrace; though it more naturally admits of a very honourable conſtruction.</p>

                        <pb n="97" facs="tcp:0161700110:102"/>In the Dominican convent is the famous <hi>Emanuel Chryſolara</hi> a knight of Conſtantinople, deſcended from a noble family, among the Romans who had removed thither with the emperor <hi>Conſtantine.</hi> He died at the time of the general council of Conſtance, and in ſuch reputation that all orders of men agreed in judging him worthy of the higheſt eccleſiaſtical dignity. The ingenious concluſion of a fine epitaph compoſed for him by <hi>Eneas Sylviaus</hi> deſerves particular notice. My extraction is from antient Rome; to me Imperial Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople gave birth; my remains lie at Conſtance. But what imports it when we die, the fort of felicity and the place of torment being every where equally diſtant? <hi>Reiſbec,</hi> makes the number of inhabitants in Conſtance, to be about ſix thouſand, and the revenues of the bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop ſeven thouſand pounds a year. The Swiſs ſide of this lake he adds is more pleaſant than the oppoſite or German ſide. The beautiful mixture of hills, planted with vines, the ſtraggling appearance of farm houſes, with orchards round them, with the ſmall and varied patches of different kinds of agriculture make it more agreeable to the eye than the Suabian villages, the houſes of which ſtand together as in the towns, and are often encompaſſed by a great corn field, or a wide meadow. Upon the whole, both ſides of the lake are equally well inhabited. The Swiſs ſoil is more ſtony and heavy than the German, and though the Thurzan is one of the beſt ports of Switzerland, it is indebted
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:0161700110:103"/>
to Suabia for a part of the prime neceſſary of life, which it repays in wine and fruits.</p>
                     <p>It was on this ſtage that the celebrated <hi>Geſner</hi> began his career, who in a ſhort time expelled ſo many mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of devils, as is pretended, and cured ſo many hundred bigots. An order of the biſhop of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, having prohibited ſuch miracles in his dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſe, found him taking refuge under the prelate of Salmanſweiler, who by the ſtrength of hard gold, always purchaſes of the Pope, an exemption from the biſhop's power. In oppoſition to the biſhop, the prelate eſpouſed the part of the refugee with much warmth; and his fortune was made by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution he underwent. The prelate's ſteward, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied him with barrels of ſtinking oil, and other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, which he uſed for the purpoſe of his cures, and in the furniſhing of which the other found his account.</p>
                     <p>They little think in Holland, how much they owe to the lake of Conſtance. As matters are at preſent, they can hardly guard againſt the ſand, which being waſhed down from the Alps by the Aar, and other rivers, threatens to ſtop up the mouth of the Rhine, and already leaves room to conjecture ſome violent revolution by the ſand-banks it has raiſed. And if the reſervoir we ſpeak of, did not interrupt by far the greateſt quantity of ſand, which the rapid ſtream
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:0161700110:104"/>
of the Rhine waſhes from the high Buntmerland; Holland muſt have been before this time, buried un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a new ſand, and the courſe of the Rhine being altered, would have totally changed the figure of that country. It is true, theſe changes muſt neceſſarily happen; as however conſiderable the depth of this lake be, it muſt at laſt be filled up, and the ſooner, becauſe the ſtream, as it flows from Conſtance, through the upper parts of Germany, is always deepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its bed, and the lake loſes exactly as much water as it gains in ſand. On the other hand, if we reflect how much ſo great a baſon as this lake may contain; and calculate its contents, as de la <hi>Torre</hi> did thoſe of Veſuvius, we ſhall think the Dutch are ſecure for many generations.</p>
                     <p>Uberlingen, a city on the lake, ten miles north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſt of Conſtance, ſituate on the top of a rock, and ſurrounded with vineyards, was thought ſo pleaſant by the ancient dukes of Suabia, that they made it their uſual reſidence. It has a very good trade, and is famous for its mineral waters, which cure the ſtone, and other diſtempers, and in twice or thrice waſhing, take away all warts. The hoſpital in this town, is the beſt endowed in all Suabia; and the people ſo rich, that they conſtitute as much to the general charges of the empire as many of the princes.</p>
                     <p>Near Zell, is the Abbey of Reichnau, particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:0161700110:105"/>
famous for the large emerald, preſented to it by <hi>Charles</hi> the Great. It is about two inches thick, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing larger than a common folio, and weighs twenty eight pounds, three quarters. Several jewellers have offered fifty thouſand guilders a pound for it; in the church of this abbey lies the above-mentioned liberal emperor, once ſo powerful and glorious, but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards forſaken by every one, ſo that he died in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme indigence in the year 888.</p>
                     <p>The convent boaſts, likewiſe, of being poſſeſſed of the body of St. <hi>Mark,</hi> the Evangeliſt, but this is diſputed with them by the Venetians.</p>
                     <p>In the cloiſters of this abbey, is the picture of a nobleman, who died in 1675, in the 70th year of his age; with a beard reaching to his knees; this puts me in mind, ſays <hi>Keyſler,</hi> of a Flemiſh painter, named <hi>John Meyo,</hi> whoſe beard was of ſuch a length, that when he ſtooped, he could tread upon it, and this peculiarity occaſioned him to be nick-named <hi>Johannes Barbatus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In this neighbourhood, is the foreſt of Bregentz, in the villages of which there has been hitherto, ſays, <hi>Keyſler,</hi> a ſtrange cuſtom, that the unmarried ſons, or ſervants of the peaſants are allowed to intrigue with a girl till ſhe proves with child, and then indeed, but not before, are obliged under ſevere penalties to
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:0161700110:106"/>
marry her. This kind of gallantry they look upon as very innocent, and are ſo ſtrongly attached to it, that when, a few years ago, government was for ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing ſuch a ſcandalous practice; it was nearly occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioning an inſurrection, and the diſpute is not yet terminated.</p>
                     <p>Augſburg, is a free Imperial city, lies in a delightful country between the rivers Lock and Wertach, which unite not far from this place. It is a large populous well built city, eſteemed the capital of Suabia, furniſhed with many noble fountains, adorned with brazen ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of ancient heroes and emperors, and likewiſe with ſome valuable monuments of antiquity. The burghers are reckoned to be 6000; the council is mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and conſiſts of an equal number of reformed, and papiſts. The profeſſors of both religions are eaſily diſtinguiſhable by their dreſs. Augſburg, was formerly the moſt conſiderable city in all Germany for commerce, but the declenſion of the trade of Venice was a ſevere ſtroke to it.</p>
                     <p>The town houſe, is accounted the fineſt in all Germany, the entrance is of poliſhed red mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ſupported by two pillars of white. The cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers contain abundance of hiſtorical and political paintings, with well choſen apothegms, exhorting the judges to impartial juſtice, to prudence, peace, and the fear of God. The whole breadth of it is one
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:0161700110:107"/>
hundred and forty ſeven feet; its length is one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and ten; and its height one hundred and ſeventy five feet. It was completed in 1620, after having been ſix years in building. Its principal or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament, is conſidered to be a ſaloon of fine pictures, in the third ſtory, which is fifty two feet high, fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty eight broad, and one hundred and ten in length, without any pillars to it, and ſurrounded on both ſides by the four princes rooms, as they are called, which are alſo exquiſitely painted. Near the town houſe, ſtands the lofty tower of Perlachthurm. This tower is three hundred ſteps high, and the woman which ſtands above the weather cock is as big as life. In an area adjoining to the tower, is a very fine foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, with the four ſeaſons in braſs, and in the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre, the emperor <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> with appoſite inſcriptions. The palaces of the count de <hi>Fugger,</hi> are very mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent. The Fuggery, as it is called, conſiſts of 106 ſmall houſes, erected in 1519, by the family of the Fuggers, lords of the adjacent country, for the reception of poor burgers, who have annual penſions ſettled on them. On the fine, and well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived aqueducts for the conveyance of water here, from the Loch are ſeveral corn, ſawing, flatting and melting mills, but the water-works in particular are remarkable here, which from five towers convey the water in ſuch a manner, through the city, that not only five large, and beautiful fountains with other public reſervoirs, but alſo the greateſt part of the
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:0161700110:108"/>
houſes are ſupplied by means of theſe works, with that element in plenty. It is ſurrounded with very fine paſture land, beautiful and fertile plains, and with large foreſts full of all ſorts of game. There are more Lutherans than Catholics in this city, who live together in tolerable harmony; their poor are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for in the ſame hoſpital, and to avoid giving of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, the Lutherans ſtand with their hats off when the hoſt goes by. There is no place where the citizens have their dreſſes ſo varied, which is ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated by the magiſtrates, that every perſon of qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and religion may be known by it.</p>
                     <p>In the biſhop's palace, which is otherwiſe an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignificant building, is the hall, in which the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant princes preſented their confeſſion of faith to the emperor Charles V. in the diet, held here <hi>anno.</hi> 1530, and from thence called the Augſburg Confeſſion, which occaſioned a civil war in the empire that laſted ſome years; but it was at laſt agreed, in a ſubſequent diet, held in the year 1555, that the proteſtants ſhould enjoy the free exerciſe of their religion throughout the empire. The magiſtrates have ſince been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of an equal number of proteſtants and catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lics, their ſenate conſiſts of twenty-three Roman ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholics, and twenty-two Lutherans, and their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon council of an hundred and fifty of each; the executive power is in the ſenate, and the legiſlative authority in both bodies.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="104" facs="tcp:0161700110:109"/>The fortifications of this town are not very ſtrong. The duke of Bavaria took this city in 1704, after a ſiege of thirteen days; and after the loſs of the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of Hochſtadt, the ſame year, he withdrew his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon, not thinking it any longer tenable.</p>
                     <p>On the braſs door of the cathedral, among other ſcriptural ſtones, is repreſented the Virgin Mary, tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Eve</hi> out of <hi>Adam's</hi> hip. The revenues of this ſee are ſo conſiderable, that it is generally filled by the younger princes of the electoral houſe of Bavaria and Palatine. The canonries are worth from 1000 to 1700 guilders a year, according to the price of corn. Thoſe of Ratiſbon and Euhitadt, are about the ſame value, thoſe of Conſtance ſmaller, thoſe of Paſſau, better, and theſe again greatly ſurpaſſed by the canon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Saltzburg. The church of St. Maurice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the catholics, and is a fine building.</p>
                     <p>The monks of St. Ulrich diſpoſe of a duſt or pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, called St. Ulrich's earth, recommending it by the name of that holy man, who is ſaid to have baniſhed all the rats out of the city, and neighbourhood into a hole, which is to this day ſhewn in the church, and dedicated to this ſaint. The duſt is dug up from the place where he was buried. If it were true that no rats were to be found in Augſburg, and that any brought there alive, immediately die, it is a wonder that phyſicians and naturaliſts have not examined whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:0161700110:110"/>
ſuch effect proceeds from the ſoil, water, air, herbage or other natural cauſe, as in other places and countries, where ſome ſpecies of animals cannot live. In the iſlands of Malta and Candia, and in Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia, there are no venemous ſerpents or vipers. The iſlands of Gorzo, Ivica, and Ireland, are immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately fatal to all venemous creatures. At Einſidel, a hunting ſeat belonging to the duke of Wirtemburg, not a rat is to be ſeen; and being brought there by way of experiment, they ſoon die. That the bones of dead bodies are a real ſafeguard againſt ſome ſpecies of vermin, is beyond diſpute, and poſſibly the earth of a church-yard, where a great number of bodies are mouldered away, may be effectual againſt rats. This, however, I knew, ſays <hi>Keyſler,</hi> that St. Ulrich's earth, though ſo highly extolled, fails of its power over the rats in other places.</p>
                     <p>The evangelical college, called <hi>Gymnaſium Annaeum,</hi> has a library worth viſiting.</p>
                     <p>In Mr. <hi>Euno's</hi> muſeum in this city, is to be ſeen a collection of about twenty ſorts of bird's neſts; there is a ſimilar collection among the king of Poland's cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſities at Dreſden. Here is alſo a chain ſo ſmall, that a flea may be faſtened to it; likewiſe, ſome ivory cups, with a ring round the middle, which are ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minutive, that they muſt be viewed with microſcopes, one hundred of them being contained in a hollowed
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:0161700110:111"/>
pepper-corn. Augſburg, like Nuremberg, has always been famous for ingenious artiſts. An incredible quantity of Turkiſh, as it is called, and other ſorts of gold and ſilver paper is made here. The fineſt ſilver work is imitated in pewter, but if in a hundred weight, there be but ſo much as half an ounce of lead, the deſign fails. This incomparable pewter is, at the ſame time, ſo ſolid and hard, that ſnips of common pewter may be melted in it over the fire.</p>
                     <p>Among the public buildings, the einleaſs, <hi>i.e.</hi> admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, as it is called, is a very ingenious work; it ſaves the trouble and danger they had formerly of opening the city gates at night for travellers or cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riers, and may be made ſo, that many perſons can come into the city at once, either horſe or foot. To this end, a bridge goes up and down, and as often as a gate ſhuts, another opens with a great noiſe, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be better contrived for ſecurity and conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience.</p>
                     <p>Another curious thing is the engine, which by means of twenty-eight ſprings, one of which is braſs, the water is raiſed up to three towers. The city alſo is not without its fine gardens. In the Gulman gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens are ſome water-works, and fine ſhady walks, which render it an agreeable retreat in the ſummer heats. But in water-works, it is ſurpaſſed by the Schaver gardens, which have alſo a pretty aviary; its
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:0161700110:112"/>
owner is famous for his excellent balſam, of which prince Eugene uſed to order a large quantity againſt the opening of every campaign.</p>
                     <p>The Biſhop is one of the eccleſiaſtical princes of the empire, but has no ſhare in the government of the town. His reſidence is at Dillingen.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reiſbec</hi> remarks, that Augſburg is one of the oldeſt towns in Germany, and one of the moſt remarkable, as it is there and at Nuremberg, we meet with the oldeſt marks of German art and induſtry. In the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth and fifteenth centuries, the commerce of this town was the moſt extenſive of any part of South Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many; and contributed much to the civilization of the country, by the works of art and variety of neceſſaries to the comfort and convenience of life, which it was the means of introducing. Many things originated in this town, which have had great influence on the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of mankind. Not to mention the many impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant diets of the empire held here. It was in this city, that in 952, a council confirmed the order for the celibacy of prieſts; in 1530, as we have already men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, was the confeſſion of faith of the proteſtants, laid before the emperor, and other ſtates of Germany; in 1555, the famous treaty of peace was ſigned, by which religious liberty was ſecured to Germany.</p>
                     <p>Many of the houſes, according to <hi>Reiſbec,</hi> are old
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:0161700110:113"/>
and ugly, and are built with ſo little attention to the rules of modern taſte, that <hi>Winkleman</hi> renounced liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Germany, after he had ſeen them. The houſes in Augſburg muſt not be conſidered as Roman and Greek temples, but as monuments of the architec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the times in which they were built. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever conſiders them in that light, and compares them with the houſes built at Lubec and Nuremberg, in the ſame century, will ſee to how much greater mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence Augſburg had arrived in thoſe early times. He will ſee too, a great deal of real beauty of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, and correſpondence of parts, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>The looks of the inhabitants of Augſburg, have ſomething very ſtriking in them. They are a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound of the Suabian and Bavarian features. The proteſtants are moſt like the Suabians, and the catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lics like the Bavarians. It is an obſervation, which has been frequently made, and undoubtedly a true one, that we may diſtinguiſh a proteſtant of Augſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg from a catholic, by his looks and manner. Any perſon who goes into their reſpective churches, will ſee ſtriking characteriſtic differences in their counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. As the catholics are more rigid at Augſburg than elſewhere, and the followers of the different ſects ſeldom intermarrying, this difference may the more eaſily be accounted for.</p>
                     <p>The police of the place continues <hi>Reiſbec</hi> is very
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:0161700110:114"/>
good, and though the town has no territory, it has no debts. The water-works at Augſburg are more admired than thoſe of Marly, their mechaniciſm is much more ſimple, and the utility of them, much more conſpicuous.</p>
                     <p>Augſburg, however, is no longer what it was. It has no longer a <hi>Fugger</hi> and a <hi>Welſer</hi> to lend millions to the emperor. In this large and handſome town, though formerly one of the greateſt trading towns in Germany, there are no merchants at preſent, whoſe capitals exceed 20,000l. The others, moſt of whom muſt have their coaches, go creeping on with ſmall capitals of 3 or 4000l. and do the buſineſs of bankers and commiſſioners. Some houſes, however, carry on a little banking trade; and the way through Tyrol and Graubundten, occaſions ſome little exchange be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween this place and Germany.</p>
                     <p>After theſe brokers and doers of buſineſs by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, the engravers, ſtatuaries, and painters, are the moſt reſpectable of the labouring part of the city. Their productions, like the toys of Nuremberg, go every where. They have always ſome people of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius amongſt them; but the ſmall demand for their labours, affords them ſo little encouragement, that to prevent ſtarving, they are moſtly confined to the ſmall religious works, which are done elſewhere by the capuchin monks. They furniſh all Germany with
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:0161700110:115"/>
little pictures for prayer-books, and to hang in citizens houſes. Indeed, the arts meet with little ſupport in this country. In other provinces of Germany, mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters appear to be no better ordered; <hi>Mengs, Winckel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, Gluck, Haſſe, Handel, Haydon,</hi> and many others, were obliged to acquire reputation abroad, before their merits were acknowledged at home.</p>
                     <p>There is an academy of arts inſtituted here, under the protection of the magiſtrates. It ſeems, however, like its patrons, to have no other aim, than to produce good mechanics, and preſerve the manufacturers of the city. The ſenate, for ſome time paſt, has been deliberating on ſimilar projects for the encouragement of induſtry. As I take part in any improvement for ſocial happineſs, I was extremely mortified, ſays <hi>Reiſbec,</hi> to ſee that three good intentions were thwarted by the very governors of the town themſelves.</p>
                     <p>The grounds of this oppoſition ariſe chiefly from the form of government. The patricians, who, with a very ſmall addition of the mercantile part, govern the town ariſtocratically, cannot bear to ſee the plebiean enabled, by his induſtry, to carry his head above them. This deſpicable policy, takes its origin in the general corruption of the country. Nine-tenths of the inhabitants, are the moſt infamous raſcals imaginable; fellows, who, on the leaſt ſignal, are ready to cut each others' throats, on account of religion; who ſpend

their weekly wages every Sunday in ale-houſes, and never reflect on the greatneſs of their predeceſſors, but when the liquor is fermenting in their heads. It is impoſſible to give any idea of all the ridiculous inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents occaſioned by religious diſputes. Every day produces ſome occurrence, which makes one both laugh and complain. They never bruſh a cobweb from a public building without mingling religion in the buſineſs. The catholics, who are more zealous than the proteſtants ſupport a controverſial preacher here, as they do in all the towns where the religion is of a mixed kind. This man, at certain times, ſets one half of Augſburg a laughing, the other a raving. He who filled this part when <hi>Reiſbec</hi> was there, was an Ex-jeſuit; who was one of the beſt comedians of the kind he had ſeen. The exceſſive poverty and indolence of the people, makes them regardleſs of their rights: the ariſtocracy would not be ſo powerful, if the people had more attachment to their conſtitution. But <hi>liberty,</hi> ſays <hi>Rieſbec,</hi> is no dearer to them, than the chaſtity of their daughters whom their canons, (whoſe incomes are about 200l. per annum) purchaſe every year by dozens.</p>
                     <p>The other tenth of the inhabitants, conſiſt of ſome patrician families, among whom there are ſome very polite people, merchants, artiſts and clergy. The town, which is 9 miles and half round, contains hardly 30,000 people, and their collective capital, ſcarely exceeds
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:0161700110:117"/>
1,500,000l. ſo that their yearly decreaſe becomes more apparent. Should ſome fortunate circumſtances not ariſe, another century will ſee them reduced to beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary. M. <hi>Nicolai</hi> makes the number of habitants 34 or 35,000 and ſays, there are 28,000 houſes.</p>
                     <p>The more modern part of this town is truly beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful; we are led to believe. that in proportion as the internal reſources diminiſhed, the magiſtracy became more attentive to external decoration; but it is, as with the falſe bloom on a courtezan's cheek, it may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guile the paſſing ſtranger, but whoever ſees her at her toilet, will ſoon be undeceived.</p>
                     <p>The city has its water for the table from the river Loch, which runs at ſome diſtance from the town. The aqueducts conveying it, are much to be admired. As the court of Bavaria has it in its power to cut off this indiſpenſible neceſſary of life; by threatening the town with ſo doing, it often lays it under contribution. But having beſides this, other means of keeping the high-council in a ſtate of dependance; to ſecure itſelf from this oppreſſion, it ſo ſeeks the Emperors protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as to become wholly dependent on him, and is there as it were banded about by both courts. The Emperor's miniſter to the circle of Suabia, generally reſides in this town, which ſecures to his court a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual influence with the magiſtracy. There are Auſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trian and Pruſſian recruiting parties quartered here,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:0161700110:118"/>
and the partiality of the government to the former, is very remarkable. In the war of 1756, the citizens were divided into equal parties for the two courts. The Catholics conſidered the emperor as their god; and the proteſtants did the ſame by the king of Pruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia. The flame of religion conſequently had very much kindled a civil war amongſt them.</p>
                     <p>Ulm is the moſt conſiderable city in Suabia. It lies on an uneven ſpot of ground, on the Danube, where that river unites with the Iler, and firſt becomes navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable for veſſels of conſiderable burthen. This city is ſituated forty miles weſt of Augſburg, but the road, for the moſt part, is ſo ſandy, and the ſecond ſtage ſo tedious, by means of the ſloughs, that it takes up nine hours to perform the journey.</p>
                     <p>Compared to the neighbouring cities, it is well fortified; they have here a very particular cuſtom, which is not to ſuffer ſtrangers to go on the ramparts, without paying a guilder. All the burgers are under the ſame reſtraint, the privilege of walking free, being allowed only to the patricians and their friends. This does not proceed ſo much from an apprehenſion of any clandeſtine correſpondence, as from avarice; for theſe patricians ſhare the hay and fruit growing on the ramparts among themſelves, which makes them cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious againſt whatever may occaſion any diminution of their profit. That which engages the attention of
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:0161700110:119"/>
travellers, in this city, is the cathedral, not to be equalled by any in Germany, that of Straſburg ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted. The ſteeple is four hundred and one ſteps high; nothing can be finer than the proſpects from the top of it, the whole country round it being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely level. In caſe of fire, eſpecially from lightning, ſixty-three large copper kettles always filled with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter are hung up in different parts of the tower, and on the roof of the church, with a machine for drawing up proviſions for the watchmen in the tower. There is a very handſome ſtone-bridge here over the Danube, which greatly favours the trade of the inhabitants in linen, fuſtians, hardware and wool. It is one of the largeſt and beſt built places in Germany, and the town-houſe is a very handſome edifice. Large quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities of wine are brought here from the Rhine, the Neckar, and from Conſtance, to be tranſported down the Danube. The Reformation prevailed here about the year 1529, and the magiſtrates, as well as the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants are moſtly Lutherans. The city of Ulm, ſays <hi>Keyſler,</hi> is however very far from being what it formerly was, when it uſed to be a common ſaying, <q>The lords of Ulm, the merchants of Nuremberg, and the burgers of Augſburg.</q> And this ſaying al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, was equally current, <q>The power of Venice, the ingenuity of Nuremberg, and the fire-arms of Straſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg; let the world ſhew the like.</q> But this declen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is not the peculiar misfortune of Ulm: many other Imperial free-towns, join in the like complaint.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="115" facs="tcp:0161700110:120"/>Of all the circles of the Empire, Suabia is the moſt divided, it contains four eccleſiaſtic, and thirteen lay-principalities, nineteen independant prelacies and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies, twenty-ſix earldoms and lordſhips, and thirty-one free cities. The prime directors of the circle are the biſhop of Conſtance and the duke of Wirtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg, which laſt has the ſole direction of all that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates to military concerns.</p>
                     <p>The mixture of the various forms of government and religious ſects; the oppreſſion exerciſed by the greater over the leſſer; the game conſtantly played by the Emperor, who poſſeſſes many pieces of detached country in Suabia, which depend not on the circle, and can in conſequence of his privileges as archduke of Auſtria, extend his poſſeſſions in it by various ways, are circumſtances which give the cultivation of the country, and the character of the inhabitants, a moſt extraordinary caſt.</p>
                     <p>In ſeveral of the port-towns, the higheſt degree of cultivation may be ſeen in the midſt of the moſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage wildneſs; a great degree of knowledge and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh of manners, mixed with the groſſeſt ignorance and ſuperſtition; traces of liberty, under the deepeſt oppreſſion; national pride, together with a contempt and neglect of the native country; in ſhort, all the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial qualities in ſtriking contraſt, and oppoſition to each other.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="116" facs="tcp:0161700110:121"/>Thoſe parts of Suabia which belong to the greater potentates, ſuch as Wirtemberg, Auſtria and Baden, are certainly the moſt improved. The whole of Sua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia may comprehend about 900 German ſquare miles, and two millions of people. More than half of theſe are ſubjects of the three above-mentioned houſes, though they do not own, by a great deal, one half of the land.</p>
                     <p>If the ſmall German lords would keep themſelves within due bounds; if they were not deſirous to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear greater than they really are; if they were more affectionate to their ſubjects; if they were not inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to the ſofter feelings of humanity; and ſo hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile to the Muſes and the Graces, the very ſmallneſs of theſe ſtates, would eſſentially contribute to their happineſs. For although a ſmall country muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily part with ſome money, to procure what it wants from abroad, yet if the governor does not require many luxuries, a prudent economy and management will keep them within due bounds. Beſides, as moſt of the ſovereigns in this part of the world are Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic, and the rich foundations in the neighbourhood lies open to their younger children, they are not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbered with the burthen of making any other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion for them. Many of them alſo belong to the church, and their preferments in that line, might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent their laying any burthens on their ſubjects. But the happineſs of their people, is never their ſtudy,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:0161700110:122"/>
from the want of family ties, they conſider them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as unconnected with the country, and think their only buſineſs is, to act like generals in an enemy's land, and plunder where they can. Were this not the caſe, their exemption from ſupporting any military eſtabliſhments, the eaſe with which a ſmall country may be governed, the diſtance from the political diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractions of greater ſtates, the ſecurity that other powers of Germany cannot play the great conqueror over them, and many other circumſtances, might be improved into bleſſings in theſe ſmall ſocieties.</p>
                     <p>The courts of Stutgard and Carlſrube are the only ones which ſeem to have any ſenſe of making the ſubject happy. The reſt appear vain enough to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the people created for them, and not they for the people. The treaſurers of theſe petty lords, with ſome of whom, ſays <hi>Reiſbec,</hi> I was well acquainted, make a very eſſential difference between the intereſts of the prince, and thoſe of the people; and though the ſubject is under no apprehenſion of groſs tyranny; yet he is by no means ſafe from having his pocket picked by the nicer operations of the finance.</p>
                     <p>The education of theſe lords, is ſo thoroughly neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, as hardly to admit better hopes. It is almoſt univerſally in the hands of prieſts. Part of theſe are monks, whoſe knowledge is in a manner wrapped up in their cowls, and part are young <hi>abbés</hi> juſt come
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:0161700110:123"/>
from ſchool, and who only ſeek to make their fortune, by the connections of their pupils. The monk teaches that a reverence to ſaint <hi>Francis, Benedict,</hi> or <hi>Ignatius,</hi> a regular attendance on maſs, telling beads, and giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alms to monaſteries, are objects which will make amends for many tranſgreſſions of another kind.</p>
                     <p>My excurſions, he adds, in the different ſtates of the circle of Suabia, have not produced the rich en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment I promiſed myſelf. I viſited a dozen, free Imperial towns, in which, notwithſtanding the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publican form of government, not a ſpark of liberty or patriotiſm was to be ſeen. The inhabitants have, through the oppreſſion of more powerful neighbours, long ſince, loſt all ſenſe of the value of independence; but though aſhamed to mention the name of their native country out of their own walls, within them they mimick the forms of old Rome, and after the manner of thoſe governors of the world, inſcribe their public buildings of ſtate with <hi>Senatus, Populuſque, Hallenſis, Bopſingenſis, Nordlingenſis,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>In the fifteenth century, the Imperial cities of Sua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia, acted a very different part. They were then united in league, not only with each other, but with the cities of Franconia and the Rhine. Even the emperor had cauſe ſometimes to be alarmed at their increaſing power, which made <hi>Charles</hi> V. diſunite them. From the time of the aſſociation of the
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:0161700110:124"/>
Hanſe-towns, the gold flowed from all the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try into the cities. Theſe were the excluſive ſeats of induſtry, and their wealth drew into their dependance the neighbouring princes, who, at that time, lived by robberies. If the ſpirit of trade, which then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed, had ſuffered them to place more value on the poſſeſſion of landed property, they would to this day have preſerved ſomewhat of their former ſplendour; as with their power they might have made many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts, and with their wealth, many purchaſes.</p>
                     <p>All hopes are now vaniſhed of their ever again be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming conſpicuous. As ſoon as the prince, diſcovered the value of induſtry, and gave it free encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in their dominions, it fled into their protection, and abandoned the dark walls of cities, in which a ſyſtem of monopolies, little policy, and narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded envy of the ſucceſsful, laid it under ſuch ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold reſtraints. The conſequence of which is, the towns are ſo reduced, as to be obliged to ſell the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle landed property they are poſſeſſed of, to diſcharge their debts. This has lately been the caſe with Ulm; the largeſt town in Suabia next to Augſburg.</p>
                     <p>The great population which prevails in the circle is wonderful, when the untoward circumſtances of the country are conſidered. By untoward circumſtances; is meant the extortion of petty maſters, who all keep their miſtreſſes, their ſtag-hounds, their French-cooks,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:0161700110:125"/>
and Engliſh horſes; the perpetual quarrels among neighbours, which ariſe from the various peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and governments of the empire; the ſmall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits attendant on induſtry, within ſuch a confined ſpot; and laſtly, the conſtant decreaſe of coin, owing to the ſums of money expended by the governors of the country, in ſearch of foreign luxuries.</p>
                     <p>There is, however, an integrity ſtill adherent to the German character, and a kind of jovial humour about it, that makes the princes of the country ſhud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at any acts of wanton oppreſſion and cruelty, which, with the ſame powers, would no doubt be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed in Spain, Italy, and even in France. Give a German prince, but room for his dogs and horſes, (for about the welfare of theſe, he is uncommonly ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous) and you have little to fear from him in other reſpects.</p>
                     <p>There is one object, however, in which there is great need of reformation, that is, in the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of criminal juſtice. The torture is not yet aboliſhed in theſe countries, and they ſtill behead, hang, break upon the wheel and impale. It is not very long ſince they burned a woman for being a witch. The civil law too, is not yet reduced to that perfect ſtate which might be deſirable. Not that all forms ſhould be aboliſhed, and every thing left to the wiſdom of the judge, under the pretence that forms

                     <hi>CHAP. IX.</hi> Of the CIRCLE of WESTPHALIA.</head>
                  <p>THIS circle is ſurrounded by the United Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, the Northern or German ſea, the Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and the Electoral Rheniſh circles, and the circle of Burgundy. Its extent amounts to 1250 ſquare Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man miles. The air towards the north is cold, and the ſoil almoſt one continued moraſs or barren ſand. The horſes are large, and the hogs in high eſteem, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially the hams, known by the name of Weſtpha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia hams. The ſouthern part has a warmer atmoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phere, and a much better ſoil, which produces paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and ſome corn.</p>
                  <p>The principal rivers are the Weſer, the Ems, the Lippe, and the Roer. It contains ſeveral ſovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:0161700110:128"/>
as the biſhoprics of Oſnaburg, Munſter, Pader<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born and Liege; the abbeys of Corvey, Stablo, &amp;c. the duchy of Cleve, with the county of Mark, the duchies of Juliers and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>, Naſſau-ſiegan, and Naſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſau Dillenburg; the principalities of Eaſt Frieſland, and Mors, with ſeveral counties, ſeignories, and the Imperial cities of Cologne, Aix-la Chapelle and Dort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund. It has no capital, but Munſter is its moſt conſiderable town. This circle reaches in length from north to ſouth, about two hundred miles, and nearly the ſame diſtance from eaſt to weſt.</p>
                  <p>The ſummoning princes, and directors of the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, are the biſhop of Munſter, and with him alternately the electors of Brandenburgh and Palatine, as dukes of Cleve and Juliers, both of whom, in this directory, enjoy together but one voice. The diets of the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle are uſually appointed at Cologne, but ever ſince the year 1718, none have been held. The archives belonging to it, are kept at Duſſeldorf.</p>
                  <p>With reſpect to religion, this circle is one of the mixed.</p>

                     <head>The BISHOPRIC of PADERBORN,</head>
                     <p>Is bounded by the country of Lippe towards the north; by the duchy of Brunſwick on the eaſt; by the county of Waldeck on the ſouth, and by the duchy of
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:0161700110:129"/>
Weſtphalia on the weſt. Its greateſt extent from weſt to eaſt, amounts to eleven, and from north to ſouth, to about nine German miles. It contains twenty caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, ſixteen monaſteries, and ninety-five pariſh churches. The Roman-catholic is the eſtabliſhed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. This country is remarkable for the variety of its ſalt-ſprings and other fountains. In the Tranſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Royal Society, December 1665, mention is made of a ſpring in this country which loſes itſelf twice in twenty-four hours, and returns with a great noiſe, and force ſufficient to turn three mills not far from its ſource; the inhabitants call it Bolder-born, or the Boiſtrous ſpring. And in the Tranſactions of January following, there is an account of another re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable fountain in this dioceſe, called Metborn, which is a treble ſpring, two ſprings of which, though not a foot and a half diſtant from each other, have very different qualities; the one being limpid, blew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh, and luke-warm; the other cold as ice, turbid and whitiſh; of which water, all fowls that drink, die ſoon after in ſtrong convulſions; but giving them a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle common ſalt, will keep them alive longer, and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar will quite recover them. The third ſpring, which iſſues about twenty paces from the others, is of a greeniſh colour, very clear, taſtes both ſour and ſweet, but very pleaſant; and from its weight ſuppoſed to be a mixture of the other two.</p>
                     <p>It is probable, that it is the water from this ſpring,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:0161700110:130"/>
which is ſerved up at the tables of the principal <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berges</hi> in Paderborn; and perhaps all Germany does not produce a lighter, or more pleaſant water to drink. It moſtly reſembles the Seltzer, but is even lighter and more pleaſant to the taſte. But to thoſe who drink freely of it, though with ever ſo ſmall a portion of wine, it is apt to occaſion a ſlight fever on the brain; which however goes off ſoon, if the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of water drank has not been immoderate. This water, like ſome of the delicate wines in the ſouth of France and in Italy, loſes all its fine qualities, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes inſipid, if tranſported to any diſtance. If like the Seltzer water it would bear carriage, the revenue it would produce, muſt be immenſe.</p>
                     <p>The biſhopric of Paderborn was founded by <hi>Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magne,</hi> and the cathedral church conſecrated by Pope <hi>Leo</hi> III. in 796.</p>
                     <p>Paderborn, the capital city, takes its name from the head of the river Pada, which ſprings in a torrent near the cathedral of this city, and afterwards runs into the Lippe. At this fountain, according to the Magdeburg chronicle, moſt of the inhabitants of Saxony and Weſtphalia were baptized, about the year 780, by or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of <hi>Charlemagne,</hi> the natives being heathens before he conquered this country. A great part of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent country is very barren, and has little to boaſt of beſides hogs-fleſh, deer, and other veniſon; in the
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:0161700110:131"/>
middle of it, however, are high mountains which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain iron mines.</p>
                     <p>The town formerly enjoyed the immunities of a city of the empire, and carried on a great trade, but at preſent its commerce is inconſiderable, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants ſubſiſt chiefly by agriculture, and breeding of cattle. The emperor <hi>Charlemagne,</hi> and ſeveral other emperors and German kings reſided and held their diets here formerly.</p>

                     <head>The BISPHOPRIC of MUNSTER,</head>
                     <p>Is bounded on the eaſt by the biſhopric of Oſnaburg and Paderborn; on the ſouth by the county of Mark; on the weſt by the duchy of Cleve and Zutphen, and on the north by the counties of Bentheim and Stein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>furth. It is the largeſt of all the Weſtphalian biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rics, being an hundred miles in length, and eighty in breadth.</p>
                     <p>This country is generally level. It has, however, ſome agreeable heights, but no great or lofty moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains. The extenſive heaths which are ſeen in it, ſerve for breeding of cattle. There are alſo ſome fruitful plains, large woods, and turf, together with good quarries of ſtone, and rivers abounding in fiſh. No part of Weſtphalia produces better bacon, which
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:0161700110:132"/>
is exported all over Europe, and ſo much admired, that it produces double the price of any other.</p>
                     <p>At the time of the reformation, the Lutheran doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine found many adherents in this part of the world, but it was afterwards ſuppreſſed. There are ſeveral nobles here who are ſtill of the proteſtant perſuaſion, but the eſtabliſhed religion of the country is catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic.</p>
                     <p>The biſhop is a prince of the empire, and at the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et ranks with the biſhop of Liege, but in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that the biſhop of Oſnaburg, always ſits between both. In the circle of Weſtphalia, he is the firſt ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moning prince and director of the circle. The chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter conſiſts of forty members, who are all nobles, and muſt prove their nobility; and once a year the ſhield and helm of the youngeſt canon are carried in proceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, with beat of drum through the city, that every one may enquire into his pedigree.</p>
                     <p>Munſter, the capital of the biſhopric, lies in a very fruitful and pleaſant ſpot, on the rivulet Aa, or Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha. The city is large, rich, and populous. It is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended by a ſtrong citadel, built to keep the inhabitants in awe, after the inſurrection made by John of Leyden, in 1635, who, pretending divine inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, drove the biſhop and magiſtrates out of the city,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:0161700110:133"/>
cauſed himſelf to be proclaimed king, and held out a fourteen months ſiege againſt them. He made one of his concubines queen, but afterwards cut off her head, becauſe ſhe would not approve of all his mad projects. The biſhop having got a reinforcement of troops, at laſt ſeized the city by ſtratagem, and took the anabaptiſt king priſoner, who having been car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in deriſion to moſt of the countries in Germany, was the year following put to death with red-hot pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, and his bones hung up in an iron-cage, on the top of a ſteeple.</p>
                     <p>At Munſter, in 1648, was concluded the treaty which eſtabliſhed the proteſtant religion, and put an end to the thirty years war. This treaty has been made the baſis of almoſt every ſubſequent treaty, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially as to religion. It is ſometimes called the treaty of Weſtphalia, at others, the treaty of Oſna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg, becauſe the proteſtant princes held their confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences at Oſnaburg, as the catholic princes did theirs at Munſter. The Swedes had been engaged eighteen years in this war, and got poſſeſſion of an hundred ſtrong towns in the empire; and by this treaty they ſecured the duchies of Bremen and Verden, weſtern Pomerania, the iſland of Rugen, and the city of Weiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and might have made ſtill better terms, if they had not adhered to the part of the proteſtants.</p>

                     <head>The BISHOPRIC of LIEGE,</head>
                     <p>Lies in the Netherlands, and is bounded on the north by Brabant and Guelderland: on the eaſt by the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies of Limburg and Juliers; on the ſouth by Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emburgh and the Ardennes, and on the weſt by Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant and the country of Namur. It is in length from north to ſouth, about twenty German miles, and about half as much in breadth, but the breadth varies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing twice as much in ſome places as it is in others. Some ſmall diſtricts lie within the juriſdiction of the duchies of Brabant and Luxemburg.</p>
                     <p>The ſoil is fertile in corn and paſturage, and yields wine, which reſembles the middling wines of Burgun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and Champagne, together with very conſiderable foreſts and mines of copper, lead, iron, and ſtone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coal; as alſo many good ſtone-quarries, and among them, likewiſe ſome marble. This biſhopric is alſo celebrated for its mineral-waters; namely, thoſe of Spa, and Chaude-fontaine.</p>
                     <p>The principal rivers by which it is watered, are the Meuſe and Sambre, which unite in the county of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur.</p>
                     <p>The chief exports of this country, and particularly of the town of Liege, conſiſt of beer, fire-arms, nails, ſerge, leather and ſtone-coal; all which are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:0161700110:135"/>
from hence in prodigious large quantities, more particularly fire-arms, ſuch as guns, piſtols, and ſwords, with which in time of war they ſerve almoſt all Europe. The low prices for which they will ſell their guns and ſwords, is almoſt incredible. No na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can come in incompetition with them, in point of cheapneſs for theſe articles.</p>
                     <p>In the circle of Weſtphalia, this Biſhop is third in rank. He is one of the moſt conſiderable eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal princes in Germany. His annual revenue is about three hundred thouſand ducats. The chapter of Liege conſiſts of ſixty major-canons, who are moſt of them of noble extraction, and have the power of electing their biſhop. There are twenty-four other canons, who have no ſhare in this election. It is computed there are in this dioceſe, or rather principality, fifty-two baronies, eighteen walled towns, and four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred villages well peopled. The Biſhop can lay no taxes on his ſubjects without the conſent of the clergy, nobility, and commons, who are called the three ſtates of the country.</p>
                     <p>Liege is ſuppoſed to derive its name from a little rivulet, which runs through this country, and falls into the Meuſe. It is a very large, and a very popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous city, of a triangular form. There are ſeveral hills and vallies within the walls, and ſome iſlands made by the Meuſe, which is here divided into three
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:0161700110:136"/>
branches, which, after having paſſed through the ſtreets under ſeveral bridges, unite again a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the town. The town is ſeated in a vale between two mountains, the higheſt of which lies to the north, and the other to the eaſt. In the valley between theſe mountains runs the river Meuſe, and it is here very broad.</p>
                     <p>This town has ten large ſuburbs, in which are a great number of religious houſes and churches; which laſt, with thoſe in the city, make an hundred in all. In the city and ſuburbs are likewiſe ſeveral public places or ſquares, as alſo, a cathedral church dedicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to St. Lambert, in which there are many reliques. The Biſhop's palace and the cathedral, are large and ſpacious buildings, the latter is built with red ſtone, and has a quadrangle within. This city is about four miles in circumference, and contains about an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty ſtreets. According to the opinion of ſome travellers, no city in Germany or France, can equal it in fine churches, convents, and other religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous foundations. The fortifications of the city are but mean, and being commanded by hills which ſurround them, are incapable of reſiſting a large army; but the citadel, which is ſituated on a very high hill, is a place of ſome ſtrength; yet it may be a queſtion, whether it is not of more diſſervice than real ſervice; as it is by no means ſtrong, and from its elevated ſituation, if the enemy once got poſſeſſion of it, they could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moliſh
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:0161700110:137"/>
the town in a few hours. The duke of Marlborough took this city in the year 1702.</p>
                     <p>Liege is ſtiled an Imperial city, under the protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of its Biſhop; but this prelate is ſovereign of the city and dioceſe, and the citizens have ſuffered more than once very ſeverely for diſputing his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. Moſt of the ſtreets are very narrow, but there are many of a good breadth. There are alſo ſome very ſpacious and handſome private edifices; but in general, the buildings are mean and ſhabby. On the banks of the river there are ſome very pleaſant walks, which are much reſorted to in ſummer. The envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons are ſo extremely pleaſant, that it has obtained the name of the paradiſe of eccleſiaſtics. It is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſaying, likewiſe, that it is the hell of women, becauſe they are obliged to live a very laborious life, the women doing all the laborious offices both at home and abroad; the purgatory of men, becauſe they are almoſt all governed by their wives; and the paradiſe of monks, on account of their rich benefices. The Engliſh jeſuits have a college here, delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſituated on the ſummit of a high hill, with a very fine garden. This college is now appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated to the education of youth in the catholic per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion; of which there are in general from ſixty to ſeventy ſcholars, moſtly the ſons of our nobility and gentry. It is wonderfully well fitted up for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and the diſcipline and care that is taken of the
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:0161700110:138"/>
young gentlemen, is equalled in no place. Great pains are taken with their education. There is ſcarce an art, ſcience, or language, which is not taught in this ſeminary. The proficiency in claſſical learning therefore cannot be expected to be very great. In ſhort, the method of ſtudy generally purſued in this college, reſembles the plans of our moſt conſiderable modern academies in the vicinity of the metropolis, which are certainly very different from the mode of education in our great ſchools, ſuch as Weſtminſter, Eton, Wincheſter, and one or two more.</p>
                     <p>At the oppoſite extremity of the city, is a convent of Engliſh nuns, whoſe chief ſubſiſtence is obtained by the education of young ladies, of their own re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious perſuaſion. They have generally the ſame number of young perſons under their tuition, with the college of Engliſh jeſuits, who are likewiſe chiefly the daughters of our catholic nobility and gentry. The penſion as it is called, or the terms for board and education, are very moderate, about 25l. a year, every thing included, and are kept in ſickneſs and in health, they alſo profeſs to teach a multiplicity of things. The nuns, as well as the jeſuits, are almoſt all, either from this country or from Ireland, and many of them related to the moſt conſiderable catholic families in one or other of them.</p>
                     <p>In the convent, there is likewiſe a penſion for ſuch
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:0161700110:139"/>
ladies as chuſe to come and board there. This pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is kept in a building adjoining to the convent, but not within the inner walls of the convent. It is upon a very frugal plan; the penſion is very reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, the dinners ſumptuous, they all dine in one eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-room, and have ſeparate chambers to retire to, for tea and to ſit in. The only inconvenience is, that being within the outer gate of the convent, they are obliged to diſmiſs their friends, and return home themſelves by nine in the evening. In other reſpects, this is a very agreeable and cheap place for thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to come to, who wiſh to live comfortably and agreeably on a ſlender income. It may not be amiſs to remark, that ſeparate dinners are not allowed, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in illneſs,</p>
                     <p>In the monaſtery of St. William, juſt without the walls, lie the remains of that famous Engliſh travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, Sir <hi>John Mandeville,</hi> who having viſited almoſt all the great cities of Europe, preferred Liege to any of them, and accordingly paſſed the latter part of his days in this city. The univerſity was ſo conſiderable, that <hi>Meibonus</hi> relates, there were twenty-one kings ſons reſident here in 1131. At preſent it is in no eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teem. There is alſo a public library in this city, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the council-houſe, but it is by no means conſiderable, and is not frequented. The environs of this city are highly pictureſque and beautiful, but the internal parts carry a very dingy hue, owing to the
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:0161700110:140"/>
clouds of ſmoke continually iſſuing from ſuch an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe number of little forges, as are to be found in its precincts.</p>
                     <p>About three Engliſh miles from Liege, at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of a beautiful valley, and on the banks of a very pleaſing ſtream, which deſcends with conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able rapidity from the mountains, ſtands the little village of Chau de-fontaine. This village is famous for its baths, the waters of which are of a ſulphurous nature, and always hot. The inn where the baths are, is not much frequented. The houſe is very old faſhioned, but the accommodations, as to the wines and diet, are far from bad, and the charges not extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant. There are many families who make this houſe their reſidence for weeks together, tempted to it ſole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the retiredneſs of the ſituation, the beauty of the ſcenery, and the occaſional luxury of the baths, which are made uſe of more for pleaſure than health. They are of a very agreeable temperature as to heat; and the expences attending the care of them, very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable.</p>
                     <p>Near Liege, in the road, however, from Spa to Aix-la-Chapelle, ſtands the town of Verviers; a place for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly of not near ſo much import as at preſent. This town owes all its conſequence to its woollen manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures, which are now carried on to very great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent; and of late years, they have even rivalled us
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:0161700110:141"/>
very ſucceſsfully, in ſeveral of the northern parts of Europe, in this branch of commerce.</p>
                     <p>About ſeventeen miles ſouth-eaſt of Liege, is the village of Spa, which has been long famous all over Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope for its mineral waters. It is ſeated in a ſpaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious valley ſurrounded by hills, part of which are covered with woods, and on the north-ſide, more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, with very ſteep and craggy mountains, which immediately overlook the town.</p>
                     <p>The town of Spa, according to <hi>Thickneſſe,</hi> is ſituated in a ſtony, mountainous country, on the banks of which, in ſummer, is a murmuring ſtream, but which in winter, is ſometimes a rapid river; the air is good, and the environs in general are pleaſant, though rude and uncultivated, having much the appearance of a part of the globe, which has been broken up by earthquakes, or ſome violent convulſions of nature; ſo that all the luxuries of life are brought daily on wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men's backs from Liege. In the winter, the place is deſerted.</p>
                     <p>The account given by <hi>Pliny</hi> of the waters of this place, is that they taſted of iron, were purgative, and a ſovereign cure for tertian agues and the ſtone. The three principal ſprings are the Pouhon, the Geron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtere, and the Savoniere. The Pouhon is in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the town, or rather village; for Spa, ſtrictly
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:0161700110:142"/>
ſpeaking, is no more than a village, though, from the numerous and ſplendid buildings erected within theſe few years, for the accommodation of ſtrangers, many of which are of the firſt diſtinction; it is more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable than many towns. It is from this ſpring that moſt of the water is ſupplied, which is ſent into foreign countries. Over the ſpring is a ſtone build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, on which there is an inſcription recounting the virtues of theſe waters; that they remove obſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, diſſolve hard ſwellings, dry up a ſuperfluity of moiſture, and ſtrengthen weak limbs, if drank in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per quantities, and under the direction of the faculty.</p>
                     <p>Health is now become but a ſecondary object that attracts ſuch a ſplendid aſſembly of both ſexes, which now reſort to this delightful ſpot. Numbers reſort here for the ſake of gaming high, and by their dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity and addreſs, bid fair to amend or improve their ſhattered fortunes: a crowd of another ſort at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend only as paraſites, and dependant on ſuch illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious perſonages as keep public tables, and make a ſplendid appearance. Others come there to make the beſt market they can of the commodities they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port. Some aim at procuring new acquaintance and correſpondents. Others reſort here purely to enjoy themſelves and the wholeſome air of the climate. Some again have diverſion and amuſement principally in view, and ſpend their time here more for the ſake of the good and grand company that comes here, than
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:0161700110:143"/>
out of any regard to the virtue of the waters. In a word, this moſt delightful ſpot is the centre and ſeat of all joy and pleaſure; which contribute towards the countleſs miracles that are wrought here beyond the power of words to expreſs.</p>
                     <p>He who takes into his conſideration, only the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berleſs amuſements of this delicious ſpot, the various games, the balls, the plays, the walks, and other en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainments that are carried on here, and ſucceed each other without intermiſſion, muſt doubtleſs imagine, that a life ſo led in the daily gratification of every ſcene, is able to remove a variety of little inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences, without the leaſt aid or aſſiſtance from theſe ſalutary ſprings. Such, for inſtance, as the yellow jaundice, which is principally owing to ſome light and trivial obſtruction, the hyp or vapours, which are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the reſult only of an unpolite deportment, from a too peeviſh and moroſe huſband, and more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, that petty diſorder called the green-ſickneſs, a maiden-diſtemper for the immediate cure of which, the young lover is the infallible phyſician.</p>
                     <p>There are three different ways of lodging, as well as living, at Spa.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe perſons who come there alone, or in ſmall parties, with a ſlender retinue, and little baggage, lodge in general at public inns.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="138" facs="tcp:0161700110:144"/>In all theſe there is attendance ſufficient, and a more plentiful larder than is reaſonably requiſite; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that their tables or ordinaries are principally intended for the reception of ſuch perſons as are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to frequent theſe houſes, for the recovery of their health.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond method of living at Spa, is by hiring furniſhed houſes, as in Bath or London. Of this ſort there are abundance to be met with, of all ſizes and prices Princes, and perſons of high rank, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe keeping a public table there, generally adopt this mode.</p>
                     <p>The third method is to hire furniſhed apartments. And this is more calculated for ſmall families, or ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle perſons, who do not like the hurry and buſtle of an inn. Theſe perſons generally ſend for their provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions from the adjacent inn, at ſo much per head. Or if ſingle gentlemen, they will find it much the cheapeſt method to dine at the public ordinaries, where they will meet with very good company, pick up freſh acquaintance, and indulge themſelves in a variety of different converſations.</p>
                     <p>The cuſtom of paying viſits, except among perſons of ſome rank, is now almoſt wholly laid aſide. The eſtabliſhed etiquette, however, is that the inferior pays the firſt viſit, whether he arrives firſt or laſt, and
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:0161700110:145"/>
the return is conducted according to the rank and character they reſpectively bear. If the diſproportion is very great, no return at all is expected. Princes, however, generally teſtify their regard for any perſon of diſtinction by a perſonal viſit. The counter-viſits are, in general, little more than bare ceremony; they are reduced to a formal tour in a chariot, or perhaps on foot, to leave a card at ſome perſon's houſe, who never fails to be out of the way, or, at leaſt, denied.</p>
                     <p>Moſt people, however, pay no viſits at all, but to ſuch perſons as are manifeſtly their ſuperiors: they content themſelves with teſtifying their reſpects to their bottle-companions, or ſuch others as they are perſonally acquainted with, who on the other hand frequently circumvent them, by waiting on them firſt.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe who delight in tranquility and repoſe, may reſide there in as retired and ſolitary a manner as they pleaſe, and there are rural objects enough to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage their attention.</p>
                     <p>Amongſt the multitude of perſons of both ſexes, who reſort to the Spa, there are a variety of charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and among them many very amiable ones; and beſides the friends uſually to be met with there, it is impoſſible to fail of finding ſome ſtrangers, whoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany and converſation prove exceedingly engaging: theſe ties of friendſhip, thus ſuddenly contracted, and
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:0161700110:146"/>
grounded on a ſympathy of tempers and conformity of characters, eſtabliſh an openneſs of heart, which is the life and ſoul of ſociety, and renders it inexpreſſibly delightful.</p>
                     <p>Time, at the Spa, flies away with an amazing ſwift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; though it muſt be allowed, two parts in three of it, are ſpent in nothing but amuſements; yet the whole body of its viſitors is in perpetual motion, all ſeemingly, at leaſt, as buſy as bees; and not a drone to be met with in the whole hive. The amuſements follow ſo cloſe at the heels of each other, in that moſt agreeable receſs, that there are ſome people who have been there for ſix weeks ſucceſſively, and ſometimes longer, who have never dreamt of taking any ſurvey of the country, or in ſhort, any of the parts ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent.</p>
                     <p>The ſeaſon for reſorting to the Spa, does not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly commence till the end of June, but ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in its utmoſt beauty and perfection about the latter end of July, and the whole month of Auguſt.</p>
                     <p>Moſt of the company are at the Pouhon well, by five o'clock in the morning, which gives the town the appearance of a fair at that hour, it being then likewiſe crowded with a multiplicity of horſes and carriages waiting to carry the company to the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronſtere and Savoniere ſprings. This latter ſpring
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:0161700110:147"/>
is ſituated on an eminence, at the eaſt ſide of Spa, and is much about half a league from the town. The road, however, is rugged, and in ſome meaſure trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome and unpleaſant, eſpecially in the going there, it being upon an aſcent all the way, inſomuch that though the diſtance is ſo inconſiderable, moſt of its viſitors go there in carriages or on horſeback, leſt the walk ſhould be apt to throw them into too great a perſpiration, or put them out of breath; in either of which caſes, as the water is very cold, it might prove of dangerous conſequence, as is well known by too fatal experience.</p>
                     <p>This ſpring, or well, is contained in a very ſmall baſon, round which the drinkers ſtand, in order to be ſerved; and is covered with a dome or cupola, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of free-ſtone, and the whole ſurrounded with a low wall.</p>
                     <p>At one of the ſprings there is a large building, with a fire in it when the mornings are chilly, to which the company retire, after having drank a glaſs or two of the waters. Here you meet with a mixed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of people of all ranks and degrees, citizens, monks, nuns, lords and ladies, and ſometimes kings or princes, who diveſting themſelves of their high dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, converſe there with the ſame familiarity, as if they were all upon a level.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="142" facs="tcp:0161700110:148"/>There are horſes and carriages to be let here, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the morning only, or for the whole day. The price of the horſe, to go to either of the diſtant wells, is about two ſchellings, each ſchelling ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence Engliſh. Thoſe who engage them for the whole day, in order to enjoy the pleaſure of an evening's ride, pay about three ſchellings. In the very height of the ſeaſon, probably ſomething more. The carriages let out for hire, which are low phaetons, very ſhabby, old faſhioned and clumſy, are cheap in proportion.</p>
                     <p>With regard to the general expences attending a reſidence at Spa, they are not, even in the height of the ſeaſon, more than thoſe of the little watering-place on the weſtern coaſt of England, according to the ſtile in which a perſon lives. The wines and diet, on the other hand, are much more ſumptuous than they are to be met with in England on almoſt any terms. There are likewiſe ſeveral circulating libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in this place, tolerably well ſtocked, not only with novels, but with all modern publications, even of works of literature.</p>
                     <p>This frequently induces ſtrangers to make conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable purchaſes from theſe libraries. And French books may be met with here on as reaſonable terms, as in any town of Europe, and in as great variety in point of aſſortment.</p>

                        <pb n="143" facs="tcp:0161700110:149"/>As the latter part of the forenoon, in the month of July and Auguſt, is frequently too ſultry to ride out in the morning, it is generally filled up between theſe libraries, and the aſſembly rooms, where the pharo-bank is held, and to which all ſtrangers are admitted gratis. The principal aſſembly room is ſeated on an eminence, about half a mile from the town, command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a moſt delightful view. It is called the Vauxhall. Here a great number of parties and ſingle gentlemen breakfaſt on their return from the wells, a band of muſic playing the whole time. When this repaſt is over, the pharo-bank opens, and continues dealing for about a couple of hours. The capital ſtock is about a 1000 louis d'ors. No perſon is allowed to punt leſs than a guinea, except the ladies, who are indulged with the liberty of playing for ſilver. A hazard table is then introduced for about half an hour, or a little more, juſt before dinner, when the ladies, for the moſt part retire, and this cloſes the morning's amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the public-rooms. There are card-tables for thoſe who chuſe to make parties of whiſt and piquet. The evening, till duſk, is generally dedicated to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſions on horſeback, or in carriages; the ſquare be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing full of carriages, and horſes ſtanding for hire about five o'clock every evening. There are alſo two or three very fine public walks, where the company meet as the ſun gets nearer the horizon, and at which the band of muſic belonging to the rooms occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally play. The mountains overhanging Spa, preſent
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:0161700110:150"/>
a number of very agreeable walks, which have been cut through the woods at a great expence, in zig-zag paths, all up the ſides of them. The beautiful views that preſent themſelves in climbing up theſe moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, the proſpects of which vary every inſtant, am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply recompence the toil. No ſooner does night cloſe in, but all the company repair inſtantly to the rooms. Of theſe there are two, both very elegant and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perb. The one in the town, and the other about half a mile diſtant, called the Vauxhall, as has been already obſerved. At one or other of theſe rooms, there are balls, three or four times a week. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervening nights, there are only card-parties, a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menade, and the pharo-bank. It is this latter which ſeems to keep every thing alive in theſe regions of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipation. The large heaps of gold diſplayed on the cloth, which covers the pharo-table; the number of people of faſhion who are playing at it; the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts which are made by many of them to break the bank, by doubling the ſtakes from time to time, is ſufficient to intereſt the attention of a number of ſpectators unconnected with the play. And it ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times happens, that a ſpirited player is ſucceſsful enough to break it. A ſingular inſtance of which, I will relate, from <hi>Thickneſſe.</hi> Some years ſince, a ſtranger, of plain but decent appearance, took his ſeat at the pharo-table at Aix-la-chapelle; the bank was at that time rich, and the ſtranger, after having loſt ſome money, threw down his pocket-book, full of
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:0161700110:151"/>
notes to a high amount, and declared he was <hi>at the whole bank.</hi> The ſtranger won, the banker trembled, and the company ſtared at the cool diſpaſſionate man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in which the ſtranger received his good fortune, who ordered a perſon, that ſtood near him to take the money, and retired; but not before, a reduced half<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pay captain, who had been looking on, exclaimed aloud, <q>Good God! if I had won but a twentieth-part of that ſum, what a happy man it would have made me!</q>—Would it, ſaid the ſtranger? then you ſhall be happy; and in a ſhort time, a ſervant was ſent, who put into the officer's hands a purſe, contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the twentieth part of the money won. A few days afterwards, it was known, that the king of Pruſſia had been <hi>incog.</hi> at Aix-la-chapelle, and that he was the ſtranger, the gambler, and the generous donor.</p>
                     <p>The prince Biſhop of Liege, is ſuppoſed to receive ſeveral thouſands a year from the bankers belonging to this pharo-bank, for giving them his licence to hold it. At the end of the aſſembly-room in the town of Spa, is a very neat, little French theatre, where there are plays three times a week. The actors, in general, are toler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. The parterre of this theatre, by being boarded over on ball-nights, ſerves as an apartment for the pharo-bank. For perſons of rank and faſhion, there is a club, where the members dine together every day. It was inſtituted by the Engliſh. Every per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon muſt be balloted for, and one black-ball is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:0161700110:152"/>
to exclude the candidate. Dreſs and ſuppers are never thought of at Spa. Every one dreſſes a l'Angloiſe, and the heat of the weather, the early riſing, and late dinners, make people wholly unſolicitous about eating or retiring from the rooms.</p>
                     <p>With reſpect to thoſe who come there only for the waters, there are divers caſes where they do not agree with the conſtitution of thoſe invalids who drink them; and it is certain, there will always be viſitors who will never receive the leaſt benefit from them. Some drink them out of caprice, or elſe follow ſuch inſtructions as are whimſical and injudicious; ſome ſwallow down too large a quantity; and others drink them too ſparingly; ſometimes without any proper preparation, and ſometimes by altering the qualities of the waters, with an intermixture of drugs preſcribed by phyſicians, unacquainted with the practice pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to the wells, or incapable of foreſeeing in what manner they will operate. In ſhort, there are abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of errors committed by invalids, either through the non-obſervance of a proper regimen, or the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudent choice of a ſpring unfit for their ſervice, as well as a miſtake in the quantity or manner of drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the waters, on which the cure of their particular diſorder in a great meaſure depends.</p>
                     <p>It is univerſally known, the Geronſtere ſpring is moſt ſuitable in thoſe caſes where there is a weakneſs
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:0161700110:153"/>
of the fibres, or a contraction proceeding from a too lively or quick ſenſibility: it is fit likewiſe for weak ſtomachs, and ſuch as have tender conſtitutions, whoſe fibres are too inactive; ſuch as are in a languiſhing condition, or are afflicted with catarrhs and other pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toral diſorders.</p>
                     <p>The impetuous rains and violent hurricanes that frequently happen in this country, make the ground and ſtones ſhrink and give way ſo, that the roads are almoſt impaſſible in winter, except on the new chauſſé from Spa to Liege;—however, if the roads are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what rough, the mountains through which thoſe paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages are cut, afford a very pleaſing proſpect.</p>
                     <p>Theſe rough-hewn, unpoliſhed rocks, intermixt with a great variety of ſtately oaks and humble ſhrubs, ſtrike the eye of every curious traveller, who has any adequate idea of a beauteous landſcape. For my own part, ſays the author of a tour to Spa, the firſt time I travelled that road, I ordered my coachman to halt at ſeveral places, that I might look about me, and make my obſervations on the agreeable proſpects which the narrow paſſages cut through the mountains, preſented themſelves from time to time to my view. I was agreeably ſurprized, ſays he, to find that an unculti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated ſpot of ground, with no other covering than a worthleſs, pitiful ſtock of broom, or heath, ſhould ſo delightfully delude me, as to appear, a-far off, like a
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:0161700110:154"/>
charming verdant graſs-plat, the enamel of which, and its odd fantaſtic knots or compartments, were amuſing beyond meaſure; and this variety of charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deluſions occur frequently in excurſions round Spa.</p>
                     <p>The other two ſprings are at a ſmall diſtance from the town.</p>

                  <div type="part">
                     <head>The BISPOPRIC of OSNABERG,</head>
                     <p>Is bounded on the north by Lower Munſter, on the ſouth by Upper Munſter, on the eaſt by the principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Minden, and on the weſt, by Munſter and Lingen. It is about ten German miles in length, from north to ſouth; and from eaſt to weſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween four and ſix German miles.</p>
                     <p>This was the firſt biſhopric founded by <hi>Charlemagne,</hi> who granted extraordinary privileges to this ſee, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empting it from all manner of ſervice and homage, even to the Emperor himſelf. At the peace of Oſna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg, in 1648, it was ſettled, that this biſhopric ſhould alternately have a Roman catholic and a Lutheran biſhop, and that the chapter might chuſe and ſelect the former, either from among themſelves or elſewhere; but that the latter ſhould always be a prince of the houſe of Brunſwick, and of that branch of the houſe of Brunſwick from which his preſent majeſty is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended. When they have a popiſh biſhop, he is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fragan
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:0161700110:155"/>
to the archbiſhop of Cologne, but the proteſtant biſhop, who at preſent is his majeſty's ſecond ſon, his royal highneſs the duke of York, has no eccleſiaſtical juriſdiction over the catholics. The Biſhop is a prince of the empire, and ſits at the diets of the empire in the council of princes, between the biſhops of Munſter and Liege. Among the ſeveral ſtates of the circle of Weſtphalia, this biſhopric is fourth in rank, and his principality produces him yearly 180,000 Rheniſh flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rins, which is 15,500l. a year; this, according to <hi>Reiſbec.</hi> But we have reaſon to believe, it produces twice the ſum.</p>
                     <p>This country is partly Roman-catholic, and partly proteſtant,; neither the proteſtant nor the Roman-catholic biſhops have the right of reformation; but every thing muſt remain as it ſtood in 1624. No Jews are tolerated in this country.</p>
                     <p>The cathedral is in the hands of the Roman-catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lics; the chapter conſiſts of twenty-five canons, not above four of which are proteſtant, and theſe have no vote in the election of a popiſh biſhop. Some of the other churches are proteſtant. There are not above four towns in the whole country, and about 20,000 fire-places or hearths.</p>
                     <p>About one half of this biſhopric conſiſts of heath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands, which yield above ten ſorts of turf, as alſo paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turage.
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:0161700110:156"/>
This country, likewiſe, produces as much rye as ſupplies the inhabitants, and above five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred ſtills. Conſiderable quantities of corn are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported here from the principality of Minden. The breed of cattle, likewiſe, is but ſmall, and they are moſtly ſupplied from Frizeland.</p>
                     <p>The inhabitants are diligent and laborious. The country people ſeldom ſit by ſtoves, as they do in other parts of Germany, but by fire-hearths, where they perform their principal work, which is ſpinning. Above ſix thouſand of them go every year to Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, where they now, till, cut turf, and do other work for hire. The meaneſt of them, notwithſtanding, carry home twenty, and the beſt workmen full ſeventy florins; ſo that the ready money, which they by this means bring into the country, may be reckoned at 200,000 florins.</p>
                     <p>The greateſt and moſt beneficial occupation of the inhabitants conſiſts in ſpinning yarn, and manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turing a coarſe kind of linen; which is conveyed by the Engliſh, Dutch, and Spaniards, to Guinea and America, and brings annually into the country above a million of rixdollars.</p>
                     <p>Oſnaberg, the capital, is ſituated in a fine plain, and beautified with ſeveral, noble, public buildings. It derives its name from a bridge over the river Haze.
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:0161700110:157"/>
The manner of building here is antique, and the number of houſes, excluſive of the public and bye-buildings, amounts to 1200. The town is not po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous, not above five hundred children being bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized in a year. Its magiſtracy is Lutheran, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choſen annually. The Biſhop's palace is fortified like a caſtle. They are ſaid to have the beſt bread and beer here, which is to be met with in Weſtphalia, and they carry on a conſiderable traffic in linen, cloth, and hams. Its principal ſubſiſtence depends on its linen trade manufactured in the country, and in the foreign manufacturies, vended here in retail. There are three well-built hoſpitals here, excluſive of ſome ſmaller ones. This city was alſo formerly, one of the Hanſe towns. The epiſcopal palace belongs to the electoral houſe of Luneburg, who uſually reſigns it to the catholic biſhop for his reſidence. This town is poſſeſſed of the right of making copper, which it exerciſed for the firſt time in 1740. In the hall of the council-houſe, where the celebrated peace of 1648 was concluded, are ſeen pictures of the ambaſſadors who aſſiſted at it.</p>
                     <p>The duchies of Oldenburg, and Delmenhurtſt, which the king of Denmark, at the deſire of the Ruſſian court, exchanged for a part of Holſtein, with the prince of Gottorp, now make a very good principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, containing 78,000 people, and yielding every year about 40,000l. Engliſh. It is from this part of Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:0161700110:158"/>
many, but particularly from Frieſland, that they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the ſtrong fine coach-horſes that trot ſo proudly over the pavement of many Italian cities, and are ſometimes, though more ſeldom, met with in France. The court of Peterſburg brought up many of theſe horſes to mount its heavy cavalry, who look very formidable on theſe terrible cattle. The Dutch cui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſiers are ſupplied from Holſtein, and in fact, the horſes of that country are preferable to thoſe of Frieſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land and Oldenburgh for this ſervice, and with the ſame ſtrength they connect more alacrity and life.— The Dutch call them <hi>vaſt-trotters</hi>—they are too heavy to gallop, but will trot at an amazing pace, with a heavy drag behind them, for a whole day together. They are coal-black, ſeventeen hands high, and very nobly creſted. The price of a pair of handſome ones, about fifteen years ago, was 120 pounds Engliſh.</p>

                     <head>THE DUCHY OF CLEVE,</head>
                     <p>Lies on both ſides the Rhine, and is bounded by part of Holland towards the north; by Munſter on the eaſt; Juliers on the ſouth, and Brabant towards the weſt. It is ſixteen German miles in length, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween four and five in breadth.</p>
                     <p>The air is ſound, and the weather moderate. This duchy has high lands and low bottoms; the former of theſe are furniſhed as well with arable-lands, as with buſhes; the latter, particularly towards the Rhine,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:0161700110:159"/>
are, on both ſides fenced with ſtout dams, excluſive of which, there are alſo ſummer-dams, which ſcreen the rich meadows and paſtures lying near the river againſt the ſummer-water, to the heights of between eleven and ſixteen feet. This country abounds alſo in corn, fruits, and all manner of plants. The breed of horned cattle, and horſes, is conſiderable. In general, the country is well cultivated, and contains many delightful ſpots, particularly near the town of Cleve. All kinds of game are in great plenty here, in particular, on the weſt ſide of the Rhine. The river divides the country into the eaſtern and weſtern parts, and receives in its courſe, the rivers Roer, Ems, and Lippe. The Meuſe alſo touches on a part of the duchy. All theſe rivers abound in fiſh, and the ſalmon, pike and carp, of the Rhine, are in great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt.</p>
                     <p>In this duchy are twenty-four towns, and three im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities, or <hi>municipia.</hi> The inhabitants are chiefly catholics, but all religions are tolerated in this duchy. The country, in many parts, is mountainous and woody. The commerce of this country is very much facilitated by the navigation on the Rhine, and on the Meuſe. The ſovereignty belongs to the King of Pruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia, as elector of Brandenburgh, whoſe anceſtors laid claim to it, in the beginning of the laſt century; by virtue of a marriage, with one of the co-heireſſes of the
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:0161700110:160"/>
laſt prince of the male line in this duchy. This claim was confirmed by the emperor Leopold, in 1678.</p>
                     <p>The yearly revenues ariſing to the King of Pruſſia, from this duchy, are eſtimated at 356,000 rix-dollars, and the ſum which goes to the war-cheſt, at 340,000.</p>
                     <p>Cleves, the capital of the country, in Latin <hi>Clivia,</hi> derives its name from the town and citadel, being built on the declivity of a hill, between the Rhine and the Meuſe. It is large and well-built, but ſurrounded by cliffs and craggy rocks, about twelve miles from Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meguen. The town is well peopled, but neither the city nor the citadel are of any great ſtrength. A ſilk manufactory was eſtabliſhed here in 1755. The en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>virons are pleaſant, and in front of the gates are ſome very fine walks. From this place there is a canal runs into the Rhine, which is about three Engliſh miles diſtant. On the weſt-ſide of the town, lies the park of prince <hi>Maurice</hi> of Naſſau, very much admired for its grottos, canals, and fine water-works; and over theſe on a high hill, called the Sternberg, may be diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, at the diſtance of fifty miles, the city of Utrecht, with forty other cities and great towns, twelve of which, are ſeen through viſtos, and at the end of each ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears a fine city.</p>
                     <p>The private houſes in Cleves are very ſhabby, and the only public buildings of any note are the great
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:0161700110:161"/>
church, a monaſtery of Capuchins and another of Franciſcans. As the King of Pruſſia is ſovereign of the country, the religion countenanced by government is Calviniſm; but moſt of the churches are in poſſeſſion of the catholics. In the great hall of the citadel is an inſcription by which it appears that <hi>Caius Julius Caeſar,</hi> dictator in the year 698 from the building of Rome, having firſt conquered the adjacent country founded the citadel of Cleve.</p>

                     <head>The PRINCIPALITY OF EAST FRIEZLAND</head>
                     <p>Is bounded by the German ocean on the north; by Oldenburg on the eaſt; by Groningen on the weſt, and by Munſter on the ſouth. It is about ten Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man miles from north to ſouth, and as many from eaſt to weſt.</p>
                     <p>This principality is ſituated in a moiſt and thick air, but much purified by the ſea-breezes. Spring and ſummer appear here ſomewhat later than in other parts of Germany; hence alſo their corn-harveſt happens later. The country is throughout level and low; whence alſo it is ſecured by expenſive dikes againſt the inroads of ſea-floods. Along the ſea lies a marſh uncommonly fertile, which has a clay bottom, and is more uſed for meadow and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-land than for agriculture.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="156" facs="tcp:0161700110:162"/>The remarkably rich paſtures of this country yield an important breed of cattle, producing horned cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, horſes and ſheep in great numbers, and alſo of an extraordinary ſize. In theſe parts one cow will yield near twenty-four cans of milk, and from this very rich milk is made moſt excellent butter and cheeſe. On the contrary, in the heart of the country, the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom is for the moſt part ſandy, as alſo fenny and mooriſh, but yields turf for burning, which, in the great ſcarcity of fuel here, is very advantageous and indiſpenſably neceſſary to the country. The greateſt part of the produce of the earth, as alſo culinary herbs grow to a large ſize, but are ſeldom ſo good as they are in other countries. Fowl and veniſon are alſo to be had, and there are geeſe, whoſe weight exceeds twenty-four pounds. In harveſt, a great number of fieldfares and ſnipes generally appear. The ſea here yields all ſorts of fiſh, as oyſters, muſcles, ſea-crabs, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>The principal river is the Ems, which comes from the biſhopric of Munſter, and runs through the Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lart into the North Sea. The Dollart is a bay between Eaſt Friezland and Groningen, which aroſe out of a conſiderable tract of country, and was ſwallowed up by the ſea. For, in the year 1277, the water firſt broke into this tract of land with a violent flood, and no proper oppoſition being made to to it, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:0161700110:163"/>
bay gradually aroſe, on whoſe circuit there ſtood formerly above fifty great and ſmall towns.</p>
                     <p>Trade and navigation are carried on here very briſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. The produce of the country, and the commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties exported hence are large horſes (numbers of which are ſent to Rome and ſold by the pair, in proportion to their ſtrength and beauty for three or four hundred dollars and more, and uſed for coach horſes) horned cattle, butter, cheeſe, rape-ſeed, and fine cloth. On the other hand, every thing the country is in want of, is conveyed hither by ſhipping.</p>
                     <p>The land-ſtates conſiſt of the nobility, and the ſtates, as alſo of the villagers. Between theſe and the reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing houſe certain articles of agreement have been gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually entered into, ever ſince the time of count <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the ſecond, which, with the peculiar imperial or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances iſſued at the ſame time are conſidered as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial laws in the government of the country. Eaſt Friezland has alſo many other privileges.</p>
                     <p>The ancient counts were created princes of the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire in 1554. This princely houſe became extinct in 1744, upon which <hi>Frederic</hi> II. King of Pruſſia, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of an expectancy granted to the houſe of Brandenburg, by the Emperor Leopold in 1604, took poſſeſſion of Eaſt Friezland; a proteſt to which was
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:0161700110:164"/>
made by the houſe of Brunſwic—Luneburg, before the regency of Eaſt Friezland and the aulic council of the empire, who claims this principality by virtue of an alliance entered into in 1601 with Prince <hi>Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Eberhard,</hi> a former-prince of Friezland.</p>
                     <p>Aurich, the ancient reſidence of the prince, and which is even to this day the ſeat of the provincial college, ſtands almoſt in the centre of the country. The ancient reſidentiary caſtle is ſurrounded with ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts and ditches. In the garriſon church the Calvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts perform their religious worſhip. In the town it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf we ſee the Lutheran church, the provincial houſe, the Latin ſchools and a public alms-houſe. So early as the year 1519, Aurich received the Lutheran doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine.</p>
                     <p>Emden, the chief city of the principality lies near the river Ems. It is a ſtrong ſea-port town, and a place of great trade. The houſes are high and well built, and the town-hall is a magnificent ſtructure. This place contains a harbour, an old fort, and a cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del belonging to the prince and lying on the Ems, to which the ſhips arrive by means of a broad canal drawn from that river, called the Dolf. From this city there is a fine proſpect of the German Ocean, and likewiſe of the adjacent country.</p>

                        <pb n="159" facs="tcp:0161700110:165"/>The things principally worthy of notice here are the town-hall and council-houſe, the library and the great church. Moſt of the inhabitants are proteſtants or Calviniſts, and there are ſome Lutherans, catholics and Jews. In 1750, an Aſiatic company was eſtabliſhed here by the King of Pruſſia.</p>
                     <p>Emden, ſays <hi>Reiſbec,</hi> is by no means ſo fine a city as Bremen. The King of Pruſſia has taken an everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſlike to the inhabitants, who, to ſay the truth, when taken in the lump, are not the moſt amiable peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. They are very remarkable for their lazineſs and inſenſibility. It was a great while before the good en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours of the King of Pruſſia, its ſovereign, to turn this people to commerce and ſhip-building were at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with any ſucceſs. The Eaſt-India Company, which he had eſtabliſhed at a great expence, was ruined within a few years of its erection, and certain republican prejudices, which the burgers of this city affected, rendered all the King's other efforts for a time ineffectual. At length the activity and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the government, attended with ſome fortunate circumſtances, got the better of the impediments to that extenſion of commerce, for which the city is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly well ſituated. The herring-fiſhery, which the King took every ſtep, in his power, to encourage, brings in large ſums of money every year. The Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican war aſſiſted the King's deſigns very much, and the
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:0161700110:166"/>
trade of the place now begins to be very flouriſhing. Emden exports many Weſtphalian linens to the ſouth countries, and provides a part of Weſtphalia with ſpices and wines. They have alſo a conſiderable trade in cheeſe.</p>
                     <p>The revenues ariſing from this principality are very conſiderable. They, many years ago, greatly exceeded 100,000 rix-dollars, and ſince it came under the Pruſſian regency, have been very conſiderably in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed.</p>
                     <p>The principality conſiſts at this time of three towns and nine prefecturates, which were formerly lordſhips, but are now in like manner with the towns, hereditary and proper eſtates of the ſovereign prince, as alſo of lordſhips which have their own hereditary lords, but are ſubject to the ſovereign, ſupreme juriſdiction of the prince.</p>

                     <head>PYRMONT.</head>
                     <p>This country lies between the biſhopric of Pader<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born, and the electorate of Hanover. The lower part of it contains an uncommonly beautiful and pleaſant vale, which extends four miles in length, and as many in breadth. All around is environed by lofty green mountains. In this vale are the celebrated mineral-ſprings and ſteel-waters. This country is now ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:0161700110:167"/>
to the Prince of Waldeck. His annual revenues, as ſovereign of this country, are eſtimated at near 30,000 rix-dollars, to which the mineral ſprings con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute a very great proportion.</p>
                     <p>Theſe waters are often frequented by perſons of the higheſt rank. The king of Pruſſia has been known to drink them. They are exceedingly palatable, and come neareſt to the Seltzer-waters, in their taſte and their qualities. Pyrmont is about a day's journey from Hanover; to which place, there is a very fine road, moſt part of the way with very large and well en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graved ſtones, every quarter of a German mile, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning the exact diſtance from Hanover; a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance very unuſual on the continent. After Spa, every place of this kind appears inſipid. Yet in the ſeaſon, there is a great deal of very good company from Hanover, and the other large cities in the north of Germany. A very magnificent hotel or inn, for the accommodation of ſtrangers, has been lately built, where the apartments are fitted up in the moſt modern taſte, and the charges not ſo extravagant as the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of the outſide of the building is magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent. This hotel is much ſuperior to any even at Spa. There is, as in moſt inns of Germany, an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding good <hi>table d'hote,</hi> of two or three courſes—with variety of good wines for very moderate prices. Were not the approach to this place on the ſide of
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:0161700110:168"/>
Holland and France, ſo exceedingly diſagreeable, owing to the heavy ſands of Weſtphalia, it would be much more frequented than it is at preſent. They have their public rooms every night, and their aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, and their pharo-banks, as in other watering-places, but every thing here is on a ſmall ſcale, to what it is at Aix-la-chappelle and at Spa. Neither is the country round about it ſo diverſified and pictu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſque. The country is more open and more level; nor are the mountains ſo finely wooded. On the contrary, the rooms, where the company meet, lie, as it were, in a hole, near the ſpring-head; and not only carry with them the appearance of great antiquity, but they are alſo very gloomy, and ſeem ſituated, as it were, in a ſwamp, ſurrounded with wood. For thoſe, however, to whom the drinking of the waters is any induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for repairing hither, there are but few watering-places, where they will meet with ſuch excellent ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodations, more reſources of amuſement, or a greater variety of good and reſpectable company.</p>

                     <p>Is a free Imperial city, and has its name probably from its warm-baths, which have been celebrated from times of old. It is ſuppoſed to have taken its ancient name from <hi>Serenius Granus,</hi> lieutenant general of Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia Belgica, in the reign of the emperor Adrian, who
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:0161700110:169"/>
having diſcovered the hot-ſprings here about the year 53, was the firſt perſon who erected ſome beautiful buildings over them, after the manner of the Roman baths, and then built a palace for himſelf in this city; in the confirmation of which, the inhabitants ſhew a piece of ancient architecture, which they call <hi>Turris Grani,</hi> and aſſert, that it is a part of that general's pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace. This town is ſituated in a fruitful valley, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſed with woods and mountains, and yet the air is eſteemed exceeding wholeſome.</p>
                     <p>The emperor <hi>Charlemagne,</hi> was ſo delighted with the beauty of this place, that he choſe it for his reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. He is interred in the church of Notredame, where they keep his ſword, his belt, and the four evangeliſts, written in letters of gold, which are uſed at the coronation of the emperors. Part of the jewels of the empire are alſo kept in this city: all which are ſhewn only once in ſeven years; except at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of ſome great perſonage, and then they are taken out and put in again, in preſence of the chief-magiſtrates, and ſuch eccleſiaſtics as are on the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation. In this city, ought properly to be, the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronation of a Roman king or emperor.</p>
                     <p>The ſtadthouſe is a ſtately building, built in 1533, and adorned with the ſtatues of all the emperors ſince <hi>Charlemagne;</hi> in this hall are ſeveral fine pieces of painting, particularly one of the reſurrection, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:0161700110:170"/>
of <hi>Charlemagne</hi> giving the charter to the city of Aix. In the middle of the market-place, is a noble fountain, admired for the largeneſs of its dimenſions and its curious workmanſhip. On the top of the fountain, is a large braſs ſtatue of <hi>Charlemagne,</hi> in gilt armour, with his face towards Germany. On the edge of the ciſtern, is an inſcription, which mentions, that <hi>Granus,</hi> a Roman prince, was the firſt perſon who diſcovered and built the hot-baths in this city. On the inſide of the cathedral, where <hi>Charlemagne</hi> was firſt interred, hangs a very large crown made of ſilver and braſs, gilt, ſurrounded with forty-eight ſtatues, a foot high, and thirty-two leſſer ones, all of ſolid ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. The emperor <hi>Frederic,</hi> removed the body of <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemagne,</hi> buried part of it in the choir, under the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, in a ſilver coffin, and covered it with a tombſtone of white marble; with the buſt of Proſerpine upon it, ſuppoſed to have covered <hi>Julius Caeſar's</hi> tomb.</p>
                     <p>The principal reliques which pilgrims reſort hither to adore, are 1. The Virgin <hi>Mary's</hi> gown, that ſhe was dreſſed in at the incarnation, made of wool. 2. The cloth girt about our Saviour, when he was crucified; 3. A piece of the cord, with which he was bound when he was delivered to Pilate; 4. Some of the blood of St. <hi>Stephen</hi> the martyr, enchaſed in gold and precious ſtones, on which the emperors are ſworn at their inau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guration; 5. The picture of the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> with our Saviour in her arms, ſaid to be done by St. <hi>Luke;</hi>
                        <pb n="165" facs="tcp:0161700110:171"/>
6. A manuſcript of the goſpels, by the patriarchs of Jeruſalem and Conſtantinople. In the upper part of the church is a throne of white marble, where the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors uſed to ſit, and which is ſuppoſed to be the ſame which <hi>Charlemagne</hi> placed there nine hundred years ago.</p>
                     <p>The territory of the city is called the kingdom of Aix-la Chapella, and lies quite round it. In it are to the number of three thouſand ſubjects. This city is governed by a mayor, two burgomaſters, fourteen al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermen, and 120 common-council men. The mayor is appointed by the duke of Juliers, the reſt of the corporation by the city companies, of which there are fourteen or fifteen.</p>
                     <p>The hot-baths occaſion it to be much reſorted to, of which there are three within the walls. One of them is the ſame in which <hi>Charlemagne</hi> uſed to bathe, with his nobility and great officers of ſtate. Theſe baths riſe ſo hot, that they let them cool twelve hours before they are uſed. There is alſo a fountain of warm-water, which is drank in ſummer, for many chronical diſorders.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe who have deſcribed the virtues of theſe wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, relate, that they are good againſt all affections of the nerves; ſuch as convulſions, palſies, numbneſs, tremblings, gout, ſciatica's, contractions, ſwellings,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:0161700110:172"/>
diſtempers of the bowels, ſtomach and ſpleen, inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate head-achs, vertigo's, barrenneſs, abortion, and ſcabs of all ſorts.</p>
                     <p>The city of Aix profeſſed the proteſtant religion ſoon after the Reformation, on which account the people were very much harraſſed by the Imperialiſts during the civil wars of Germany; till at laſt popery was eſtabliſhed again, and is now the only religion publicly profeſſed by the inhabitants; but proteſtants are permitted to reſide here, and go to a church with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the walls, under the dominion of the Dutch.</p>
                     <p>The emperors were uſually crowned in this city for five hundred years after <hi>Charlemagne,</hi> and by the golden-bull, made in the reign of <hi>Charles</hi> IV. the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror was to receive his firſt crown here; but the cuſtom of crowning him with three crowns, as was formerly the way, hath been long ſince diſcontinued; and at every coronation, the magiſtrates, who have the cuſtody of <hi>Charlemagne</hi>'s ſword, ſhoulder-belt, and the goſpel in golden letters, which are uſed in that ceremony, deliver them to the elector of Mentz, and the emperor declares, that his being crowned elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, ſhall not prejudice the privileges of the city of Aix.</p>
                     <p>Among other holy relics, the greateſt curioſity, which that city has produced, is the Latin Teſtament,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:0161700110:173"/>
above-mentioned, really found in the ſepulchre of <hi>Charlemagne,</hi> and conſequently it muſt be at leaſt nine hundred years old; it is written on fine thin paper, or vellum, ſomething like gold-beaters ſkin, twenty-times doubled; the characters are in large ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitals, well preſerved and quite clean, except at the beginning of St. John's goſpel; but there it is much ſoiled, becauſe all the emperors were ſworn on this book at their coronation; and there it was, ſaid <hi>T</hi>—. they laid their dirty hands.</p>
                     <p>The degree of cultivation, and riches of Weſtpha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia, ſays <hi>Reiſbec,</hi> far exceeded all ideas I had formed of them, and quite aſtoniſhed me. All the cities and villages abound in tradeſpeople. Muhlheim, Elber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feld, Solingen, Sorſt, Ham, Duisburg, Meurs, We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, Cleve, and ſome other cities have capital manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures in them. They make a great quantity of linen and woollen, and ſupply almoſt all the country of the Upper Rhine, Suabia, and Franconia, with white threads; they have beſides manufactures of handker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs, ſilks, and cottons; they prepare ſteel and iron at Solingen, better than in any other part of Europe, England alone excepted. Their commerce extends all over the Netherlands, part of Franconia, and the whole empire.</p>
                     <p>This wonderful induſtry, united to the natural fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tility of the country, renders this one of the richeſt,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:0161700110:174"/>
and moſt remarkable parts of Germany; a gentle ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration, and a ſecurity againſt deſpotiſm, derived from the ſtates of the country, contribute not a little to the happineſs of this circle. The inhabitants are chearful, hoſpitable, and well-mannered; they may be quoted, as a new inſtance to be added to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berleſs ones, already given of the little influence which religion has over the civil condition of men, when not attended with other local circumſtances. Though the proteſtants in this circle are far from being ſo enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened, or ſo tolerant, as thoſe of their perſuaſion in other countries; and though they are much more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted to ſenſual enjoyments, than their brethren of other places, they are the moſt induſtrious people, and the beſt ſubjects that can be found; nor does the bigotry of the Catholics hurt the manufactures and agriculture of the country, their education only direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to ſuch objects as have no connection with man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners or civil ſociety. Every thing, therefore, depends upon the habits amidſt which men grow up.— When once induſtry is habitual to a people, the moſt object ſuperſtition will have no influence on their tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral felicity; the prieſts themſelves will render their ſermons conformable to the manners of the country, nor will the monkiſh theoriſts be able to overturn them.</p>
                     <p>There are as many legends in this country, as in Cologne, nor are the people leſs fond of proceſſion
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:0161700110:175"/>
and pilgrimage, and yet they are infinitely more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious, more frugal, and more wealthy than at Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logne. It is not therefore the fault of the religion, or ſuperſtition, but of the government alone, that the people of Cologne are ſo debauched, and that the prieſts of the place openly recommend debauchery, a looſe education having made their religion prejudicial to them. The corporation-ſyſtem, which with more activity and cleverneſs would have been a bleſſing to the country, is become the curſe of it. In a word, police, government, and executive juſtice, are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, under a weak adminiſtration, to the ſame abuſes as government; nor is it religion itſelf, but the abuſes of it, which make it prejudicial to the ſtate.</p>
                     <p>The upper part of Weſtphalia, which lies at a greater diſtance from the Rhine, is not ſo well cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated, and by nature is much leſs productive, than the lower part; it is occupied by many heaths and moraſſes, which, for the moſt part, produce only turf, and, in the better places, dyer's-wood. Some parts of the country, ſuch as part of the duchy of Minden and marquiſate of Tecklenburg, are remarkably well peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled, but this is compenſated by the ſtriking depopu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of ſome others; as for inſtance, of the biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rics of Munſter, Oſnaburg, and Paderborn, the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſate of Bentheim, and ſome domains in the electo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate of Hanover.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="170" facs="tcp:0161700110:176"/>This part of Weſtphalia, however, is the proper country for hemp and flax, which are ſome of the richeſt products of this country. The greateſt part of the hemp and flax, manufactured in theſe parts of Weſtphalia, about the Rhine, Holland, the Auſtrian Netherlands, and the French Netherlands, comes from this part of the country. Beſides, there is a great part exported raw to England, Spain, Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal, and America. Though theſe productions are found, in great plenty, in other parts of Germany, particularly in the electorate of Hanover, the circle of Lower Saxony, Heſſe, Waldeck, and Fulde; it is a queſtion, whether all the flax and hemp of the other parts of Germany, taken together, are equivalent to the quantity found here. According to a very accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate eſtimate, the annual exports of raw and ſpun flax and hemp, out of the ſingle circle of Weſtphalia, amounts to five millions ſterling, which, with what is exported, worked up, amounts to 200,000l more.</p>
                     <p>To enter Holland, from the ſide of Weſtphalia, appears to be going out of a pig-ſty into a fine gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den. The country round Nimeguen eſpecially, is a ſtriking contraſt to what is ſeen in Weſtphalia. The magnificence and regularity of the Dutch cities, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, ſoon becomes tireſome in the extreme. All the cities, villages, roads, and canals, are ſo ſimilar, that they appear copies of the ſelf-ſame individual picture.

                  <head>CHAP. X. Of the CIRCLE of BURGUNDY.</head>
                  <p>THIS circle is one of thoſe that are wholly catholic. The greateſt part of its territories have been torn from it. France has gradually brought under her domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion the duchy of Lorrain, which was reckoned in the circle of Burgundy, and a part of the duchy of Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emburg, with a part of the counties of Flanders, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tois, Burgundy, Hennegau and Namur. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces of Gelderland, Holland, Zealand, Utrecht, Friezland, Overyſſel, and Groningen, have united and are become independent; nay, they have even reduced under their ſubjection, a part of the duchies
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:0161700110:179"/>
of Brabant and Limburg, and part of the country of Flanders, with the town of Maeſtricht and its terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory.</p>
                  <p>Thus the circle of Burgundy conſiſts now only of the principal part of the duchies of Brabant, Lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg, Luxemburg, part of the counties of Flanders, Hennegau, and Namur, and part of the upper quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Gelderland.</p>
                  <p>Theſe territories now belong to one ſingle lord; the archduke of Auſtria, who repreſents the whole circle, and is ſole-director, and circle-ſummoning prince of it.</p>
                  <p>The people of this country have in them a natural ſpirit of revolt, like their neighbours the French. They covet to be free, and indeed the unlimited pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of their ſovereigns, and the oppreſſion they have conſtantly laboured under, from an arbitrary govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in ſome meaſure, juſtifies their oppoſition. It was the tyranny of the Duke of <hi>Alva,</hi> their governor in the reign of <hi>Philip</hi> II. of Spain, who was then ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign of Brabant, that occaſioned their revolt in his time; and it was their diſlike to the emperor <hi>Joſeph</hi> II. their late ſovereign, that brought on the laſt rebellion, quelled by the emperor <hi>Leopold.</hi> Indeed, ſo powerful were the princes of the empire, in early ages, that they were lords of life and death, and could take away life
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:0161700110:180"/>
without trial, merely by their mandate. In the hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of Brabant we have the following intereſting ſtory.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sifroi,</hi> Count Palatine, having married a beautiful young woman, but of no great family or connexions, was called to the holy wars ſoon after his marriage. The ſpirit of the times led him to this enterprize with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out much reluctance, except that of leaving his young wife behind him, whom he feared might be induced to diſhonour him in his abſence. He left her, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, in the care of a friend, one of the principal officers of his eſtabliſhment, and deſired he might be made acquainted, from time to time, with her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, and the ſtate of her health. The beauty of this lady attracted the love of her guardian, and in his ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign's abſence, he endeavoured to corrupt her principles, and rob his lord of that fidelity ſhe owed him. Finding her averſe to his ſolicitations, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conquerable, his love was converted into hatred, and when he next wrote to his ſovereign, he traduced her character, and repreſented her as having defiled his bed, with a menial ſervant of his houſhold, and thus diſhonoured his name. <hi>Sifroi,</hi> on the receipt of this intelligence, was thunderſtruck, and the more ſo, as no former letter had given him the leaſt intimation of her attempting to deviate from the line of virtue. The poſſibility of a falſe report, and his love for his lady, operated in her favour; but then his pride took
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:0161700110:181"/>
the alarm, and, as of two paſſions in conteſt, the evil one is generally predominant, ſo it was here. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out conſideration, in the impetuoſity of temper, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned an immediate anſwer to this falſe friend, ſaying, if the proofs were glaring, he deſired to be rid of her; but the mode of putting her to death he left to this officer. On the arrival of this mandate, he made a freſh attempt upon her virtue, armed with the power of taking away her life on her non-compliance. Still ſhe was firm and invincible, and the conſequence was, that her death was pronounced. Unwilling to bring her to a public execution, leſt his treachery ſhould be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, he hired an aſſaſſin to take her into a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring wood, and there diſpatch and bury her.</p>
                  <p>This being ſettled, the man left her, cut her name upon a rock, and told his ſavage employer, that he had executed his commiſſion, and buried her in the foreſt, near the place where her name was engraved.</p>
                  <p>It happened at this time that ſhe was pregnant. She ſoon however found a retreat in a cave, and here ſhe took up her abode, nature in due time performing her own office, and ſhe was delivered of a fine girl, which the ſtory ſays, was ſuckled by a doe, which Providence had ſent to be its nurſe; for her diſtreſs, and anguiſh of mind had rendered her unable to perform that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dearing taſk herſelf. She lived ſeven years, with her infant, in this ſolitary deſart, feeding on wild herbs and roots, and aſſociating with the tamer animals of

the foreſt. Her cloaths were worn out, and ſhe was obliged to go naked, without any other covering than her long hair, which reached below her waiſt.</p>
                  <p>The officer, who ſuppoſed her dead, being inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the unexpected return of his ſovereign, fearing a diſcovery of his treachery, and not able to bear the reproaches of his own mind, put an end to his exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; and when <hi>Sifroi</hi> came back, and the whole mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was unravelled, he too ſoon, for his peace, learned the innocence of his wife, and the treachery and end of him to whom he had entruſted her; and would have given the world not to have ſent his cruel mandate, haſtily diſpatched in a moment of phrenzy; but it was then too late, the deed, as he ſuppoſed, was done.</p>
                  <p>Hunting ſome time afterwards in this foreſt, and ſtraying from his party, chance led him to the rock where her name was cut. Startled at the ſight, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came motionleſs upon his horſe. In a moment or two his ſenſes returned, but returned with bitterneſs. Stung with remorſe, and overpowered with diſtreſs, he could only ſigh and weep. <hi>Genevieve,</hi> whoſe fears were always awake for herſelf and her little one, dreading a diſcovery that ſhe was ſtill in being, had been wandering in ſearch of food, and returning to her cave at the time <hi>Sifroi</hi>'s eyes were fixed upon the rock; little expecting to meet any thing in ſo ſequeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered a part, fled to her abode, and ſcreamed as ſhe fled. <hi>Sifroi,</hi> at the noiſe turned inſtantly round, and
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:0161700110:184"/>
juſt obtained the glimpſe of her as ſhe entered. Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching the cave's mouth, he cried out, "What is that voice? Is it a human voice?" "It is," ſhe anſwered. "Then come forth," he cried. "Throw me your coat," returned ſhe, "and I will, for I am naked." He accordingly did ſo, and to his great aſtoniſhment and joy, diſcovered both his wife and his child. The inclemency of the weather, and her hard fare, throwing a brown hue over her, had made ſome alteration in her features, but her beauty had not left her. She became more amiable in his eyes from the calamity ſhe had experienced; though deſtitute of dreſs, ſhe was cloathed with innocence, and returned unſullied to his arms.</p>

                     <head>The AUSTRIAN PART of the DUCHY of BRA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BANT,</head>
                     <p>The length of which is rated at twenty-two, and its breadth twenty German miles, was formerly the firſt in rank of all the ſeventeen provinces in the Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands. The air of this country is good, and its ſoil very fertile. Its greateſt riches conſiſt in flax. Near Bruſſels a canal has been carried from the river Senna, to the village of Willebroech, where it diſcharges it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into the river Rapel, which unites itſelf with the Schelde, ſo that a perſon may ſail from Bruſſels to the north ſea. This canal was begun in the year 1550, and finiſhed in 1561, at an expence of 800,000 florins.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="177" facs="tcp:0161700110:185"/>In the Auſtrian part of Brabant are reckoned nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen walled towns, and a conſiderable number of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities enjoying the rights of burghers and towns.</p>
                     <p>The whole country profeſſes the Romiſh church. In the year 1559, an archbiſhopric was erected at Mecklin, and to it was aſſigned the primacy of Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gium. To this ſee belongs eleven collegiate churches, and 203 cloyſters, a number of the laſt of which are now ſuppreſſed within theſe three years. Subject to the archbiſhopric are the biſhops of Antwerp, Ghent, Boiſleduc, Bruges, Ypres, and Ruremond. The number and opulence of the eccleſiaſtics in this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try are very conſiderable.</p>
                     <p>For the promotion of learning, here are ſeveral ſchools and <hi>gymnaſia,</hi> and likewiſe the univerſity of Louvain.</p>
                     <p>The duchy of Brabant belonged formerly to the Frankiſh monarchy. Afterwards it became part of the Lotharingian kingdom, and a fief of the German empire. In courſe of time it deſcended to <hi>Philip</hi> II. of Spain.</p>
                     <p>The republic of the United Netherlands, in the 17th century, made itſelf maſter of the northern part of the duchy of Brabant, which it retained at the peace of Weſtphalia. The emperor <hi>Charles</hi> VI. in the
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:0161700110:186"/>
year 1706, after the battle of Ramilies, took poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the preſent Auſtrian part of this duchy. That part of the duchy of Brabant, which belongs to the houſe of Auſtria, contains the cities of Louvain, Bruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, Antwerp, and Mecklin, of each of which we ſhall ſpeak.</p>
                     <p>Louvain is a very large and pleaſant town, with an old caſtle, and a celebrated univerſity. The walls of this place are near ſeven miles in circumference, but within them are a great many gardens and vineyards. The public buildings are magnificent, and the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity conſiſts of a great number of colleges. The town was formerly in a flouriſhing ſtate, owing to the noble manufactures of linen and woollen cloth eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed here, which in the beginning of the 14th cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury, maintained upwards of 150,000 workmen, but the cloth-weavers making an inſurrection in 1382, and being puniſhed on that account, ſome of them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew to England, and with its manufactures the town likewiſe decayed. The place at preſent is chiefly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable for its good beer, with which it ſerves the neighbouring towns. The fortifications are not very ſtrong, and yet it boaſts of never having been taken, except by the French, in 1746. It is ſaid, there are no fewer than forty one colleges belonging to this uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity.</p>
                     <p>Bruſſels, is the fineſt and richeſt city of the Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:0161700110:187"/>
the capital of Brabant, and ſeat of the gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of the Auſtrian low countries, where the court is held, and to whom the people pay almoſt the ſame honours, as to their ſovereign. The ducal palace, where the governor reſides, the town-houſe, and the arſenal, are ſuperb ſtructures. The camblets, lace, and fine tapeſtry, which are exported from this town, are famous. It was furiouſly bombarded by the French for forty-ſix hours, in 1695, by which four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen churches, and above 4000 houſes were reduced to aſhes, but in four years all were rebuilt again, far more beautiful. In 1706, the allies made themſelves maſters of this place, and in 1746, the French. It lies on the Senna, partly in the plain, and partly on an eminence, being large, well built, populous and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified. The public buildings, the palaces and courts of the ſeveral princes, counts, and other perſons of condition here, together with the churches and cloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, are ſome of them conſiderable, and ſome magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent. The magiſtracy is elected yearly from ſeven patrician families.</p>
                     <p>Bruſſels, ſays <hi>Reiſbec,</hi> is one of the moſt beautiful and moſt brilliant cities in Europe. There is not to be ſeen any where, a finer place than the large market-place of this city; all the houſes in it, are built in a ſtile, and with a degree of magnificence, that you ſcarcely ſee, any where out of Italy. We meet here
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:0161700110:188"/>
with excellent company, who, to a ſtranger, are not difficult of acceſs. There are ſeveral clubs after the manner of the Engliſh, where we find the greateſt freedom and good humour.</p>
                     <p>Bruſſels is far more beautiful, for the bombardment it ſuffered from marſhal <hi>Villeroy;</hi> for ſince that time, the miſchief he did, has been entirely made good by many new ſtreets and public buildings, in a much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſtile than they were before. Many of the ſtreets are alſo well paved, ſome very ſpacious, and all the new houſes large and well built.</p>
                     <p>Among the churches of Bruſſels, there are ſome that well deſerve notice. St. Gudula is a very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable gothic pile, highly ornamented with mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents, chapels, pictures, &amp;c. The jeſuits church has alſo ſeveral objects to attract the attention of ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers. One whole ſide of the great market ſquare, is taken up with the town-houſe, which is a moſt ſtupen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous quadrangular building, with a fine cupola, and a pretty gothic front; the apartment in which the ſtates of Brabant meet, is very magnificent; the hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of <hi>Charles</hi> V. is worked in tapeſtry, with a brilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ancy of colouring, that is almoſt inconceivable, the manufacture of the place, and covers one of the apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. There are likewiſe other apartments which contain many original paintings, by the greateſt Fle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh maſters. Another great advantage the market-place
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:0161700110:189"/>
enjoys, is being ſurrounded with the corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion-halls of different trades, the fronts of which being uniform, and adorned, make a fine circumference.</p>
                     <p>The archduke's palace, though an old irregular building, erected at different times, ſhould not be paſſed over unnoticed. It is a very large edifice, and the apartments are extremely ſpacious and well fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed. Behind it, is a large park well ſtocked with deer. There are alſo many very pleaſant walks in it, and a ſummer-houſe built by the emperor <hi>Charles</hi> V.</p>
                     <p>Among other edifices uſually viewed, are the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laces of Orange, De Ligne, Epinoy, Rubengue, Eg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont, Aremberg, Arſchot, and Bournonville. In the gardens of the latter, you have a fine view of Bruſſels and the adjacent country. The only objects of much conſideration in theſe palaces are the paintings, among which, particularly in the palace of the duke of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remberg, are many very capital pieces, not only by Flemiſh, but alſo by Italian maſters.</p>
                     <p>As to the diverſions of Bruſſels, there is a very large opera-houſe and two theatres, in which French comedies are played. The opera-houſe is very ſpaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, but ill lighted. Inſtead of boxes, it has large cloſets like the Italian theatres, which contain tables, chairs, a fire place, &amp;c. ſo that parties are formed for cards and converſation during the performance. But
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:0161700110:190"/>
the prices are too low to admit of any ſplendid en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment; their performers are but very moderate, and bad muſic, is an entertainment that will not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed by thoſe who are in the leaſt acquainted with the luxury of an Engliſh or an Italian opera.</p>
                     <p>The court gives an air of livelineſs to Bruſſels, which is not to be met with in the other cities of Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. What with the officers about the perſon of the governor-general; the reſidence of a conſiderable mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary force; the chief courts of juſtice, with no ſlight portion of trade and manufacture, this place is the moſt pleaſing and chearful reſidence in Flanders.</p>
                     <p>The Engliſh reſident here, ſays <hi>Thickneſſe,</hi> conſiſt chiefly of perſons of ſmall fortune, who come to Bruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, in order to give their children a good education; of young men on travelling excurſions, and of the unfortunate and indigent.</p>
                     <p>Now and then a family of good fortune ventures upon a winter here; but I never heard of one, ſays he, who did not quit the place with more than common diſſatisfaction.</p>
                     <p>There are few capitals in Europe, in which provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and almoſt all other expences incidental to a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily are ſo reaſonable as in this city. It is even ſaid, that a family may live here upon two hundred pounds
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:0161700110:191"/>
a year, as well as upon ſix hundred in England. But this we apprehend is rather exaggerated. There are two articles of expence in this city which exceeds moſt other places, houſe-rent and firing. There is no hiring a ſmall decent houſe under thirty or forty pounds a year; and in the article of firing, which is wood, where there are no ſtoves, two or three ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings a day in cold weather, may be ſoon expended without economy on a ſingle fire. Proviſions, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly vegetables, of which there are no finer any where, and all the articles of dreſs, and likewiſe car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages, ſervants, and public diverſions, are cheaper here than in moſt places. The education of children likewiſe, which <hi>Thickneſſe</hi> juſtly obſerves, many peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple believe, to conſiſt in French, dancing, and a tinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of foreign manners, may be obtained upon much more moderate terms in Bruſſels, than in any part of England.</p>
                     <p>The number of ſuſpicious characters who reſort hither from England, makes the natives, as well as the Engliſh of any reſpectability, remarkably ſhy towards ſtrangers of our own country. Theſe ſuſpicious cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters conſiſt of two ſorts, either of ſuch as have had ſome ſtigma affixed upon them in England, ſo that no perſon, of any character could aſſociate with them, without conſidering himſelf, as reflected upon in ſo doing; or they are compoſed of perſons, who hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing morally bad about them, yet confiding in
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:0161700110:192"/>
their riches, which they blazon forth, aſſuming a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence to which neither their manners nor their connections, give them the leaſt pretenſions.</p>
                     <p>Theſe latter characters, <hi>Thickneſſe</hi> has drawn in ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther too glowing colours. As for the women, ſays he, there are ſome of them who attend the winter balls of the Bruſſels court, that never advanced farther at St. James's, than to ſee beneath the arm-pit of a beef-eater, the Sunday proceſſion of our royal family to and from the chapel-royal. Some of theſe poor people are driven almoſt to <hi>ſtarvation,</hi> in order to furniſh the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary decorations of a court appearance; though for the comfort of their purſe, and the conſolation of their ſtomachs, it requires nothing more than the common dreſs of genteel life. Of this number are inſtanced two antiquated ladies, whom he ſtiles late of the pump room at Bath, without a fortune to bear it, or a word of the language to ſupport it, were preſented at this court. It was very bleak that day, and as the weather is generally a ſubject for ſtrangers to begin with, the archducheſs obſerved, it was very cold, and repeated the words <hi>bien froid,</hi> two or three times, leſt they might not underſtand her. At length, one of the ladies believing the archducheſs aſked them to ſtay dinner, and that it was a nice fry they were to participate of, curtſied, and replied, that whether it was fried or broiled, ſo they had the honour of dining at court, it was equal to them. To avoid ſuch things
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:0161700110:193"/>
happening in future, it is now the etiquette at the court of Bruſſels, that no Britiſh ſubject ſhall be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented there by our miniſter, who has not previouſly been preſented at St. James's.</p>
                     <p>We take the liberty here to preſent to our readers, <hi>Thickneſſes</hi>'s hints to a perſon of faſhion, who propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to make Bruſſels his winter-reſidence. If a young man of fortune and rank is fond of play, there is no ſociety ſo reſpectable in any quarter of the globe, in which there are not ſome characters who would take ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of this foible to his utter ruin, and deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if he was ſilly enough to ſuffer himſelf to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnared. Bruſſels therefore ought not to be exempt from ſuch characters, at the ſame time, we believe the nobleſſe of that capital to be as highly reputable in general, as at any of our own court.</p>
                     <p>Were you to make this city as you propoſe, your next winter's abode, you would of courſe be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to the little, but elegant court held here, the conſequence of which is a round of viſits muſt be made to all the nobleſſe who attend it, and who form that brilliant aſſembly. Theſe viſits will all be punc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually returned; for thoſe ſtrangers who are young and rich, will find a prince, a duke, a count, or a ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron, who will intimate to them, that by a little ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs, they may be admitted into the GRAND SO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CIETY. Profeſſions of regard due to ſtrangers, good
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:0161700110:194"/>
breeding, artful flattery, fine women, ſumptuous ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, are all thrown in the way of a young man of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, to cover the real cauſe of ſo much attention: ſee him ſeated between a ducheſs and a counteſs, both poſſeſſing the charms of beauty, graced with the moſt eaſy and captivating French manners, a noble repaſt before him, and the moſt delicious wines at his elbow, thus placed and being a ſtranger the attention of the whole table appears to be employed to make him happy, and if in ſuch a ſituation a young man of faſhion in a ſtrange country, does not feel himſelf ſo, where is happineſs to be found, almoſt every paſſion of man is gratified, nor does he go to ſleep without flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering himſelf he is in a fair way of being admitted, tête-a-tête, with one or more of the charming women with whom he enjoyed ſuch a happy evening. The next night, he meets the ſame agreeable ſociety, and finds himſelf as much at home and at his eaſe, as if he was at his own manor houſe. In this ſituation the ſtranger who knows he is a very handſome young man, no doubt forms ſome plan of further happineſs, without ſuſpecting that many of the party who are not ſo rich as he is, would not diſlike a draught on his banker or even a mortgage on his eſtate, and as both ſexes conſtantly play in this country, it may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed both underſtand it very well: My Lord An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glois, of courſe, is one of the party, and if he wins of a lady, it gives him an opportunity of ſhewing his good breeding; if of a prince, or a duke, why it is
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:0161700110:195"/>
honour enough to have ſuch great perſonages his debtors; but if he loſes, and it is ten to one but he does, he muſt pay directly; for every body here knows that an Engliſhman has ſo much money, that if it were not for continental excurſions, they could not tell what to do with it. Now, ſays <hi>Thickneſſe,</hi> leſt it ſhould be ſuppoſed this is an imaginary picture ſketched out without an original to copy from. I will come to a matter of fact. I found here a young gentleman of Ireland, of genteel appearance, of good addreſs, and of eaſy fortune; a member of this grand ſociety, and living in a degree of intimacy with the firſt people. On his firſt arrival he loſt, as moſt firſt comers do, a conſiderable ſum of money to a native of high birth, and of courſe paid it. At ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of time they played again, and the ſtranger be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the winner of a ſum even greater than that which he loſt a year or two before; but inſtead of being paid he was informed by his antagoniſt, that he was not to receive his fortune as a younger brother till he was thirty, and therefore deſired to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to pay the debt by inſtallments, and engaged the winner to give his word he would not let his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther know what had paſſed. The pais-bas peer, however, never made good his engagements; went to Paris, would neither anſwer letter, nor pay drafts made upon him; and therefore having cancelled all former obligations, the ſtranger determined to lay the matter open to his brother, but what was the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence?
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:0161700110:196"/>
—"He was aſked if they did not know that they were the firſt people of the country, and was told that his brother wore a ſword. But finding that ſuch pais-bas hauteur would not do, and that the young ſtranger wore a ſword too, ſome mode of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derating matters was to be employed. Another great man related to the former, then ſteps forward, cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures the conduct of the two brothers, opens his doors wider than ever to the ſtranger, and ſoftens him into more patience. It may now be imagined he is paid, no ſays <hi>Thickneſſe,</hi> nor ever will. Is it not enough to have the honour of dining with a prince, ſupping with a duke, and dancing with a ducheſs, without being paid a thouſand pounds or two?"</p>
                     <p>The wine that is generally met with in Bruſſels is bad. The wine merchants it is ſaid have a method of brewing ſeveral ſorts of wine, and particularly what they call Burgundy, with pigeons dung, and an arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial ſweet wine palatable enough, in which a quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of brimſtone is infuſed, called Moſelle. The wines made from the hills adjacent to the Rhine, with which this country is plentifully ſupplied, is, perhaps, of all fermented liquors the beſt; this wine, in my opinion, ſays <hi>Thickneſſe,</hi> and he was a judge, when pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured genuine, is ſuperior to all others. It improves both in ſtrength and flavour, in proportion to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain age. For it is a great miſtake to imagine wine cannot be too old. There is a time when wine as
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:0161700110:197"/>
well as men arrive at maturity; after which wines, as well as men, loſe ſome part of their original vigour; for though they give travellers wines to taſte of an hundred years or more, it muſt be obſerved, that as they ſell great quantities every year from their large reſervoir tons, ſo they as conſtantly fill them up an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually with new wines. If therefore a perſon ſends to Frankfort for the beſt Rheniſh wine, not for hock, he will in a few years have hock in his cellar at half price. It is inconceivable what a variety of excellent wines this country and Hungary produces, the latter very little known; all of which are ſuperior to French or Spaniſh wines, except, perhaps, Burgundy and Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagne of the firſt growth in good wines.</p>
                     <p>It is a great miſtake to imagine that the wines in Germany are apt to create the gout; they may, it is true, be unfit for thoſe who have the gout, or the ſeeds of that diſorder in their conſtitution; but in ſound bodies, it is more likely to prevent than to promote a gouty habit. In Champagne, where the wine of the country is conſtantly drank, there are few or no gouty people; and real Champagne is a very wholeſome wine.</p>
                     <p>No part of the continent can long continue agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to an Engliſhman, who has been accuſtomed to live even with that decency which the Engliſh of mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dling fortunes live in their own country. For this
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:0161700110:198"/>
reaſon it is that the Engliſh nation alone are the leaſt ſatisfied with the fare they meet with abroad. The neatneſs of our houſes, the cleanlineſs of our butchers, bakers, &amp;c. render the houſes, ſhops, and manufactur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of what we eat and drink on the continent highly diſguſtful. The ſervants and boys of the bakers in the Low Countries, and in France, are the dirtieſt miſerable looking people on earth, no part of their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons being clean but their legs and feet, for they are always viſible; and though the tables of all orders of people are covered with a variety of diſhes, which may catch the eye, or provoke the appetite, an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſhman, whoſe ſtomach is not depraved, will ſoon wiſh to ſee a plain wholeſome diſh or two of meat, <hi>à la mode d'Angleterre</hi> ſet before him.</p>
                     <p>Knaves of many nations, ſays <hi>Thickneſſe,</hi> have fled to this city under the idea they were beyond the reach of thoſe they meant to defraud, not knowing that in Brabant and in all the Low Countries a perſon may be arreſted for debts contracted in any other; and that not only men, but women and children are ſubject to impriſonment for the debts of a fugitive huſband or parent; the marquis <hi>de Sanna,</hi> the count <hi>de Ribaderia,</hi> and duke of Brunſwick were arreſted here by their diſtant creditors; but a ſtranger who takes a houſe, after a year and a days reſidence in it, is not liable to perſonal confinement for debt, until a tedious proceſs has been carried on againſt him.</p>

                        <pb n="191" facs="tcp:0161700110:199"/>An Engliſh gentleman of fortune having chaſtiſed his ſervant too ſeverely, abſconded, but his wife was hurried to the common gaol to be reſponſible for his town-debts till he returned; and this buſineſs is done in ſo brutal a manner, that our London bailiffs are quite poliſhed, when compared to a pais bas officer of juſtice.</p>
                     <p>I viſited, ſays <hi>Thickneſſe,</hi> their <hi>Maiſon de force</hi> or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.

In this houſe, ſays he, I ſaw five or ſix hundred of the worſt people on earth, living in a cleaner and more orderly manner than the ſame number can live any where at large. Neither relations nor friends are admitted to ſee the offenders, no improper converſation is heard; prayers, work, and penitence are the lot of all. Such houſes being erected in every county in our kingdom, would do more to prevent houſe-breaking, than all the county gallows's in England.</p>
                     <p>It ſeems to have been a miſtaken notion in ſeveral courts of Europe, that the houſe of Auſtria received ſo little benefit from theſe provinces, that they were ſcarce worth the keeping, the expences running away with all the profit. But admitting that no money is
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:0161700110:200"/>
received into the treaſury of Vienna, ſtill the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of having a conſiderable body of troops paid and maintained, is of itſelf very important. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces pay the troops in garriſon and forces of all kinds that are quartered here, which amount at different times from ſix to twenty thouſand men; beſides the opportunity of advancing a number of ſubjects to poſts of honour and profit, is valuable to any court.</p>
                     <p>Theſe provinces likewiſe are very populous, and are found highly ſerviceable in recruiting regiments; and as they poſſeſs much trade and numerous thriving manufacturies, they are a body of ſubjects of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted importance. However theſe advantages are not all, for it is very well known that large remittances are made to Vienna, notwithſtanding the expence of keeping a court here.</p>
                     <p>The upper town, ſays <hi>Peckham,</hi> in his deſcription of this city, is magnificent, and has lately been much improved by new buildings, and by incloſing a piece of water-ground, planting it and laying it out in walks.</p>
                     <p>It is well ſupplied with fountains, ſome of which are rather whimſical; for inſtance, the three virgins from whoſe breaſts ſlow continual ſtreams of water; and to ſhow that the male ſex is no leſs charitably in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:0161700110:201"/>
there is the ſtatue of a boy who ſpouts out water with the moſt immodeſt aſſurances. It is called in the Flemiſh tongue <hi>Mannykipis.</hi>

                     <p>Nothing will ſtrike the eye of an obſerving ſtranger with more ſurprize in this city, than to ſee on a navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable river, more than a hundred miles from the ocean, ſuch a number of large high-maſted veſſels, of various conſtructions, lying before the town: the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigable canals and rivers throughout all the Low Countries, are indeed wonderful. Some progreſs of inland navigation, ſays <hi>Thickneſſe,</hi> has been ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully made in England; but yet the nation at large does not ſeem to know the aſtoniſhing advantages which would ariſe to the kingdom, if it were more general. <hi>M. de la Landes</hi> treatiſe <hi>ſur le canaux de la navigation,</hi> remarks, that a waggon with ſix horſes and two drivers, carries between two and three thouſand pounds weight, whereas a ſingle boat, navigated by two men, will carry two hundred thouſand pounds weight. This therefore, is a ſaving of two hundred men, and ſix hundred horſes, beſides the extra num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of men and horſes, which are required to repair the damages they do to the roads.</p>
                     <p>The public walks are elegant, the ramparts extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pleaſant, and the country round Bruſſels is moſt delightful to the eye, and extremely profitable to the poſſeſſors; for the land within ten miles of the city,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:0161700110:202"/>
ſells at forty years purchaſe, and lets in general for three pounds ſterling an acre.</p>
                     <p>In the arſenal is ſome old armour, of neither curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity or uſe; except an iron ſhirt, which no ſword can pierce; and a ſteel ſhield, ſo finely engraved, that the figures ſeem reflected from the poliſh, not to be etched in the ſteel: the niceſt touch cannot perceive the leaſt ſcratch; though the figures appear to be ſtrongly marked when the ſhield is held obliquely.</p>
                     <p>Juſt below the arſenal is the palace of the governor of the Auſtrian Netherlands. The ſtair-caſe is very magnificent, the ſteps are of marble, and the baluſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trades of iron, gilt, adorned with compartments of birds and beaſts, nicely executed in poliſhed ſteel, by <hi>Triefle;</hi> the cieling is painted in freſco.</p>
                     <p>The apartments of the princeſs are hung with Bruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels tapeſtry. The floors are all inlaid with mahogany and box. The princeſs's cabinet is much admired, being covered throughout with the fineſt japan. The late prince was a great mechanic, and had a cabinet of curioſities trifling enough, among which were two boxes, containing all the common trades in minia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                     <p>In the menagerie, there are ſome fowls, which are the produce of a very unnatural amour, between a
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:0161700110:203"/>
rabbit and a hen; they are of various ſizes; their breaſts and bellies cloathed with white fur, their wings and backs covered with feathers, without the plume, which riſe from the ſkin, and have the appearance of wet feathers; they are all milk-white, as their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents; their ſhape in every reſpect the ſame as other fowls. The rabbit, in an amorous mood, like many other huſbands, ſtrips his wife of her cloathing; by biting half the feathers from her back.</p>
                     <p>Having been at Bruſſels myſelf more than once, I can take upon me to ſay, that the city is by no means the fine place it is in general repreſented. The ſtreets are narrow, and not well paved, having no foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. The houſes are built in the gothic taſte, with pediment tops, and the windows are chiefly caſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Was it not from the fountains continually running, the place would be exceedingly dirty, and there is no appearance of ſhops or trade. Part of the town ſtands upon the top of a high hill, where there is a ſmall park cut in walks, the reſort of genteel people on Sundays; from this park runs ſeveral new ſtreets, with elegant houſes erected in the modern ſtile of building, commanding a fine proſpect. The pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace is ſmall, but very grand and neat, and ſtands juſt below the hill. Being the reſidence of the viceroy, and where the court is held; it is the rendezvous of all the brilliant part of Brabant, and living here is not very expenſive. A man may make as genteel an
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:0161700110:204"/>
appearance in this country, for his hundred a year, as he can in London for three times the ſum.</p>
                     <p>The roads from city to city are continued pave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in a ſtraight line, for thirty or forty miles toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, planted with trees on both ſides, and the country every where open and unincloſed, and there is a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal from Bruſſels to Antwerp, on which a floating-barge, with good accommodation, paſſes to and from it every day.</p>

                     <head>OF ANTWERP.</head>
                     <p>This town and diſtrict is called the Margravate of the holy Roman empire. Its origin is ſomewhat ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure. <hi>Godfrey</hi> of Bouillon, enjoyed it under this ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, after which it deſcended to the dukes of Brabant; but yet it was reckoned one of the Seventeen Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. At preſent it is ſtrictly united with Brabant.</p>
                     <p>The approach to the city of Antwerp is noble, by a ſtraight paved road, bordered with oaks.</p>
                     <p>This city is ſeven miles in circumference, built in the form of a creſcent, and ſurrounded with a good wall, and many baſtions, faced with ſtone. Theſe fortifications, however, are of no other conſequence than to defend the town againſt any ſudden incurſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, but they look very beautiful, for the top of the
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:0161700110:205"/>
wall is an hundred feet broad, and planted with dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble rows of trees. Its ſtrength is in a large regular and very ſtrong citadel, in form of a pentagon, which the duke of <hi>Alva</hi> cauſed to be erected there in 1568. It ſtands cloſe to the river Scheld, on the ſouth ſide of the city, and commands all the town and the adjacent country, for ſome diſtance. There are five principal baſtions to it, which command each other, defended by two very deep ditches. Here ſtood the ſtatue which the duke of <hi>Alva</hi> had erected, repreſenting himſelf in a military attitude, and trampling the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and people under his feet, which ſo rouſed the ſpirit of the populace, that they broke into the cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del on a holiday, and entirely demoliſhed the ſtatue.</p>
                     <p>The river at Antwerp is twenty feet deep, and at high-water riſes twenty feet more, which makes it an excellent harbour, ſo that large veſſels may come up from the ſea, and unload their cargoes at the eight principal canals in the town. Theſe are the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages which carried their trade to ſuch a height; but the Dutch building Fort Lillo, which commands the approach, and makes all the ſhips that paſs pay toll, was a fatal ſtroke to their trade, and drove the chief of it to Amſterdam.</p>
                     <p>Antwerp has many remains of its former magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, particularly in the length, breadth, and regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity of the principal ſtreets, and many of the public-buildings
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:0161700110:206"/>
and churches. It has twenty-two ſquares, two hundred and twelve ſtreets, and ſeventy gates, from each of which runs a ſtreet terminating at the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedral-ſquare. The ſtreet called La Mere, is the fineſt in the city, it is very well paved, and is ſo wide, that twenty coaches may paſs in it a breaſt, with great eaſe; it is alſo very well built, and in general of free ſtone: many of the other ſtreets alſo, make a very good appearance, being broad, ſtraight and handſome. The better ſort of houſes, throughout the city, are in general large, lofty, and contain good apartments. From the decay of trade, ſeveral of them are let at very low rates; moſt of them have court-yards, and gardens, which make them very agreeable to live in, and many are in the ancient ſtile of building, which does not make ſo graceful an appearance.</p>
                     <p>The markets here are numerous, and moſt of them well ſupplied; that for fiſh is near the river, and abounds with great plenty, and that for fruit and gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den-ſtuff, is well ſupplied by numerous country-carts, in which the peaſants bring the produce of their little farms. One ſquare is called the Friday market-place, in which, on a market-day, is to be ſeen many ſales by auction of furniture, and ſome of pictures, where are to be picked up ſometimes valuable pieces by Fle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh maſters.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="199" facs="tcp:0161700110:207"/>Nothing can be more melancholy, than to view the houſe of the Hanſe-towns, built in 1468, (a time in which this city was ſo flouriſhing) for the uſe of the merchants trading to the Baltic. It is a ſquare edifice of 230 feet, and all of ſtone: the upper floors were ample magazines for all ſorts of dry merchandize, with vaſt cellars for the wet goods, which are now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted into ſtabling for troopers horſes, and the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gazines to hay-lofts; a ſad ſpectacle of the building, which once was the reſidence of wealth and induſtry, and ſhews, how miſerable a fall any place undergoes, that loſes a once eſtabliſhed trade.</p>
                     <p>Antwerp contains now about ſeventy thouſand ſouls, of which about ten thouſand are on the poor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt. The police of the city, with regard to the poor, is as bad as it is ſingular. There is an ample fund for their maintenance, which is diſtributed not among thoſe perſons, who are really indigent, but among the families of ſuch perſons as happened to, be enrolled among the poor many generations back, when it firſt became an object of general police, to provide for thoſe who were unable to provide for themſelves.</p>
                     <p>Very near the ſtreet La Mere, is the exchange, ſaid to be the firſt building of the kind raiſed in Europe; and from which Sir <hi>Thomas Greſham</hi> is ſaid to have taken his idea of that in London. This building is
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:0161700110:208"/>
now reſorted to only by half a dozen bankers, and as many brokers. Four ſtreets meet there, and it has four gates anſwerable to them; the parades are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by above forty marble pillars; the length of it is 180 feet, and the breadth 140. Beneath, are vaults and magazines for goods; and over it are the apartments of an academy for painting, ſculpture and architecture. The expence of this building is ſaid to have amounted to 300,000 crowns, at a time when money was much dearer, than it is at preſent.</p>
                     <p>This city was once the grand emporium of almoſt all the commerce in Europe, which was owing to three principal cauſes. Firſt, to the liberty which reigned here; ſecondly, to the advantages of its ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and port; for above four thouſand ſail of ſhips could lay in perfect ſafety in the canals at a time: and thirdly, to the near neighbourhood of the moſt flouriſhing manufactures then in Europe, which were carried on in all the Flemiſh towns. Bruges poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed the greateſt ſhare of trade before Antwerp roſe to ſuch a height; but the wars which broke out in Flanders, in the beginning of the 16th century, drove moſt of the merchants from the former place to the latter. They reckoned the trade of this city at its height about the year 1568, when they computed the inhabitants at 200,000: their harbour at that time, contained very often 2500 ſhips at a time, and 500
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:0161700110:209"/>
were commonly ſeen to go out or come in, in a day. The annals of the city inform us, that in the year 1550, the trade amounted to one hundred and thirty-three millions of gold, excluſive of the bank. The Antwerpers, to this day, are fond of telling the ſtory of <hi>John Daen,</hi> their famous merchant, who lent the emperor <hi>Charles</hi> V. a million of gold, and afterwards entertained him moſt magnificently; made a fire of cinnamon-wood, and in the emperor's preſence, threw the bond into it.</p>
                     <p>But all their proſperity was no ſecurity againſt the tyranny of their ſovereign, <hi>Philip</hi> II; and his arbitrary agent the duke of <hi>Alva,</hi> preſently drove all trade from Antwerp, ſo that the fall of the city was much quicker than its riſe. After being twice ſacked, there was much of it burnt down, in 1576, and brought into ſucha condition, as was utterly incompatible with trade; the merchants therefore fled in whole troops, and the Dutch received them. Having formed their infant republic, Amſterdam began to be a place of trade; they removed thither, and carried with them their correſpondence and induſtry.</p>
                     <p>Upon the loſs of their trade, the inhabitants gave their attention principally to banking, jewelling and painting. In the firſt they have always been profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients, and carried it to a great extent, even in the preſent times: during the duke of <hi>Marlborough</hi>'s
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:0161700110:210"/>
war, two brothers, the <hi>De Konnings,</hi> paid, one of them the army of France, and the other, that of the allies. Some of their painters were of note in the Flemiſh ſchool, before the time of <hi>Rubens;</hi> but that great maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter laid the principal foundation for their fame; he eſtabliſhed their ſchool, and painting flouriſhed here for a long while under the influence of his genius; ſo that Antwerp has produced more good artiſts this way, than any other town in the Netherlands. Antwerp has likewiſe been famous for printing the Plantin edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, being much eſteemed in the learned world. <hi>Plantin</hi>'s printing-houſe remains, though imperfect at this time, and is ſaid by the Antwerps, to be the beſt in Europe, having been ſupplied with near an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred different ſorts of founts of letters, two of which were Syriac, forty-ſeven Roman, nine Greek, and ten Hebrew.</p>
                     <p>But Antwerp, though ſo much reduced from its an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient ſplendor, is yet a place of conſequence: here is ſome trade carried on, for which it is yet well ſituated, and has numerous cities in Flanders, &amp;c. to ſupply with foreign commodities; they have alſo ſeveral flouriſhing manufactures, a conſiderable lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trade, and a ſhare of the linen fabrics, &amp;c. It is alſo an agreeable place to reſide in, from the number of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, and people of large fortune, who live in it. Through their patronage, a theatre has been rebuilt, and alſo an apartment for the performance of concerts.
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:0161700110:211"/>
The firſt is a very beautiful and well contrived edifice, well furniſhed with ſcenery and machinery; it is richly ornamented too with paintings. A company of French comedians exhibit here three times a week in winter. Some good maſters have ornamented the concert-room, with their paintings, where a concert is performed once a week in winter.</p>
                     <p>In the churches there are numerous pictures of moſt capital merit, by the firſt painters of the Flemiſh-ſchool, ſuch as <hi>Rubens, Vandyke,</hi> and others. The great fault of the painters of the Flemiſh-ſchool, ſays <hi>Marſhall,</hi> is, that they are entirely deſtitute of a chain of great ideas; an action, complex in its nature, but rendered one by the genius of the artiſt, is ſought for in vain, in their works, good colouring, and a maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly imitation of ſtill-life, are their great excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies; minute finiſhing is carried by them to the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt perfection.</p>
                     <p>The cathedral of Antwerp is a vaſt building, and full of ornaments of painting, ſtatuary, and rich carv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The taking down from the croſs by <hi>Rubens,</hi> is one of the fineſt pictures of the kind to be met with in the whole world. It is very large, with a number of figures, all executed in the higheſt ſtile of this painter, ſo that it cannot fail of being highly admired by all lovers of painting. They are always kept maſked or covered.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="204" facs="tcp:0161700110:212"/>The fall of the angles by <hi>Floris,</hi> is ſuppoſed to rank, next in merit. On the thigh of one of the fallen angels, is a large hornet, painted by <hi>Quintin Matzys,</hi> the noted blackſmith of Antwerp, who fell in love with the daughter of <hi>Floris,</hi> and demanded her in marriage; the painter refuſed him, becauſe he was not of his own profeſſion. <hi>Matzys,</hi> therefore changed his hammer for the pallet, and ſtudied under the Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian maſters for two years; on his return he painted this hornet, unknown to <hi>Floris,</hi> who by miſtake was going to bruſh it off, thinking it alive; he was ſo pleaſed with the execution of it, that he immediately gave him his daughter in marriage; <hi>Matzys</hi> was bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on the outſide of the weſtern door of the church, where there is a plain ſtone with this epitaph:</p>
                     <q>
                        <l>
                           <hi>Conunbialis amor de Mulcibre fecit Apellum.</hi>
                        </l>
                        <l>Love transformed Vulcan into an Apelles.</l>
                     </q>
                     <p>This building is very nobly ornamented, and its architecture in the Gothic ſtile, is not inferior to any edifice in the Low Countries. It is five hundred feet long, and two hundred and forty feet broad. It was erected in the 13th century. The firſt ſtone of the choir was laid by the emperor <hi>Charles</hi> V. Nothing can well be finer than the view ſeen from the top of this fine ſteeple; not only a vaſt tract of country for many miles round, but of ſeveral very conſiderable cities, ſuch as Malines, Bruſſels, Ghent, Liege, Lou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vain,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:0161700110:213"/>
&amp;c. Here is a muſical-clock, which chimes every hour, half-hour, quarter, and half-quarter, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of near eighty bells. The largeſt bell was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected in 1440, and weighs ſixteen thouſand pounds.</p>
                     <p>The abbey of <hi>St. Michael</hi> is the grandeſt in the city, the refectory is covered with pictures by <hi>Quellin,</hi> moſt admirably executed. There is a deception of a ſtair-caſe, with a fiſh lying on one of the ſteps, which muſt attract every eye. In the church is a grand piece by <hi>Rubens,</hi> the adoration of the Magi, which he finiſhed in thirteen days. The apartments of the abbot are well worthy of a prince. Such a profuſion of capital pictures by the beſt Flemiſh and Italian maſters, with paintings to imitate baſſo relievo, exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted in a ſtyle, ſo as to deceive an artiſt.</p>
                     <p>The Jeſuits church is one of the moſt beautiful edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices to be ſeen in all Flanders; the facade is enriched with ſtatues and other ornaments of a great maſter; the architecture has uncommon merit; the workmanſhip is very maſterly, and it is full of fine paintings; the fineſt marble, intermixed with jaſper, porphyry, and gold; nor can any thing be more magnificent than the chapel adjoining.</p>
                     <p>In the library is ſeen a portrait of <hi>Rubens,</hi> drawn in pen and ink by himſelf, and executed in the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imitable
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:0161700110:214"/>
manner; with a minute expreſſion, ſo mixed with freedom, that it is beyond the power of the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to equal it.</p>
                     <p>The chapel of the Virgin is remarkably beautiful; it is compoſed entirely of white marble, deſigned and executed by <hi>Scheemaeckers;</hi> and ſurrounded with baſs-reliefs. The altar is all of marble, with various deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of ſilver, and a ſtatue of the Virgin in that me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, ſix feet and an half high. The door of the chapel is likewiſe very neatly executed, and over it are three bronzes, of very fine workmanſhip.</p>
                     <p>In the church of the friars of St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> are a holy family, a very large picture by <hi>Rubens;</hi> one of his fineſt pieces. St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> in a tranſport of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion by <hi>Vandyke.</hi> He is lifting up his eyes to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, where he is ſuppoſed to ſee <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> This their catalogue ſays, is the very beſt performance of that great painter; it has certainly a wonderful merit; their is a ſtrength and majeſty of expreſſion, with an elegance and freedom of deſign, that is ſeldom ſeen; the colours are chaſte and agreeable, &amp;c. in a word, the whole piece is ſtrikingly fine. Here is alſo a crucifix, by <hi>Vandyke;</hi> this picture is likewiſe moſt capitally fine. Upon painting the above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned fine picture of St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> he demanded ſix-hundred

florins as his price, but the monks diſput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with him, he inſiſted on his terms, but let them have this crucifix very cheap. It could now be ſold for thirteen thouſand guineas. Such is the fate of the moſt ingenious part of mankind! They can ſcarcely live by the ſale of their productions, but when they are dead and buried, the world begins to find out their merit, and value ſingle efforts of their genius, at ten times more than their whole fortune.</p>
                     <p>In the firſt church, nothing is more worthy of atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion than the monument of the marquis <hi>Del Pico,</hi> one of the governors of the citadel. He is repreſented as ſtarting out of his ſleep, and in amazement at the ſight of two ſkeletons ſtanding before him. Over his head are two cherubs weeping, one of which holds a ſhield, and the other a helmet. Between them ſtands Fame, with the arms of the marquis in one hand, and her trumpet in the other; the whole decorated with great number of military inſignia. It is the work of <hi>Scheemaeckers,</hi> and one of his beſt performances. In the year 1746, at the ſiege, a bomb damaged it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderably, but it is ſince repaired and very well. The altar, by the ſame artiſt, is alſo a magnificent piece of ſculpture.</p>
                     <p>In the church of St. André, there is alſo a curious monument erected by two Engliſh ladies, to the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:0161700110:216"/>
of that unfortunate princeſs <hi>Mary,</hi> queen of Scots, who fell a ſacrifice, ſays <hi>Thickneſſe,</hi> to the jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy and hatred of our queen <hi>Beſs.</hi> This monument is of marble, with a buſt of the Queen.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Rubens,</hi> who died in the year 1640, was buried in a little chapel, which ſtill belongs to his family in the great church. His monument is of marble, and well executed; over the altar is a picture by his own hand, repreſenting the infant <hi>Jeſus</hi> on the knee of the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, which is perhaps the beſt conceived, the beſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted, and the beſt preſerved of all his works. St. <hi>George,</hi> and St. <hi>Jerome</hi> attended by two fine women, are near the Virgin, and theſe are the portraits of his two beautiful wives. This picture was engraved after his death by <hi>P. Pontius,</hi> and <hi>Rubens's</hi> intimate friend <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vates</hi> compoſed his epitaph; which however is too contemptible to copy, nor was it placed over his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains till the year 1755.</p>
                     <p>At Bruſſels, ſays <hi>Thickneſſe,</hi> all is French; at Ant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werp, all is Dutch. Which of the two is beſt with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the people, ſays he, I will not pretend to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine, but with reſpect to the laws, Antwerp bears all the credit and honour due to humanity. That barbarous and tyrannic cuſtom, of ſecretly trying cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minals, deſtroying their bodies, and confiſcating their property, in all the other provinces of the Auſtrian Netherlands and France, does not prevail in this city.
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:0161700110:217"/>
Perhaps this is the reaſon why Antwerp he adds, has produced more men of genius than any other city in this country. Here they had liberty to think, and it appears a kind of perpetual motion, was firſt made at Antwerp, and in 1530, <hi>Gemma Fuſius,</hi> found out a method of determining the longitude at ſea, by means of clocks and watches, and this very ſoon after gave riſe to the invention of clock-work.</p>
                     <p>When a perſon is to be tried for any offence in this country, he is brought face to face with his accuſer in open court, in the preſence of the magiſtrates, and cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minals are even allowed two council to plead for them. If the queſtion be put, the puniſhment muſt be in the preſence of two <hi>echevins,</hi> or aldermen; and if the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner be acquitted, he is inſtantly diſcharged: if guilty; he is executed or puniſhed the next day; but only a moiety of his property is forfeited; the other goes to his wife and children, or neareſt relations.—The beſt account I can give you, ſays <hi>Thickneſſe,</hi> of what is meant by the queſtion being put to a priſoner, before it is known whether he be innocent or guilty, is that the ſuppoſed offender is fixed on a frame, to which there are certain ſtretchers applied to his limbs, to draw them gradually beyond their natural extenſion, and at the ſame time, drops of water are let to fall on the breaſt, or ſome particular part of the body, which by repetition became almoſt intolerable.</p>
                     <p>The ſituation of Antwerp, remarks <hi>Reiſbec,</hi> would
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:0161700110:218"/>
have been much more advantageous for the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of commerce, but the Dutch have locked up the mouth of the Scheld. Their forts not only govern the mouth of the river, as they ſhould do according to treaty; it having been agreed by the peace concluded at Munſter, in 1648, between Spain and the United Provinces, that no large ſhips ſhould ſail directly to Antwerp; that they ſhould unload their merchandize in Holland, which ſhould be conveyed thence in ſmaller veſſels; but they have literally ſtopped up the mouth of it. Sunken ſhips filled with ſtones, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe dykes of ſtone palliſadoes, and other things of the kind, barely leave room enough for ſmall boats to go by. Twenty millions of guilders would not be ſufficient in twenty years to remove the impediments which the Dutch have laid in the way of the trade of Antwerp. On the contrary, other writers aver, that the Scheld is navigable now for ſhips of the largeſt bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then up to Antwerp; did not two forts on oppoſite ſides of that river, oppoſe the paſſage of veſſels above a limited burthen, which is very ſmall. A report propagated by the cunning of the Dutch, that there are five large veſſels ſunk in the Scheld, between their forts, has ſtrangely gained credit, not only in coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries at a diſtance from the river, but in Brabant itſelf, and even in Antwerp. It is amuſing to reflect on the eaſy credulity of the world. How much people are impoſed on by vague reports, and the authority of univerſally received opinions! We are well aſſured, by perſons of the firſt rank and character in Brabant,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:0161700110:219"/>
that there is not one veſſel ſunk in the Scheld, nor any other obſtruction, than the treaties and forts al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready mentioned to the paſſage of a ſeventy-four gun ſhip up to the walls of Antwerp.</p>
                     <p>There is no want of gold in Brabant and Flanders. Antwerp, Bruſſels, Ghent, and Bruges, are ſtill filled with the treaſures which were amaſſed when theſe towns were what England and Holland are now. The burgeſſes of theſe cities have a ſhare in all the great undertakings and loans of the neighbouring nations. Their commerce of exchange is immenſe; probably inſurance is not ſo ſafe among the Dutch themſelves as it is here. Antwerp is one of the moſt famous places in the world for inſurance. In the laſt Bavarian war, the court of Vienna, being determined to raiſe a loan in theſe countries, was aſtoniſhed at the quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with which the money was raiſed; but the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of Ghent and Antwerp gave the regency to underſtand, that if there was occaſion for three or four times as much, it would be as eaſily procured.</p>
                     <p>The inhabitants are religious to exceſs, ſays <hi>Reiſbec.</hi> They are alſo remarkably gay in their dreſs and equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page. The women, who are of a ſmall ſtature, are delicate, neat and beautiful; but, being almoſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from ſociety, and taught only the internal ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of their houſes and their children, they are not ſo ſocial as the ladies of France and England.
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:0161700110:220"/>
They are generally of a pale complexion, a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance which is perhaps owing to their conſtant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement in their houſes, for they never walk abroad or take any exerciſe, except upon Sunday evenings and public days, when they take the air in their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages upon the grand ſtreet called the <hi>Rue la mer,</hi> or in the environs of the city.</p>
                     <p>Mechlin is a conſiderable city, very well ſituated for traffic with Antwerp, Bruſſels and Louvain, by means of the rivers Dyle and Demer, which join before they arrive at this place, and run through it; there are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides ſeveral canals, and a great many bridges thrown over them. It is the capital of a diſtrict of the ſame name, and a See of an Archbiſhop, whoſe title is Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate of the low countries. The town is large and well built, and the ſtreets broad, clean and well paved. The market-place is ſpacious, and the cathedral is a ſuperb ſtructure, with a high ſteeple, and ſome very harmonious chimes. Mechlin is famous for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacture of the lace that goes by its name. It is chiefly made in the nunnery of the Beguines; a kind of nuns, without thoſe vows, which bend the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ones to a monaſtic life, being at liberty at any time to quit the confinement and marry; there are generally ſeven or eight hundred young women in it, employed on lace, which brings a good price all over Europe. They are alſo famous in this place for foundries of bells and great guns, and, in an inferior
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:0161700110:221"/>
for brewing good beer, which they export in conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable quantities. It is an agreeable place to reſide at, from the diverſions which are continually going on in it, principally owing to the number of nobility who make it their reſidence. This town was taken by the duke of <hi>Marlborough,</hi> in 1706, and retaken by the French in 1746.</p>
                     <p>At a village called Aigle, ſeated at the foot of a moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, on the Moſelle, there is a remarkakle ſquare ſolid pyramid, 74 feet high, and adorned with many images. It is a heatheniſh tomb, which appears from the inſcription to have been founded by two brothers, named <hi>Secundini,</hi> in honor of their parents. In all probability this mauſoleum was created between the times of <hi>Diocleſian</hi> and <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great. Part of the territory of Luxemburg likewiſe belongs to the French.</p>

                     <p>Flanders, a province of the Netherlands, which may be divided into Dutch, Auſtrian, and French Flanders, is bounded by the German ocean, and the United Provinces on the north; by the province of Brabant on the eaſt; by Hainault and Artois on the ſouth; and by another part of Artois and the German ocean on the weſt. It is about twenty German miles
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:0161700110:222"/>
from north to ſouth, and nearly the ſame diſtance from eaſt to weſt.</p>
                     <p>This country enjoys a temperate and wholeſome air, being partly level and partly mountainous. Its ſoil is in general fertile and fit for agriculture, and in ſome parts, particularly towards the ſea, its fertility is very great. The land here bears almoſt all kinds of corn and garden-ſtuff. Flax is the riches of the country. The paſture grounds in many parts are ſo excellent, that there are no better in all the Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands. For this reaſon the breeding of cattle is an important article, and it yields alſo fine butter and cheeſe. Flanders alſo produces fruits of various ſorts, together with fowl and veniſon, ſuch as deer, wild-boars and hares; and likewiſe ſea and river fiſh. In it alſo are foreſts and woods. Its chief river is the Scheld. Some uſeful canals have alſo been dug here, among which that between Bruges and Ghent is the, principal one.</p>
                     <p>In the whole country are computed 62 walled and open towns, many hundred villages, and above 250 Seignories. The ſtates here are the prelates, nobles, and four members from the principal towns.</p>
                     <p>The Flemings may boaſt the invention of ſome im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant arts. They were the firſt in Europe who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to ſupport themſelves by weaving, and learned
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:0161700110:223"/>
to dye cloths and ſtuffs. In this reſpect the towns of Ypres and Courtray have the oldeſt and greateſt reputation. In the latter was invented the art of weaving all ſorts of figures in linen. In the 14th century, <hi>Viervliet,</hi> found out the method of curing herrings. <hi>John Van Eyck,</hi> in the 15th, invented oil colours.</p>
                     <p>At preſent the manufactures of Flanders are far from being in the flouriſhing condition they were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly; however, we have ſtill from Liſle, brocades, cottons, camlets, lace, and other wares; from Ghent, Menin, and Courtray, linen; from Tournay, tapeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, curtains, bed coverlets, and other worked ſtuffs; from Bruges, cotton and fine woolen ſtuffs, linen and laces. The chief towns of Auſtrian Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, beſides thoſe deſcribed, are, Louvain, Ghent, Bruges, and Oſtend.</p>
                     <p>Louvain is a large and pleaſant town, ſituated on the river Dyle; it is one of the principal cities of the Netherlands, and the capital of one of the four quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, into which Brabant is uſually divided. The country round it is very fertile, and the diſtance from Bruſſels not more than twelve miles to the north-eaſt of that city. The air likewiſe is eſteemed exceedingly healthful. Its circumference within the walls is at leaſt ten Engliſh miles; but it is a place of no great ſtrength, being of too large an extent to be eaſily
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:0161700110:224"/>
defended. The caſtle ſtands on the top of a hill, ſurrounded with vineyards, and fine gardens, and has an extenſive proſpect over the neighbouring country.</p>
                     <p>This city, before the cruel adminiſtration of the duke of <hi>Alva,</hi> was very conſiderable for its manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures; it being computed there were no leſs than 4,000 maſter-weavers in it at one time; and it has ſtill a trade in fine linen, but not comparable to what it was formerly. At preſent its only glory is its uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity, which reſembles thoſe of England more than any other in Europe. It conſiſts of 43 colleges, and ſome make the number greater, of which there are not more than four, for the education of youth, where ſtrict diſcipline is obſerved; the others are for thoſe of riper years, who come and go when they pleaſe. Many of theſe colleges are handſome buildings, and nobly endowed; but in both theſe reſpects they bear no compariſon with thoſe of Oxford and Cambridge. The ſtudents in divinity conſtantly wear gowns and caps, but the reſt only at public exerciſes. In every one of the four colleges above-mentioned, philoſophy is taught by two profeſſors, each of whom reads two hours in a day, the young ſtudents writing after them. The governor of the univerſity is ſtiled <hi>Rector,</hi> and is choſen every half year by the <hi>Senatus Academicus,</hi> which conſiſts of the ſuperior graduates in the ſeveral faculties. He has plenary juriſdiction over the ſcho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:0161700110:225"/>
and is attended by eight beadles, who go before him with ſilver maces on holidays, and in ſolemn pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions. There is another officer called the <hi>Promoter,</hi> who by the authority of the rector, inflicts puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on the offenders, and ſometimes paſſes ſentence of death, but generally lays a pecuniary mulct on them in proportion to their crime. They have alſo a chancellor, whoſe only buſineſs it is to confer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, and who in all public aſſemblies takes place next to the rector.</p>
                     <p>The town-houſe of Louvain is a magnificent build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of great antiquity, adorned on the outſide with ſtatues, and very curious ſculpture. As to the churches of the city, they are many of them beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful and ſtately buildings, eſpecially the cathedral church of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> which is governed by a provoſt, a dean, a chanter, 18 honorary prebends, and ten canons, who are all profeſſors of the ſeveral ſciences in the univerſity. The Jeſuit's church is alſo a very handſome edifice, not unworthy of Rome itſelf; and its pulpit of oak is reckoned the fineſt piece of carved work in Europe. Their library contains a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of valuable manuſcripts, in which reſpect it is ſaid to be the beſt in the Auſtrian Netherlands.</p>
                     <p>In this place, ſays, <hi>Thickneſſe,</hi> reſided a few years ſince a man, no leſs extraordinary in his way, than the famous mountain doctor in Switzerland, named <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen,</hi>
                        <pb n="218" facs="tcp:0161700110:226"/>
and called the god of legs. He was an illiterate, under-bred man, who had a noſtrum to cure ulcers in the legs, and with ſo much ſucceſs that patients came to him from every part of the continent. But that which eſtabliſhed his fame and fortune too, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond contradiction, was the extraordinary cure he performed on the late Prince <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>Lorraine's</hi> leg, after he had tried all the ſurgeons of Paris and the low countries, without benefit, and had been for many years a perfect cripple; though he had given in pictures and ſnuff-boxes to various ſurgeons to the value of five thouſand pounds. Being ſent for, and on exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining the ulcer, he, in a very rough, unpoliſhed lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, ſaid to the Prince, <hi>"Zounds! what is</hi> this <hi>all? why, we will walk to-morrow!"</hi> His rude man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and ſeeming ignorance had almoſt determined the prince to have diſmiſſed him inſtantly; for he thought it impoſſible that a man, who had not ſet his foot to the ground for ſome years, ſhould be able to walk the next day; yet he did walk the next day, and in a very ſhort time after was perfectly cured, and enjoyed eighteen years of life and health afterwards. Mr. <hi>Bogen</hi> is now dead; but his ſon, whom the prince made his valet-de-chambre, is ſtill living, and is equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly qualified to perform the ſame, cures. Neither fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nor ſon pretend to any chirurgical ſkill, farther than rolling the bandage, which is done in a moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent and extraordinary manner. The whole ſecret, ſays <hi>Thickneſſe,</hi> I have good reaſon to believe, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

                     <p>Ghent is one of the largeſt cities in Europe, being near fifteen miles in circumference; ſome ſay twenty. It is built on a great number of little iſlands, formed by four rivers and many canals, over which there are an hundred bridges: but large and pompous as this account is, the reality bears no proportion to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription; more than half the ground within the walls, being occupied by gardens, and there are ſome fields. The fortifications are contemptible, being little more than lines for an army to encamp within. Some of the ſtreets are large, well paved, and tolerably built. Among the public buildings, there are none worthy of any attention but a few churches, except the houſe in which <hi>Charles</hi> V. was born, which is ſtill to be ſeen. This place gave birth to that monarch in the year 1500. He was the ſon of <hi>Philip</hi> the handſome, arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duke of Auſtria, whoſe parents were the emperor <hi>Maximilian</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> the only child of <hi>Charles</hi> the bold, the laſt prince of the houſe of Burgundy. His mother was the daughter of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> and <hi>Iſabella,</hi> king and queen of Caſtile and Arragon.</p>
                     <p>The abbey of St. Pierre ranks far beyond any others in Ghent: it is ſituated on a riſing ground, at
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:0161700110:228"/>
the extremity of the town, and conſiſts of an abbot and thirty-ſeven benedictine monks. The refectory is ſuperb, and fitter for a palace than a convent; it is paved with black and white marble, and painted throughout in a maſterly manner. The library is very magnificent, and the number of books, ſuch as they are, very conſiderable. From the windows you have a moſt delightful, as well as an extenſive view of the country. In the church is ſome tapeſtry held in great eſtimation, which has been there upwards of two cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turies. It contains the hiſtories of Sts. <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> in divers compartments, moſt admirably finiſhed, and was the work of <hi>Croyer,</hi> of Bruſſels.</p>
                     <p>The horſe, in the converſion of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> is the fineſt animal it is poſſible to behold. Our Saviour ſtanding tiptoe on a wave is the true ſublime, and is moſt happily executed. <hi>Elymas</hi> ſtruck with blindneſs, has much merit; and a marble floor is as nicely imitated in the tapeſtry, as was ever ſeen in any pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                     <p>The abbot's houſe is moſt ſumptuous; the gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of the low countries always reſides in it when at Ghent. The apartments are crouded with good pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, but three by <hi>Rubens</hi> are moſt excellent: the one is <hi>Joſeph,</hi> with the infant <hi>Chriſt</hi> in his arms; the two others are the heads of old men.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="221" facs="tcp:0161700110:229"/>The cathedral is a noble old building, dedicated to St. <hi>Buvon,</hi> of whom there is a good ſtatue over the grand altar, ſtanding on the clouds, which are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by angels. Againſt the pillars of the church are ſome tolerable ſtatues, and where there are va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cancies they have painted figures in the imitation of ſtatues ſo happily, that it is difficult to find out the deception. The pulpit is ſaid to be the grandeſt of the kind; it is of marble, enriched with ſtatues, and has two angels to ſupport the ſounding board. There is a capital picture of St. <hi>Buvon,</hi> by <hi>Rubens,</hi> in which he has introduced himſelf, his wife and family.</p>
                     <p>The monument of Biſhop <hi>Trieſte,</hi> by <hi>Fiamingo,</hi> is moſt admirably executed; the boys do not yield even to thoſe of Cardinal Richlieu's monument at the Sorbonne. <hi>Fiamingo's</hi> principal excellence was in boys and the delicate. In this reſpect he was ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to <hi>Michael Angelo,</hi> who attained the antique only in ſtrong muſcular figures, not in thoſe of youth nor women, who under his bold hand became amazons.</p>
                     <p>The Maiſon-de-Ville has two fronts, the one in the Gothic, the other in the Grecian ſtile, of three ſtories, adorned with Attic, Ionic, and Corinthian columns.</p>
                     <p>There are ſome few pictures, as the Day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by <hi>Rubens,</hi> and the Coronation of <hi>Charles</hi> VI. in which picture are five hundred figures, moſt of
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:0161700110:230"/>
them taken from the life. But the moſt capital pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is Hercules between Virtue and Pleaſure, taken from the fable of Cebes.</p>
                     <p>Before I came into this country, ſays <hi>Thickneſſe,</hi> I thought the diſcipline of the Britiſh and French troops were tolerably ſtrict; but as every, thing is by compariſon, ſo I was ſoon convinced that neither the Britiſh or French diſcipline can bear that name, when put in competition with the diſcipline of the German troops; and yet I am told I ſhould find a ſtill greater difference between theſe troops and thoſe of the king of Pruſſia. The ſoldier here wears his white coat three years, and it muſt be always perfectly clean; at the expiration of which time he has a new one, and his old one is made into a waiſtcoat and breeches, and muſt ſerve three years more in that capacity; and is then dyed black to make gaiters. The ſoldier is found in every article he can want for dreſs, even to his hair-ſtring and powder; but his net pay is only two-pence halfpenny a day! five farthings of which is put into the common meſs (eight men in each) and the other five farthings are for the luxuries of life. Sheeps head broth, and horſe-beans boiled in greaſe, are with them great delicacies. It fares better with the officers, for a captain of foot in the Imperial ſervice has an hundred guineas a year, a ſervant allowed him, and his livery furniſhed by the Emperor. But when an officer neglects his duty, and repeats it two or three
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:0161700110:231"/>
times, after the commandant has hinted to him to be more attentive, he may be diſmiſſed by the ſame au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. Having aſked, ſays <hi>Thickneſſe,</hi> what puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were uſed to maintain ſo ſtrict a diſcipline, the anſwer was, <hi>none!</hi> The puniſhments are ſo ſevere that no man riſks the experiment.</p>
                     <p>In the caſtle of Ghent there are cloathing, arms, accoutrements, &amp;c. for ten thouſand horſe and foot, all in the moſt perfect order, and all of it made with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the caſtle walls by the hands of the ſoldiers. The German troops are in general ſturdy, well-looking men, but they are ill-limbed, and certainly have not much more underſtanding among ten thouſand of them, than may be found among a flock of ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſheep led about by a bell-wether.</p>
                     <p>They have very flouriſhing linen manufactures throughout all this country; but theſe are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to Ghent, though there are many in that town; but all the villages, and almoſt every farm, is a flax-manufactory. Flax is a principal crop upon all the ſundry parts of this country, and the farmers and labourers do not only grow it, but alſo dreſs and weave it, and the women and children ſpin it. Every little farmer has one or two looms; many of them five or ſix, and ſome ſeven or eight, according to the number of hands in the family. This makes the whole race of country people remarkably active and
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:0161700110:232"/>
induſtrious; the ſervants and the farmer and his ſons will weave linen in the night, and in wet days, when they have not employment in the farm; and in this manner greatly contribute to earning a better main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance for their families than in other countries, where ſuch time is appropriated to idleneſs.</p>
                     <p>The accommodations in the bark on the canal of Auſtrian Flanders, are infinitely ſuperior to thoſe of the Trackſkuits in Holland, being conſiderably larger, with excellent apartments below, for three ſeveral claſſes of paſſengers, and a ſhaded quarter-deck with benches for them to fit on, when they chuſe to take the air. There is a good dinner provided for each apartment; and the company may be accommodated with wines of different kinds, tea, coffee, and Flemiſh beer. The price of travelling, as well as the fare, is remarkably cheap; and the beſt apartments are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways filled with good company. In fine weather no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be more delightful than an excurſion from Ghent to Bruges by the bark, which paſſes from place to place in one day, diſtance about 30 miles, price 2s. 6d. Engliſh, dinner included. The variety of fine proſpects, the charming verdure every where to be ſeen; the number of little chatteaus on the banks of the canal; the enlivening company that is generally to be met with, and the ſtill pleaſing man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in which die bark keeps moving forward, without any moleſtation from the ſun or duſt in a hot ſultry
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:0161700110:233"/>
day all together conſpire to give very pleaſing ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations to the mind. They tell you an Engliſh gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman was ſo delighted with the paſſage, the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment, and the company he met, that he lived on board this bark for ſeven years, ſleeping one night at Ghent, the next at Bruges, and ſo on; and, that being a facetious man, the better ſort of people of theſe two towns, particularly the young ladies, would frequently, for an excurſion, go and dine, as they uſed to call it, with the Engliſh gentleman.</p>
                     <p>There are a kind of ſtage-coaches that travel all through Brabant, heavy, lumbering things, that on their paved roads almoſt ſhake a man to death. The fare is cheaper than in England, and the accommodations paſſable; but four perſons may hire a coach and pair, which will travel as faſt as the ſtage, and coſt no more than the ſtage price, and are far more eaſy to travel in. A perſon may go from London to Spa, and travel 200 miles through all Auſtrian Brabant, for four gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas, and live well upon the road; the paſſage in the packet from Dover to Oſtend included, which is one guinea of the money. Thoſe who travel in Flanders by the canals, pay as much for the carriage of a trunk as for themſelves; the natives of the country take a few neceſſary things, in a kind of ſatchel made of carpeting called a <hi>ſac du nuit,</hi> which they carry in their hands when they are obliged to change boats, as is often the caſe, the canals not joining each other; and by this they avoid the impoſitions of thoſe who attend the
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:0161700110:234"/>
boats to remove the luggage. The price of travelling in theſe boats or barks is not more then one halfpenny Engliſh, per mile. They ſet out at ſtated hours as ſtage-coaches do, are drawn by horſes at the rate of four or five miles an hour, and will travel thirty or forty miles a-day, ſtopping at certain places to dine.</p>
                     <p>For fifteen-pence the treckſchuyt, an elegant yatch, conducts the traveller from Oſtend to this city, which in the 13th century was the principal mart in Europe, and where the merchants of all parts of the world had houſes and commerical connexions; but the frequent revolts of the inhabitants againſt their ſovereigns, the manufacturers againſt their maſters, and the maſters againſt the magiſtrates, firſt drove the ſtrangers to Antwerp, and the natives to different parts of the world; the ſad effects of which are ſtill felt, and ſtill viſible; for Antwerp was raiſed on the ruins of Bruges, as Amſterdam is at this day on thoſe of Antwerp. But ſince Oſtend has become a free port, Bruges begins to revive in her trade. It is ſaid there are two hundred and fifty ſtreets in Bruges, and 40,000 inhabitants; but more than 10,000 of them are ſupported by public charity.</p>
                     <p>The police is good, the magiſtrates being juſt, but ſevere, and there is no part of the continent where ſtrangers or natives can travel more ſecurely. At Bruges an advocate is paid twenty-eight pence an hour
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:0161700110:235"/>
for attendance, but the phyſician has only ſeven-pence for each viſit. When a conſultation is held, each phyſician has twenty-ſix pence, and the ſurgeons half that ſum.</p>
                     <p>In one of the churches at Ghent, there is a ring of bells, the largeſt of which weighs 110 quintals, each quintal, a hundred pounds. There are two or three fine open places in this city, and a good theatre; but the houſes, as at Bruſſels and Bruges, are all old-faſhioned and built in the Gothic ſtyle.</p>
                     <p>Bruges is an ancient and extenſive city, walled in, the circumference being near five miles. It has near three hundred ſtreets in it, and a vaſt number of canals and rivers; but notwithſtanding all this ſpaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, it is not an agreeable place. The houſes are in general very old and extremely ugly, and the whole place ſhews evident ſigns of decay, and a loſs of that trade and manufacture for which it was once famous. They reckon ſix ſquares, ſeven gates, eight churches, and no leſs than ſixty monaſteries; a woeful ſort of population, inſtead of the induſtrious manufacturers, which once filled the city: among the reſt, there is a nunnery of Engliſh, which ſeveral Roman Catholic families in England have contributed to fill.</p>
                     <p>The churches of Bruges have not any thing in them remarkable; the beſt is the Jeſuits, which is an elegant
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:0161700110:236"/>
edifice. In the church of our Lady, there are two fine monuments of <hi>Charles</hi> the Bold, Duke of Burgundy, and his daughter and heireſs, <hi>Mary</hi> of Burgundy; they are of braſs, with much enamelling; the workmanſhip good. Her dreſs is likewiſe ſhewn, that ſhe wore three hundred years ago, and which is highly enriched with jewels.</p>
                     <p>What gives this place a very melancholy air, are the vaſt houſes ſtanding empty in every part of the town, which once were the reſidence of wealth and ſplendour. Among others they have ſeventeen palaces, which, in the times of their proſperity, were formerly the reſidence of conſuls from various kingdoms and ſtates in Europe. This town was famous for trade, before Antwerp aroſe, being then the greateſt mart in Europe; England made it the ſtaple for her wool; and its cloth manufactories were much more conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, than thoſe of any other place or country. Bruges however at preſent is not without ſome trade. The Oſtend canal admits ſhips of from 2 to 300 tons burthen, up to the heart of the city, which excites more trade here than in any other town in Flanders.</p>
                     <p>The merchandize imported by the ſhipping on this canal, is ſent to many places from Bruges, particularly by the Scheld to the city of Ghent, and from thence by other canals to various cities; and that river with the Scarpe and the Lys, reaches to Tournay, Menin,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:0161700110:237"/>
Liſle and Douay: they have likewiſe a communication with Antwerp, Louvain, Mechlin, and Bruſſels. It is an epiſcopal town. In the great ſquare there is a houſe founded in 1411, where they provide for 130 orphans, and bring them up, ſome to learning, and others to trades, according to their abilities. This city has often been taken and retaken in the late wars, particularly in 1745, by the French.</p>
                     <p>Oſtend is the only ſea-port of Auſtrian Flanders. It is ſmall, but well built and clean, nor does it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit ſo much decay of ancient greatneſs as Bruges. It is ſituated in the midſt of a ſalt-marſh, with ditches into which the ſea is let; this ſituation makes it ſtrong, but the improvements in the modern art of attacking places will not allow it the ſame of ſuch another ſiege as that which it ſtood againſt the Spaniards, which laſted three years, and in which above 100,000 men on both ſides fell. The French, in 1745, took it in eight days. In the furious ſiege above-mentioned which laſted from 1601 to 1604, and in which the Dutch loſt 50,000 men, and the Spaniards 80,000, <hi>Iſabella Eugenia,</hi> governante of the Netherlands, made a vow ſhe would not change her linen till Oſtend ſurrendered; but before the town was taken, the colour of it was quite changed. However the ladies of the court, to keep her in countenance, had theirs dyed, ſo as to be in colour like that of their miſtreſs. By the late Emperor's having made it a free port, the
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:0161700110:238"/>
trade of it has been very much increaſed. The eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of an Eaſt-India Company here, by the Emperor, has alſo contributed not a little to render it famous. The maritime powers endeavoured to frighten him out of this eſtabliſhment; and it is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what extraordinary how theſe powers could have had the modeſty to puſh this matter in the manner they did; for why the Emperor ſhould not have the liberty to form what eſtabliſhments he pleaſed in a ſea-port in his own dominions, is much more than any of the Engliſh or Dutch memorials could give a ſatisfactory reply to.</p>
                     <p>It is eſtimated that the Engliſh ſmugglers alone bring to the amount of 600,000 livres monthly into this town; they bring too, ready money, and therefore the Oſtenders are content with ſmall profits, for their brandy, tobacco, tea, gauzes, laces, wine, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>This town is now inhabited by men of all nations, where as much Engliſh is heard as French or Flemiſh; ſurrounded with the ſea, they have no good water; the harbour however is crouded with ſhipping, which ſhews it to be a place of great trade.</p>

                     <head>THE COUNTY OF NAMUR,</head>
                     <p>Is nearly ſurrounded by the Biſhopric of Liege and the Duchy of Brabant. Its extent from north to ſouth is about ſix German miles, and nearly as much from
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:0161700110:239"/>
eaſt to weſt. This country is very mountainous and woody. Its principal riches conſiſts in iron, which is here prepared into ſteel and worked up in great quantities. In the level country is a great deal of corn land. The Meuſe, which runs through the country, and receives into it the Sambre at Namur, tends much to the fertility of the ſoil, and to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the country in general from its navigation.</p>
                     <p>Namur, the capital of the country, is a large and rich town, ſeated between two mountains, with a ſtrong caſtle, ſeveral forts, and a biſhop's ſee. This city was beſieged by King William in 1695, who took it in the ſight of an army of 100,000 French, though there was 60,000 men in garriſon.</p>
                     <p>The Flemings, ſays <hi>Reiſbec,</hi> are the moſt extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary compound of ſlothfulneſs and induſtry, ſtupidity and acuteneſs, activity and cowardlineſs, goodneſs of heart and treachery, that can be well conceived. An Engliſhman once ſaid of them, "They have the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence of the French, without their pleaſantry; the pride and bigotry of the Spaniards, without their ſenſe of honour; the ferocity and harſhneſs of the Dutch, without their punctuality; the debauchery of the Germans, without their integrity; and as to their bodies, they are blocks, from which the carver at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to make Engliſhmen, but could not cut them out." The picture is in general juſt, as theſe inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the Netherlands are an aſſemblage of all theſe
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:0161700110:240"/>
nations. But what they are moſt conſpicuous for, is want of honour. You muſt have agreements in writing in all the common tranſactions of life. You are in danger of firſt being overcharged, and then carried into a court of juſtice by every workman of whom you beſpeak a piece of work, if you do not put down your agreement in black and white.</p>
                     <p>With reſpect to their bodies, they and the Saxons are moſt like the Germans, deſcribed by <hi>Tacitus:</hi> their bodies are of a very unwieldy make, and <hi>ad impetum valida,</hi> what too <hi>Tacitus</hi> ſays of the old Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, that they can bear neither hunger nor thirſt, nor heat, nor cold, nor yet any long work, is true of them. In the Imperial armies they are accounted good partiſans, but are never put to regular ſervice without extreme neceſſity. They have a great abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of diſcipline, and look upon it as a ſevere puniſhment to be ſubject to the rules of ſervice. If their robberies and maraudings are not overlooked, they will not laſt out a campaign. In ſhort, it is only in action that they ſhew themſelves at all as ſoldiers.</p>
                     <p>Except Spain, Italy, and Portugal, there is no country ſo overloaded with monks as the Auſtrian Netherlands: there are in many towns forty or fifty convents; ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral prelatures are worth 200,000 guilders, (2000l.) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>year. If you divide the income of the country into four parts, one will be found to belong to the prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:0161700110:241"/>
one to the nobility, one to the ſovereign, and one to the people. The bigotry and intolerance of the inhabitants are beyond all deſcription, and is a marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous contraſt to the corruption of their manners.</p>
                     <p>Reſpecting their manufactures, they have not a ſingle one comparable to what they were formerly: that of lace is flouriſhing, but not near ſo conſiderable as formerly; and the ſame obſervation is applicable to thoſe of fine linen and tapeſtry: indeed, the attention given to manufacturers in every country of Europe, cannot but have drawn much from the old fabric long eſtabliſhed; no article of manufacture is found in Flanders which is not ſtrongly rivalled by ſome neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour or other. This, with the internal miſchiefs, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting from freedoms of corporate towns cramping the workmen, is very prejudicial to all induſtry in theſe provinces.</p>
                     <p>Notwithſtanding theſe impediments, the fabrics of Auſtrian provinces are by no means inconſiderable; the towns are thick, and all of them have ſome manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture or other: their linens, laces, ſtockings, caps, cloth, druggets, carpets, &amp;c. are all conſiderable; employing great numbers of hands, and bringing much money into the country.</p>
                     <p>The dreſs of the peaſants of this country is like that of French Flanders; and what we ſo often ſee in
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:0161700110:242"/>
the pictures of <hi>Teniers.</hi> The women wear a kind of French night-cap, with a plaited border, gold ear-rings, a gold croſs hanging from their neck, a jacket and petticoat, the petticoat ſhort, the jacket laced before, and ſlippers. Some wear a black bib and ſhort black apron. They never wear a hat, but when abroad throw over their heads about four yards of black ſtuff like a veil. The better claſs of women wear camblet hoods abroad, and long cloaks of the ſame.</p>
                     <p>The man's dreſs is better deſcribed by the plate—where a young man has conducted his ſweetheart to the houſe of a village-doctor for a remedy, ſhe having complained of being ill. As this man looked into the cauſe of complaints by the urine of his patients, ſhe took a bottle of her urine with her, little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that on examining it he would have diſcovered that ſhe was with child; and which ſhe would never had her lover, the laſt man in the world, to have been made acquainted with.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. XI.</hi> Review of Germany.</head>
                  <p>THE Germans are in general tall, robuſt, and well made; of a fair complexion, and regular features. Their women in particular are very handſome, and excel thoſe of moſt other countries. They never uſe paint, or foreign ornaments, to embelliſh their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. Their apparel is exceedingly modeſt, but very rich, and they are ſaid to be remarkably fond of jewels; they are more obſequious to their huſbands than thoſe of other nations, many of them not even ſitting at table with them, and none of them taking the upper hand of them. They are alſo for the moſt part well educated, and extremely fond of muſic; but not very talkative.</p>
                  <p>The people of Germany have a degree of ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion among them, beyond that of other nations, that will ſometimes lead them into the moſt deſperate acts. The following from <hi>Chiſul,</hi> is one of the many ſtories that could be brought to evince this truth. He was at Vienna about forty years ſince, and had the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of ſeeing the decollation of a woman, whoſe head the executioner ſtruck off at one blow, as ſhe ſat in a chair, levelled againſt the back part of her neck with a two-handed ſtroke and a broad two-edged
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:0161700110:245"/>
ſword. At theſe executions there aſſiſt, as in Italy, about twenty perſons of an order called the Confra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity of the Dead, habited in black with maſks, broad hemmed hats and mourning ſtaves. They are a fixed ſociety, compoſed of citizens of the middle rank, on whom their confeſſion impoſe it as a piece of penance to aſſiſt <hi>incognito</hi> on theſe occaſions. But moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable was the fact and behaviour of the criminal, who was about twenty-ſix years old, and in the abſence of her huſband, then three years impriſoned at Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg, had admitted the embraces of a young man whom ſhe paſſionately loved, but at laſt diſcovered was going to be married to another woman. After the moſt earneſt, but fruitleſs endeavours to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade him from his purpoſe, ſhe invited him to walk with her one morning beyond the <hi>Favorita,</hi> where, in a bye place, ſhe enticed him to kiſs her, and at that moment took her opportunity, and ſhot him in the head. This done ſhe immediately reſigned herſelf to juſtice, revealed the whole fact, and implored her ſpeedy diſpatch, that ſo ſhe might have his company in the other world, without whom ſhe could not live in this. She walked with a freſh and undaunted countenance to the place of ſentence, which, though before deſigned and notified accordingly, is never formally pronounced till the time of execution. From thence ſhe returned to the place of her death, ſat down in the chair, and received the ſtroke without ever moving her body, changing her countenance, or dreading the blow ſhe
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:0161700110:246"/>
was to feel.—At theſe executions they often catch the blood of the criminal, as good againſt the falling ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. It is from ſimilar ſuperſtitions, that the people ſo frequently murder infants at Hamburg, in order to procure a capital puniſhment, tired of their lives, and dreading the idea of ſelf-murder.</p>
                  <p>Though the Germans in general are of large ſtature, yet it has been obſerved their ſpirit is not equal to their bulk. They are generally very good-natured, and free from malice and ſubtlety. The peaſants are laborious, ſincere, honeſt, and hoſpitable; as are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the merchants and tradeſmen, who are withal very complaiſant.</p>
                  <p>Hoſpitality is a peculiar characteriſtic of the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans; and it is a virtue they derive from their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors; for <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> informs us, that in his time their houſes were open to all men; that they thought it an injuſtice to affront a traveller, and even looked upon it as a piece of religion to protect thoſe who came under their roof. A ſingle letter of recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation is ſufficient to procure a perſon an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able reception among them, which can hardly be ſaid of the inhabitants of any other country. Their civility extends ſo far as to introduce a ſtranger directly into their ſocieties or aſſemblies. They are remarkable alſo for their bravery, and love of military glory, in which they rival, if not ſurpaſs, moſt other nations.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="238" facs="tcp:0161700110:247"/>The Germans are frequently repreſented as dull and heavy; but thoſe who characterize them thus, have ſeldom any knowledge of them, but what they borrow from the French, who hardly ever allow wit or ſenſe in any other nation than their own. To judge of their intellects by their improvements in mechanic arts, we ſhould never charge a people with heavineſs and ſtupidity to whom we are indebted for ſo many uſeful and valuable diſcoveries. They have not indeed the ſame vivacity, but they ſurpaſs the French in applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and judgment. Upon the reſtoration of learning they diſtinguiſhed themſelves early in the different branches of literature.</p>
                  <p>Their firſt reformers, <hi>Luther, Melanchthon, Camera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> and others, were moſt of them men of eminent erudition. Few other nations ſurpaſs either their men of letters, or even their mechanics, in application. This made an Italian ſay, by way of joke, expreſſive of their aſſiduity, "That the underſtanding of a German was not in his brain, but in his back." Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is encouraged here to a fault, no perſon being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to any degree in their univerſities, who has not publiſhed at leaſt one diſputation.</p>
                  <p>In regard to baths and mineral fountains, it is a queſtion if there are ſo many in all Europe as in Germany. They reckon above a thouſand ſprings of acid waters alone, ſome hot, ſome cold, and others that are both hot and cold at different times.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="239" facs="tcp:0161700110:248"/>Germany is likewiſe famous for that ſort of earth called <hi>terra ſigillata.</hi> It is a kind of hard earth, with white, yellow, and red veins, and ſaid to be an antidote againſt all ſorts of poiſons.</p>
                  <p>Travelling is cheaper in Germany than in moſt parts of Europe, but the accommodations on the roads between the great towns, are very indifferent, both with reſpect to diet and lodging. In the houſes we ſeldom ſee a fire, except in their kitchens, their rooms being heated by ſtoves. One thing is very peculiar in their bed-furniture, they uſe no blankets nor quilts; but lay one featherbed caſed in linen like a pillow, and another underneath covered with a ſheet, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween theſe two, the Germans ſleep. Travelling in many parts of Germany, particularly where the roads are ſandy, is very tedious, the poſtilions not going above three Engliſh miles an hour. It is uſual for thoſe perſons who travel poſt through Germany, and have no carriage of their own, to purchaſe one for that purpoſe, which may generally be met with in any of the frontier towns on very eaſy terms; as the carriages at the poſt houſes in Germany, and which the poſt-maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are obliged to furniſh, if required, have frequently no covering to them. They are in every reſpect like an Engliſh waggon, built on a ſmall ſcale to hold about ſix perſons. The covered carriages occaſionally to be found at the poſt-houſes, and thoſe purchaſed by common travellers, are like our old-faſhioned phaetons.
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:0161700110:249"/>
The ordinary poſt-waggon, which anſwers to our ſtage-coach, travels night and day for days together. It goes between forty and fifty Engliſh miles in four-and-twenty hours, and is in appearance like an Engliſh narrow-wheeled waggon, only ſomething lighter. For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly none of them had coverings, at preſent moſt of them have, but not all.</p>
                  <p>Germany, including Sileſia, is ſomething larger than France. It contains about twelve thouſand ſquare miles. The ſoil varies very much in different parts. A great part of it however is very highly cultivated. The immenſe maſſes of rocks in the ſouthern parts of Auſtria and Bavaria, and the ſands of the north, which take in nearly the whole of Lower Saxony, with Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denburg, Pomerania, and the north of Weſtphalia, are not capable of ſuch a high degree of cultivation as the upper parts of Germany; but this would be a great advantage, if the intereſts and welfare of the whole were common. The mountains in the ſouth contain metals of all kinds in prodigious quantities, and the ſands in the northern parts produce hemp, flax, and wool, with excellent timber in abundance for the building of ſhips.</p>
                  <p>Bohemia, Moravia, Sileſia, Auſtria, Bavaria, and the countries about the Rhine, the Auſtrian Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands, and part of Upper Saxony, furniſh corn, cattle, wine, and all the prime neceſſaries of life, in ſuch
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:0161700110:250"/>
quantities as are not only ſufficient to ſupply Germany, but even for exportation.—In ſhort, Germany is the only country that is independent of all the world, and ſupplied with all the neceſſaries and convenience of life, which a large and flouriſhing ſtate requires, for its ſupport, or ſtands in need of for its defence. France, ſays <hi>Reiſbec,</hi> is deficient of wood and cattle, particularly horſes, the moſt neceſſary metals and linen; and Ruſſia is obliged to import wine, wood, horſes, and various other articles; but Germany has every thing which theſe two very powerful countries produce, and a ſuperfluity beſides of what they ſtand in need.</p>
                  <p>It is difficult to eſtimate the population of Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many. Some countries, as for inſtance Upper Auſtria, have 2000 ſouls in every ſquare mile, Magdeburg, Minden, Brunſwick, and many others, have 2500. On the contrary, the Hanoverian dominions, Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denburg, Pomerania, and Mecklenburg, with many others, have not more than 1000 inhabitants on every ſquare mile. Reckoning therefore 1700 inhabitants on an average for every ſquare mile, will give twenty-five millions for the whole country, which is nearly the number they are eſtimated by the late King of Pruſſia in his Treatiſe of German Literature; and which, ſays <hi>Reiſbec,</hi> ſeems to come neareſt the truth. The manifeſto which the Empreſs of Ruſſia preſented to the court of Vienna, on account of the laſt diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances about Bavaria, contains theſe remarkable words, "It is the intereſt of all the powers of Europe to take
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:0161700110:251"/>
care that the balance of Germany be not diſturbed; for if it ſhould be, its internal ſtrength and ſituation may enable it to deſtroy the peace of Europe."</p>
                  <p>This extenſive country has not as yet acquired the degree of cultivation of which it is capable. It is not even ſo highly cultivated as France. The peace of Hubertſburger is its aera of cultivation. Since that period agriculture and induſtry have been univerſal. It at once exerted all its ſtrength to fill up the gaps which had been made by the deſtructive war of thirty years. The very partition of the country into ſo many different ſtates, prejudicial as it is to the exertion of power for the purpoſe of foreign conqueſts, has been of advantage to its internal cultivation. At preſent the firſt princes in Germany contend with each other who ſhall make the greateſt improvements in the adminiſtration of juſtice, in the ſyſtem of edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and in their general police for the promotion of agriculture and commerce, with as much eagerneſs as they formerly contended for a rivalſhip in pomp and external magnificence. In no country is there now ſo thorough a conviction of a value of men, and of their different occupations, and how to improve them to the utmoſt advantage, as in Germany.</p>
                  <p>With reſpect to legiſlation, and the true intereſt of a country, there has been a benevolent light ſpread in moſt parts of this empire, which not only points out their deficiencies, but encourages the princes and their
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:0161700110:252"/>
ſervants to fill them up. Without doubt Germany as well as the reſt of Europe is much indebted to the king of Pruſſia, the firſt practical philoſopher in modern times, who has been ſeen on a throne. It was this prince who began the glorious revolution, which has made ſuch changes in Germany during the laſt twenty years; he taught his neighbours that the intereſts of princes and their ſubjects were the ſame; he began to take off the veil which was thrown over adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: finally, he ſubdued the tyrants among the nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and prieſts, who fattened on the ſubſtance of the citizen and peaſant. Military as his government may appear to ſuperficial obſervers, it is to that alone Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many is ſo indebted for a peace of five-and-twenty years, which ſhe had not known for many centuries be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and in the courſe of which ſhe firſt began to feel what ſhe really was.</p>
                  <p>The peculiar turn of the Germans ſeems to be phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy; they are diſtinguiſhed from all the nations of Europe for cool and juſt judgments, united with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme induſtry; they were the firſt who threw a light on mathematics and general phyſics; they next darted through theology, hiſtory, and finally legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the ſame philoſophic ſpirit. The prize of wit they will do well to leave to other nations, for which they will ever contend in vain.</p>
                  <p>If Germany could make itſelf one great people; if it was united under one governor, if the preſent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:0161700110:253"/>
of a ſingle prince were not often in oppoſition to the general welfare of the whole; if all the members of the empire were ſo well compacted into one body, that the ſuperfluous ſap of the one could circulate and invigorate all the reſt, how much greater ſteps towards cultivation might not the country then make! But Germany would then give laws to all Europe. How powerful are the two houſes of Auſtria and Branden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg, even as things now are? the greatneſs of whoſe ſtrength conſiſts in their German poſſeſſions, and yet who do not poſſeſs half or even the beſt parts of this country. Though the character of the Germans be not ſo brilliant as that of other nations, ſtill it is not deſtitute of its peculiar excellencies. The German is a man of the world. He lives under every ſky, and conquers every natural obſtacle to his happineſs. His induſtry is inexhauſtible. Poland, Hungary, Ruſſia, the Engliſh and Dutch colonies, are much indebted to German emigrants. Even the firſt ſtates in Europe owe great part of their knowledge to Germany. Rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude is alſo an almoſt univerſal characteriſtic of the people of this country; neither are the manners of the inhabitants in the leſſer cities, by any means ſo cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt as thoſe of France and other countries: it is ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this circumſtance, that the country is ſo well peopled, notwithſtanding the great emigrations. In ſhort, frugality on the part of the Proteſtants and frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs on that of the Catholics, are grand, brilliant and natural characteriſtics.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. I.</hi> Of the Country in general.</head>
                  <p>THE United Netherlands are bounded by the German ocean on the north, by Weſtphalia on the eaſt, by Auſtrian Brabant on the ſouth, and by the Engliſh channel towards the weſt. Theſe provinces are ſeven in number; Holland, Zealand, Utrecht, Guel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derland, Overyſſel, Groningen, and Friezland. The name of the Netherlands, which included the Dutch, Auſtrian, and French, in all appearance takes its riſe from the ſittuation of theſe countries, as conſidered with reſpect to Germany, and implies the Nether or Lower Germany. The whole of the Seven United Provinces includes about 625 ſquare geographical miles. The air is moiſt and unhealthy. The winter
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:0161700110:256"/>
ſets in about October, and even in the month of May there is often ſcarce any appearance of ſpring. In ſummer the heats are often more exceſſive than in the ſouth of France, or even in Italy. Sometimes the extremes of heat and cold are even felt in the ſame day.</p>
                  <p>Here are all manner of tame fowl, as in England; and of the wild ſort, the ſtork about the bigneſs of a heron is the moſt remarkable. This bird builds his neſt on the top of their chimnies in moſt of the towns and villages, and through a national ſuperſtition is never deſtroyed. They take their flight with their young ones, about the middle of Auguſt, and as is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectured retire into Africa, or ſome other warm coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and return in February. There are prodigious quantities of wild geeſe, herons, ducks, and other water-fowl, which cover the marſhes of the Low Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries every winter; they have likewiſe plenty of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridges, ſnipes, quails, pigeons, hares and rabbits, but none of thoſe wild beaſts which abound in the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man foreſt, ſuch as bears, wild boars, and wolves; foxes they have in great numbers. Their ſeas, lakes, canals, and rivers abound in fiſh of all kinds, except oyſters, of which there are very few.</p>
                  <p>The whole country is full of moraſſes, which how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever are not without their advantages, yielding good turf for fuel, and in ſome parts they are reckoned ſo
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:0161700110:257"/>
ſecure a defence for the ſtate on the ſide of Germany, that the draining of them is prohibited by law.</p>
                  <p>Theſe moraſſes however joined with the low ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the country near the ſea, occaſion fogs and frequent rains, which are more particularly brought on by the weſterly winds that prevail in theſe parts with great violence. The general diſtempers of the inhabitants are the gout and ſcurvy. Colds and rheu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiſms are alſo very common; and in the fenny parts near the ſea, where the mud during the ebb emits putrid effluvia, continual vomitings are very frequent. It is the dampneſs of the climate that accuſtoms the inhabitants to ſmoaking; for both men and women of a certain age, are ſeldom ſeen without their pipes and ſpitting pots.</p>
                  <p>The land is for the moſt part level, and in many places lyes even lower than the ſea; for which reaſon it is not only fenced againſt its inundations by dykes and dams at a prodigious expence; but likewiſe for draining the water from the fenny parts, there have been innumerable ditches cut, from which the water ſo drained is conveyed by windmills into canals, and from thence by means of ſluices into the rivers. Theſe dykes and canals give the country a very ſingular ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, and being planted with rows of trees, willow and others, interſperſed with gardens and pleaſant houſes, make it very convenient as well as delightful to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers.
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:0161700110:258"/>
The barks which are drawn by horſes, ſet out every day in ſummer at certain hours, to go from one place to another. As a great part of the country con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts of heath and ſands, it does not afford a ſufficient ſubſiſtence for the inhabitants; nor can all the induſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of agriculture draw from it as much grain as is neceſſary for home conſumption. But this again is amply compenſated by its reſources of trade and navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, which enable the Dutch not only to brew good beer, and diſtil brandy from the corn they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, but likewiſe to export great quantities afterwards of both. On the other hand, the rich meadows and paſtures make grazing very profitable, by which the inhabitants are ſupplied with milk, butter and cheeſe, and the exports of the two latter amount to very large ſums; the Texel cheeſes being famous all over the world. In Holland, too, the breeding of ſheep is very conſiderable, and admits of further improvements, as under proper regulations a million of ſheep might be fed in that province. The wool of theſe ſheep is alſo reckoned very fine. Several places likewiſe yield tobacco, and Zealand is famous for its madder. Culi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary plants theſe provinces have in abundance, and in ſome parts of them there is great plenty of fruit. The principal fuel is turf and pit-coal, the latter of which comes from England. Wood being very ſcarce and dear, there is but little of it uſed. Every piece of timber worked up in theſe countries, whether for building or for exportation, is brought from abroad.
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:0161700110:259"/>
In many places they boil ſalt from the ſea water. The country of Zutphen yields iron. In ſhort, nature affords ſo little that is valuable here, that the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants owe both the neceſſaries and comforts of life to their extenſive commerce with foreign countries.</p>
                  <p>The principal rivers are the Rhine, the Meuſe, and the Scheldt. The firſt of theſe riſes in Germany, and taking its courſe through the Duchy of Cleves, enters the Netherlands at Fort Schenk; there it divides into two branches; the moſt conſiderable of which, after paſſing by Nimeguen, runs into the Meuſe; the other branch, after again ſubdividing into ſmaller branches, loſes itſelf in the canals, and in one or two leſſer rivers.</p>
                  <p>The Maeſe forms the boundary between Geulder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land and Brabant. Oppoſite to Dort this river divides into two branches; one branch runs by Rotterdam, and the other takes a different courſe; they afterwards meet again; and this river, which is very wide at its mouth, then diſcharges itſelf in the ocean at Brill. On this river, which riſes in Burgundy, and runs through the principality of Liege, there was formerly a very conſiderable traffic; but the ſeveral ſovereigns through whoſe dominions it takes its courſe, having laid heavy tolls on all veſſels as they paſſed through their territories, this trade is now very much on the decline.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="250" facs="tcp:0161700110:260"/>The fiſhery in the ſeveral ſtreams, rivers and lakes, though very conſiderable, ſerves only for home con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption; but that of the North-Sea is very produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive; it is divided into the greater and the leſſer. By the former is to be underſtood that carried on along the coaſts, eſpecially on the Doggerſand or Doggerſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bank, between England and Jutland, on which there are caught cod, haddock, turbots, whitings, ſoles, and other ſea fiſh. The cod caught here is either carried freſh and alive to market, or elſe is ſalted up at ſea, and thus forms a branch both of foreign and domeſtic commerce. The great fiſhery is that of herrings, from which the Dutch reap immenſe profits: for if it may not as formerly be termed the golden mine of Holland, yet it ſtill yields a comfortable ſubſiſtence to at leaſt 30,000 families. The ſeaſon for catching the herrings along the coaſt of England and Scotland, is from the 24th of June to the 25th of November. The veſſels employed in this fiſhery, are called buſſes, and carry from twenty-five to thirty laſts, each laſt is 80 buſhels, which one with another ſell for about one hundred and twenty guilders. Some years back no leſs than fifteen hundred ſuch veſſels have been known to ſail from the ports of Holland; whereas at preſent the number ſeldom exceeds two hundred. Though the eſtimates of the profits ariſing from the herring-fiſhery differ, as the profits themſelves do in different years, yet it is computed in a good year, that the neat gain to the proprietors of the buſſes, amounts to two
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:0161700110:261"/>
millions of guilders, each guilder 20d. Engliſh. The ſalting and curing of herrings, which the Dutch firſt learnt about the end of the fourth century from a fiſherman of Flanders, and in which no nation has equalled them ever ſince, has made the Dutch herrings univerſally preferred before all others. Further, the whale fiſhery at Greenland, Spitzbergen, Nova Zem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bla, &amp;c. employs annually about two hundred and fifty ſail of Dutch ſhips.</p>
                  <p>The United Netherlands are well cultivated and extremely populous; they contain no leſs than 113 cities and towns, with 1400 villages, ſome of which are very conſiderable, and about two millions of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants. But the moſt populous and the beſt cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated is the province of Holland, which has not its equal in the univerſe; having ſix or more large cities within eight or ten miles of each other. The neat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the houſes, and of the canals, which are cut through the ſtreets, and planted with trees, as alſo the cleanlineſs of the ſtreets, give the towns of this province a more agreeable appearance than is uſually to be met with in other countries; and for pretty villages, no part of the globe can be put in competition with North Holland.</p>
                  <p>Theſe countries, according to ſome writers, have been moſt of them gained from the ſea. Others, on the contrary, are of opinion, that a great part of them
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:0161700110:262"/>
have been loſt by inundations, and both of them are in the right; for their ſeas and rivers appear in many places to be above the land at high-water, and kept out only by prodigious banks; and there have been inundations even in the memory of man which have laid great tracks of land under water. The tops of ſteeples or other high buildings have been ſeen upon their coaſts at low water. Sir William Temple re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks, that from the Zuiderſee never having been mentioned by any Roman writers, it is reaſonable to ſuppoſe, that it was formed by ſome great inundation of the ſea breaking in between the Texel and other iſlands; and this is the more probable, from the great ſhallowneſs of that ſea, and the flatneſs of its ſands over the whole extent of it. Other changes he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes to have happened in the face of theſe countries by the ſands which have gathered at the mouths of their great rivers above-mentioned.</p>
                  <p>Theſe ſands are ſuppoſed to have been collected from the weſterly winds, which generally blow on theſe ſhores three parts of the year, and are more violent than the eaſterly ones, which uſually bring calm weather and froſts.</p>
                  <p>The Zuiderſee is about ſeventy miles in length, and half as much in breadth, but ſo very ſhallow as has been obſerved, that a paſſage over it is more dangerous than a voyage in the Bay of Biſcay. And ſuch is the
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:0161700110:263"/>
violence and rage of the ſea when the wind blows a ſtorm at north-weſt, that if it happens to be a ſpring tide, their ſtrongeſt dykes ſometimes give way. An inundation happened in 1530, by which ſeventy-two villages were ſwallowed up, and 20,000 people de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed. The banks of theſe rivers are alſo ſometimes broken down by ſhoals of ice and land-floods. From the ſhallowneſs of the water at neap tides at the mouth of this ſea, they are obliged to unload their veſſels before they come in, and bring in their veſſels in cradles.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reiſbec</hi> obſerves, that there is no ſolid earth in any part of Holland, and that even on the borders of the Duchy of Cleves, there are evident marks of this country's having been formed like the Egyptian Delta; with this difference, that the ſoil on the banks of the Nile is more fruitful. Parts of Brabant have like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe been formed by the Scheld, Maeſe, and other rivers. At a great diſtance from the coaſt in Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, under the good earth may be ſeen dry ſand, and under this again, large layers of good earth; as if the rivers and ſea had by turns depoſited their ſand and their mud. The whole coaſt of Germany is of the ſame kind, as far as the Elbe. Throughout all this diſtrict, ſays Reiſbec, there is no ſolid ground.</p>
                  <p>The ſea forms boundaries to herſelf which ſhe never paſſes, but in caſes of extreme neceſſity. Her playful
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:0161700110:264"/>
waves have made the downs, which reach from Calais to the Texel, and protect the land which is in ſome places lower than the ſurface of the ſea; but when a north or north-weſt wind puts her into a fit of anger, ſhe overthrows in an inſtant that which with the help of the neighbouring rivers, ſhe has been building for many centuries. They tell you with a degree of confidence, that a ſhip of 200 tons burthen was blown over the bank at high water, between Calais and Gravelines, on the ſhore; the bank twenty feet higher than the ſurface of the water.</p>
                  <p>The ſea of Haerlem grows wider every day, threatens to break the dykes between Leyden and Haerlem, and make a perfect iſland of North Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. This ſea is ſixteen miles long, and nearly eight miles broad. In the laſt century, the ſea de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moliſhed a great part of the iſland in which Dordrecht is ſituated; and 60,000 people periſhed by this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident.</p>
                  <p>Dreadful as the ſea is to the main land, ſhe is ſtill a more formidable enemy to the iſlands which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute the province of Zealand; but what ſhe exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutes on the continent, by violent ſtorms, ſhe under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes here, by craft and cunning. Moſt of theſe iſlands are lower than the ſurface of the ſea; the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants have, in conſequence, attempted to ſecure themſelves, by very expenſive dykes, or banks.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="255" facs="tcp:0161700110:265"/>The ſea is perpetually undermining them, and waſhing away the earth by degrees; in many places they are already quite naked. This compels the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants to build other walls behind their dams, which, expecting the ſame fate, muſt in time leave the whole to the mercy of the enemy.</p>
                  <p>Nor are the inhabitants of the middle of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try in a better ſituation. The territories about Nime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guen and Arnheim, the moſt beautiful and moſt fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in all Holland, will in time be ſubdued by the Rhine. In many diſtricts about Betuve, the ſand is already ſo high, that at every ſwell the river is driven violently to the oppoſite ſhore; this will repeatedly happen, till it has finally broke itſelf a new bed, and covered with water all that is now ploughed land, or the ſite of villages and hamlets. The many canals which have been made to receive part of the waters of theſe rivers, are by no means ſufficient to break their force.</p>
                  <p>Theſe canals, and the continual digging of turf, entirely diveſt this country of all ſecurity. In the direct line between Rotterdam and Amſterdam, there is dyke upon dyke; all theſe hollows have been occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by digging away the turf; moſt of them are ſo deep that it is impoſſible to draw the waters from them into the canals, which are on a level with the ſurface of the ſea. What a ruin muſt then take place,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:0161700110:266"/>
if once the waters of the neighbouring rivers break in upon them, or endeavour to open a way through them!</p>
                  <p>In ſhort, no Dutchman can promiſe his children a durable habitation, except the inhabitants of Guel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derland, which is nothing but ſand; and thoſe of Overyſſel and Drenthe—countries which are almoſt nothing but moraſſes and heaths, and the habitations of fevers, colds, and catarrhs.</p>
                  <p>Though this country is ſo famous for its trade, and its multitude of ſhipping, yet there is ſcarce a good harbour on the coaſt. The beſt are, Fluſhing, Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veotſluys, and Rotterdam. As for Amſterdam, there cannot be, any where, a more incommodious haven; being ſeated in ſo ſhallow a water that very few ſhips can get into it, except at high tide.</p>
                  <p>Every one knows that huſbandry is not the great national object in Holland, but trade and manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures. Their territory is ſmall in compariſon with their population; ſo that an application to trade is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to the exiſtence of the inhabitants. The quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of land fit for tillage, was originally under ſuch peculiar circumſtances, that the wealth which flowed in from trade and manufactures, could alone render the practice of any huſbandry advantageous. The ſoil is of two ſorts, very good or very bad; and ſo
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:0161700110:267"/>
unhappily ſituated are the Dutch, that the former is only to be preſerved by thoſe vaſt monuments of their induſtry—the banks, which preſerve all the lower and beſt lands from being overflowed; for the higher tracks of Friezland, Guelderland, &amp;c. contain in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, a very great proportion of waſte, and poor, ſandy ſoil. This proportion is greater than is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly imagined, and was ſo when the republic was undoubtedly in a more flouriſhing ſituation than at preſent. <hi>Davenant</hi> tells us, that in 1688, they had eight millions of Engliſh acres, which let, with houſes and tenements, at four millions ſterling. Now, this being only ten ſhillings an acre, in a country very full of cities, muſt very much reduce that ten ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings per acre, probably to ſix ſhillings; which ſhews that this country of immenſe wealth and trade, though they ſecured the ſoil by banks, yet did but little in raiſing the value of land. Graſs lands, indeed, let here at very high prices.</p>
                  <p>Whatever receives moſt encouragement from the ſtate, is ſure moſt to proſper trade being the great object in Holland; manufactures are very much at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to, theſe have conſequently proſpered; but as to agriculture, and the landed intereſt, they make it totally ſubſervient to every other; for the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of corn, and other proviſions, is ruinous to the farmer, but is not regarded here, becauſe it is an object of commerce.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="258" facs="tcp:0161700110:268"/>This conduct, however, is ſuitable to the ſituation and intereſts of the republic. Nature, and a fortune almoſt as ragged, has crammed them into a neglected marſh, which nothing but an induſtry like theirs, could have made the habitation of an independent nation. In ſuch a ſtate, trade, navigation, fiſheries, and manufactures, were their principal ſupport, in their firſt naval expeditions againſt the Spaniards; theſe, therefore, they wiſely engaged in, with their utmoſt ardour: But as to agriculture, of what benefit could it be to a nation, that had not land enough to render themſelves independent by it?</p>
                  <p>Neceſſity drove the Hollanders to trade; but, had a genius more extenſive than that of <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> or of <hi>Monteſquieu,</hi> dictated to them a choice, it would have been what neceſſity compelled. Induſtry will ever make the greateſt figure in thoſe ſpots that deny every thing to idleneſs; a numerous people, in ſuch ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, muſt either be induſtrious or ſtarve.</p>
                  <p>The great ſucceſs of the Dutch in trade, has made other nations ambitious to imitate them; but in this there appears too great a neglect of thoſe eſſential diſtinctions, which are often found between different countries. France, England, Sweden, and Ruſſia, have very conſiderable territories, conſequently they ought to pay a much greater attention to agriculture than this republic, whoſe land is contemptible, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared

with theirs; but all theſe powers, particularly France and England, have ſacrificed agriculture to their commerce. This has been very bad policy; for that conduct which may be very beneficial for a territory of eight millions of acres, may be highly improper for one of twelve times the number.</p>
                  <p>In the agriculture of Holland, the richneſs of their paſtures is to be noticed, and the great attention they pay to the management of their cattle. They are very fond of the culture of tobacco, and of madder; of madder, in particular, they raiſe enough not only for their own conſumption, which in their linen and cotton manufactures is very great, but alſo for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP II.</hi> Of the Province of Holland.</head>
                  <p>WE will now ſpeak of the ſeveral provinces. The province of Holland, the moſt conſiderable of the ſeven provinces, and in many reſpects equal to the other ſix, is bounded by the Zuider ſea on the north; by Utrecht on the eaſt; by Brabant on the ſouth; and by the Britiſh ocean on the weſt; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending about eighty miles in length; in ſome places forty in breadth, and in others not above twenty. It contains an area of about 400,000 acres. This
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:0161700110:271"/>
province is uſually divided into North and South Holland. South Holland contains all that country between Zealand and Brabant, and that arm of the ſea, which uſually goes by the name of the river Y, And North Holland reaches from this river to the ocean.</p>
                  <p>It lyes, in general, very low, and, in ſome parts, even lower than the ſea, from which it is ſecured by dykes, and interſected by innumerable ditches and canals, through which, at the time of the ebb, the water is carried off. On the coaſts of the north ſeas, the ſand-hills ſupply the place of dykes. The air is foggy and unwholeſome. The greateſt part of the province conſiſts of fine paſture lands. The principal occupation of the country people is making butter and cheeſe, and they accordingly keep a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of milch cows. This province ſtands in need of all the art in the world, to embelliſh and make it ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitable. The air, in winter, is almoſt one continued fog; nothing is to be heard on the plains but the cries of ſea gulls, plovers, ſwallows, crows, ducks, geeſe and ſwans. Thoſe birds, which take refuge in the woods, are ſeldom known here. Of all the provinces, none is ſo much expoſed to the fury of the ocean; and the inundations which happen from time to time are ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible. The firſt which hiſtory mentions, formed the gulph called the Zuider ſea. Before that time, Friez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land was ſeparated only by a ſmall lake.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="261" facs="tcp:0161700110:272"/>In ſeveral parts of the country, the rivers which run through this country, are joined by navigable canals, which open a cheap communication between the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral towns and villages of this populous province; as, by means of the trechſcuyts, a paſſenger goes from place to place on theſe canals, at fixed hours, and at very cheap rates. Goods are likewiſe ſent by the ſame conveyance, which is an unſpeakable convenience to the inland trade.</p>
                  <p>This province abounds in the nobleſt improvements, and is populous beyond compariſon with any of the other provinces; containing 37 towns, eight boroughs, and 400 villages; and the number of its inhabitants, on a careful eſtimate, is computed at above a million of inhabitants, which is one half of the population of the whole country. The houſes in the towns are moſtly built of bricks; and for cleanlineſs in them, no country in the world comes up to Holland: in North Holland, in particular, neatneſs and ornament are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to an aſtoniſhing pitch. In that province there are villages in which the rooms and furniture of the houſes are clean and bright beyond imagination: the houſes themſelves, as alſo the floors, and every wooden utenſil, both within and without, even to the very gates near the roads, and the poſts in the paſtures, againſt which the cows rub themſelves, as alſo the trunks of the trees, being painted over. The chimnies likewiſe, with the cow-ſtalls, both on the floor and on the ſides,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:0161700110:273"/>
are kept in the greateſt neatneſs. In theſe elegant cow-ſtalls, families themſelves reſide, in order to ſpare their dining rooms. The ſtreets, too, are paved with brick, and very carefully waſhed and ſtrewed with a fine, white ſand.</p>
                  <p>It is in this province, more than in any other, that the diverſion of ſkaiting is followed, from the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of canals which interſect it. The Dutch, who in other reſpects are an indolent ſet of people, are paſſionately fond of this exerciſe, and are the beſt ſkaiters in Europe. Some of them will ſkait fifteen miles in an hour. The ladies are drawn along in <hi>traineaux,</hi> a gentleman ſitting behind them, and guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the horſe. There is no year, however, in which ſome accident does not happen from theſe aquatic amuſements.</p>
                  <p>The Dutch have carried their ingenuity ſo far as to contrive boats with ſails, fixed on ſkaits or ſledges, to glide along on the ice: but theſe carriages are more for curioſity than real uſe, as being by no means ſafe. They move after the rate of fifteen leagues an hour; and, without reckoning up the other inconveniencies to their being put in practice, the reſiſtance of the air alone would be ſufficient to take any one's breath away, in travelling with ſuch expedition. It is aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that people have gone in this manner from Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam to Sardam in ſeven minutes—a diſtance of ſeven miles.</p>

                     <pb n="263" facs="tcp:0161700110:275"/>The principal cities of the province of Holland are Amſterdam, Rotterdam, Leyden, Haerlem, Delft, Dort, and the Hague; of theſe we ſhall ſpeak in their turns.</p>
                  <p>Amſterdam is the capital of this province, and of the United Netherlands. It is ſituated on the little river Amſtel, which runs through the city, and falls into that arm of the ſea called the Y, that lies on the north ſide of the town, and which forms a large har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. Amſterdam is the greateſt trading city of Europe, and though, by reaſon of the ſhallowneſs of the paſſage which leads up to it, from the Zuider ſea, it might be thought but badly ſituated for a ſea-port, as ſhips of burthen muſt be lightened to paſs through it, and afterwards wait for an eaſterly or north-weſt wind to go into the north ſea; yet it is advantageous in this reſpect, that goods can be eaſily carried backwards and forwards from all the other towns of this province, and with a fair wind it is but a few hours paſſage to or from all the ports of North-Holland, Frieſland, Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yſſel and Guelderland.</p>
                  <p>The ground is naturally marſhy, conſequently the buildings at Amſterdam are founded on oaken piles, which made the facetious <hi>Eraſmus</hi> ſay, that in his country vaſt multitudes of people lived on the tops of trees. The middle of the town is interſected by a great number of navigable canals, which, while they conduce to the pleaſantneſs and cleanlineſs of the place,
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:0161700110:276"/>
are at the ſame time a great convenience to trade; but in hot weather they emit foetid effluviae, which would be ſtill worſe, were not the water kept continually in motion by two large water-mills and a horſe-mill. In dark evenings, theſe canals uſed to coſt many people their lives, till theſe dangers were happily remedied by illuminating the ſtreets and ſides of the canals: compared however with the ſtreets of London, they are at preſent but miſerably lighted up. Theſe canals divide the town into a multitude of iſlands, which are joined with each other by means of ſtone and wooden bridges. This town itſelf forms a ſemicircle on the Y, being fortified on the land-ſide with ramparts and regular baſtions. This ſide of the town may likewiſe be laid under water. On this river is a moſt delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful walk commanding a fine proſpect.</p>
                  <p>Amſterdam, ſays <hi>Marſhall,</hi> appears to no great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to a ſtranger on his firſt coming to it, except he enters the city through the Heeregraft, or the Key<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſergraft ſtreets: that of Haerlem is very long, but the ſluices in the canal hurt the effect of it; the two for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer have alſo canals in the middle of them, and are very noble ſtreets; but like moſt in Holland are planted with trees. Some of the canals are very broad, and make a fine appearance; but the houſes in general are not erected in a grand ſtile; on the contrary, very many of them diſgrace the areas before them. This, though an evil, is an evil to be found in
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:0161700110:277"/>
all the cities of Europe, and eſpecially in London. In ſquares this great city appears to be very deficient; they are few in number, and have nothing in them ſtriking: that called the Dam is the principal, but it is very irregular. The houſes, like all thoſe in Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, are in the old Gothic ſtile, with pediment roofs, and being generally out of the perpendicular, are prevented from falling by iron cramps in the form of the capital S. To a paſſenger in the ſtreet, by hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over on both ſides, they ſeem to threaten his life.</p>
                  <p>Though Amſterdam cannot boaſt many fine ſquares, like ſeveral other capital cities, yet it contains ſome public buildings, that ſtrike the ſpectator with aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at their magnificence.</p>
                  <p>The building which is incomparably beyond all others, is the ſtadthouſe: the dimenſions of the front, as given by ſeveral authors, is 282 feet, the depth 232, and the height 116 feet, beſides a ſmall cupola. It was begun in 1648. It is built upon wooden piles like maſts of ſhips, rammed down as thick as they can ſtand. There are no leſs than 14,000 of them, which are ſaid to have coſt 100,000l.; there being a great quantity of iron-work employed in the foundation, to keep the piles together. The ſuperſtructure is ſaid to have coſt twice as much. The expence of this edifice, however, has been variouſly computed, with ſuch an amazing difference, as from 300,000l. to 3,000,000l.;
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:0161700110:278"/>
the latter muſt certainly be computed according to the different value of money then and now; but even ſo, it muſt very much exceed the truth: the former is, in all probability, much nearer the reality. The front of this building has nothing of taſte or elegance; it is a heavy pile, which ſtrikes the ſpectator with that idea which is raiſed by the grandeur of its magnitude. The inſide is finiſhed in a very noble ſtyle, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the purpoſe to which it is applied; ſuch as, a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, a bank, the ſeat of the courts of juſtice, the ſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions-rooms, guard-rooms, &amp;c. The three ſtatues of braſs, repreſenting Juſtice, Fortitude and Plenty, at the entrance, and the woman in marble, <hi>in relievo,</hi> ſupporting the city arms, are moſt exquiſite pieces: the tower above, with the clock and its admirable chimes; the Atlas, with the globe on his ſhoulders, as alſo all the other beauties and ornaments of ſculpture and painting, are ſcarce to be equalled in Europe. The floors, walls, and pillars are, in general, of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and the roofs finely carved, painted, and gilt; and many of the apartments are adorned with very fine paintings, by the beſt Flemiſh maſters. In the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond ſtory is a great magazine of arms; and over that, great reſervoirs of water, with tubes to conduct it into every apartment; and another precaution, which has been taken againſt fire, is, lining the chimnies with copper. The top of the cupola gives a view of the city, and neighbouring country, in great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, commanding the whole circumference; which,
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:0161700110:279"/>
with the canals, and the immenſe number of ſhips continually going in and coming out of the harbour, altogether form a very noble proſpect.</p>
                  <p>The entrance to this building is through ſeven ſmall doors, but the want of a large door ſuitable to the grandeur of the building, is a deſigned omiſſion; the ſeven doors in number and uniformity, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting the ſeven United Provinces.</p>
                  <p>The bank of Amſterdam, which is the lower apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is famous all over the world. The great trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure ſaid to be locked up in the vaults of this houſe, are the ſums received in purchaſe, not of bank ſtock, but of bank-transfer. This is not like that of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, a bank that circulates notes in return for caſh; on the contrary, it is a bank of depoſit; whoever pays money here has it entered in the bank-books, but can never again demand it. When he wants to raiſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, he offers his bank credit for ſale, which is tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred in a moment, and any ſums of money may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be raiſed upon it.</p>
                  <p>The treaſure in the bank in Amſterdam is an intire ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret to all but thoſe who have the management of it; the value has been computed, or rather gueſſed at; and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be from 20 to 40 millions ſterling; but to name any particular ſum muſt at the beſt be but gueſſing at random. It is however a very aſtoniſhing ſyſtem of
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:0161700110:280"/>
accumulation; for it is a well-known fact, that money once paid into the bank-books can never be demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and further, that money is perpetualy paid in. Here, therefore, there ſeems to be a conſtant ingreſs, but no egreſs; conſequently a treaſure which ſeems perpetually increaſing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Marſhal</hi> ſays, that though by the regulations of the bank, no money can be paid to any perſon that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands it, in conſequence of his credit on the bank; yet it is certain the bank lends both money and credit to the brokers, who make it their buſineſs to buy bank credit, and give caſh for it. Theſe people attend every morning between eleven and twelve, before the Stadthouſe, either to buy or ſell bank-credit, as occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion may offer.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hanway,</hi> who gives the beſt account of this bank, does it in the following words: As the bank of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam receives only the beſt and pureſt coin, or bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, the bank-money bears a commiſſion of 4 or 5 per cent. If a perſon is deſirous to raeliſe his bank-credit, he diſpoſes of it with greater facility than we ſell bank-ſtock. Here they make payments after the manner of the bank of Venice, viz. by transferring in the books of the bank, from the credit of one to the credit of another: theſe transfers are made by the perſonal appearance of the transferror, by his order, for which there are printed forms; or by virtue of
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:0161700110:281"/>
his power of attorney. Though no money can be claimed again, when once paid into the bank, yet in caſes of depoſits, the ſame identical gold and ſilver may be reclaimed by him who delivered it in; for which purpoſe he has a permit renewable every ſix months, otherwiſe to become invalid. In which lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter caſe, the caſh ſo delivered, is blended with the common ſtock, and transferable only in the manner already mentioned. Though this bank pays no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, yet it receives intereſt for the ſame loan, to the Eaſt and Weſt-India Companies; the large ſums of money lent to the Dutch Government, are entirely independent of this bank; the revenues of each re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective province being engaged as a ſecurity for ſuch ſum.</p>
                  <p>The great hall is a noble room indeed, adorned on all ſides with the fineſt marble pillars of the Corinthian order; but the floor of marble is the moſt ſurprizing of all, which is ſo laid as to repreſent without the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of any other lines than the veins of the marble, both the celeſtial and the terreſtrial globes. Each of theſe marble maps, as they are ſtyled, being twenty-two feet in diameter.</p>
                  <p>Below ſtairs are the priſons both for debtors and criminals, with a guard-chamber, where the keys of the city are locked up every night. The ſovereign power of this city is lodged in 36 ſenators, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:0161700110:282"/>
members for life; and when any of them die, the remaining ſenators elect others in their room, the people having no ſhare in the nomination or choice: the ſenate likewiſe elect the deputies to be ſent to the ſtates of Holland, and appoints the chief magiſtrates of the city, who are ſaid to reſemble the Lord Mayor and Aldermen of London. The Burgomaſters are four in number, three of which are choſen annually.</p>
                  <p>The police of this city ſeems worthy of imitation. Notwithſtanding its being the firſt trading city in the world, and a conflux of all ſorts of people, it ſeldom happens that there are above one or two executions here in the courſe of the year. What is more ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, no perſon can be put to death without previouſly ſigning his own condemnation, acknowledging his guilt and the juſtice of his ſentence, which is done with great form and ceremony, in a room of the Stadt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, expoſed to the open air at two different times. The number of debtors too is very inconſiderable; every creditor here, as in moſt parts of the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, is obliged to allow a maintenance to the perſon he impriſons, proportionate to his ſtation in life.</p>
                  <p>The exchange is a large building, and well adapted to the purpoſe, but it is unornamented, and not equal in architecture to that of London; the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance of numbering the pillars, in order to find
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:0161700110:283"/>
a merchant the more readily, is very convenient. It was very imprudently built on a canal; this circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance ſet ſome wicked perſons about ſixty or ſeventy years ſince, to endeavour to blow it up, while the merchants were aſſembled; for this purpoſe they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured a large quantity of powder and other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſtibles, which they placed under the bridge that goes over it; a child however blew out the match which prevented the fatal effects that would otherwiſe have enſued. As an acknowledgement for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of ſuch a number of the inhabitants, all the children in Amſterdam have the privilege of coming and playing in the exchange the firſt three days of the fair in the afternoon, and of making as much noiſe as they pleaſe.</p>
                  <p>The admiralty, ſays <hi>Marſhal,</hi> is the next public edifice that demands attention; the ſize of it, with its environs, is very conſiderable. It conſiſts of three ſides of a ſquare; the front being 220 feet long, and the wings the ſame; in the midſt is the yard for building. The arms and ſtores belonging to the ſhips are kept here in very great order. The ground-floor is filled with cannon balls; and the ſecond contains the arms and cordage; the third their ſails, public flags, &amp;c. Beſides theſe, here are many other curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſities of the naval kind, which are worth viewing. The dock is 508 feet long; and contiguous to it, are the houſes for lodging the carpenters, &amp;c. The or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:0161700110:284"/>
in which every thing is kept cannot fail of ſtrik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every one. This building with its contents has been lately deſtroyed by fire.</p>
                  <p>The Eaſt-India houſe and Arſenal are great build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, which much deſerve viewing. In the former, the company hold their meetings, and have very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable magazines of all ſorts of India goods. The arſenal is 2,000 feet ſquare every way; it contains docks for building the ſhips, and warehouſes and ſtores for completely rigging them, all in excellent order. They have magazines of all ſorts of naval ſtores; in one they have many pieces of heavy artillery, and in another more than 600 large anchors ready for uſe. The two rope-walks are 18,000 feet long.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are the principal public buildings in this city; but there are others which will attract the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of travellers; ſuch as, the works going forward in the harbours, the ſluices, the baſtions, with each a windmill, the bridges, &amp;c. As to hoſpitals, there are a great number of them, but the architecture of the edifices is nothing; it is however highly worthy of obſervation, that all the poor of Amſterdam, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed of all the provinces, are maintained by charity, there being no poor-tax in any country in Europe, except England; the ſame fund ſupports all the hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitals, in which there are above twenty thouſand people.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="273" facs="tcp:0161700110:285"/>At all the public inns and taverns, and at thoſe houſes in which any public buſineſs is tranſacted, there are poor-boxes, into which, it is uſual to put contributions from all ſales, auctions, &amp;c. Certain perſons are alſo appointed to go and collect alms from time to time, and at all the public feſtivals, which are applied to the ſame uſe: the theatres, and places of amuſement of every kind, pay a third or a half of their gains for the like purpoſe; and if this is not ſufficient, government makes good the remainder. Every perſon entering the gates of Amſterdam, after dark, pays a penny to the poor; but after a certain hour of the night, (eleven or twelve,) none can enter the city till the next morning.</p>
                  <p>In all the towns of Holland, they take excellent precaution to force the idle to work. They have a houſe of correction, called a raſp-houſe, in which they ſhut up the idle poor and vagrants, that can work and maintain themſelves, but will not. The employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they give them is to ſaw and raſp Brazil wood; in which if they are not expeditious, they are ſeverely beaten; and for thoſe who are lazy, they have an admirable contrivance, which is a cellar with a pump, into which they let water, ſo proportioned to the ſtrength of the perſon, that he ſhall be able, with infinite labour in pumping it out, to ſave himſelf from being drowned; which fate thoſe who are put there are, by law, doomed to ſuffer, if they
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:0161700110:286"/>
do not eſcape it by hard working; and for ſuch as are incorrigibly idle, this labour is admirably adapted. In theſe priſons they alſo put young men whoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchery or extravagance threatens the ruin of their health and fortune; and this is done at any time on the requeſt of their parents or guardians: women are likewiſe ſometimes permitted to confine their huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands in theſe priſons, on a complaint of their being extravagant. It does not however appear that this is effected by virtue of any written law, but through cuſtom and ancient uſage.</p>
                  <p>It is obſerved of the hoſpitals in this country, as well as of thoſe in England, that they reſemble the palaces of princes more than the habitations of poor people. There are houſes alſo where a perſon may have his diet and lodging as long as he lives, on the payment of a ſmall ſum of money in advance.</p>
                  <p>As to churches, the only one worthy of being men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned is the new one, dedicated to St. Catharine; the ornamental parts of which are finiſhed in a moſt capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal manner. The pulpit is carved in the richeſt ſtyle; the chancel is parted off by a railing of Corinthian braſs; the windows are likewiſe finely painted, and the organ is the beſt in the low countries, except that at Haerlem; and they ſay at Amſterdam, the beſt in the whole world: it has a row of pipes, deſigned to counterfeit a chorus of voices, which it performs very
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:0161700110:287"/>
badly; there are fifty-two whole ſtops beſides the half ones, with two rows of keys for the feet, and three for the hands. Here is to be ſeen a moſt magnificent tomb of the brave Admiral <hi>de Ruyter;</hi> his effigy lying at large, with all ſorts of trophies in marble, ſculpture and relievo, with large inſcriptions. In one of the aiſles of this church is another ſumptuous monument, erected to the memory of <hi>John Van Galen,</hi> another of their admirals, with a very fine inſcription.</p>
                  <p>This church, however, is not yet finiſhed, though it has been begun more than an hundred years ago; the ſteeple was deſigned to have been much higher: more than 6,000 piles have already been driven into the ground in an area of one hundred feet ſquare, as a foundation for it; but ſtill they thought the bog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gineſs of the ground not ſufficiently remedied for ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting ſo great a weight, as this ſteeple would be, if it were finiſhed.</p>
                  <p>The number of churches, of the eſtabliſhed religion in this great city, does not exceed thirteen; but ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of them have two galleries one over the other, and contain a prodigious number of people. There are, however, upwards of fourſcore Roman-catholic cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels, beſides a great number of others, belonging to different ſects of the proteſtants: none of theſe, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, are permitted to marry, according to their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective rites, without the marriages being firſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnized
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:0161700110:288"/>
before a magiſtrate; nor any perſons admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to offices in the ſtate, but thoſe of the preſbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian or eſtabliſhed religion.</p>
                  <p>It is obſerved, that the Jews of Amſterdam live in more ſplendour than in any part of the world. They reſide in a peculiar quarter of the city, reſembling a little town, and have two ſynagogues; one not inferior to the beſt church in London, and the other though not near ſo ſumptuous, exceeds any they have at Rome or Venice; beſides which, they have ſchools in which they educate their youth in their own religion and language. I went once, ſays ſome writer, into their ſynagogue, where were about 2,000 men and boys with white ſilk hoods over their ſhoulders, liſtening to two others, who had but little reſemblance to prieſts, and who were explaining the laws at the lower end of the church: at every period they were repeating their great Ala, or Allalujah, to which the reſt did not ſeem very attentive.</p>
                  <p>The manufactures carried on in this city, are more numerous and conſiderable than at any other place in the ſeven provinces; they weave all ſorts of cloths, woollens, ſtuffs, and ſilk, gold and ſilver ſilks, ribbons, tapeſtry, linen in large quantities, &amp;c. All ſorts of fabrics in leather, with many in ivory and metals, are likewiſe carried on here: they have alſo a great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of mills for ſawing, poliſhing, &amp;c. Their ſail-cloth
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:0161700110:289"/>
and paper-manufactories are likewiſe very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable; and the printing of books ſhould not be forgotten; they print in all languages. Here are great numbers of bookſellers, who it is thought employ twice the quantity of preſſes that work at London: theſe books are exported to England, and ſome to the ſouthern parts of Europe; but vaſt numbers to all parts of Germany, Denmark and the North.</p>
                  <p>Amſterdam can boaſt of no great antiquity; it owes its origin to a few fiſhing villages, and was firſt wall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in about 1482. Its preſent number of inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants is computed by <hi>Marſhal</hi> at 300,000. <hi>Buſching</hi> makes the number only 200,000. The foreigners re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorting hither from time to time likewiſe form a very conſiderable number.</p>
                  <p>The air of this city, ſays <hi>Marſhal,</hi> is ſo bad and foggy, that I can hardly believe the aſſertion of thoſe who affirm it to be healthy. It is ſurrounded entirely by the ſea and by marſhes; the canals are very nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous, and not always free from noxious exhala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. The cleanlineſs, indeed, of the inhabitants is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to as great a height as poſſible, but this by no means remedies the evil; for that eternal waſhing muſt add to the damps, which are otherwiſe ſo unwholeſome in this country. The beſt part of their cleanlineſs, is that exerted in keeping their canals clean; but I muſt
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:0161700110:290"/>
remark, ſays he, I ſaw no ſmall neglect of this moſt eſſential object.</p>
                  <p>The moſt uſeful of the four elements, water, with which the Dutch are ſurrounded, is not to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured here fit for drinking, without great difficulty. What is generally uſed for this purpoſe, is that which is had from the clouds; they have likewiſe water which they procure from a ſmall river, the Vecht, ſome miles diſtant; but even this is not very good.</p>
                  <p>The Dutch were formerly very attentive to have all their carriages placed on ſledges, and drawn only by one horſe; this was certainly a wiſe precau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, conſidering that the whole city is on a founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion purely artificial, on piles; but this regulation is now but little attended to; for there are at preſent a great number of coaches on wheels: it is true they pay a very conſiderable tax, which, as the number of carriages increaſed, has already been raiſed once or twice, and amounts now to about ſeven pounds a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>year, but ſtill as luxury increaſes, coaches on wheels increaſe; and the higher they are taxed, ſome ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble people are of opinion, the more they would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe.</p>
                  <p>With reſpect to the ſledges, as it may be eaſily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, if the body of a coach was conveyed through the ſtreets of London on a ſledge, that the leaſt irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:0161700110:291"/>
in the ſurface of the pavement, would render it liable to be overſet. It will not appear ſurpriſing that the man who guides the horſe, ſhould walk by the ſide of the vehicle, to prevent any ſuch accident: and if, from the pavement not being level, the carriage ſhould incline towards him, he keeps it up with his ſhoulders; if, on the other hand, it inclines the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſide, there is a rope faſtened to the edge of the top of the coach, which he pulls towards him with all his might, to prevent the carriage from overſetting on the other ſide. This carriage is drawn with ropes by one horſe; the driver has a bucket of water faſtened to the ſledge, and a mop with which he is continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wetting it; but as, <hi>Marſhal</hi> obſerves, theſe car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages are getting very much into diſuſe. They are however, the only public vehicles to be met with in that city, which are to be hired by the hour. It may be ſuppoſed the prices of ſuch carriages cannot be very extravagant. There are carriages on wheels to be hired, but their prices are extravagant; and the permiſſion of the burgomaſters muſt be previouſly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</p>
                  <p>The government of this city is veſted in about nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty perſons, who are elected from amongſt the burghers. Of theſe, thirty-ſix compoſe the council, who repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the whole body of the people, and are inveſted with ſupreme power.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="280" facs="tcp:0161700110:292"/>Reſpecting trade, this is the grand emporium, not only of the United Provinces, but the centre of all the commerce of Europe. For a general correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, it much exceeds London; but the groſs amount of the trade of London, far exceeds that of Amſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam. Two thouſand ſail of ſhips annually enter this port, which muſt form a vaſt commerce; the different branches of which ſhall be treated of hereafter.</p>
                  <p>There are ſome very good collections of natural hiſtory, drawings, paintings, and medals, in this city; which thoſe who are <hi>amateurs</hi> generally go to view, and which the poſſeſſors are always prepared to ſhew. There is, in particular, a very fine collection of pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, by the celebrated Mr. <hi>Hope,</hi> of Amſterdam, which all ſtrangers of any rank never fail of going to ſee; this gentleman is of Scotch extraction, a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendant of the <hi>Hopeton</hi> family, and ſuppoſed to be one of the richeſt and moſt extenſive merchants in the whole world. The compliment paid to him on the change at Amſterdam, is ſo great, that it is never ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to begin till he comes.</p>
                  <p>The price of living in Amſterdam, for a ſtranger at a middling <hi>aubérge,</hi> is nearly as follows: a florin or guilder a day, that is 20d. for the chamber; breakfaſt with tea as in England, coſts ten ſtivers or ten-pence; the dinner, with a pint of wine, thirty ſtivers or half a crown; ſupper the ſame.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="281" facs="tcp:0161700110:293"/>The beds conſiſt of four or five mattreſſes, with a very broad down-bolſter, inſtead of pillow, generally fitted into the ſide of a room, like the cabin-bed of a ſhip, with a rope hanging down from the top to catch hold of, in order to lift one's ſelf up, when we wiſh to riſe. Comfort and convenience ſeem here to be ſtudied; but on account of a number of the mattreſſes, they are four or five feet high from the floor; and a young couple, on their wedding night, unleſs their blood is truly Dutch, would run the hazard of breaking their necks; in truth, they are fit only for the moſt ſober ſleepers. Some have ſide-boards to prevent the cloaths falling off, and the ſleeper falling out.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Marſhal</hi> gives a very different account of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences incident to a ſtranger at Amſterdam for his diet and lodging; but then it ſhould be recollected that he was an Engliſhman, and the writer from whom the above extract was made, a Frenchman. I was very fortunate in my quarters at Amſterdam, ſays <hi>Marſhal,</hi> being recommended to a private family in trade, for lodgings. I dined for ſome days either at an ordinary, where I paid to the amount of ten ſhillings for my dinner, or at ſome merchants houſes to whom I was recommended: but afterwards I boarded with the family, who lived much better than I ſhould have ſuppoſed any people would do, who let lodgings. Their dinners were excellent, and dreſſed in the French ſtyle: but I paid, ſays he, twenty florins a-week for my
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:0161700110:294"/>
lodgings, and ſeventeen more for my board, ſervant included. This would be thought very dear in Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, he adds; but owing to the difference of cuſtom in the two cities, board and handſome lodgings is not to be had in Amſterdam for any price.</p>
                  <p>Coffee-houſes are to be met with in this city, the ſame as in London; but their internal appearance is very ſhabby. Different foreign papers are to be met with in them, but not upon that extenſive ſcale as in London. In moſt of them ſmoaking is permitted, which renders the ſmell of them at all times rather of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive; they are much frequented by the middling claſs of Germans, and Frenchmen, who are everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly diſcuſſing the politics of Europe, with a ſelf-ſufficiency and volubility of ſpeech, that is almoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible.</p>
                  <p>The ſpill-houſes muſt not be omitted, which are a very ſingular eſtabliſhment of the kind, and not to be met with in any other town in Europe. Theſe are public-houſes licenſed by the ſtate, for the reception of girls of the town: both the girls who enter theſe houſes, and the perſons who are the owners, pay a tax to the ſtate. To theſe places people of character re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort openly, without fear or ſhame. There is as little ſcandal in being ſeen in one of them, as being ſeen at a play-houſe, or any other place of amuſement; the entertainments of theſe houſes are muſic and dancing:
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:0161700110:295"/>
the nymphs of this place, who are not engaged in dancing with their paramours, are ſeated round the room; and every ſtranger goes and talks to them if they are not previouſly engaged, as long as be thinks proper; and generally offers them wine and other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhments, as he would to perſons he mixed with at an aſſembly. They dance minuets and mattelots; and every man who takes out a girl to dance, pays ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence to the muſic. If any one chuſes to retire with them, there are ſmall rooms adjoining, furniſhed with a bed and other conveniences; and if a man with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draws with his miſtreſs, he returns with her into the room; and no more notice is taken of him, than if he had only gone out to ſpeak to a friend. Though the eſtabliſhment of theſe houſes was well meant, they are ſeldom frequented but by ſailors and the lower claſs of men and women; the girls are generally dirty, painted and patched. The States are of opinion, that if they did not indulge the people in this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, they ſhould never be able to keep their wives and daughters chaſte; and therefore of two evils they chuſe the leaſt.</p>
                  <p>The houſes in general are old faſhioned, and built, as we have obſerved, with pediment tops; and thoſe ſtreets through which there is no canal, are narrow. One very ſingular circumſtance has been remarked by travellers in theſe narrow ſtreets, that moſt of the houſes ſtand out of the perpendicular, and incline for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward;
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:0161700110:296"/>
and this happens not only with many of the houſes, but even with the churches; ſeveral of the ſteeples of which may be obſerved far from upright. There are people in Holland who will engage under a heavy penalty, on being well compenſated, to ſet the ſteeples as erect, as when they were firſt built. The method they take is very ſimple; it is merely to dig un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the foundation of the oppoſite ſide of the building, which never fails to reſtore it to its perpendicular.</p>
                  <p>From Amſterdam to Utrecht is a fine broad canal; and for the diſtance of 12 miles from the former city, the banks are covered with country-houſes, where the merchants of Amſterdam regale themſelves every Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day. Each houſe has a ſummer-houſe built on the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, that will hold ten or a dozen people; and in fine weather, they are generally full of people ſmoaking and drinking: each perſon diſtinguiſhes his country-ſeat by ſome motto either in Latin or Dutch, alluſive to the happineſs of a retired life, painted on the outer gate. Their gardens are pretty, but in the old taſte; parterres of flowers, long narrow alleys, ſome covered with vines, &amp;c. with ſtatues at the end. Their houſes are covered with fruit-trees; but from a care not to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure the building, a wooden frame is fixed againſt the houſe, and the trees nailed againſt ſuch frames. There being no gravel in the country, their walks are merely earth, kept free from weeds. Moſt of the houſes are painted white, and window-frames and doors green;

and this contraſt is pictureſque and pleaſing. They are generally built cloſe on the bank, a ſandy road only paſſing between the river and the canal.</p>
                  <p>Rotterdam next to Amſterdam, is the moſt conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able town in Holland for largeneſs, beauty of its buildings, trade, and riches; it is ſituated at the conflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the rivers Rotter and Maeſe. It has its name from the former of theſe rivers which runs into it on the north-weſt ſide, and dam, ſignifying in Dutch, a fence againſt the waters. This city, ſays <hi>Marſhal,</hi> is ſecond to Amſterdam alone, and comes nearer to that famous emporium of trade, than any port in England does to London. The Maeſe here is a very noble river, and canals are cut from it through every part of the city, which are ſo deep and broad, that ſhips of above 300 tons, load and unload directly into the quays and warehouſes on the banks, as ſmaller veſſels do at Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam. The ſides of many of the canals are plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with tall trees, which united with the maſts and flags of the ſhipping, and the houſes, form a very pleaſing ſpectacle.</p>
                  <p>Rotterdam has greatly the advantage of Amſterdam, for convenience of commerce. Ships of large bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then cannot go up to Amſterdam without unloading; but they may here come cloſe to the merchants houſes. In winter both the Maeſe and the Texel are frozen up; but in the Maeſe the paſſage is open much ſooner,
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:0161700110:299"/>
which is a great advantage in trade; inſomuch, that 300 ſail of Britiſh ſhips have been ſeen ſailing out of this harbour at once, when not a ſhip in the Texel has been able to move. Add to this, that the country about Rotterdam is far more pleaſant, the air more healthy, and the water better; but the other being the ſeat of government, counterbalances all theſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, and gives it infinitely a greater trade.</p>
                  <p>Nine-tenths of the Britiſh trade with the United Provinces centre at this place, which is owing to the advantage of its ſituation; many ſhip-loads of goods conſigned for Amſterdam, are ſent hither, and go by canals to that city: ſeveral hundred ſail of Britiſh veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels are ſometimes in this harbour at a time. There is alſo a conſiderable ſhare of the Eaſt-India trade car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on here, with very great magazines of their goods; and a glaſs manufactory, which works only for the Eaſt-India ſhips. I ſaw in it, ſays <hi>Marſhal,</hi> a vaſt quantity of toys done in enamel, bowls, cups, ſaucers, plates, figures, &amp;c. many of which were in a groteſque ſtyle, and well executed: theſe, they told me, met with a ready ſale in the iſlands depending on the Dutch empire in thoſe regions.</p>
                  <p>Several of the ſtreets are very ſpacious and well built; Heeren ſtreet is the fineſt; the houſes are built of hewn ſtones, but the Boompies is more agreeable, lying along the Maeſe, the length more than half a
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:0161700110:300"/>
mile; it ſeems like a vaſt quay; on one ſide is a row of lofty elms, ſkirted by the river, which is ſometimes full of ſhips, and on the other, the ſtreet is bounded by very large and well-built houſes. The beſt company in the city come here to walk in an evening. There are only four churches in this city of the eſtabliſhed religion, and none of them worth notice; but there is a large Engliſh chapel, where the ſervice of the church of England is performed by an Engliſh clergyman, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to it by the biſhop of London. The income about 100l. a-year. The Exchange is a very large and maſſive building, which gives a good idea of the place.</p>
                  <p>In the houſes belonging to the merchants, both of this city as well as of Amſterdam, all the beſt apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are on the ſecond floor; the ground floors are uſed for offices. On the firſt-floors the families live; on the ſecond ſtory are the beſt rooms, and the garrets or upper ſtories ſerve for warehouſes; and as there are goods perpetually craning up into ſome or other of the warehouſes, it is not a little dangerous to walk along the ſtreets of either of theſe cities. In general they do not crane their goods up as in England by a wheel fixed in the warehouſe; but draw them by a horſe, whoſe harneſs is fixed to a rope wnich runs through the pulley of the crane; and thus running a conſiderable length along the ſtreet, draws up the goods.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="288" facs="tcp:0161700110:301"/>Some of the merchants houſes are very magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent both here and at Amſterdam; for 6000l. ſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling is no price for a good houſe; and they pride them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in old-faſhioned furniture. The rooms are lined with oil-cloth, ſome painted ſimilar to our paper hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and ſome with ordinary landſcapes; a glaſs luſtre generally hangs in their beſt room, and Turkey carpets cover them, often of ſuch dimenſions as to be worth from thirty to a hundred pounds. The rooms dado high, are lined with wainſcot, and ſome with white marble; this with the oil-ſkin hangings renders them eaſy to be waſhed; the maids are cleaning theſe and the windows of the houſe every day of the week; the curtains and bed-furniture are always taken down and waſhed, when the leaſt ſoiled; and of courſe though a Dutch houſe may be damp, it is remarkably clean and well kept.</p>
                  <p>This city is very famous for having given birth to <hi>Eroſmus.</hi> Little as the Dutch affect to admire literature, they one and all ſhew the houſe in which he was born, with a kind of oſtentation. On the great bridge is a tolerable ſtatue of him in braſs; he is repreſented with a flowing gown, a cap on his head, and a large folio book in his hand, wide open; the pedeſtal is of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble incloſed with iron rails; the expreſſion, ſays <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal,</hi> is nothing remarkable; and in that particular we perfectly agree with him. Among Dutchmen, <hi>Eraſmus</hi> might be a very learned man; but among
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:0161700110:302"/>
learned men, we apprehend him to have been, at the beſt but a ſecond-rate genius. There is nothing elevated or ſublime in his writings, and thoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions of his which are in moſt requeſt, are emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently characteriſtic of the genius of the country-buffoonery and low humour.</p>
                  <p>All ſorts of proviſions are very dear at this place, where fiſh is far from cheap; the Dutch are amazing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly induſtrious, and the lower claſs very frugal; was that not the caſe, it would be impoſſible for them to live. Were the poor at Rotterdam to ſquander away as much money in drink, as they do in the great trad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towns of England, they would ſtarve: this may be eaſily conceived, ſays <hi>Marſhal,</hi> when I inform my readers, that during my ſtay here, bread was never leſs than twopence half-penny a pound, and that I could not live decently with one ſervant at the inn, for leſs than twenty florins a day, which is one pound thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen ſhillings and four-pence; this, ſays he, is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly as dear as in England. Wine, he adds, is cheaper than in England, but they have a great deal that is very bad. The red wine that is generally met with on the continent out of France, particularly in Flanders, Germany, and Holland is a thick, mud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy kind of claret, and conſiderably ſtronger; perhaps from a mixture of brandy with it, than genuine claret. This wine is to be had on the continent for about
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:0161700110:303"/>
two ſhillings a bottle, and has a roughneſs like port. There is only one ſpill-houſe in this town.</p>
                  <p>In the year 1732, the number of taxed houſes were eſtimated at between ſix and ſeven thouſand, and the inhabitants at between fifty and ſixty thouſand. The regency is compoſed of twenty-four counſellors, and a court of juſtice, conſiſting of a chief judge, four burgomaſters and ſeven aldermen.</p>
                  <p>Dort is an inconſiderable town compared with Amſterdam and Rotterdam, yet its deputies rank firſt in the aſſembly of deputies, from the different towns in Holland; whereas the Hague being conſidered only as a village, ſends no deputies to the ſtates of Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. However, the Hague, from its being the reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the Court, the place where the States-general aſſemble, and the centre of attraction to all foreigners; we ſhall proceed to treat of it, after having premiſed one or two particulars reſpecting the town of Dort, which is the moſt ancient in the province of Holland, as well as the firſt in dignity. This is the only town in the province where they have the privilege of coining money. In the year 1619 a famous ſynod was held in this city for exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the opinion of the Arminians and Calviniſts.</p>
                  <p>In one of the upper rooms of the gunner's doel are the benches where this famous ſynod ſate, which has given riſe to ſo many diviſions in this country

between the Arminians and the Anti-arminians, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrants and Anti-remonſtrants, predeſtinarians, latitudinarians, &amp;c. who all pretend to give a true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of the articles eſtabliſhed in this ſynod. Some Arminians ſuffered death for the cauſe, and the celebrated <hi>Grotius</hi> was impriſoned, and would have probably ſhared the ſame fate, had he not eſcaped by artifice, and fled to Paris, where he was highly careſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the French king, and allowed a penſion of a thouſand crowns a year. His eſcape was effected by means of his wife, in the following manner. He had obtained leave for a great trunk of books to be brought him, which he ſent backwards and forwards ſeveral times for near a twelvemonth; it was at firſt diligently ſearched by the guards, but finding nothing but books and linen, they did not trouble themſelves to look into it, as it paſſed; on which his wife perſuaded him to lock himſelf into the trunk, and endeavour to make his eſcape, and he was accordingly carried off without any ſuſpicion. His lady who was left behind in the apartment, lay upon the bed, in her huſband's night-gown and cap, pretending to be ill; whereby prevented any enquiry after him for ſeveral days. For this meditated ſcheme, ſhe was in danger of being condemned to perpetual impriſonment, but was at length by a majority of her judges formally diſcharged, and followed her huſband to France, where many other Arminians met with a kind reception, and were allowed liberty of conſcience.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="292" facs="tcp:0161700110:306"/>This town likewiſe gave birth to the famous <hi>De Witt.</hi> It carries on a conſiderable commerce in tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and Rheniſh wine, by means of the Rhine, which flows by its walls; though not ſo much as formally. There are at preſent in it about 18,000 inhabitants. Its ſituation is naturally ſo ſtrong, that though it has no fortifications, it was never yet taken. It is an iſland which was formed in 1421, by a terrible inundation, which deſtroyed ſeventy-two villages, in which, ſays <hi>Buſching,</hi> there periſhed not leſs than 100,000 per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. It is curious to ſee the floating rafters come down the Rhine to this place from Cologne, on which there are upwards of three hundred perſons.</p>
                  <p>Brill is about ſix miles diſtant from Helvoet, which is the town where paſſengers always land, who go over in the packet to Holland from Harwich. In this city may be obſerved the ſame neatneſs as is to be met with in all the other cities of Holland. This town and Helvoet-ſluys both ſtand in an iſland. <hi>Marſhal</hi> calls it a poor fiſhing place. The fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions give it the repute of being ſtrong; but the fineſt object is the river Maeſe at high water, which is near two miles over, and the fight of which, though beautiful to view, has not proved very pleaſing to many an Engliſh traveller, who perhaps fondly imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that when he had once got on <hi>terra firma</hi> in Holland, he ſhould no more be obliged to truſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf on that element which brought him there, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:0161700110:307"/>
along their canals; till he returned back to his native country.</p>
                  <p>The houſes are in general uniform, built of brick, with ſharp roofs and pointed fronts. What renders this city very famous in Holland is, that the Count <hi>de la Marc</hi> ſeized upon it with his <hi>gueuſes</hi> or beggars in 1572, and by his brave example drew the other towns of the Netherlands into a general revolt.</p>
                  <p>Hague is a moſt beautiful place, ſays <hi>Buſching,</hi> ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated in a very delightful country, without either gates or walls. It is ſurrounded however by a moat which is paſſed over at the entrance of the town by draw-bridges.</p>
                  <p>Its environs are exceedingly pleaſant, from being bounded on the eaſt by verdant meadows; on the ſouth by ſplendid ſeats; on the weſt by the ſand-hills along the North Sea, on which ſide there is a ſtraight avenue paved with clinkers, and a two-foot walk for paſſengers, planted with ſeveral rows of trees, leading to the village of Scheveling, about two miles diſtant; and northward is a delightful wood, in which the Stadt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder has a country ſeat. This village, the firſt of its kind in Europe, is the reſidence of the States-general of the ſtates of Holland, of the courts of juſtice, and of the foreign miniſters. The number of inhabitants are computed at 40,000.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="294" facs="tcp:0161700110:308"/>The Hague, ſays <hi>Marſhal,</hi> is a conſiderable city, though called a village, from the ridiculous reaſon of its not being walled. It has more of the <hi>rus in urbe,</hi> he adds, than any place he had ever ſeen. The ſtreets are broad and regular, but few of them without trees; the ſquares, like ancient Athens, are ſurrounded with groves; and the numerous gardens, with the ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing meadows, hardly ever broken in upon by thoſe receptacles of filth, and brick-kilns, which ſurround London, render it quite rural, and make it delightful to thoſe who admire ſuch views in the midſt of a city. Some writers make the number of gardens in this place and its environs to amount to upwards of 4,000, a number one would think ſcarce credible.</p>
                  <p>Every city of the United Provinces has a houſe here for its reſpective deputies. The old palace of the counts of Holland, at preſent, belongs to the Stadt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder; and though it was built 500 years ago, the wood work is ſtill ſound. In the centre of the area between the buildings of this palace, is the great hall, where the trophies of the republic in their many vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories are hung up; but in other reſpects it has nothing to recommend it. In this palace the ſtates of the United Provinces aſſemble, and here the foreign miniſters have their audience. On the weſt it opens to a large plain, ſurrounded with magnificent houſes, regularly planted with trees, which have made ſome
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:0161700110:309"/>
travellers draw a compariſon between this ſpot and St. James's park. It is indeed like the Mall in St. James's park, but not a third ſo long.</p>
                  <p>The ſtreets of the Hague are extremely well paved with clinkers, that wear an appearance of bricks; the joints are ſo well cloſed, that they admit of waſhing like a houſe; and the inhabitants ſeem to vie with each other in this public cleanlineſs; thoſe of each houſe keeping that ſpot clean which is before it, which makes walking in them exceeding pleaſant. This ſpirit of neatneſs maybe obſerved at Rotterdam and moſt other towns in Holland; but the pavements not being ſo good, the effects are not ſo very viſible as they are here. This great attention in the Dutch however to the keeping of their houſes clean, ſeems rather on the decline: there being many houſes in England kept to the full as clean as any in Holland. But this extends only to the better ranks of people. For among the lower claſs, there is no compariſon between the two nations. A Dutch cottage, or the houſe of an inferior tradeſman, is kept as clean as poſſible, though there be ever ſo many children in it; but in England ſuch habitations are too often the reſidence of filth and naſtineſs. We have a female character, ſays <hi>Marſhal,</hi> amongſt us who is called a daudle, but ſuch a being is not known in Holland.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="296" facs="tcp:0161700110:310"/>There is one article which is found great fault with by ſtrangers at the Hague, and that is the expence of fuel. A fire of wood will coſt as much as ſeven fires in London; and I ſaw no coal, ſays <hi>Marſhal;</hi> turf is the only firing. This I do not diſlike, he adds; its making no ſmoak, which from ſea-coal is offenſive to the ſmell, and from wood prejudicial to the eyes, an advantage much in its favour; beſides the moſt aſth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic perſon will find no inconvenience to his breath from turf. But as to ſtoves ſo much uſed in this and other northern countries, they are extremely diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able: cuſtom might reconcile them; but an Engliſh fire far exceeds all theſe contrivances.</p>
                  <p>This place appears very different from any other of the Dutch towns; buſineſs and making money is all that is going forward at Rotterdam, but at the Hague there is nothing of the kind: to make amends for which, there is as much good company as in any city of Europe. It is the court of the Prince of Orange, conſequently all the foreign miniſters make it their place of reſidence; and the meetings of the States-general are ever held in this place: the number of elegant equipages is great, the expenſive dreſſes, the quantity of ſervants, and the general air of luxury and pleaſure, carry a very different appearance from any thing to be met with elſewhere. But though there, are ſuch a number of idle people here who ſpend very great incomes, yet ſtill the Hague is very
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:0161700110:311"/>
badly off for public diverſions. The chief place of public amuſement here is a French theatre, and this is chiefly ſupported by the ſubſcriptions of foreign miniſters. Operas are indeed occaſionally performed when ſingers are to be had; but where comedies are badly performed, no very ſanguine expectations will be entertained of any great degree of excellence in their operas. Concerts they have very often, but the beſt are at private houſes.</p>
                  <p>The public buildings at the Hague make no figure; the houſes; the form of the ſtreets and ſquares, are in general infinitely ſuperior; ſome of theſe indeed appear very magnificent. The palace, as they call it, has ſeveral courts, but it is a very antiquated building. Nor is that which belonged to prince <hi>Maurice</hi> of Naſſau, and where the council of war now aſſemble, in the leaſt remarkable. Notwithſtanding this place is ſo extremely populous, there are but two churches in it. One of them is of a circular figure without pillars, a mode of building which the Dutch ſeem to admire.</p>
                  <p>The Voohout is the Dutch Mall, and is about as broad as that of St. James's. It was planted by the Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> V.; there are three alleys for car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages, and the buildings oppoſite to it make a good appearance; but what is very ſingular, inſtead of
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:0161700110:312"/>
gravel, they have laid it with cockle-ſhells, which are very unpleaſant to walk upon. This, ſays <hi>Marſhal,</hi> is very ſtrange, as gravel might be had from us at no great expence. Sand is the general ſubſtitute in Holland, which takes off very much from the beauty of their gardens and public walks. This Mall is however as much deſerted as our Ring.</p>
                  <p>The Prince Graft is a very noble ſtreet, near half a mile long, of a a fine breadth, and as ſtraight as an arrow; a ſpacious canal, planted on both ſides, runs along the middle of it, with ſeveral ſtone bridges having iron balluſtrades, over it; the houſes, eſpecially thoſe on one ſide, make a very grand appearance, and the whole in ſhort is very ornamental to the Hague. But this ſtreet is a ſtrong proof that planting of trees has not an effect equal to a fine range of buildings unaccompanied by them. A canal cut through a very wide ſtreet, and faced with ſtone, agrees extremely well with the regularity of the houſes, and is an addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional beauty to them, but trees are no ornament here.</p>
                  <p>When, we ſaid there was no commerce carried on in this place, we ſhould have excepted one article, and that the moſt liberal of all other articles of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, namely the commerce of books. This is the great mart for literature, particularly French, of all Holland, if not of all Europe. Great quantities of
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:0161700110:313"/>
books in quires are exported from hence all over Germany, as well as to England and France. The Dutch editions of French books are in general in more eſteem than the French, as being printed better, and on a better paper, and what is more material than all, more carefully reviſed, and therefore freer from the errors of the preſs than the ſame works printed in other countries. What is it that ſtamps ſuch a value on the <hi>Elzevir</hi> editions at this preſent time, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly the editions of the claſſics, but that they are not only very neatly but alſo very correctly printed; ſo that ſcarce a ſingle error of the preſs is to be found by the moſt diſcerning eye, throughout any of their works?</p>
                  <p>This town, conſiderable as it is, never had a voice among the ſix in the ſenate, nor among the twelve that have been added ſince, though Purmerend and Schiedam, two inconſiderable places, have votes, for which no other reaſon can be aſſigned than that the Hague was always conſidered as a village, though the moſt beautiful and largeſt in the world. <hi>Tacitus</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſome groves here in which <hi>Claudius Civilis</hi> aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled the people, and made an harangue to them. <hi>Guicciardini</hi> has likewiſe taken notice of ſome ancient ſculptures and other things relating to <hi>Adrian, Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninus, Septimus Severus,</hi> and other Roman emperors. Whilſt Holland was under the Spaniſh juriſdiction, the treaſury and other public offices were here kept.
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:0161700110:314"/>
The air of this place is ſaid to be very wholeſome. Sir <hi>William Temple</hi> attributes longer life to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of this village, than to thoſe of any other place in Holland.</p>
                  <p>Near the Hague are two or three other places which attract the attention of ſtrangers; the firſt is Schevel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the road to which through the ſand-banks is curious. This is a pleaſant little village about two miles from the Hague, on the ſea-coſt. The road to it is paved, as we have already obſerved, and ſhaded with double rows of lime trees and benches at different diſtances to ſit down upon. To this place people go to eat fiſh, freſh caught, and admire the beauty of the proſpect, as people in London occaſionally make parties of pleaſure to Greenwich and Blackwall to eat while-bait. This coaſt is likewiſe very well worth ſeeing, to remark the attention of the Dutch in keeping up their banks, to prevent the depredations of the ſea upon their country.</p>
                  <p>On this beach, which is very flat and regular, the famous ſailing chariot of <hi>Stevinus</hi> was made trial of, furniſhed both with wheels and ſails, which carried eight and twenty perſons the aſtoniſhing diſtance of forty-two miles in two hours; and once, by an error of the perſon who had hold of the rudder, was very near ſailing into the ſea with a full cargo, which was rather more than they had bargained for.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="301" facs="tcp:0161700110:315"/>The great ſucceſs of this ſailing machine has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced many imitators in different parts of Europe; and a hundred ſchemes for conducting not only car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages but carts and waggons, and even ploughs by the wind have been attempted. Something uſeful, ſays <hi>Marſhal,</hi> might probably be invented, but mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticians wanting money for theſe experiments, none of their viſionary ſchemes have hitherto been carried in practice.</p>
                  <p>In ſummer, people come down here to bathe; but what is moſt ſingular is, that the daughters of the fiſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men take care of their cloaths while they are bathing, and furniſh them with cloaths, help to wipe them dry when they come out of the water, without its being thought any ſcandal on either ſide; ſuch is the power of cuſtom. Scheveling has already ſuffered ſo much from the encroachments of the ſea that the church which was once ſituated in the centre of the village, is now almoſt by the ſea-ſide.</p>
                  <p>At the ſmall diſtance of a pleaſant walk from the Hague, is the houſe in the wood belonging to the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> which in Holland is an object of curioſity; but there is nothing in it that will ſtrike an Engliſhman accuſtomed to Engliſh gardens. In the palace there is a fine ſaloon with a cupola, and it is richly ornamented with ſome very capital paintings by <hi>Rubens, Vanderveldt, Varelſt,</hi> and <hi>Schuyr.</hi>

                     <pb n="302" facs="tcp:0161700110:316"/>The family of the <hi>Bentincks</hi> have alſo ſome very fine gardens in the Dutch taſte near this place, known by the name of the Portland gardens, which they keep open at all times for the accommodation of ſtrangers, and of the public at large; and theſe are almoſt the only gardens which are thus publicly open. The eye here is agreeably amuſed by a diverſity of objects to take off from the tediouſneſs of the long alleys in the Dutch gardens, (which are here, as in other places, covered with ſand, carried on in a ſtraight line, and interſected every inſtant by other ſimilar ſtraight walks) for there is a fine orangery, a grotto, a jet d'eau, a grove, terraces, mounts, parterres, a lake, and a menagery.</p>
                  <p>Ryſwich is another village near the Hague, which moſt ſtrangers viſit, not only to view the palace of the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> but as remarkable from its being the ſpot in which a treaty of peace was concluded in 1697 between England, Germany, Holland, France, and Spain. The palace is the only building of free ſtone in the Seven United Provinces: it is ſtrongly envel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loped in wood, which darkens every room; this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of crouding all their houſes with trees and wood is unaccountable in the Dutch. In a hilly bleak country, where wind and plenty of air were evils, one would naturally look for this taſte; but in a dead flat, where the air is apt to ſtagnate, as well as the water, it is prepoſterous. There is nothing in the palace
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:0161700110:317"/>
worthy of obſervation, but a few good pictures. In the ſtate chamber, is an echo which repeats diſtinctly at one end of room whatever is ſaid in a whiſper at the other, without thoſe who are in the middle being able to comprehend a ſyllable that is ſaid.</p>
                  <p>At Honſlaerdyck there is another palace belonging to the Prince, about a mile from the ſea, in which there is a gallery of fine pictures, by the firſt maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in the Flemiſh ſchool, among which are a Charles the firſt, by <hi>Vandyke,</hi> a Madona by him, with a Venus, by <hi>Rubens.</hi> This houſe is conſidered to be ſuperior to ſome of the famous palaces in Italy. From the back part there is a delightful pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect through a pleaſant grove, and ſome regular plantations of ever-greens, which form a ſquare of half a mile from each angle to the centre: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond this place is an aviary for exotic birds, and a menagery for wild beaſts. The lower rooms of this place have no peculiar ornament, except being neat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly paved with marble, after the Dutch faſhion; but the room up ſtairs are magnificent, and the two gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leries very curious. The princeſs's cloſet is orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented all round with exquiſite japan-work.</p>
                  <p>To give ſome idea, before we entirely quit the Hague, of what may be the expences to a man of faſhion, during a ſhort ſtay in this ſeat of Dutch gaiety and ſplendor, we ſhall extract what <hi>Marſhal</hi>
                     <pb n="304" facs="tcp:0161700110:318"/>
ſays on that ſubject. With reſpect to an ordinary traveller, they may be brought within a compaſs near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſimilar to what we ſtated as the uſual routine of expences for ſtrangers unincumbered with carriages and ſervants at Amſterdam.</p>
                  <p>I was, ſays he, at the <hi>Parlément d'Angleterre,</hi> which was the hotel that all perſons of any rank went to. I found it fully anſwerable to the character I had received of it; for although I was moderate in my bill of fare, yet I could not come off for leſs than two regular courſes, and ſeveral ſorts of excellent wines; indeed, it was to little purpoſe to be explicit in giving orders about my meals, for I was ſerved with a variety whether I choſe it or not. The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences upon an average were about two guineas a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day; but I entertained, ſays he, ſome perſons of character to whom I had letters of recommendation. There is no ſatisfaction, he adds, in travelling expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively, eſpecially in eating and drinking, and ſuch money is better expended in purchaſing the rarities or peculiar productions of the country, than in ſquandering away large ſums at inns. Theſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances he mentions as a hint to other travellers, that may conſider and lay their plan before-hand: for, by not taking private lodgings, and by making a longer ſtay than he intended, his expences were very heavy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="305" facs="tcp:0161700110:319"/>Thoſe who make the tour of Holland from the Hague, proceed thither by the way of Delft or Rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdam, the latter of which cities we have noticed; or elſe take their route by Leyden, Haerlem, Amſterdam and Utrecht, and ſo take Rotterdam on their return. Theſe are the principal and moſt populous cities in Holland, or rather in the Dutch Netherlands;—Utrecht not being in the province of Holland, though all the reſt are.</p>
                  <p>Delft lyes in the road between the Hague and Rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdam, about ſix miles from the Hague. This is an agreeable place, pleaſantly ſituated among the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows; the ſtreets are ſpacious, and canals running through them planted with trees. It is about half the ſize of Norwich. The principal object in it is the manufactory of earthen ware, and hence called Delft. Their porcelain employs at preſent about 4,000 people, men, women and children; the manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture was once ſo flouriſhing as to employ more than 7,000, but the ſetting up of a fabric of white ſtone-ware in England was very prejudicial to it; though not near ſo much as the Staffordſhire cream-coloured ware; this has rivalled the Delft manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, not only in the Britiſh conſumption, but even in their own city, to ſuch a degree, as to have induced the principal manufacturers to make application more than once for a prohibition of it: this has not yet been granted; but very high duties have been laid
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:0161700110:320"/>
on it; and the uſe of it ſtill continuing, they are at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting to rival us in the ſame manufacture, but hitherto without ſucceſs.</p>
                  <p>Brewing is alſo a trade in which the people of Delft are very much engaged, and which ſucceeds very well: there was formerly a very conſiderable cloth-manufactory here, but rival manufactories in France eſtabliſted in the time of <hi>Louis</hi> XIV. have brought it to a low ebb.</p>
                  <p>There are but two churches in this city, in one of which is the tomb of <hi>Prince William</hi> I. of Orange, the founder of the republic, who was treacherouſly ſhot in his palace here by an aſſaſſin in 1584. The place and hole in the wainſcot through which the balls paſſed are ſtill ſhewn. A moſt noble mauſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leum has been erected here to his memory, at the expence of the ſtates-general. There are two ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of him, one of marble, repoſing on his tomb, which is ſupported by twenty-two pillars of black marble, and another of braſs ſtanding near it. On the top is Fame ſounding her trumpet, with this motto <hi>Te vindice, tuta libertas.</hi> Under your auſpices ſhall freedom flouriſh. At his feet lyes his little dog, which is ſaid to have pined away, and died with grief for the loſs of his maſter, <hi>(ſee the plate.)</hi>—This church is now the burial place of the Princes of Orange. The aſhes of the celebrated <hi>Grotius</hi> are
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:0161700110:321"/>
likewiſe repoſed here. Surely this man merited a ſtatue of braſs in the great ſquare of Rotterdam, much more than <hi>Eraſmus.</hi> Poſſibly his works con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining more ſound and deep learning, with leſs buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foonry than thoſe of the other, were above the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of Dutchmen. In the other church is a ſtately marble monument to the famous admiral <hi>Van Tromp.</hi> This city is likewiſe ſaid to have given birth to the celebrated <hi>Heinſius.</hi> In the hotel-de-ville, a fine gothic building, is a machine in the form of a clog, which uſed to be put about the neck of perſons convicted of adultery.</p>
                  <p>The commerce of this place, as has been already remarked, is not ſo conſiderable as formerly, and it is now the retreat of wealthy merchants; who have probably been induced to come here from its cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trical ſituation, the ſalubrity of the air, its vicinity to the ſea, the continued verdure with which it is on every ſide ſurrounded, and its being a large, clean and quiet town, unaccompanied with noiſe and buſtle.</p>
                  <p>About as far to the ſouth of the Hague as Delft is to the north, or ſomething more, lyes the city of Leyden, eſteemed the largeſt and fineſt town in Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, next to Amſterdam. It is ſeated in a country full of gardens and meadows, and ſurrounded with a great number of ditches and canals, near the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:0161700110:322"/>
bed of the Rhine, which now looks like a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal. It is about four miles in circumference, and its ditches are bordered with rows of trees. This town is unqueſtionably one of the neateſt and pleaſanteſt in the Low Countries; and though it may be going too far to ſay, it is the largeſt town in Holland next to Amſterdam; yet Rotterdam is the only town beſides, that comes in competition with it. The buildings are beautiful and magnificent, the ſtreets ſpacious and very clean, with canals in the middle of many of them, the ſides of which are planted with rows of trees. The Rapenburg ſtreet is a very noble one; and, as the inhabitants ſuppoſe, the fineſt in Europe. The great church is a vaſt building, but moſt remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for being the burial place of the great <hi>Boerhaave.</hi> The inſcription on his monument is ſimple and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. <hi>Salutifero Boerhaavii genio ſacrum.</hi> "Sacred to the health-reſtoring genius of <hi>Boerhaave."</hi> Had not the family of this illuſtrious Hollander been rich enough to pay this tribute to his memory, there would be nothing here to ſhew that this town had the greateſt phyſician that ever lived ſince <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates.</hi> If a naval officer diſtinguiſhes himſelf ever ſo little, he is honoured with a public funeral; but thoſe who contribute to enlighten the human mind by deep reſearches, go unnoticed. In the church of St. Mary there is a monument of <hi>Joſeph Scaliger,</hi> and another of <hi>Eluſius</hi> the herbaliſt.—The ſtadthouſe preſents nothing worthy of obſervation, but a picture
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:0161700110:323"/>
by <hi>Luke</hi> of Leyden, of the laſt judgement. It is ſaid, this is the firſt painter who had any idea of perſpective. He died in 1533.</p>
                  <p>But what has rendered this city famous all over Europe, is its univerſity. It undoubtedly has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced many great and very able men, But this, like their commerce, appears on the deline. Whoever expects to ſee magnificent colleges, or pompous heads of houſes, will here be miſerably diſappointed.</p>
                  <p>They have only two colleges, in the nature of hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitals, for the ſupport of poor ſcholars, the reſt of the ſtudents living at their own expence; they wear no gowns or caps, but walk about the ſtreets with their ſwords on, and appear in the ſchools and perform their exerciſes with them on, and their heads un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered. Thoſe who wiſh to be members of the univerſity apply to the <hi>Rector Magnificus,</hi> corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponding with our vice-chancellor, who enters their name in the univerſity book; for which half-a-crown or five ſhillings is paid, which entitles the ſtudent to a certain quantity of wine and beer without paying exciſe.</p>
                  <p>Beſides the public lecture, the profeſſors allot cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain hours for reading private ones; theſe laſt about three months, for which the ſcholars pay forty or fifty guilders, though they ſeldom are much ſuperior
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:0161700110:324"/>
to the lectures of our private tutors. They com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly dictate in Latin, which is oftentimes not leſs obſcure than the ſubject of the lecture.</p>
                  <p>Degrees are not regulated here either by time or merit; if the ſtudent can make a <hi>theſis,</hi> and pay his fees, he may be admitted. His <hi>theſis</hi> he is, <hi>pro formâ,</hi> obliged to maintain in the ſchool againſt any oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent. The degrees of doctor and maſters of arts are the only ones in uſe among them; that of batchelor being not known here. The graduates give public entertainments, and publiſh their <hi>theſes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The profeſſors of the ſeveral faculties publiſh their <hi>ſeries lectionum,</hi> containing the times when, and the ſubjects upon which they are to read in public. Some of them have two hundred, others three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred per annum.</p>
                  <p>The ſchools conſiſt of a large pile of brick build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, in the uppermoſt rooms of which the famous <hi>Elzevir</hi> had his printing office. They have a library ſaid to contain ſome curious manuſcripts; but neither their library, their phyſic-garden, nor their collection of natural hiſtory, preſents any thing very intereſting to the generality of travellers, of all which they ſeem to make great boaſt in Holland. It was a remark of the late Doctor <hi>Johnſon,</hi> that ſome judgment might be formed of the ſtate of literature in any
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:0161700110:325"/>
town, from the bookſellers ſhops. If this criterion holds good with reſpect to Leyden, literature will appear at a very low ebb there; the collection of books to be met with in that city being in general but very indifferent, and moſtly confined to medical ſubjects. This univerſity is the oldeſt in the United Netherlands; and was founded by <hi>William</hi> I. Prince of Orange.</p>
                  <p>As this city ſeems to be on the decline in its litera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſo it is in its woollen manufactures (the ſtaple commodity of this city,) and which were formerly much more conſiderable than at preſent. The work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men conſiſt of ſeveral nations, particularly French. Their fabrics employ at preſent ſeveral thouſand men, women and children; chieſly making broad and nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row cloths, ſerges and camlets; but they are inferior, ſays <hi>Marſhal,</hi> to the fineſt cloths of the ſame kind in England. Their camlets and rattines, however, are greatly ſuperior to thoſe made at Bruſſels, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways have been held in high eſtimation; and there are two colours to which they are ſuppoſed to give a ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior dye, to any other country whatever—black, and particularly blue. The French are ſuppoſed to equal them in their black, but the Leyden blue ſtands as yet unrivalled every where. Their cloths they export to Spain, Turkey, and the Eaſt-Indies; in which countries they have the preference over ours; not from their being better in quality, but from their
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:0161700110:326"/>
being cheaper. Among other reaſons aſſigned for their trade being on the decline, one is, that the princes in Germany, who formerly cloathed their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies entirely with Dutch cloth, have lately ſupplied themſelves from manufactures of their own, which they had eſtabliſhed.</p>
                  <p>A great trade is carried on here in garden-ſtuff, which is in ſuch eſteem as to be carried as far as Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam, to ſupply the markets there. Their gardens are ſaid to produce four or five crops every year; and it is further ſaid, that an acre of garden ground is worth two hundred and fifty pounds, purchaſe-money; and arable, two hundred pounds, and an acre of meadow land, an hundred and forty pounds.</p>
                  <p>This city likewiſe is famous for being the birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place of <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Leyden,</hi> who in 1534, ſet up to be a king; his followers were a kind of anabaptiſts, who committed many outrages; but the following year they were puniſhed for their raſhneſs and rebellion; and <hi>John</hi> himſelf was broken upon the wheel. This <hi>John</hi> of Leyden was a taylor, and in the hall where the taylors meet, is ſhewn the board, which he uſed to cut out his cloth.</p>
                  <p>Not far from this place, at the village called Cath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich, near the ſea, are the ruins of an ancient fortreſs, known by the name of <hi>Arx Britannica,</hi> which being
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:0161700110:327"/>
built by <hi>Cabjala,</hi> and afterwards deſtroyed by the Normans, was at laſt overwhelmed by the ſea; yet not ſo much, but that at certain times when the ſea is very low, its ruins are plainly to be ſeen; and ſome antiquities have been found with this inſcription, <hi>Ex. Ger. Inf. Ex Germania Inferiori.</hi> From Lower Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many.</p>
                  <p>The only remaining city to be noticed in this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, is Haerlem, fifteen miles diſtant from Leyden, and nine from Amſterdam; with which two cities it enjoys a communication, by means of two ſpacious canals. The views of the country between Leyden and Haerlem, are by no means unpleaſant, though there is a range of vaſt turf pits, and the lake of Haer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem on one ſide; but the other is much diverſified with meadows, fed principally with black, cattle. The lake is twelve miles long, and three broad, lying be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Amſterdam, Leyden, and Haerlem; there is a very conſiderable commerce on it, ſo that it is finely ſpread with ſails. This lake yields great quantities of fiſh. It is ſurpriſing that little jealouſies between the three great cities near this river, ſhould prevent their agreeing, in a work ſo very advantageous to the country, as draining and converting this lake into a rich meadow would be. The water is in no places more than eight feet deep, and all of it could be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed away at a ſmall expence, and the whole ſpace kept perfectly dry. The Dutch all agree that it is
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:0161700110:328"/>
practicable; but three cities above-mentioned, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not agree together about doing it.</p>
                  <p>Haerlem, like other Dutch cities, has a ſhow of fortifications, but there are none that could hold out any ſiege. The ſtreets are wide and ſtraight, but the houſes have nothing in them to attract notice. There are many canals here: as to the number of inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, they are reckoned at fifty thouſand. The prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal church is a very fine ſtructure; it has three or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, one of which is ſo celebrated, that it is uſual for perſons of faſhion and fond of muſic, to pay a ducat, the eſtabliſhed fee, to hear a few airs played upon it. And they ſhew in this church ſome cannon balls, that are now ſticking in the walls, which were ſhot into it by the Spaniards during the time of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine ſervice, in the famous ſiege of 1572. In the roof are hung up the models of two veſſels with ſaws to their keel, which were ſent by the people of Haer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, to the ſiege of Damiette, on the confines of Egypt, to cut the chain which ſtopped the navigation up the Nile; by effecting which they delivered one of their counts of Holland, who was kept priſoner there, under the reign of <hi>Barbaroſſa.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In memory of this extraordinary action, the young men of this town celebrate the firſt of January, and carry little boats about, ſhaped like the ſhips in the church; they boaſt that <hi>Barbaroſſa,</hi> in conſideration of
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:0161700110:329"/>
the ſignal ſervices done by the people of Haerlem in the holy war, added the ſword to the arms of this city, and the Partriarch of Jeruſalem beſtowed the croſs upon it.</p>
                  <p>Haerlem likewiſe boaſts the invention of printing by one <hi>Laurence Coſter,</hi> who, as <hi>Guicciardini</hi> ſays, walking one day in one of the groves, of which they have ſeveral about this place, cut ſome letters from the bark he had peeled from the trees, and ſtamping them, inverted on a piece of paper; he found them to come right; then rubbing them over with ink, it produced ſomething like a letter, though ſomewhat blotted; however being encouraged by this rough draught, he cut regular letters on better materials, which being dipped into a more glutinous ink, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated improvements, he brought it at laſt to perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. They ſay, one of his ſervants robbed him of all his inſtruments, and went with them to Mayence, or Mentz, which is the reaſon that city diſputes this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention with Haerlem. His picture with the letter A in his hand, and drawn with a furred gown, is to be ſeen in the Prince's garden. They likewiſe ſhew a piece of <hi>Coſter</hi>'s firſt printing, the impreſſions only on one ſide, as they uſed to print their firſt originals.</p>
                  <p>The gardens of this city merit much being ſeen: they are all almoſt in the Fauxbourgs. It is the hyacinths which are now the prevailing flowers; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:0161700110:330"/>
the preference was given to the tulip. Though the price of the roots is very much diminiſhed, ſome at preſent will ſell for a hundred florins a root; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly five hundred pounds have been given for a ſingle root of yellow hyacinth, but this was before they were general, fancy alone conſtituting the great diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between them. Next to the hyacinth, they value moſt the tulip: next, the anemony, then the narciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, and then the auricula: other choice flowers, which ſome nations pride themſelves in, are here in no eſteem. The bulbous flowers are exported all over Europe.</p>
                  <p>The objects moſt worthy of notice in this neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood, are the manufactures of the bleach-ground; the principal trade is bleaching linen; large quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that have been made in other provinces, in Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and in Sileſia, are brought to Haerlem, to be bleached: whole ſhip-loads have even been brought here, from Scotland and Ireland, for the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. It is the quality of the water alone, which bleaches the linen in this place, ſo much better than in any other. Repeated trials have been made in Scotland and Ireland, where Dutch bleachers have been employed, without their having the ſame ſucceſs. Let it be remembered, however, that the whiter any cloth is made, ſo much the leſs time it will wear; this extraordinary fine bleaching ſhould therefore be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to ſuch cloths, as are intended for the uſe of the
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:0161700110:331"/>
rich. The charge of freight to and from Scotland, with the price of bleaching, amounts to about ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence a yard, which would be a very great addition in the price of any but very fine linens.</p>
                  <p>Beſides this branch of trade, there are ſeveral conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable manufactures, particularly of velvet, damaſks, ſatins, ſilk ſtuffs of various ſorts; thread, tape, &amp;c. In all which a great number of hands are employed; and I was here told, ſays <hi>Marſhal,</hi> that their fabrics had been increaſing for ſome years, but that their bleaching trade was on the decline.</p>
                  <p>Weavers, upon an average, will earn here, near half-a-guinea a week. From different accounts of the number of hands employed in all the manufactures, it appears there are from thirty, to upwards of forty thouſand; but there are many of them employed by ſome very conſiderable breweries, which work for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation.</p>
                  <p>In all this part of the province of Holland, ſcarce any arable land is to be ſeen: their meadow land is very rich, and will let from forty ſhillings, to ſix pounds an Engliſh acre. This land is principally applied to the feeding of cows, which are of a very large breed; in the management of them, the peaſants are remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably attentive; they keep them clothed all the winter, and as clean as an Engliſh gentleman would a ſtable
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:0161700110:332"/>
of hunters. This is not effected by the means of lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, for they uſe none. A trench of ſtone or brick, is made in the floor of the cow-room, in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that the dung may fall directly into it, and which being ſwept away with the dirt of the reſt of the houſe, forms a good compoſt; and a ſaving of ſtraw in a part of the country where there is no arable land, is an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of no ſmall importance. They beſides, dreſs and rub down their cows, as we do our horſes, which they think will make them give the more milk; they like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe keep their cow-houſes as warm as poſſible, and ſtop every crevice, till the breath of the beaſts makes the whole place perfectly warm. This is a ſtrange cuſtom, and appears contrary to nature; but they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry this notion ſo far of keeping their cows warm, that they even put cloths over their loins, whilſt they are feeding in the fields in ſummer.</p>
                  <p>Theſe paſtures are likewiſe fed by large herds of black cattle, which the Dutch drivers purchaſe in Holſtein and Denmark, for forty or fifty ſhillings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, and ſell to the farmers here for three or four pounds; and it is obſervable that their meadows are ſo rich, that ſome of the beaſts will be fattened in ſix weeks time. The butchers buy them fat from five to nine pounds a-head: and as an Engliſh acre will fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten three, the farmer makes from three to ſix pounds an acre, for only part of the year.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="319" facs="tcp:0161700110:333"/>It is aſſerted the fleſh of their oxen is not ſo firm, nor their hides ſo capable of making good leather, as thoſe of Engliſh cattle: this is owing to the luxuriance of the food, puffing them up in ſo ſhort a time, rather than giving them that ſolid fat, which ſix or eight months effect in England; it is accordingly obſerved, that though ſome of theſe beaſts are as large as the Engliſh ones, yet they will not equal them in weight.</p>
                  <p>As the Dutch eat very little freſh beef, the greateſt part is ſalted for the ſhipping, or dried and ſmoaked in a peculiar manner for hung beef, which they ſend all over Europe.</p>
                  <p>Land in the neighbourhood of Leyden, ſells dearer than in any other part of Europe, when applied to cultivation, and not to building on. Arable land, as has been obſerved before, will fetch 200l. an acre: and garden ground from 250 to even 300; the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts they yield being highly valued by the Gour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands at Amſterdam.</p>
                  <p>The gardeners are very ſkilful in cropping their lands continually, on the plan now purſued in the gardens round London; where this art is carried to as high perfection as in any quarter of the globe.</p>
                  <p>The general fertility the country is owing to the ſoil, and to its being ſo well watered; for from the
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:0161700110:334"/>
general flatneſs of the whole country, its vicinity to the ſea, and its numerous rivers, this country is evidently a drained marſh or bog; it being all either a fat marly loam, mud, or a turf bog: theſe are rich ſoils, and with the advantage of cattle, and having al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways water to have recourſe to, which the Dutch boors eſteem a matter of great conſequence both to fattening cattle, and making them give large quantities of milk; they produce the wonders that are ſeen in this country. Much therefore is owing to the number of canals and rivers that interſect the meadows; and probably to their overflowing large tracks of land in winter, and leaving behind advantages, it may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed parallel to thoſe which are left by the Nile.</p>
                  <p>Among the rivers it is very well known, that the Rhine is very inconſiderable. At Leyden an inſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant canal is ſhewn which is the real Rhine. The glory of other rivers increaſes proportionably to the length of their courſe; but this dwindles to nothing, and is utterly loſt before it comes to its harbour.</p>
                  <p>The cauſe of the Rhine's fate was an earthquake, which ſhook the Downs in the ninth century, and fill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the mouth of this river, forced it to return and ſeek a new paſſage. The river Seck was then ſcarce worth notice; but the waters of the Rhine which were
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:0161700110:335"/>
driven back and overflowed the country; ſwelled and deepened the Leek's channel, and the entrance of the ſea has been ever ſince ſhut up, againſt the ancient courſe of the Rhine.</p>
                  <p>Thus, this poor river which runs ſuch hazards in the lake of Conſtance, and throws itſelf down a precipice near Schaff hauſen, loſes at length its reputation, and waters, at the village of Caturik.</p>
                  <p>Before we quit the neighbourhood of the Hague, and Leyden, which are reckoned the politeſt places in all the provinces, and the moſt learned; one being the ſeat of government, and reſidence of the foreign miniſters, and the other an univerſity and the ſeat of ſciences, and literature; we will beg leave to offer ſome few remarks on the character of the people in this part of the United Netherlands.</p>
                  <p>Among the lower claſſes of people, there is a very great national reſemblance throughout all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces; but among the better ſort, who ſupport them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves without trade, and who have travelled, theſe are all more or leſs French. They ſpeak that language only, they dreſs in the French taſte, eat in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and give themſelves (particularly young men of any faſhion in Holland) the ſame airs, as if they aped French livelineſs and vivacity. People of this deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are not uncommon at the Hague; this place not
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:0161700110:336"/>
being ſupported by trade, but rather the reſidence of idleneſs than induſtry; and being full of foreigners, it may account for this motley appearance of characters, which we find in the inhabitants of that city. It is likewiſe worth remarking, that there is ſomething of the character of a Frenchified Dutchman to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at Leyden, though not ſo much as at the Hague, But at Rotterdam there is a viſible difference. This plainly ſhews that the characters and manners of the people are very much formed, by their cloſe adher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to or neglecting buſineſs. A Dutch Burgomaſter, or principal freeman, dreſſes in a formal ſuit of black, and his lady in a hoop every way ſhaped like a bell, with a laced coif, worth 100l. whilſt the daughter ſhall be tricked out in every French faſhion.</p>
                  <p>At Leyden the Univerſity draws a great number of perſons who have no views of trade, and who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore affect the appearance and manners of the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants; but at Rotterdam every individual is deeply engaged in commerce, and therefore exhibits the true Dutch character much more to the life.</p>
                  <p>An unſhaken induſtry ſeems to be the ſtrong cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racteriſtic features of this city; no application wearies them, no accidents divert them; their whole atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is directed to the raiſing of wealth; and it is not a little ſurpriſing to ſee the numbers who have attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed large fortunes, and yet continue the ſame anxiety
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:0161700110:337"/>
and eagerneſs after more, without thinking to enjoy what they have already acquired. Their conſtitutions are cold and phlegmatic to an amazing degree; a ſober regular, parſimonious way of life, is habitual to them, and no paſſion ſeems to lurk in their boſom that can ruffle them. This, however, cannot be attributed to their love of trade, ſo much as to their climate.</p>
                  <p>A Dutchman is as amphibious as a frog, ſays <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal;</hi> half their country is water, and half their time is ſpent upon it. The vapours which ariſe from the quantity of water with which they are ſurrounded, and from a ſoil which is low, moiſt, and boggy, muſt neceſſarily affect the mind of its inhabitants. What an aſtoniſhing contraſt between love in Spain or Italy, and love in Holland! Would it not be amazing to tell a Neapolitan <hi>inamorato,</hi> that the height of his fine phrenzy was mere climate; and that if he lived in Holland, he would look upon his miſtreſs with the coldeſt friendſhip!</p>
                  <p>But theſe characteriſtics are not general; there are and muſt be many exceptions. Many of the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants and manufacturers live genteelly; and though not all in the French ſtyle, yet in much eaſe, plenty, and affluence, while they attend to trade as cloſely as if no ſuch external marks of riches were to be ſeen among them. They are fond of indulging in the lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uries of the table, in expenſive furniture, and hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:0161700110:338"/>
equipages; but as for dreſs, amuſements, and a variety of ſervants, they are totally indifferent about them.</p>
                  <p>The true national character, unmixed, muſt be ſought for among the lower claſs; in them are to be found the ſame coldneſs of conſtitution, with no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigoration than what beer, gin and tobacco give, which they take in great quantities. In them is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to be ſeen a rough booriſhneſs, which is not to be met with in other countries. The very loweſt of the people will not pay the leaſt mark of perſonal reſpect to the greateſt merchant: this is the effect of that equality which flows through a republic, and not mere liberty; for they are governed with three times the ſeverity in this country, that the lower people in England are.</p>
                  <p>The following anecdote will illuſtrate this. After the elector Palatine, King of Bohemia, who married the daughter of James I. and from whom the kings on the Britiſh throne are deſcended—after this king had been routed at the battle of Prague, he fled to Holland. This was in the year 1520, about forty years after the Dutch had thrown off the Spaniſh yoke, and when a ſpirit of equality had taken hold of the people in general; the king with ſome few attendants was out a courſing, and riding incautiouſly over a field that had juſt been ſowed, the farmer and
<figure>
                        <pb facs="tcp:0161700110:339"/>
                        <head>DUTCH LIBERTY.</head>
                     </figure>
                     <pb n="325" facs="tcp:0161700110:340"/>
one of his peaſants who had been threſhing in the barn, ſeeing the king riding on the land, quitted their work, and ran out to him with the utmoſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. "Hollo!" cried the farmer, who knew the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the king, "Hollo! you King of Bohemia,— what do you mean by riding over my land?"—The king more ſurpriſed than afraid, ſtopped his horſe, made an apology, and returned.</p>
                  <p>The lower ſort of Dutch have been reproached with being paſſionate, that they draw their knives on each other, and in their inſurrections are very barbarous; but this ſcarce ever happens but when they are too free in their uſe of gin.—We will now proceed to North Holland.</p>

                  <p>THIS forms a peninſula; it being almoſt ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the north and Zuyder ſeas, and is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected only by an iſthmus with South Holland.— They are both under one regency, called the States of Holland and Weſt-Frieſland, though the appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of Weſt-Frieſland belongs more properly to the northern part of this country.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="326" facs="tcp:0161700110:341"/>There are a great many very high dykes or ſand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hills in this part of Holland, but the other parts of the country lye very low. It was formerly over-run with waſhes or marſhes, but the perſevering inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants have drained them, and they are now very fine meadow grounds; though it is neceſſary to keep up a great number of wind-mills to carry off the waters occaſionally, which is attended with conſiderable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence.</p>
                  <p>Sardam, the town much viſited by ſtrangers, near Amſterdam, though a village, in neatneſs has not its equal in all Europe, and for the conſiderable trade that it carries on.</p>
                  <p>It is the principal place for ſhip-building in all the provinces; and when the Dutch navy was at the height of its proſperity, was noted for a ſaying, That if you gave the people ſix months notice, they could launch a man of war every day in the year.</p>
                  <p>Here are at preſent large magazines of timber, maſts, yards, cordage, ſails, anchors, cannon, and every thing neceſſary to build, rig and fit out, all ſorts of veſſels: but this place is not only noted for ſhip-building; there are a great many manufactures carried on here, particularly of aper; this being the moſt conſiderable paper manufactory in all the Netherlands, and employing above ſix hundred men, beſides women
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:0161700110:342"/>
and children; the men earn about ſeven ſhillings per week, on an average, but ſome of them get much more. Theſe wages ſeem to be about equal to thoſe given by the ſame manufactures in England, but living here is much dearer, which is compenſated by the ſuperior frugality and ſobriety of the Dutch.</p>
                  <p>The number of wind-mills at this place is aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. <hi>Buſching</hi> makes them to be no fewer than twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-three hundred.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe for ſawing timber to build their ſhips with, are admirable contrivances; they facilitate the work ſo much, that it is greatly to be regretted, that they are not imitated in England. Such a ſaw-mill indeed was erected ſome years ſince at Limehouſe, but the ſawyers who dreaded a loſs of employ, aroſe in a body, and pulled it down.</p>
                  <p>The Dutch have had them above 140 years, and yet in England they continue uſing the hand-ſaw, which is forty times the expence; the reaſon alledged is, if mills were generally introduced, a great number of ſawyers would at once be out of employ; but it is abſurd to ſuppoſe that ſuch ſtout and able men as faw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers could remain without work; and the cheapneſs of the manufactures uſing mills, would make the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption ſo much the greater, that all the hands de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent on them would be increaſed. This was found
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:0161700110:343"/>
to be the caſe in Holland, and particularly in Sardam; where the erecting ſaw-mills increaſed, as appears by authentic regiſters, the number of ſhip-wrights, in the proportion of twenty to one.</p>
                  <p>There are alſo many mills for grinding wood and colours, ſuch as the dyers uſe; and likewiſe a great number of powder-mills, of which there is a large ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactory carried on: all theſe mills make Sardam a very conſiderable place, and their ſtructure is ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly curious, that a ſtranger will find no greater entertainment any where in Holland, or ſtronger in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citements to reflection on the induſtry of the Dutch, and the great national benefit ariſing from their fruga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and their ingenious contrivances for lowering the prices of their manufactures, than in this village. This was the place in which the great <hi>Czar Peter</hi> worked as a common ſhip-wright, and the tools he uſed to work with, are ſtill ſhewn. It is about ſeven miles from Amſterdam.</p>
                  <p>Near Eidam is a track of country, of more than twenty miles in circumference, called Purmerend, the name of a lake which was here formerly, but which is now entirely drained, and covered with rich meadows. The ſoil is a rich, black loam, compoſed, to all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, of ſand and clay, but more like a ſlime ſettled; the graſs is admirably rich, but full of weeds, the Dutch having no notion of meadows well-laid
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:0161700110:344"/>
out; the luxuriance of the herbage is all that they attend to, in order to have (what is called in England) a great ſwarth of hay. Yet theſe meadows let from 40s. to 5l. an acre Engliſh.</p>
                  <p>This fertility ſhews what is to be expected from drained lakes. There is no inſtance of this in England; yet the moors in Huntingdon and Cambridgeſhire, and the lakes in Scotland, ſays <hi>Marſhal,</hi> would ſurely ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of this culture. Larger cows and ſheep than are to be met with here, are no where to be ſeen; theſe cows will give four or five gallons of milk, Engliſh meaſure, in a day; and the cheeſe and butter made from one of them, amounts to about eight pounds ſterling a-year.</p>
                  <p>This track of land is, on the whole, one of the greateſt curoſities in the United Provinces. It was drained in the year 1612, and the whole completely finiſhed in four years. The lake contained 10,000 acres, of which 7,000 are now made profitable as meadows, orchards, or gardens; the remaining 3,000 compoſe villages, roads, dykes, canals, drains, &amp;c. The appearance is as beautiful as that of a dead flat can be; the verdure is fine; the fences perfectly neat, the rows of trees, the orc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ards and the gardens nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and thriving; in ſhort, a richer ſpot is hardly to be ſeen. The rents are very high, but the fertility of the ſoil merits it; for here are many meadows that
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:0161700110:345"/>
will more than feed a large cow, per acre, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port her all the ſummer with great plenty.</p>
                  <p>A Dutch boor, with fifty or ſixty acres, will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive to live as well or better than an Engliſh far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer with two hundred acres; this is entirely owing to their ſpirit of frugality and neatneſs. It is not only viſible in their houſes and furniture, but in all their farming offices. Their tools and implements are kept in the moſt exact order; their ſcythes, ſpades, ſhovels and forks appear like houſehold inſtruments: their waggons are conſtantly kept as clean as our coaches, and this ſpirit of cleanlineſs runs through every thing. Though this certainly takes up time, it anſwers to them very well in the end; for there is a great difference in the wear and tare of any tools or inſtruments of huſbandry, whether they are kept clean and under cover, or dirty and expoſed to the weather: from which I conclude, ſays <hi>Marſhal,</hi> that no time is better ſpent than that which is employed in keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the implements, and every thing relative to huſbandry, neat and clean.</p>
                  <p>This is particularly obſervable in Holland, not only in their implements of huſbandry, but in their cattle, their fences, the banks of their ditches, their dykes, their walls, poles, hedges, &amp;c. whatever the fence is, one is ſure to find it in good order; and this is
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:0161700110:346"/>
equally conſpicuous in all their public works; the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, bridges, dykes, &amp;c. are all in admirable repair.</p>
                  <p>So great is the economy of the Dutch, and ſo much do they live within their income, that they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver know the want of money; being thus rich, they will contribute as freely to the erection or repair of a publick building, as to the fences in their own gardens.</p>
                  <p>Next to Sardam, the village of Broek is one of the moſt curious in Holland, as well as the moſt conſiderable. The extreme neatneſs which reigns there, is unexampled even in the reſt of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces. The inhabitants are very rich, and ſome of them can give their daughters ſeveral tons of gold for their portion. The houſes here are all built of timber, and ſeldom exceed one ſtory high. They are ſo frequently painted, that they always look as if they were juſt built. The windows are in general ſaſhed and decorated with beautiful curtains. The inſide alſo of their houſes is neat, and embelliſhed beyond conception. Thoſe who have ever ſo ſmall a portion of ground before their houſe, never fail to convert it into an agreeable garden diverſified with gravel walks, ſhell-work, images, and little hegdes or painted rails. The village itſelf is watered by a number of canals, the banks of which are kept up with the greateſt neatneſs; and all the ſtreets
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:0161700110:347"/>
are paved with bricks, which are kept frequently waſhed and ſtrewed with white ſand; in ſome places the bricks are diſperſed in the form of flowers. That theſe ornaments may not be defaced, or the ſtreets made dirty, no carriages or horſes are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to paſs through them. There is but one public houſe at the entrance of the village, and which is the only one that ſtrangers are admitted to ſee, if they have no acquaintance among the inhabitants. When any ſtrangers come there, they are ſo jealous at the ſight of them, that thoſe who have daughters, who are in general very handſome, make them keep out of ſight.</p>
                  <p>Not only the wooden furniture in the houſes are painted to the very broom-ſticks, but likewiſe the gates and rails in the meadows, and even the very poſts in the meadows, the latter of which are fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ornamented with carved work.</p>
                  <p>At Alamaar, which is the chief town in North Holland, there is a very ſingular charity. A con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable eſtate has been left for the ſupport of old maids and widows, no matter of what religion, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided they will take an oath never to marry. This city is ſurrounded by a great number of gardens, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chards and rich meadows; and very near it there is a grove, which would make a figure in the beſt regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar garden in England, it is ſo beautiful. The ſtreets
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:0161700110:348"/>
of this city are regular and well built, and the large canals kept ſo clean, that they give the town an elegant appearance. In 1732 it was found to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain 2,581 houſes. Both within and without the town are ſeveral pleaſant walks, particularly on the ramparts. It was once one of the fortreſſes of Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. The country round about it once conſiſted of lakes, which have been all drained, and now make an excellent appearance, being all cut into rich mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, and hardly an acre loſt. All the canals and dykes are planted with rows of trees; the villages are thick and well peopled, and all of them poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing an air of neatneſs and regularity, which alone would make travelling in Holland extremely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful.</p>
                  <p>The road from this place to Bemſter, in ſummer is very pleaſant. At the end of the town begins a ſtraight viſta, which continues for three miles. In the middle of this viſta there is a wide canal, and on each ſide a road perfectly level and ſmooth, with a row of trees, and a ditch running along the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide; both of which are bordered with the fineſt mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, interſperſed with ſeats and gardens. Every cottage has a garden which the boors cultivate ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely well. The women and children are princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally employed in making nets for the herring fiſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which employs a great number of hands in this country.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="334" facs="tcp:0161700110:349"/>It is aſtoniſhing that the number of people whom this fiſhery maintains, ſhould not have made us, on whoſe coaſts they come to fiſh, more attentive to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages which nature has laid at our doors. Our poor are ſtarving for want of employment, while our more induſtrious and meritorious neighbours maintain them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves on our fiſh, and come 200 leagues to catch that which we might have in our own harbours. Such an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of ſupineneſs is not to be met with in the whole circle of European politics. The infinite advantages which would attend the eſtabliſhment of a great herring fiſhery, in ſome of the weſtern iſles of Scotland, ought to engage our government to act with more vigour in this affair. The only poſſible way of ſucceeding, would be, to build a town in the weſtern Iſlands, and make it the ſeat of the whole undertaking: the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany ſhould, above all, be careful to provide an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate market for all the fiſh caught, ſalted, and barrelled, under their inſpection. When once the fiſhermen found a market for their fiſh, their profeſſion would increaſe very much; new towns would riſe up, and a general alacrity ſpread itſelf through all the coaſts. This would form new markets for all the productions of the neighbouring eſtates, which would animate their culture, and greatly increaſe the value of land; all this is in the power not only of the King and Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but of any nobleman of conſiderable property in the iſlands: a private capital of 20,000l. would go
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:0161700110:350"/>
further than five times that ſum in the hands of a public company.</p>
                  <p>In Holland, what with pay, allowance, and herrings, the men who go in the buſſes gain about twelve ſhillings a-week.</p>
                  <p>On the coaſt of this province are ſeveral iſlands, which formerly made part of the continent, and have been ſeparated from it by the violence of the ſea. The inhabitants of theſe iſlands make excellent mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, whether conſidered with reſpect to their courage, or their ſkill.</p>
                  <p>One great occupation among them is breeding of ſheep, with which their fields are covered. They ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly export a great deal of wool; and with the milk of theſe animals they make a green cheeſe, which is eagerly bought up under the name of Texel cheeſe.</p>
                  <p>The moſt conſiderable of theſe iſlands is the Texel, which moſt probably received its name from the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of eggs, which the ſea-gulls lay on its ſhores: it is the largeſt of all the iſlands in this track.</p>
                  <p>On the eaſtern coaſt there is a commodious road, ſtyled the <hi>Moſco Road,</hi> which is the rendezvous of all the outward bound Eaſt-India ſhips, who lye here under the cannon of a fort, cloſe erected by the Scheld. At

this place they are alſo muſtered while they wait for an eaſterly wind, to carry them out of the Marſdiep, during which time they are uſually ſaid to be lying in the Texel.</p>
                  <p>This is the principal paſſage for ſhips that come from Amſterdam, or the Zuyderſea into the ocean. It is however a very dangerous one, on account of two ſand-banks which lye at the entrance, particularly in bad weather or with a contrary wind.</p>
                  <p>On the 13th of July 1672, the Engliſh fleet under the Duke of York, came off this iſland, as with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to make a deſcent; but the ebb which uſed to laſt only ſix hours, continuing in a very extraordinary manner for twelve, and being ſucceeded by a ſtorm, the Engliſh were under the neceſſity of putting out to ſea, after loſing two of their ſhips. In 1653, and 1673, there were two naval engagements here, in the firſt of which the celebrated Dutch Admiral <hi>Van Trump</hi> was killed.</p>
                  <p>At the entrance of the water, going up to Amſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, there are two other ſand banks, where it is ſo very ſhallow, that the ſhips are obliged to be carried over them in cradles or camels, which are a kind of large boxes, 160 feet in length, filled with water, and faſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ropes under the ſide of the ſhips; the water is then drawn out of theſe machines, which as they

riſe towards the ſurface, lift the ſhips up four, five or ſix feet, according to the more or leſs water they draw.</p>
