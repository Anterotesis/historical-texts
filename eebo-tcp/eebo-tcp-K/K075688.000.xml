            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Upon theſe accounts, the <hi>eaſtera Aſtatics</hi> are weak, timorous, and ſervile, eaſily ſlid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into monarchies: With reluctance they leave their eaſe and families, and hazard their lives for deſpotic maſters. On the other hand, in <hi>Greece,</hi> and the <hi>northern</hi> parts of Aſia, where the temperature of the ſeaſons is leſs mild, and leſs uniform, the men are bold, hardy, and warlike: Without compulſion they quit their eaſe, and voluntarily expoſe themſelves to toil and danger, animated with the hopes, and rewarded with the fruits, of conqueſt.</p>
                  <p>In countries abounding with certain mines, travellers find the frame and temper of their minds ſuddenly altered; their intellectual faculties more ſprightly and vigorous, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions clearer, imagination more briſk and lively; and on paſſing to another ſoil, an univerſal relaxation, idea, gloomy, confuſed, and indiſtinct, immediately ſucceed. Thus, conſonant to the philoſophic notions of the DIVINE OLD MAN, the diſcovery, and improvement, of arts and ſciences may, in ſome meaſure, depend upon the air and climate; ſome ſucceeding beſt, where a ſprightlineſs of fancy, others, where intenſe application of mind, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired.</p>
                  <p>In a <hi>medicinal</hi> intention, the <hi>vivifying ſpirit</hi> of pure, freſh air is admirable: In acute diſeaſes of the <hi>putrid</hi> and <hi>epidemic</hi> kind, millions of lives have been loſt for want of it.</p>
                  <p>In a <hi>pharmaceutic</hi> intention, air, or the humid part of it, acts as a true diſſolvent, in the ſame manner as water in its groſſer form. The cathartic and aſtringent virtues of certain vegetables neither volatile nor exhalable by heat, but of the fixed kind and diſſoluble by <hi>menſtrua</hi> alone, have been obſerved to be diffuſed through the air. Hence it appears, that the atmoſphere may be impregnated with all the medicinal powers of vegetables which <hi>aqueous menſtrua</hi> are capable of extracting. And upon this account it is, that, in ſtanding, walking, or ſleeping, under ſeveral kind of trees, people have found themſelves variouſly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected.</p>
                  <p>The peculiar medicinal powers of certain vegetables <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halable by heat,</hi> are, by the bye, equally remarkable and curious. In obſtinate watchings, and deliriums, the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor has, by the ſteams of one of this kind, procured eaſe, reſt, and ſleep, after all the uſual internal ſedative medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines had been tried in vain.</p>
                  <p>In acute diſeaſes of the malignant kind, where ſweating was indicated, but could not be procured by any internal means, the effluvia of a vegetable, applied in a certain manner to the external ſurface of the body, have proved an efficacious ſudorific.</p>
                  <p>From a variety of ſimilar experiments, and certain ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations on the oeconomy of Nature, reſpecting cuticular inhalations, a phyſiological conjecture is drawn, namely, that the human body is endued with ſome ſecret energetic power of attracting ſuch ſalutary particles as it may be in immediate need of, from ſurrounding bodies which contain them.—Hence, old perſons, and thoſe whom long and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious indiſpoſitions had brought to the laſt ſtage of life, have, by the effluvia of young, ſound, and healthy ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, been ſurprizingly recruited, ſtrengthened, and invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorated.</p>
                  <p>In Perſia, Arabia, and other eaſtern countries, at cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſeaſons of the year, the people are obliged, by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive heat of the weather, to lie down at night to ſleep, on the tops of their houſes, in balconies, turrets, &amp;c. ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the open air, and dews, which are ſo copious, notwithſtanding the exceſſive heat, during the time of ſleep, that the body is cooled, preſerved from thirſt, and refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by its abſorbent power of attracting or inhaling the dews; provided there be any perceivable ſaltneſs in the taſte of thoſe dews: On the contrary, if the dews have not a ſaline taſte, it is then found dangerous to ſleep in the open air, and frequently attended with pernicious, and ſometimes fatal conſequences.</p>

Being deſirous to adviſe her better, for I thought ſhe was not acquainted with the herb, and might miſtake it for a ſpecies of the geranium or crane's-bill, call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed gratia Dei, which it greatly reſembles; I intreated her, in a very ſerious manner, not to deſtroy herſelf by eating a moſt deadly poiſon. She ſmiled at my apprehenſions for her, and told me that ſhe was very well aſſured of being right in her choice of the herb, and that ſhe with the reſt of her neighbours had eaten of it for a great many years. I went to her cottage, where ſhe cut the plant ſhe had ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered into ſmall ſhreds, and boiled it with a little piece of fat meat, and made a ſoup with the ingredients, on which herſelf, her huſband, two children, and an old woman, made an hearty meal; and, what I own greatly ſurprized me, without any damage or bad conſequence.

                  <p>Notwithſtanding this remarkable inſtance of the harmleſs effects of the leaves of this plant when young and tender, it appears from the real experiments made by Matthiolus up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on condemned malefactors with its <hi>root alone,</hi> that the fatal effects of it could not be prevented by any antidotes he was acquainted with. —The moſt effectual <hi>corrector</hi> of vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table poiſons in general the writer has yet found out, in the courſe of his experiments, is a pure vegetable acid, or vinegar of wood; the proceſs for obtaining which was ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally publiſhed by Glauber, (an ingenious chymiſt, but a wretched philoſopher) in the firſt part of his <hi>Philoſophical Furnaces,</hi> where he ſhews profeſſedly how to diſtil an acid ſpirit or vinegar from all vegetables, in great quantity, and at a ſmall expence.</p>

               </gap>) above eighteen hundred years ago<note n="*" place="bottom">The very learned and ingenious Dr. Middleton, in his 'Diſſertation on the ſtate of phyſicians among the old Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,' makes Aſclepiades cotemporary with Cicero; who, in his firſt dialogue <hi>de Oratore,</hi> introduceth Lucius Craſſus ſpeaking of him as his intimate friend and phyſician—"Neque vero Aſclepiades, is, ſays he, quo nos medico amicoque uſi ſumus, tum, cum eloquentia vincebat caete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ros medicos, in eo ipſo quod ornate dicebat, medicinae fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultate utebatur, non eloquentiae."—He likewiſe aſſerts, that when Aſclepiades came firſt to Rome, he knew nothing of phyſic; contrary to the expreſs teſtimony of Caelius Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relianus, Oribaſius, and other authentic documents, from which it plainly appears, that he practiſed phyſic at Parium, and other cities bordering upon the Helleſpont, and even at Athens, (where we find him treated with particular marks of diſtinction by the celebrated philoſopher Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus Academicus, afterwards preceptor to Cicero) long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſettled at Rome. The Doctor's other aſſertion, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting the friendſhip and intimacy between Aſclepiades and Cicero, includes a manifeſt anachroniſm, really ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing in ſo great a critic, more eſpecially in one who has elſewhere given ſuch ample proofs of his knowledge in the biographical hiſtory of thoſe times; and what adds to our wonder on this occaſion is, that he quotes the above paſſage from Cicero's <hi>Orator</hi> in ſupport of it: But whoever will be at the trouble of comparing the genuine memoirs anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity has given of the life, ſocial connexions, and death, of L.

He firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented the <hi>lecti penſiles,</hi> or hanging beds, in which the ſick might, with great facility, be rocked to ſleep. Theſe anodyne machines of his took prodigiouſly: Many of his noble patients had them made of ſilver; and they after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards became a conſiderable part of the Roman luxury.
<p>Notwithſtanding the boundleſs ſtrife of opinions that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily attended phyſic after the death of its great parent <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> the ancient pharmacy ſtill preſerved its foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in ſome degree, as likewiſe the Hippocratic doctrine, till this <hi>arch-craftſman</hi> of the profeſſion had the cunning and addreſs to demoliſh the whole, calling it, in deriſion, 'a meditation upon death.'—He made the whole <hi>materia medica</hi> to conſiſt only of ſuch things as would give eaſe, and exhilerate the ſpirits of the patient: Nay, in certain caſes he adminiſtered to the luxury of his patients, and indulged them in the uſe of wine, even to intoxication. This flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering of the palate, in conjunction with his new amuſive inventions, and a lucky accident of his diſcovering ſome ſigns of life in a man that was carrying to be buried, whom he ſoon recovered, and whom the people were perſuaded to believe he had raiſed from the dead, conſpired to make him the ſupreme archiater of thoſe times; and what ſtill farther contributed to eſtabliſh him in this elevated ſtation, was his having publicly challenged the Fates, by conſtantly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring that he ſhould never be viſited by any bodily di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper. Nay, Pliny the hiſtorian informs us, he held diſeaſes and prematurity of death ſo much in defiance, that he would frequently, amongſt his acquaintances, offer to lay any wager, and even to ſtake his whole fortune, that he ſhould never be ſick, as in fact he never was, not even at the time of his death; for that he broke his neck by a fall down a pair of ſtairs.</p>

<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0029500600:37"/>ſpecious, however recommended, by the ſanction of antiquity, and the later authority of
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0029500600:38"/>great names, has always appeared to the author unſupported by Reaſon and FACTS.—The moſt plauſible argument he has met with, in favour of this <hi>theory,</hi> is, that in acute diſeaſes of the eruptive kind, and particularly in the <hi>ſmall-pox,</hi> 'as ſoon as the morbific matter is expelled to the ſurface of the body, the fever ceaſes:" therefore, 'the fever is an effort of NATURE to relieve herſelf.' But it is well known to every experienced practitioner, that the leſs the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0029500600:39"/>fever is in the natural ſmall-pox, the fewer will be the puſtules, and the variolous matter more happily expelled; or, according to our great <hi>Sydenbam, [Angliae lumen, artis Phaebum]</hi> "Quo ſedatior eſt ſanguis eo melius erumpent puſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulae."</p>
            <p>It has indeed been a received opinion, almoſt ever ſince the firſt appearance of the ſmall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pox<note n="*" place="bottom">The ſmall-pox was firſt deſcribed, and treated of by <hi>Aaron</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> in his <hi>Pandects of phyſic,</hi> which he publiſhed about the middle of the <hi>ſeventh century,</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Haly Abbas</hi>'s account. But as the original works of this author, in the Syriac tongue, and the Arabic tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them by Maſerjawaihus, are both loſt, and nothing of them now remains, but ſome extracts, which <hi>Mohamed Rhazes</hi> has left us in his <hi>Continens;</hi> we have no certain ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count extant of the preciſe aera of this diſeaſe, nor in what country it firſt appeared. The moſt probable opinion is, that it had its riſe in <hi>Arabia Faelix,</hi> and was brought from thence to <hi>Alexandria</hi> by the <hi>Arabs,</hi> when they took that city, A. D. 640, in the reign of <hi>Omar Ebnol Chatab,</hi> the ſecond ſucceſſor to <hi>Mohamed:</hi> For <hi>Paulus</hi> of <hi>Aegina,</hi> who lived at <hi>Alexandria</hi> about <hi>twenty years</hi> before, makes no mention of it in his works; though he aſſures us, in his preface, that he had treated of every diſeaſe <hi>then</hi> known.

            <p>The moſt diſtinguiſhed ancient phyſicians of the <hi>Hippocratic</hi> ſchool, had no other <hi>idea</hi> of a fever than <hi>that</hi> of their great maſter—viz. a <hi>fiery</hi> or <hi>preternatural heat.</hi> This preternatural heat they conceived of, as a <hi>ſymptom,</hi> the cure of which was the province of the phyſician; whilſt the removing, and carrying off, the <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary cauſe</hi> of this ſymptom, that is, the cure of the <hi>diſeaſe,</hi> was conſidered chiefly as the work of NATURE. Now, the <hi>primary cauſe</hi> of every fever is, as the author conceives, ſome <hi>ſtimulant or acrid matter ſpaſmodically affecting the vaſcular and nervous ſyſtem:</hi> Whether this matter be, 1ſt.

               <note n="*" place="bottom">The doctrine of perſpiration, though it owes its name, and preſent eſtabliſhment, to Sanctorius, was not unknown to the ancient Greek phyſicians. <hi>Hippocrates</hi> believed all the ſurfaces of the parts of a human body, as well thoſe of the muſcles and viſcera, as of the ſkin, to be naturally in a continual ſtate of perſpiration.—The following remarkable obſervation is <hi>Galen</hi>'s (<hi>Lib.</hi> 6. <hi>de tuenda ſanitate</hi>) "Proſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciendum eſt, ut eorum quae eduntur et bibuntur, reſpectu eorum quae expelluntur, conveniens mediocritas ſervetur: Sane is modus ſervabitur, ſi ponderabitur a nobis in utriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que quantitas."
<p>From this paſſage in Galen, Sanctorius undoubtedly took the firſt hint of his <hi>ſtatical</hi> experiments for aſcertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the daily waſte of the animal fluids, made by the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets of the external ſuperficies of the body, and by the lungs: But it is impoſſible to aſcertain the quantity of this waſte, without knowing, at the ſame time, the quantity of moiſture, &amp;c. abſorbed or imbibed by the pores of the ſkin and lungs; <hi>which Sanctorius did not advert to:</hi> For the author of this, after violent exerciſe in riding, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding a great expence of perſpirable matter, and no food taken, has, in certain conſtitutions of the air and atmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphere, facilitating the <hi>cutaneous immiſſions,</hi> often found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, by moſt exact ſtatical experiments, many ounces, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times twenty and upwards heavier than he was before. Hence it appears, that all we can with certainty diſcover, reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the quantity of <hi>ſanctorian</hi> perſpiration, by experiments of this kind, is, the difference between the <hi>exhalata</hi> and the <hi>inhalata,</hi> that is, between the perſpirable matter we exhale from the pores of the ſkin and lungs, and whatever we imbibe or inhale through the ſame: For exhalation and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halation ſo confound each other as to render it impoſſible to aſcertain the exact quantity of either; as the author pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, in a ſhort time, to demonſtrate more at large to the medical reader.</p>

'Tis the want of a right conception of a <hi>habit</hi> that has oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned the abuſe and neglect of this ſovereign <hi>preventive</hi> of diſeaſes, as well as <hi>common aid</hi> to phyſic.—By continual dropping, even ſo ſoft a body as water can act upon a ſtone; by inceſſantly purſuing his blow, the ſmith can bring heat into his bar of iron: The act itſelf, ſimply conſidered, is weak and trifling; but the habit is of wonderful efficacy. —'By temperance, and a ſingular perſeverance in the virtuous toil of martial exerciſes,' <hi>Socrates</hi> (the light and glory of the heathen world) is ſaid to have acquired a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution ſuperior to the inclemency of the elements, and to the attacks of diſeaſe; ſtriking inſtances of which we find recorded by <hi>Plato (Conviv.</hi> and <hi>Phaed.</hi> where it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that he had brought himſelf, by the force of habit, to uſe the ſame cloathing, and to go barefooted, all the year round), by <hi>Diogenes Laertius</hi> in his life of that prince of philoſophers, and by <hi>Aelian</hi> in his <hi>various hiſtory:</hi> The following is one of them—"When an almoſt univerſal peſtilence had ſeized upon the camp, at the ſiege of <hi>Poti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daea,</hi> inſomuch that eleven hundred men in the army were carried off, and <hi>Athens</hi> was half depopulated, by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion, he eſcaped the diſtemper in both places, and was the only one, before <hi>Potidaea,</hi> who, during the two years blockade of that city, did not in ſome meaſure feel the ſeverity of it [<gap reason="foreign">

            <p>On this preſervative branch of medicine, and particularly on the <hi>dietetic</hi> part of it, a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of books have been written; many of them by phyſicians of eminence, with a ſpirit of phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanthropy that does honour to the profeſſion. But, as thoſe productions conſiſt chiefly of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral rules laid down for mankind without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction, to preſerve their health, and prolong their lives, they have not proved in any degree adequate to the propoſed end: For, ſo infinite is the variety of conſtitutions, (in reſpect of which all food acts, by a certain immutable law of Nature, <hi>relatively &amp; ſecundum quid,</hi> as logi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians expreſs it, not <hi>abſolutely &amp; per ſe</hi>) that any general rule laid down to any number of men, for this purpoſe, muſt be hurtful or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to the greateſt part of them at leaſt,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0029500600:46"/>if they all comply with it. Happily for man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, all the needful directions, on this head, <hi>univerſally</hi> conducive to health and long life, may be comprized in a very ſmall compaſs, without overloading the memory, or confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the judgment.—If people would only follow the dictates of that moſt beneficent of all legiſlators, Nature, by letting the ſtomach <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways</hi> take the lead of the palate, and by feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moderately upon ſuch things as they find they can digeſt with the leaſt trouble and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience<note n="*" place="bottom">

            <p>As for thoſe whimſical hypocondriacs who, like their brain-ſick brother in the comedy of <hi>Moliere,</hi> are eternally making an outcry, tho' nothing ails them, and thoſe more eſpecially who have been perſuaded to purchaſe health and longevity by eating and drinking exactly by weight and meaſure, as if they could ſupply the various and alterable exigences of Nature juſt as they fill a tub, the capacity and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charges
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0029500600:47"/>of which are always uniform and the ſame; they are in imminent danger of falling into the doctors hands<note n="*" place="bottom">It would ſeem, that this ſort of <gap reason="foreign">

He farther informs us, that his two ſons, Podalirius and Machaon, were of the ſame opinion, and maintained, "that phyſic was not made for <hi>ſuch people,</hi> and that it was not their duty to preſcribe for them, even though they were as rich as Midas!!"</note>. An oeconomiſt of this ſort might, with equal propriety, impoſe upon himſelf the critical taſk of ſtanding or ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting continually in the ſame place, of lying al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in the ſame bed, of wearing conſtantly the ſame weight of cloaths, and of riding or walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every day preciſely the ſame number of feet and inches; nay farther, he muſt compound with Providence for continual wet weather, or continual dry, for the ſame immutable degree of heat and cold, and the ſame invariable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the air in which he breathes: For 'tis certain that all theſe may, ſome way or other, affect the conſtitution, appetite, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion, ſo as to require ſometimes larger, and
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0029500600:48"/>ſometimes more ſparing meals, and the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſional uſe of weaker or ſtronger liquors.</p>
            <p>In general, the beſt rule, perhaps, that can be laid down, for preſerving health, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing life, is (what the moſt elegant <hi>Celſus</hi> recommended to the world ſixteen hundred years ago) <hi>to obſerve ſtrictly no particular rule at all;</hi> but, upon the rational principle of mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and temperance <hi>[noverca medicorum],</hi> to follow the ſober dictates of Nature; who has not ordained a ſingle want to man, the <hi>reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> ſatisfaction of which, (beſides its manifeſt ſubſerviency to health) does not afford a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure every way ſuperior to what can be found in any unnatural gratification of the appetities: For true pleaſure is the bounty of Nature, and Reaſon her diſpenſer of it.</p>
            <p>To conclude—In ſpite of all the falſe refine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of art, the true ſublime of taſte, and the ſweet ſimplicity of Nature, will for ever continue inſeparable. In <hi>diet,</hi> SHE is ſo far from objecting to <hi>variety,</hi> that ſhe delights in it: Her proteſt is only againſt <hi>that,</hi> which is produced by the deſtruction of <hi>Simplicity;</hi> againſt <hi>that,</hi> by which the <hi>palate</hi> is debauched from its natural taſte, the <hi>appetite</hi> irrecoverably depreſſed through the cloying repetition of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventive viands<note n="*" place="bottom">

            <p>ONE of the moſt troubleſome and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate complaints, to which chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are liable, is the HOOPING COUGH. The methods of treating it hitherto in uſe, have generally been found ineffectual to ſtop its progreſs, or to ſuppreſs it with ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, before it hath run its natural courſe.—</p>
            <p>OUR great maſter in phyſic, DR. SYDEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>HAM, in his account of it ſays—"What others may be able to do in this diſeaſe, I know not: as for myſelf, I have uſed abundance of all ſorts of medicines, and ſtill loſt my labour."</p>
            <p>THE author of the foregoing diſcourſe, whoſe practice is much among children, therefore informs the public, that by a long ſeries of experimental inquiries into the nature and cauſes of the diſeaſes of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in general, and of this hitherto in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractable, and frequently fatal one in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, he has diſcovered a ſafe and eaſy method of treating it with ſucceſs.</p>
