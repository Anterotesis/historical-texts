            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE</head>
            <head type="sub">Extract from the PUBLIC ADVERTISER of Monday, November 22, 1773.</head>
            <q rend="inline normQuotes">
               <p>ON Saturday laſt, a new comedy, called the Duelliſt, was performed, for the firſt time, at Covent-Garden Theatre. Previous to the curtain being drawn up, the following written hand-bill was diſperſed about the houſe.</p>
               <q>Mr. Macklin has been purſued by a malicious party to ſuch a pitch of rancour, that at laſt they have ſucceeded ſo far in their curſed deſigns, as to get him diſcharged this Theatre, and thereby have deprived him of the means of a livelihood : There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if the Public have any ſpirit, they will not ſuffer the new play to begin till Mr. Colman pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes that Mr. Macklin ſhall be engaged again.</q>
               <p>This hand-bill found its way into the Green-Room, and had a very viſible effect on the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers, as was plainly evident from their confuſion. The piece was received with great marks of appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, and given out again for Monday, which was attended with ſome hiſſing, but that was greatly overpowered by the general applauſe of the audience. The overture to <hi>Thomas and Sally</hi> being attended to with ſilence, the greateſt part of the Author's Friends, quitted the Theatre ; which being taken advantage
<pb facs="tcp:0601100500:4"/>
of by a party in the gallery, a riot enſued ; and the entertainment was not ſuffered to go on till another play was given out for Monday.</p>
            </q>
            <p>To the above conciſe relation of the circumſtances attending the repreſentation of the following Comedy (as it is given by one of the moſt reſpectable of our diurnal hiſtorians) the Author of the Duelliſt makes no exception or addition. He would be wanting, however, in that reſpect, which he has ever profeſſed and ſhewn for the public opinion, did he not endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to obviate ſome objections that have been made to his Piece, and to account, as well as he is able, for the unprecedented ſeverity of its treatment.</p>
            <p>As to the author's pretenſions to merit in this ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of writing, it is not for him to boaſt, were there cauſe for boaſting. Becauſe, ſenſible of the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a dramatic writer's making the theatre the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant ſcene of his obſervation, he can without morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication admit that an author, whoſe ſtudy is the ſtage, bids fairer for ſucceſs on it than another, who, engaged at a diſtance in more ſcientific reſearches, makes its amuſements only his occaſional relaxation from ſeverer and more laborious purſuits. Not that he is without reaſon to be flattered with the applauſe his performance met with in repreſentation ; though, were it otherwiſe, he ſhould not have the vanity to copy after a Corneille, who, in the preface to his Pertharite, which was univerſally condemned, avows boldly, that in ſpite of cenſure his play was a good one and well written. He would have confidence
<pb facs="tcp:0601100500:5"/>
enough, however, in imitation of as great a writer of our own country, to declare, with Dryden, that the town "had received with applauſe, as bad and as uncorrect plays from other men." As a writer by profeſſion, therefore, whoſe family depends on his induſtry, he conceives it not only prudential in him to convert his amuſements to profit, but that he has a right to expect the theatres ſhould be as open to receive his productions as thoſe of others. It is true, he has not found it ſo, and is ſingularly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucky in having his pieces performed with impartial applauſe, and then partially baniſhed the ſtage. He is not aſhamed to declare he writes plays not from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination but from expediency : the object in his view being not dramatic reputation but theatrical emolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ; to which, while he writes no worſe than others (which can hardly be) though it ſhould not be allowed he writes better, he preſumes he is equally entitled.</p>
            <p>To account for his diſappointment in the preſent inſtance will not be difficult. Some juſt exceptions may be made to the piece itſelf : the ſcene between the lawyers in the fourth act appeared too long ; in deference however to the opinion of Mr. Colman, who thought its effect would depend greatly on the action, it was riſked, and is here printed at length.</p>
            <p>As to the paſſage objected to, on account of its ſuppoſed indelicacy, it is entirely omitted. The author muſt do Mr. Colman, alſo the juſtice to ſay, that he conſtantly excepted againſt it, and had his
<pb facs="tcp:0601100500:6"/>
more cautious judgement been attended to, it would have been omitted in the repreſentation.</p>
            <p>Another exception has been made to the whole of the repreſentation, on account of the confuſion, I might ſay diſtreſs, of ſome of the performers. But if the circumſtances that cauſed it be attended to, ſuch performers were ſo far from being the objects of reprehenſion for playing ill, that it is a wonder they acquitted themſelves ſo well.</p>
            <p>To Mr. Macklin the author has nothing, nor ever will have any thing, farther to ſay, than that he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes the ill ſucceſs of this unfortunate comedy whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to that performer's reſentment againſt the mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, for having diſcharged him the theatre ; as it was doubtleſs their duty to do at the requiſition of the the majority of an audience. That ill-ſucceſs, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed has been imputed to cauſes, which to admit, would be to caſt an injurious reflection on perſons, who, the author is well perſuaded, by no means de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it.</p>
            <p>It has been ſaid that the gentlemen of the law took offence at the liberties taken with their profeſſion and practice, in the characters and dialogue of Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more and Nonplus. They muſt have too much knowledge and good ſenſe, however, to be ſeriouſly offended at what was deſigned as a mere laugh on the ſtage, or a ſatire on what the beſt of them regret as much as their clients, without having it in their power to remedy it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:0601100500:7"/>A club of bookſellers and a crew of authors are ſaid to have formed a formidable phalanx of oppoſition. The writer doubts not the good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions of both ; he has endeavoured to ſerve the cauſe of literature too much, to have the good will of thoſe, who are labouring, by every poſſible means, to ruin it. What injury either party might do him in the theatre, the author knows not ; but the ſcribblers have ſhewn ſo little diſcretion in the zeal to abuſe him from the preſs, that he gives them hearty thanks for the ſervice they have unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignedly done him.</p>
            <p>With reſpect to Individuals it has been miſtaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or perhaps maliciouſly, propagated that the piece was calculated to ridicule perſons or charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, for whom the author has either the greateſt reſpect, or to whom he is an entire ſtranger. They who read Mr. Fielding's Amelia will ſee from what ſource the author has drawn ſome of the principal characters and incidents. As the reſt of the piece is original, the candid muſt alſo admit that he has made no greater uſe of that writer than dramatic authors have ever been allowed to do with novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts, from the practice of Shakeſpear to that of Mr. Colman.</p>
            <p>It has been ſuggeſted, that Mr. Garrick had pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately planted a party in the houſe to oppoſe the performance. This the author cannot believe ; as, having long ſince declared himſelf that gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's open and avowed enemy, he cannot, after
<pb facs="tcp:0601100500:8"/>
what has publickly paſſed between them, think ſo meanly even of Mr. Garrick as to ſuppoſe he would act otherwiſe than as an enemy equally open and avowed.</p>
            <p>It has even been ſaid that the friends of a certain dramatiſt, whoſe name the author forbears to mention, as it is diſguſting to the remembrance of his friends, were powerful in the oppoſition. On this head he will only give a little anecdote, as it was related to him by an auditor, who ſat in the Boxes.</p>
            <p>"During the tumult in the theatre about the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition of the Duelliſt, a Lady who aſked a thing that had the appearance of a gentleman, what was the reaſon of it, was anſwered that "the <hi>Man</hi> (meaning the author) was obnoxious and therefore his piece muſt be condemned." "Yes, madam," added a gentleman who ſat by, "There are a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of animals in this town, to whom the <hi>ſpirit</hi> of a MAN is as <hi>obnoxious</hi> as the <hi>perſon</hi> of a WOMAN."—May the author of the Duelliſt be ever obnoxious to ſuch Critics.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, it has been urged, that the Author had not friends enough in the houſe to ſupport the piece. If by this is meant that the piece had not merit enough to make itſelf friends, it is falſe, as appears from the above-cited relation. While its friends remained in the houſe, it was applauded by a great majority ; but, when a conſiderable number of theſe went away, and their places were ſupplied by riotous partizans,
<pb facs="tcp:0601100500:9"/>
who could not before get into the houſe and had not ſeen it, it is no wonder that both the piece and the author ſhould fatally feel the want of friends.</p>
            <p>If this want, on the other hand, be imputed to the Author's neglect of introducing people into the theatre, to influence the judgment of the impartial part of the audience in his favour, he takes a pride in having ever paid in this reſpect a proper defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the Public ; whom he ſhould think he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted, had he acted otherwiſe, and made <hi>perſonal intereſt</hi> to ſupport his pretenſions to <hi>literary merit.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <l>Too proud to beg, too modeſt to demand,</l>
               <l>By merit only would he fall or ſtand ;</l>
               <l>Nor enmity, nor friendſhip interfering,</l>
               <l>He only aſks a fair and candid hearing.</l>
               <bibl>Prol. to the Widow'd Wife.</bibl>
            </q>
            <p>This indeed is cruelly denied him, by the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of his play ; but he hopes will not be ſo on a future occaſion ; the Author having another piece accepted at the ſame theatre ; the parts of which being already written out, and the whole ready for rehearſal, he doubts not the Manager will give him an early opportunity of repairing the loſs, attending his preſent diſappointment : Indeed he ſtill places ſo much confidence on the juſtice and generoſity of the Public, as to ſlatter himſelf he ſhall not ultimately ſuffer by truſting, without party or cabal, to the candour and impartiality of his Auditors.</p>

                     <p>Really, George, your ſituation is ſo critical that I am not lawyer enough to adviſe you. Sir Solomon, your father-in-law, ſtill ſo inflexible, ſay you?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>BOOTH.</speaker>
                     <p>As poſitiveneſs and parſimony can make him. It is not above two years ſince I married ; and, notwithſtanding every proper ſubmiſſion on my part, the earneſt and repeated ſolicitations of his daughter, and the warmeſt interceſſions of our friends, he ſtill ſeems inexorable as ever.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>WIT.</speaker>
                     <p>That's ſtrange! Time generally ſoftens reſentments of this kind. But the love of money, and an habitual paſſion for artificial trifles, extinguiſh the ſparks of natural affection. As I have acquired, however ſome credit with him, I will try, when he comes to town, how far my influence extends. And yet, Boothby, this may be carrying my friendſhip for you too far.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>BOOTH,</speaker>

                     <speaker>WIT.</speaker>
                     <p>You know he has a niece, who came over ſome time ſince from India to finiſh her education.</p>

                     <speaker>BOOTH.</speaker>
                     <p>I am told he has adopted her for his daughter ; and in her favour, it is ſuppoſed, will diſinherit my wife.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>WIT.</speaker>
                     <p>I! Why not, if the lady will have me?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>BOOTH.</speaker>
                     <p>And have you any ſerious thoughts of Emilia?</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>WIT.</speaker>
                     <p>Why, really I do think ſeriouſly of her ſometimes. The month, I ſpent, during the laſt vacation at Sir Solomon's country ſeat, gave me an opportunity of ſeeing a number of good qualities in her. She is young, it is true ; but that's a fault one may eaſily put up with in a woman.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>BOOTH.</speaker>
                     <p>Nay, I know little of her.—Sir Solomon and his lady have ſtrictly prohibited her having any intercourſe with Mrs. Boothby.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>WIT.</speaker>
                     <p>To reconcile you, therefore, to them now, will be at leaſt a diſintereſted proof of my regard for you, George.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>BOOTH.</speaker>
                     <p>It will ſo, and yet no greater than I expect from it. Your generoſity of diſpoſition, Witmore—</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>WIT.</speaker>
                     <p>Nay, no compliments between friends.—On what terms are you with your own relation? With Lord Lovemore, and his brother-in-law, General Gantlet?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>BOOTH.</speaker>
                     <p>On the beſt, if I may depend on their profeſſions. His Lordſhip is now exerting his intereſt to procure me a regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ; and, as he tells me, with confidence of ſucceſs.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>WIT.</speaker>
                     <p>I am glad of it—Your promotion may have a good effect on Sir Solomon.</p>

                     <speaker>BOOTH.</speaker>
                     <p>In the mean time, however, the pay of a Captain of foot, Witmore, is ſo diſproportioned to the way of living in this gay town—</p>

                     <speaker>BOOTH.</speaker>
                     <p>Nay, hardly ſubſiſt very creditably, and pay the court that is neceſſary to preferment.</p>

                     <p>What think you of my laying open your circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to the General? He is my client, and I know you are down for ſomething handſome in his will.</p>

                     <p>Well, you muſt comfort yourſelf then by reflecting that cannot be long. He is ſo fond of duelling, that ſome an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagoniſt or other will ſoon kill him, or he will come to be hanged for killing his antagoniſt. He narrowly eſcaped the laſt time he killed his man, as he calls it, and yet he's as captious and quarrelſome as ever.</p>

                     <p>I knew thou waſt a good-natured lad and would overlook it, or, by the Lord, thou ſhouldſt have taken him our thyſelf.</p>

                     <speaker>BOOTH.</speaker>
                     <p>How, General! Have you been taking up a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel of mine :—It was obliging in you ; —but I could wiſh—</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>GAN.</speaker>
                     <p>Oh! Sir! it's enough, I underſtand you, —you are perfectly in the right, I ſhould have been more puncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious. —It was impertinent in me, to be ſure. —A friend may be ſometimes too officious. —However, Sir, if you are diſſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, I am at your ſervice. —Call me out—You can fight—I draw my ſword for no man who dares not draw his own.</p>

                     <speaker>BOOTH.</speaker>
                     <p>Nay, but underſtand me, General. If you have taken up any cauſe of mine, I am ſo far from reſenting it as an injury, that I think myſelf obliged to you. You know I am as tenacious of the punctilio as yourſelf ; and would never be ſo rude as to take up the cauſe of a ſtranger : but among friends it is quite another thing.</p>

                     <p>Right, boy. When I commanded in Ireland, my doublet was pinked like the flounces of a fine lady's ſilk petticoat ; and all in the cauſe of my friends. The man who would not be run through the body for his friend, ought to be kicked out of the world for a ſcoundrel.</p>

                     <speaker>BOOTH.</speaker>
                     <p>An heroic ſentiment, General. —But who was your antagoniſt? I hope, for your ſake, he's really out of danger.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>GAN.</speaker>
                     <p>Nay, the raſcal himſelf, I believe, is hardly worth the care of the ſurgeon. I ſhould have wiped my conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated

                     <speaker>WIT.</speaker>
                     <p>Yes, Sir, and by the laws of the land too, if he have a mind to be hanged for it, A man may break all the laws in the ſtatute book, if he be diſpoſed to pay the penalties.</p>

                  <sp>

                     <p>To a great number, noble General : and ſo do the laws of honour too ; by which the ſcoundrel has as often the advantage of the man of honour as the man of honour of the ſcoundrel. Let us ſuppoſe, General, that your antagoniſt's ſkill or agility had been greater than yours; would that have conferred probity on him or reflected infamy on you?</p>

She has ſeen much of the world, and appears to be a diſcerning kind of woman. I know not whether I ſhould altogether ſlight her hints. They were given too with ſuch an air of ſignificance.

By providing for the huſband, I ſecure an intereſt in the gratitude of the wife. Her affection for him ſhall plead for the love of her gallant. But, till it works effect, I muſt be diſtant and reſerved—It were as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politic to alarm the modeſty of a woman, till ſome impreſſion be made on her heart, as for a General to give the ſignal to ſtorm till he had effected a breach— <stage>[Exit.</stage>

But ſhe'll not be open enough to tell me, if there ſhould be any thing in it, left it ſhould breed a quarrel. —Phoo! hang it, it cannot be nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther —in the preſence of his own wife!

                     <p>Yes, but, as I take it, that forfeiture is too conſiderable. I'll marry her tho' it be to have the pleaſure of divorcing her the next day.</p>

                     <p>They are pretty frequent indeed, Governor, and when the parties are agreed, are eaſily brought about. But if either be refractory, they are ſomewhat dilatory and expenſive.</p>

The hand-writing is a woman's, and reſembles that of Lady Lovemore ; but it cannot be hers—ſhe is to accompany my wife, and therefore would hardly diſſuade me from letting her go. Beſides, ſhe ſeems not to have the leaſt tincture of jealouſy in her diſpoſition—Yet now I reflect ; come this notice from whom it will, it may not be proper to neglect it. Mrs. Boothby's conduct is myſterious. Her reſentment laſt night at Lord Love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more's was unaffected and natural. And, though the paſſed off the matter ſlightly to day, the manner in which ſhe did it was neither eaſy nor natural—There may be ſomething more in this buſineſs than I am aware of.

               <l>To own they're pleas'd the critics ever loth,</l>
               <l>May cry "A Duelliſt with ſcarce an oath!</l>

               <l>Round oaths and double meanings, ſtrew'd between,</l>
               <l>With them the virtues of the comic ſcene.</l>
               <l>And yet the Town in general is ſo nice,</l>
               <l>It holds theſe virtues as a kind of vice.</l>
               <l>From the teeth outwards chaſte, their hands before 'em,</l>
               <l>Like reps, ev'n demireps are all decorum.</l>
               <l>Though groſs their thoughts, ſo delicate their hearing,</l>
               <l>They think the very ſtage ſhould fine for ſwearing.</l>

               <l>So much refin'd the ſcene ſince former days,</l>
               <l>When Congreve, Vanbrugh, Wycherly wrote plays,</l>
