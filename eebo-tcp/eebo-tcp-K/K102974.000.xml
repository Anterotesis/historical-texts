            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>It may perhaps be neceſſary to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint the reader, that Euripides has written a tragedy upon the ſame ſubject. In his <hi>Heraclidae,</hi> Macaria is ſacrificed in the ſecond act, and never afterwards mentioned; and <hi>Acamas</hi> is a mute. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the whole conduct of this play is ſo entirely different from that of the Greek poet, that the author is hardly conſcious to himſelf of having borrowed any thing more from him, than the general idea of the <hi>Suppliants</hi> taking refuge in the temple, and Macaria's voluntary offer of her own life.</p>

            <lg>
               <l>WELL! theſe heroic times—I ſcarce can ſpeak—</l>
               <l>Theſe ancient fables, borrow'd from the Greek,</l>
               <l>Are all ſo full of paſſion, rage, and death,</l>
               <l>So violent—they take away one's breath.—</l>
               <l>Let me recover, pray:—this tragic ſtrife</l>
               <l>Night after night,—leads me a weary life.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Thro' what variety of folks, long dead,</l>
               <l>Through what ſtrange times and beings are we led!</l>
               <l>Now a fond daughter trembling for her ſire;</l>
               <l>Now Phaedra, burning with unlawful fire!</l>
               <l>A heroine now, for Greece my brain I rack;</l>
               <l>Now Deſdemona, ſmother'd by a Black.</l>
               <l>To take theſe various ſhapes, and fill the whole,</l>
               <l>An actreſs needs a tranſmigrating ſoul.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>This night, you'll own, I've had full cauſe to mourn</l>
               <l>A chief renown'd from my embraces torn.</l>
               <l>Well might a widow weep the beſt of men!</l>
               <l>Oh! ſuch a huſband I ſhan't have again.</l>
               <l>With bright renown he fill'd the Eaſtern climes,</l>
               <l>And differ'd, ladies, from theſe modern times.</l>
               <l>In life's firſt dawn, to deeds of terror bred,</l>
               <l>The youthful hero cruſh'd the ſerpent's head.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:0296101100:59"/>
In theſe our days, when men their object miſs,</l>
               <l>There are who like to hear the ſerpent hiſs.</l>
               <l>One thing there is, which I muſt not diſguiſe;</l>
               <l>Tho' brave, heroic, generous, and wiſe,</l>
               <l>The lover, tam'd, aſide his club could throw,</l>
               <l>Chain'd to the diſtaff, like a modern beau.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Yet, all his toils and all his labours paſt,</l>
               <l>By death ev'n Envy was ſubdued at laſt.</l>
               <l>We read, (ſo ſays our bard) in Ovid's ſtile</l>
               <l>How for himſelf he rais'd the funeral pile.</l>
               <l>There on his club reclining,—like a gueſt</l>
               <l>With garlands crown'd—he ſunk to endleſs reſt.</l>
               <l>Yet even now, in theſe degenerate days,</l>
               <l>Heroic virtue ſtill can merit praiſe.</l>
               <l>When round the ſhip, in the deep roaring tide,</l>
               <l>Devouring flames advance on ev'ry ſide;</l>
               <l>Lo! on the anchor where the hero lies,</l>
               <l>With look ſerene, and ſtill the foe defies,</l>
               <l>He views the flame, he views the brawling wave,</l>
               <l>Then ſinks—undaunted ſinks in glory's grave.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>May his example every breaſt inſpire,</l>
               <l>And kindle thro' the land our antient fire.</l>
               <l>For nought,—as Shakeſpeare ſings, "can make us rue</l>
               <l>"If Britain to herſelf will prove but true."</l>
