            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A BIRTH-DAY OFFERING TO A YOUNG LADY. FROM HER LOVER.</head>
            <byline>BY THE SAME.</byline>

               <l>ERE this ſhort winter's day be gone,</l>
               <l>My MARY ANNE is twenty one.</l>
               <l>Of days ſtill ſhorter juſt a Lent,</l>
               <l>Patch'd up from different years, is ſpent,</l>
               <l>Since her Devoted fairly reckon'd</l>
               <l>The cloſe of year the thirty-ſecond.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Bending beneath the weight of years,</l>
               <l>Full as infirm as he appears,</l>
               <l>What can a worn-out lover do,</l>
               <l>With twenty-one, at thirty-two?</l>
               <l>For ſuch a phrenzy no defence is—</l>
               <l>The girl has clearly loſt her ſenſes.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Perhaps deceiv'd by ſome fond notion,</l>
               <l>Embrac'd in rapture of devotion,</l>
               <l>(I quote ſuch fancies to expoſe 'em)</l>
               <l>She dreams of bliſs in Abraham's boſom;</l>
               <l>And chuſes an Antique the rather,</l>
               <l>With better grace to call him father.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Perhaps—but fiction be ſuppreſs'd,</l>
               <l>While real joy expands my breaſt—</l>

My faithful flame her heart approves;</l>
               <l>And O! tranſporting thought! ſhe loves.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>When Souls, by impulſe ſympathetick,</l>

               <l>By feelings, which they cannot ſmother,</l>
               <l>Leap at firſt glance to meet each other,</l>

               <l>Of kin, perhaps, in pre-exiſtence,</l>
               <l>Without dull Reaſon's ſlow aſſiſtance,</l>
               <l>They recollect the happy union,</l>
               <l>And long to recommence communion.</l>
               <l>I muſt confeſs that ſuch attraction,</l>

               <l>Were beſt if, on deliberation,</l>
               <l>It met with Reaſon's approbation:</l>
               <l>Not as of abſolute dominion,</l>
               <l>To rule by dint of dark opinion;</l>
               <l>Not as a Lord of ſovereign ſway,</l>
               <l>Whom love muſt worſhip and obey;</l>
               <l>But merely as the herd inferior</l>

               <l>As my poor intellect, or thine,</l>

               <l>And breath'd an idle wiſh to ſplit</l>

               <l>Of half her charms he made a proffer</l>

               <l>NOW Evening had tinged the gay landſkip with gold,</l>
               <l>The ſwains were retired, and their flocks in the fold,</l>
               <l>When Delia complain'd in the woodland alone;</l>
               <l>Loud ecchoes retain'd, and replied to her moan,</l>
               <l>The warblers ſat liſtening around on the ſpray,</l>
               <l>And the gale ſtole in murmurs as ſoft as her lay.</l>

               <l>The frown once ſo dreadful, ah! where is its power?</l>
               <l>The voice heard with tranſport, gives tranſport no more.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>" Though the Sylvans to pleaſe me exert all their powers,</l>

               <l>Though they ſwear that my eyes like the morning are gay,</l>
               <l>That my ſong is more ſweet, than the nightingales lay,</l>

               <l>THE tree of deepeſt root is found</l>
               <l>Leaſt willing ſtill to quit the ground;</l>
               <l>'Twas therefore ſaid by antient ſages,</l>
               <l>That love of life increas'd with years</l>
               <l>So much, that in our latter ſtages,</l>
               <l>When pains grow ſharp, and ſickneſs rages,</l>
               <l>The greateſt love of life appears.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>This great affection to believe,</l>

               <l>If old aſſertions can't prevail,</l>
               <l>Be pleas'd to hear a modern tale.</l>
               <l>When ſports went round, and all were gay</l>
               <l>On neighbour Dobſon's wedding-day,</l>
               <l>Death call'd aſide the jocund groom</l>
               <l>With him into another room:</l>
               <l>And looking grave, "You muſt, ſays he,</l>
               <l>" Quit your ſweet bride, and come with me."</l>
               <l>" With you, and quit my Suſan's ſide!</l>

" My thoughts on other matters go,</l>
               <l>" This is my wedding-night, you know."</l>
               <l>What more he urg'd I have not heard,</l>
               <l>His reaſons could not well be ſtronger;</l>
               <l>So Death the poor delinquent ſpar'd,</l>
               <l>And left to live a little longer.</l>
               <l>Yet calling up a ſerious look,</l>
               <l>His hour-glaſs trembled while he ſpoke,</l>

               <l>" Shall Death diſturb your mirthful hour;</l>
               <l>" And further, to avoid all blame</l>
               <l>" Of cruelty upon my name,</l>
               <l>" To give you time for preparation,</l>
               <l>" And fit you for your future ſtation,</l>
               <l>" Three ſeveral Warnings you ſhall have,</l>
               <l>" Before you're ſummon'd to the grave:</l>
               <l>" Willing for once I'll quit my prey,</l>
               <l>" And grant a kind reprieve;</l>
               <l>" In hopes you'll have no more to ſay,</l>
               <l>" But when I call again this way,</l>
               <l>" Well-pleas'd the world will leave."</l>

            <lg>
               <l>To theſe conditions both conſented,</l>
               <l>And parted perfectly contented.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>What next the hero of our tale befell,</l>
               <l>How long he liv'd, how wiſe, how well,</l>
               <l>How roundly he purſu'd his courſe,</l>

He chaffer'd then, he bought, he ſold,</l>
