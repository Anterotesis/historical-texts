            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>AS the following Sheets are written to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceive and quiet the Minds of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of this Nation in the Caſe of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation mentioned in Her Majeſties Speech to the Parliament, ſo I could not let them come abroad into the World without taking ſome Notice of a Caſe which has happened ſince the finiſhing the other, and which ſome People take hold off, to the Diſadvantage of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, making <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of it to encreaſe our unhappy Diſtractions in this Nation.</p>
            <p>It was obſerved by ſome, that when the Houſe of Commons made their late Addreſs to Her Majeſty no Mention was made therein of the Proteſtant Succeſſion, and the Houſe of <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nover;</hi> this the Party, whoſe peculiar Zeal ſeems to have no other Way left to ſhew itſelf, than in their continued repeating the Danger of the Proteſtant Succeſſion, took hold of as a mighty Advantage, as if the Houſe of <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nover,</hi> the Succeſſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> had been purpoſely affronted on that Occaſion.</p>
            <p>But if they made ſome Noiſe on that Account, the Alarm they pretend to is doubled. Now
<pb facs="tcp:0362300200:3"/>
when on a Motion made in the Houſe the 7th of <hi>June,</hi> to Addreſs Her Majeſty for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king all the Confederates Guarantees of the Proteſtant Succeſſion, <hi>it paſſed in the Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This fills our Zealous <hi>Hannoverians, as they would be thought to be,</hi> with Aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and with a feigned Sadneſs upon their Countenances they look at one another with Diſorder and Amazement.</p>
            <p>The Gloſs they put upon this is indeed very popular, as if they did foreſee the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tender coming in at the Breach this has made; and that becauſe the Houſe would not put Her Majeſty upon the moſt Incongruous and Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent Step in the World, Needleſs to us, and Irrational in itsſelf, but pretended to be for the Propagation of the Intereſt of the Succeſſion, that therefore the Houſe of Commons ſhould be Enemies to the Proteſtant Intereſt, and to the Houſe of <hi>Hannover.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Houſe indeed have acted in this with their wonted Prudence, and the Vote they have paſſed is certainly a much ſtronger Teſtimony of their firm Adherence to the <hi>Hannover</hi> Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, than that Addreſs could have been, <hi>(viz.)</hi> 
               <q rend="inline margSglQuotes">'That they have an entire Confidence in Her Majeſty, and cannot doubt but that ſhe will take all needful Cautions for the Security of the Proteſtant Succeſſion in the Houſe of <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nover,</hi>' &amp;c.</q>  as may be ſeen in the Votes, <hi>June</hi> the 19th.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:0362300200:4"/>The Antient Law-maker, <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> being asked why be made no Law againſt Paricide, gave this wiſe Anſwer, that he would not have ſuch a Crime named among his Citizens; nor would he ſuggeſt that any of his Citizens were capable of ſo much Degeneracy of Nature as to be guilty of it, and therefore he made no Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for it. By this the wiſe Legiſlator put a greater Brand of Infamy upon the Crime than he could poſſibly have done, by making the ſevere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Law againſt it imaginable.</p>
            <p>The like is the Conduct of the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, who having put this as a Matter they think lyes ſo near, and is ſo much Her Majeſties Concern, as that it is impoſſible She ſhould for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get to ſecure it, they have thereby more effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally obliged Her Majeſty to take that Part upon Herſelf, than they could have done by leading Her to the Ways and Means theſe People have preſcribed them.</p>
            <p>The Expreſſion they have now uſed to Her Majeſty by their ſaid Vote implies moſt ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Two Things. <list>
                  <item>1. That the Proteſtant Succeſſion is a Thing of the higheſt Concern to the Nation; ſo great that it would be undutiful and unnatural in them to ſuppoſe Her Majeſty could ſo far neglect ſuch an Eſſential and Fundamental Part of Her Peoples Safety, as to Want that they ſhould remind her of it, and therefore they ſay <hi>they cannot doubt it.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. That the entire Confidence the Commons place in Her Majeſties Zeal for Her Peoples
<pb facs="tcp:0362300200:5"/>
Good, is the greateſt Obligation that a faithful People can put upon their Sovereign, to do all that can poſſibly be done in the Thing itſelf, and much ſtronger in all Reſpects than ſuch an Addreſs could have been.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>So that upon the whole it ſeems, that the Settlement of the Proteſtant Succeſſion is ſo far from having receiv'd any Shock by the Negative of the aforeſaid Vote, that in every Impartial Eye it muſt rather have Weight added to it; and Her Majeſty is farther loaded with Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to ſecure it, if that be poſſible, than She was before.</p>

            <head>THE VALIDITY OF THE RENUNCIATIONS OF Former Powers, Enquired into, AND THE Preſent Renunciation OF THE Duke of <hi>ANJOU,</hi> Impartially Conſidered.</head>
            <p>IT has been the received Maxim of the Preſent Age, that no Peace can be Safe or Honourable while any Part of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Monarchy remains in the Poſſeſſion of the Houſe of <hi>Bourbon.</hi> The Votes, and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0362300200:7"/>
Unanimous Addreſſes, of both Houſes of Parliament Here, the frequent Declarations of our Allies Abroad, and the Speeches of our Sovereign from the Throne, together with infinite other Circumſtances in Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, in Conferences, Miſſives, Memorials, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> have both at Home and Abroad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred to Print this Notion ſo indelibly in the Minds of the common People, that it appears very difficult to remove their Thoughts, or bring them to underſtand or conceive of any other Meaſures, or the Reaſons which may have been given, or pretended, for differing Meaſures. But Time has taught us to ſee, that neither the Opinion of Princes, or Parliaments, are ſo infallible, as not to be Subject to the Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and Alterations, which the Accidents of Government, and the Revolutions of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, bring upon them; and that which may to Day be eſteemed dangerous and impracticable, to Morrow becomes not only ſafe but neceſſary; ſo that it ceaſes to be an Argument againſt a Thing to ſay, that ſuch was the Opinion of ſuch or ſuch, at ſuch or ſuch a Time; for as Circumſtances alter, the Judgments of Men will and ought to be altered.</p>
            <p>This ſeems the Caſe in the Affair of Peace now on the Stage, and which I am here to enquire into; in the Examination whereof, I ſhall, with the utmoſt Impartiality, ſearch into the Thing itſelf, its Nature and Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0362300200:8"/>
without taking any Advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges from the Meaſures now in Hand, or the Quality of the Perſons whoſe Sanction is added to give Authority to the Opinion. It ſhall be of no Weight in this Caſe that Her Majeſties Speech ſays ſo or ſo, it ſhall not be brought as an Argument that the Government are ſatisfied with theſe Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, or that the Preſent Miniſtry have carried this Thing on upon ſuch and ſuch a Foundation, the true Merits of this Cauſe ſhall, according to the Title of this Tract, be impartially conſidered, and every Thing therein be weighed with the utmoſt Calm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Coolneſs of Reaſoning, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing may Byaſs the Reader, either for or againſt one Way or other, but Matters of Fact placed in the cleareſt Light poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
            <p>The Terms of the Peace which is now to be made with <hi>France</hi> are at large ſet down in Her Majeſties Speech, the quoting them from thence ſerves not to give them any Sanction in the preſent Diſcourſe, more than the Certainty that thoſe are the Real Terms now in Debate, which Certainty has never till now been determined by any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſputed Authority.</p>
            <p>By theſe Terms it is allowed, that, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to all which has hitherto been Voted, Declared, or Concluded among us here, the Kingdoms of Old <hi>Spain,</hi> and the <hi>Indies,</hi> are Given, or Allotted, to <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Bourbon,</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:0362300200:9"/>
Duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi> now <hi>Philip</hi> V. King of <hi>Spain,</hi> which is the Firſt and Main Point in Diſpute.</p>
            <p>The Contradiction this Step taken now, bears to the former Reſolutions, Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and Determinations of this Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and of the Confederates, and how it is brought to be conſiſtent with the Words Safe and Honourable, ſo long and ſo often inſiſted on before, depends upon the Novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the following Circumſtances. The King of <hi>France,</hi> a Subtil and Politick Prince, had boldly adventured to break off the Treaty at <hi>Geertruydenbergh,</hi> although his Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs were then in but a very low and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Poſture; he had found it more difficult to manage the Confederates at a Treaty than it had formerly been; and the Councils of <hi>France</hi> began to apprehend Evil Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences from the enſuing Campaign; all they had for it was, that their Troops in <hi>Spain</hi> were in a pretty good Condition, and the Duke <hi>de Vendoſme,</hi> a Commander of Reputation, having joined the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my with 5 Brigades of <hi>French</hi> Infantry, and about 2500 <hi>French</hi> Horſe, they had ſome Hopes of putting a Stop to the Troops of King <hi>Charles,</hi> who after the Battle of of <hi>Saragoſſa</hi> had found the <hi>Caſtilians</hi> not ſo much in his Intereſt as he expected, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be in Want of all Things, having his Troops diſperſed, many Towns of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance to keep Poſſeſſion of, and the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0362300200:10"/>
Rivers, Paſſes, and open Country, poſſeſt by the <hi>French,</hi> ſo that they began to think of drawing together in a Body, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating towards the Frontiers of <hi>Arragon:</hi> In <hi>Flanders,</hi> and everywhere elſe, the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt the <hi>French</hi> could propoſe to do, was to act upon the Defenſive, and, if poſſible, to keep the Confederates from beſieging <hi>Arras</hi> or St. <hi>Omer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They ſucceeded however in theſe Things beyond Expectation, the Campaign in <hi>Flanders</hi> ended with the ſingle Loſs of <hi>Bou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chain,</hi> and in <hi>Spain</hi> the Duke <hi>de Vendoſme</hi> had the Satisfaction of Surrounding the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Troops in <hi>Briheugha,</hi> beating Count <hi>Staremberg</hi>'s Left Wing at <hi>Villa Vicoſa,</hi> and puſhing the whole <hi>German</hi> Army back to <hi>Catalonia,</hi> taking from them all the Caſtles and Paſſes they had ſeized, beſieging <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronne,</hi> taking <hi>Balaguer, Cervera,</hi> and in brief, puſhing the <hi>Germans</hi> into the very City of <hi>Barcelona,</hi> where the Duke threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened to Beſiege them in the Spring Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign.</p>
            <p>Theſe Things buoyed up the King of <hi>France</hi>'s Affairs to ſuch a Height, as made the War ſeem more fixed, and Peace more remote, than ever, when on a ſudden an Accident fell in, which gave a new Turn to all the Affairs of <hi>Europe</hi>; for Heaven, who ſeemed before to have left the Cauſe to the Arm of Fleſh, and who ſuffered the ſeveral Nations to depend whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0362300200:11"/>
upon their Swords; yet now all on a ſuddain, took the Cauſe into his own Hand, and taught both Sides, that the Views they had either Way were not agreeable to him, but that other Meaſures were to be taken to ſettle the Peace of <hi>Europe,</hi> than thoſe of War Conqueſt, and Deſtruction of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind: In Purſuance of theſe Meaſures, Death was ſent with his Black Expreſs to Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon out of the World the ſeveral Perſons, whoſe being in the World prevented either Side from ſeeing their own Intereſt, and from knowing wherein the Peace of <hi>Europe</hi> really conſiſted On the Confederate Side the Stroke began with the Emperor, whoſe Death, without Male Iſſue, made Way on one Hand for the Advancement of King <hi>Charles</hi> to the <hi>Imperial</hi> Dignity, but at the ſame Time gave new Proſpects, and new Schemes, to the Politicks of <hi>Europe,</hi> cooled ſeveral of the Powers and Princes of the Confederacy in their Purſuit of the War, from the juſt Apprehenſion of lodging a dangerous Superiority of Power in the Hands of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> a Family who had been ſo juſtly dreaded by a great Part of the Chriſtian World in the Fifteenth Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury, and whoſe Power, as the <hi>French</hi> has done now, had employed all the Powers, and engag'd almoſt all the Princes of <hi>Europe</hi> in a long War for above Forty Years.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:0362300200:12"/>At the ſame Time that this blow gave <hi>France</hi> ſome Hopes of new Meaſures, and that a Peace might be made on a differing Poot than before, Death falls furiouſly on the Royal Family of <hi>France,</hi> takes away Three Dauphines, the immediate Succeſſors to the Crown, and the Dauphineſs, Wife of the Duke of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> and Daughter of the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and all theſe within the Compaſs of One Year. There now remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but One of the Children of the Family between the Crown of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and this an Infant of about One Year and half old; the Fortune of <hi>France,</hi> weak like the State, and not in the Judgment, even of Phyſicians themſelves, likely to live long; this Blow, tho' it very ſenſibly affected the Old Monarch, yet it immediately put him upon new Meaſures with the Confederates; Two Schemes lay in his View, One, in Caſe the little Dau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phine ſhould die before the other could be brought to Perfection, was the tendring the Crown and Monarchy of <hi>Spain</hi> to the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi>; which, as it might be acceptable enough to ſome of the Confederates, yet was much the Intereſt of <hi>France</hi> to manage it ſo as that the Duke ſhould owe his Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Court of <hi>France,</hi> and not to the Confederates; by which Means, if the Emperor, and his Allies, ſhould oppoſe it, as no doubt ſome of them would be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, he was ſure on one Hand to bring

the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> off from the Confedera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and on the other Hand ſhould be able to carry the War again into <hi>Italy</hi>; and by attempting to put the Duke in Poſſeſſion of <hi>Spain,</hi> might keep ſuch a Share in the Dominions and Commerce of <hi>Spain,</hi> as ſhould be for his Purpoſe. The Second Scheme, founded upon the Suppoſition of the Life of the little Dauphine for a while, was to oblige King <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Spain</hi> to a formal Renunciation of his Claim to the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> tho' the ſame ſhould fall by the Death of the preſent Dauphine, and that the Duke of <hi>Berry</hi> ſhould be declared Dauphine in Caſe of the Death of the ſaid preſent Dauphine, and the Crown to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend to him and his Heirs.</p>
            <p>This Scheme had ſeveral Views, but principally to obviate the great Objection which was made on all Occaſions by the Confederates, and which ſeem'd to be the Foundation of the War, <hi>viz.</hi> the Danger of uniting the Kingdoms of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> in one and the ſame Perſon.</p>
            <p>It ſeems needleſs to repeat here the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty <hi>France</hi> had found to bring the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates to enter upon any ſuch a Thing as a Treaty: After her rejecting the Preli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minaries, and breaking off the Subſequent Treaties at <hi>Geertruydenbergh,</hi> it ſeem'd as if the Confederates were reſolv'd to have no Peace at all, but to puſh at the Ruin of the <hi>French</hi> Monarchy, or that they were ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0362300200:14"/>
of their Strength as, that they reſolved to oblige <hi>France</hi> to offer <hi>Charte Blanc,</hi> and beg Peace, as we uſe to ſay, on their Knees: But <hi>France</hi> found out a Way to convince ſome of the Confederates that their Affairs were not brought ſo very low; and the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Court, as well moved with the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order of their own People, as tired with the unequal Burthen of the War, which had lain on them ſo heavy and ſo long, began to ſhew an Inclination to renew a Treaty. The Court of <hi>France</hi> fail'd not to lay hold of the Occaſion, and obtaining Leave at the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Court to make New Propoſals, a Miniſter was accordingly ſent over thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who having on the Part of <hi>France</hi> made Propoſals for treating of a General Peace in the uſual Manner, and promiſing largely to give Reaſonable Satisfaction to all the Allies, Her Majeſty was prevailed with to interpoſe her Intereſt and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to obtain an Appointment, and a Place was accordingly named, (<hi>viz.</hi>) <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht,</hi> the particular Hiſtory of which is not to the preſent Purpoſe, and therefore is omitted here. The Difficulties which many of the Confederates ſtarted, and the Oppoſition they made to the Propoſal of a Treaty, are too publickly known to need that I repeat them here. But their Management at the Treaty when they came there, will take up ſome Room in the future Hiſtory of that Affair, and may be briefly hinted at

here. The Imperial Court was long er'e they reſolv'd to ſend any Plenipotentiaries at all; the <hi>States-General</hi> appointed Four Miniſters, tho' as ſome reported they were rather Commiſſioners than Plenipotentiaries or Ambaſſadors, and at length with great Difficulty the Treaty began; Papers of Specific Demands were given in on either Hand, when according to the uſual Method of Treaties it was expected the Conferences among the Plenipotentiaries ſhould have begun, and each Party ſhould have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated their own Pretenſions, when on a ſudden the <hi>Imperial</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> Plenipoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiaries, or Miniſters, refuſed abſolutely to treat by Conference, but demanded Anſwers in Writing of the <hi>French:</hi> The <hi>French</hi> were ſurpriz'd at this Demand, alledging, <q rend="inline margSglQuotes">'That they had given in their Propoſals to the Confederates at firſt, and received the Demands of the Confederates, and they were ready to enter upon the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars by Conference, according to the uſual Methods of Treaties: That An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers in Writing tended only to prolong Time, and to ſet the whole World ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king their popular Uſe of them: That ſome of the Confederate Miniſters had made uſe of the former Propoſal to exaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate the reſt of their Allies, and to irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the People againſt the <hi>French,</hi> without entring into the particular Explications which they were ready to make of every

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0362300200:17"/>
full Stop. Here it was that the Miniſters of ſome of the Allies diſcovered that their Buſineſs at <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht</hi> was not to Treat, but to put a Stop to the Treaty; and that they laid hold of every Occaſion to interrupt and prevent the Proceedings, much more the Concluſion, of any ſuch Thing as a Treaty of Peace; for the ſaid Miniſters thinking they had effectually gained their Point, did not ſtick to be very open upon this Head: But they have been diſappointed in this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, as they have been in many more, by the Vigilance and Conduct of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Miniſters; for Her Majeſty finding this Secret Management of the ſaid Miniſters puſh'd plainly at deſtroying all the Hopes of a Peace by interrupting the Conferences, took Occaſion to let them know ſhe would not be bound Apprentice to the War at the Will and Pleaſure of the Allies, but that ſince all which ſhe was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to fight for, and on which as a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation the War was begun, being to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by a Peace, the Obligation to carry on the War ceaſed; neither could any Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Prince juſtifie the carrying on a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive War, and the Shedding ſo much Blood, if the Reaſonable Satisfaction for which the War was begun might be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd without it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:0362300200:18"/>Upon theſe Juſt and Rational Principles the Queen of <hi>Great Britain</hi> proceeded to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt with the <hi>French</hi> the Conditions of Peace which Her Majeſty thought fit to demand for Her own Subjects, with moſt of which the <hi>French</hi> having complied, there only remains the Satisfaction which Her Majeſty demands for the reſt of Her Allies; and here it is to be remark'd, for the Conviction of ſuch as have reproached the Queen with forſaking her Engagements and Alliances, that albeit Her Majeſty might with good Reaſon have left the Allies to make the beſt Terms they could with <hi>France</hi> after Her own Terms were adjuſted as above, they having offered to impoſe the War upon Her in a Manner altogether unjuſtifiable, yet Her Majeſty, far from ſuffering Herſelf to be guided by Her Reſentments, however Juſt, has nevertheleſs made the Intereſt of the Allies Her own in every Particular, and has forgotten no Material Demand which ſhe thought fit for them to ask, or <hi>France</hi> to grant to them, but has inſiſted upon the ſame Demands which the ſaid Confederates had made before, ſo far as Her Majeſty ſaw a Reaſon ſufficient to demand the ſame.</p>
            <p>This is the Scheme then of the Treaty of Peace, which is contained in Her Majeſty's Speech to the Parliament, wherein, as there are ſeveral ſurprizing Conceſſions made by <hi>France,</hi> which it was never thought he would be brought to comply with, on the Part

of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> and for which the People of <hi>Britain</hi> have a great Reaſon, not only to Bleſs Her Majeſties Concern for the Good and Proſperity of Her own Subjects and Kingdoms, but alſo to be very glad that the ſaid Peace was not concluded in former Treaties, where it was obſervable that no Proviſion was made for the Commerce or Intereſt of the People of <hi>Great-Britain</hi>; but all the Intereſt of <hi>Britain</hi> employed in obtaining Powers and Advantages for the Confederates, and for promoting the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts, and Greatneſs, and Securities, of the Emperor and the States-General, upon Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition that all our Security and Greatneſs was contained in the ſpecial and particular Intereſts of thoſe Powers, without any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Proviſions for our own.</p>
            <p>Theſe particular Advantages to <hi>Britain</hi> now obtain'd by this Treaty appears by a Scheme of a Peace laid by Her Majeſty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Her Parliament, <hi>June</hi> 6. 1712, in Her late Speech, and are as follows.<list>
                  <item>1.

The putting the whole Iſland of Sr. <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtophers</hi> into the Hands of the Queen of <hi>Great-Britain</hi>: This is altogether New; nor is the Advantage ſo inconſiderable as not to be very well worth Her Majeſties Concern to demand, and our Satisfaction in obtaining; the Partition of that Iſland between us and the <hi>French</hi> having not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly occaſioned much Dammage and Blood, but at laſt the utter Ruin of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Settlement on that Iſland, and of the poor Planters there, by the cruel Devaſtation of the <hi>French.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>3.

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0362300200:22"/>
of poſſeſſing a Road, and a Town in the very Entrance of the <hi>Straights,</hi> is too well underſtood to need any farther Enquiry about it.</item>

The ſecuring to the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Merchants all the Advantages, Rights and Priviledges, of Trade in <hi>Spain,</hi> that ſhall be granted to any other Nation: This takes away that General Notion, which was, that a Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference ſhould be made between the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of <hi>France,</hi> and thoſe of other Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in <hi>Spain,</hi> with reſpect to Trade, to the Advantage of the <hi>French.</hi>
                  </item>

            <p>Theſe Seven are Particulars wholly left out or very much neglected in all the former Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, of whatever Kind, which we have yet ſeen tranſacted with the <hi>French</hi>; and which at leaſt may afford us this Deduction, <hi>viz.</hi> that Her Majeſty has been juſt ſo much more concern'd for the Good of Her own

            <p>Come we now to enquire into the General Security, and the Publick Peace and Intereſt of <hi>Europe: The Ballance of Power</hi> has been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways laid down as the Firſt and moſt Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Thing to be provided for, as that on which the Safety of <hi>Europe</hi> depended and as the only Method which could be found out to prevent the Exorbitant Greatneſs of <hi>France,</hi> and keep him from Over-running the reſt of Chriſtendom, and to keep up the general Harmony among the reſt of the Powers of <hi>Europe.</hi> This Ballance of Power was thought to be effectually deſtroyed by the Seizing of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Monarchy into the Hands of a Branch of the Houſe of <hi>Bourbon</hi>; by which was moſt juſtly apprehended, that in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of the uſual Methods of the <hi>French</hi> Government, the Great and Powerful Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchies of <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>France</hi> ſhould imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately be united in the ſame Perſon, which would be the apparent Ruin of the Peace of <hi>Europe.</hi> To prevent this Melancholy View of the Publick Affairs of <hi>Europe,</hi> the other Powers of that Part of <hi>Europe</hi> princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally concerned took Arms, and joined with the <hi>Imperial</hi> Armies, which were then entred upon Action againſt <hi>France,</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror

having begun the War the Year be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.

            <p>By theſe Articles it appears, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all the Pretenſions made againſt the King of <hi>France</hi> for the Breaches made by him of ſuch former Treaties, and the pretended Inſufficiency of ſuch Acts of Renunciation, to bind the King of <hi>France</hi> where his Intereſt interferes therewith, yet that the ſaid late King <hi>William,</hi> the States-General, as well as the other Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Powers of <hi>Europe,</hi> either did think ſuch Renunciations ſufficient, or found no other Way Practicable to bind the ſaid Princes and Powers than ſuch Renunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations, and that therefore they were not the leſs to be made Uſe of, or had Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to, on ſuch Occaſions, however the King of <hi>France</hi> might have diſregarded the former Renunciations of the <hi>Pyrenees.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:0362300200:30"/>The Queen of <hi>Great-Britain</hi> having then found it neceſſary in the Proſecution of this War to hearken to ſuch Propoſals of Peace as have been made on the Part of <hi>France,</hi> in order to put an End to this Bloody and Tedious War, it cannot ſeem ſo ſtrange a Thing as ſome People would imagine, or perſwade us, that Her Majeſty ſhould lay ſome Streſs on the Validity of a Formal Renunciation on the Part of the Duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi> as it reſpects the Claim the ſaid Duke of <hi>Anjou</hi> has, or may have, in caſe of the Demiſe of the preſent <hi>Dauphin</hi> of <hi>France</hi> to the Dominions of his Grandfather, the preſent King of <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having then proved the Reaſonableneſs of continuing the ſaid Form in Treaties of Peace, I ſhall now examine what Difference there appears between the ſaid former Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciations of the King of <hi>France,</hi> and the preſent Renunciation propoſed, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Security of this preſent Renuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion conſiſts: In Order to this it ſeems neceſſary to look back into the Nature and Reaſon of the Propoſals of Peace: It is known, as above, that the Breach of the ſaid Ballance of Power in <hi>Europe</hi> conſiſted in the Conjunction of the Intereſts and Powers of the reſpective Monarchies of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi>; it is confeſt it were to have been wiſh'd on this Account that it had pleaſed God, that either the Electoral
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0362300200:31"/>
Prince of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> to whom <hi>Spain</hi> was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted by the firſt Treaty of Partition mentioned above, or the Late Emperor <hi>Joſeph</hi> had not died without Heirs; ſo as that the Poſſeſſion of the <hi>Imperal</hi> Dignity, or the Dominions of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> had not deſcended to the Perſon of the preſent Emperor. But theſe Events having fallen in, and it being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to prevent the Conſequences at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending, the Caſe muſt therefore be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as it is, not as it were wiſhed to have been. The King of <hi>France,</hi> and the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror of <hi>Germany,</hi> are the only Competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors for the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Monarchy. There is no room to doubt but the Ballance of Power is entirely broken, whichſoever of theſe Two we to poſſeſs the whole of this new Prize. So that it ſeems neceſſary to the Peace of <hi>Europe</hi> that ſome Medium be found out to adjuſt this Matter.</p>
            <p>It is not the preſent Work to offer Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diums, but to conſider the Validity of thoſe already offered: Her Majeſty has, in Her Speech to the Parliament, given in a Scheme, on which this great Work is to be, or may be founded; and has added, under Her own Royal Authority, that by this Scheme the Three greateſt Things in the preſent Diſputes about Peace are provided for, <hi>viz.</hi>
               <list>
                  <item>1. That <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> are more effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually divided than ever.</item>

                     <pb n="27" facs="tcp:0362300200:32"/>2. That a real Ballance of Power will be fixed in <hi>Europe,</hi> liable to as few Accidents as Human Affairs can be exempted from.</item>
                  <item>3. That the Nature of the Propoſal is ſuch, that it executes itſelf.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe Articles ſeem to be thus explained, </p>
            <list>
               <item>1. <hi>That</hi> France <hi>and</hi> Spain <hi>are more effectually divided than ever</hi>; that is, that the Duke of <hi>Berry</hi> being declared next Heir in Caſe of the Death of the <hi>Dauphin</hi> without Heirs, <hi>France</hi> will be Embark'd by him, (<hi>he being in immediate Poſſeſſion</hi>) againſt <hi>Spain,</hi> which may be ſuppoſed to aſſiſt King <hi>Philip,</hi> and that the Duke of <hi>Berry</hi> will not fail to defend his own Pretenſions; this ſeems to be founded upon ſo good Authority, that if he ſhould be ſuppoſed to give it up, he muſt act againſt Reaſon and Nature.</item>
               <item>2. <hi>That a real Ballance of Power will be fixed in</hi> Europe, <hi>liable to as few Accidents as Human Affairs can be exempted from.</hi> This is built on the Suppoſition of the reſpective, Parties being divided, as above; the Conſequence of which may be, that they will be ever fortifying their Intereſt with Friends and Confederates, Leagues and Treaties one againſt the other, (<hi>viz.</hi>) the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> will not fail to be ſtrictly Allied to, and in the Intereſt of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> as ever; in ſo far as the Alliance reſpects <hi>France,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the View that Houſe will have to
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0362300200:33"/>
their own Claim of the Crown, which is for ever to be excluded from the Houſe of <hi>Bourbon</hi> after the Failure of the Heirs of King <hi>Philip.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>3. <hi>That the Nature of the Propoſal is ſuch, that it executes itſelf</hi>; this is the juſt Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence from the other Two, ſignifying, that, <hi>as before,</hi> the Succeſſors of the King of <hi>France,</hi> in Failure of the <hi>Dauphin,</hi> will naturally ſtand up againſt <hi>Philip,</hi> and inſiſt upon the Renunciation made at this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and will therefore exclude him from any Pretenſions with all their Power. The Confederates will naturally, and for the ſame Reaſons which induced them to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence, and carry on this War, fall in, and join themſelves to the ſaid Sons of <hi>France,</hi> to keep out the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and prevent his ſucceeding, from that one received Maxim, which I mentioned at the firſt of this Work, <hi>viz.</hi> that it is inconſiſtent with the Safety and Peace of <hi>Europe,</hi> that the Monarchies of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> ſhould be poſſeſſed by the ſame Perſon; and on the other Hand, <hi>Spain</hi> itſelf will unwillingly Succour or Further the Pretenſions of their Kings, as what is ſeveral Ways againſt their Intereſt, and would reduce their Country to be but a Dependent on, and as a Province to the Kingdom of <hi>France.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:0362300200:34"/>To come a little into the Senſe of theſe Things, it ſeems neceſſary to obſerve here, 1. That the effectually eſtabliſhing a Ballance of Power in <hi>Europe,</hi> is the real End and Deſign of this War; all the Declarations, all the Publick Papers, all the Arguments on both Sides, are full of this; both the Treaties of Partition, the Renunciation at the <hi>Pyrencan</hi> Treaty, the ſetting up King <hi>Charles,</hi> the oppoſing the Poſſeſſion of King <hi>Philip</hi>; all theſe are founded on this No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the Safety of <hi>Europe</hi> conſiſts in maintaining an equal Ballance of Power among the ſeveral Princes and States con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in this War. 2. That the effectual dividing of the Intereſts of <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> is the only effectual Method for preſerving this Ballance of Power. And then it will come to be enquired, 3. Whether the preſent Scheme of <hi>Philip</hi>'s Renunciation be an effectual dividing the Intereſts of <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> yea or no.</p>
            <p>1. That the effectual eſtabliſhing a Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance of Power in <hi>Europe,</hi> is the real End and Deſign of the War; Her Majeſties De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of War, and the Declarations of the Princes and Powers now engaged in this War, together with the Grand Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance among the Confederates, will all teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie in Defence of this Propoſition; and to them I refer my Reader, wherein the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of <hi>Europe,</hi> the Publick Tranquility, the Ballance of <hi>Europe,</hi> are Terms uſed to
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0362300200:35"/>
ſignifie the ſame Thing, and are all along made Uſe of as the Reaſons of the War, as in Her Majeſties Declaration of War, <hi>May</hi> 4. 1702, and likewiſe, in the Declaration or <hi>Manifeſto</hi> of the States-General, <hi>May</hi> 8. 1702.</p>
            <p>Many the like might be produced, to prove, if it were needful, that theſe were the true Grounds of the War, but this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſufficient, I paſs to the next Head, <hi>viz.</hi> 2 <hi>That effectual dividing the Intereſt of</hi> France <hi>and</hi> Spain, <hi>is the only way to preſerve or reſtore the Ballance of Power in</hi> Europe. This alſo is as evident from the Courſe of the whole War; the ſetting up King <hi>Charles</hi> as King of <hi>Spain</hi> had no other Foundation, for he had at that Time no Pretence to Claim the Crown of <hi>Spain,</hi> his Elder Brother being alive, and having Children to ſucceed; but the Crown of <hi>Spain</hi> was allotted to him on this very Foundation, that the Monarchy of <hi>France</hi> might have nothing to do with the Dominions of <hi>Spain,</hi> in all the Treaties that have been ſet on Foot on every Hand, for the putting an End to the War; this has been the Foundation of all the reſt, (<hi>viz.</hi>) that the Kingdoms of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> might not come into the Poſſeſſion of the ſame Prince. Nay, the King of <hi>France</hi> himſelf has acknowledged it to be a juſt Foundation, and has made it the Foot upon which he has always made his Propoſals of Peace, as is apparent from the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0362300200:36"/>
late Propoſals, called the Six Preliminaries, wherein he owns, in expreſs Terms, that it is not ſafe for <hi>Europe</hi> that <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> ſhould come to be Governed by the ſame Perſon, at the ſame Time, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore propoſes to give ſufficient Security to the Allies that ſuch a Thing ſhould never happen. This Maxim is deduced from the former, (<hi>viz.</hi>) the preſerving the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance of Power in <hi>Europe,</hi> and is the main Point for which this Bloody War has been ſo long carried on.</p>
            <p>But all the Schemes for bringing this to paſs have hitherto proved ineffectual, the War hath proved tedious and tireſome, and the Nations have been exhauſted to ſuch a Degree by it, that the Subjects on every Side call for Peace; the <hi>French,</hi> tho' puſhed with great Succeſs, and with infinite Loſſes every Year, yet loſe their Ground by Inch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es; Twice they have beaten the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates out of <hi>Spain,</hi> although they had poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed even the Capital City, and the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Provinces, and they ſtill appear in a Formidable Poſture on the Frontiers; ſo that it ſeems to be ſtill the Work of many Years to Reduce them. On the other Hand, the ſeveral Offers <hi>France</hi> has made of evacuating <hi>Spain,</hi> has been look'd upon as unſafe, or inſincere. But Providence having removed the Princes of the Houſe of <hi>Bourbon</hi> on the one Hand, and brought King <hi>Charles</hi> to the <hi>Imperial</hi> Dignity on the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0362300200:37"/>
other, by which it appears, that the ſame Reaſons for ſettling the Crown of <hi>Spain</hi> on his Head doth not exiſt as before; and that it might be equally dangerous to <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi> to make one and the ſame Perſon Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, and King of <hi>Spain,</hi> as King of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi>; the ſaid Ballance of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi> being thereby deſtroyed as much the one Way as the other; this being the Caſe a new Expedient offers, (<hi>viz</hi>) to make a new Eſtabliſhment, or Entail, of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Crowns of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi>; ſo that the Intereſts of ſeveral Princes might be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered Incompatible, and that it might ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear divided in thoſe Intereſts; ſo that it being naturally impoſſible for them to agree as to Soveraignity, the Peace of <hi>Europe</hi> might be ſecured as the Conſequence.</p>
            <p>To bring this to paſs, mutual Renuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions have been alſo needful; but as theſe Things called Renunciations have ſuffered ſome Scandal in the Eyes of the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, it might be expected the Oppoſers of Peace would immediately object againſt the very Word itſelf as unſatisfactory. But conſidering Men always diſtinguiſh of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in order to judge rightly; and in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this it will appear, that as in Her Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties Speech it is obſerved, this Treaty executes itſelf; ſo that the Validity of this Article does not <hi>ſo much</hi> conſiſt in the Validity of the Renunciation, as the Validity of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation depends upon the Nature of the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0362300200:38"/>
Thing; for Example, ſuppoſing the Crown of <hi>France</hi> falls, as may be ſaid, by Deſcent to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent <hi>Philip,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Berry</hi> being declared <hi>Dau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phin</hi> by Virtue of this Treaty, and being immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately in Poſſeſſion of the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> no Man can think ſo abſurdly as to ſuppoſe he will demit to his Brother <hi>Philip,</hi> who alſo has given up his Right. Nor can any Man ſuggeſt that <hi>Philip</hi> can force him to it, after he is in Poſſeſſion; for it will always be allowed, that there will be a great Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between a King of <hi>Spain</hi> renouncing <hi>France,</hi> and a King of <hi>France</hi> renouncing <hi>Spain,</hi> as to the Power of forcing their Pretenſions. This then being the Caſe here, there remains no more Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, but that the Circumſtances of the Two Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons will effectually divide the Kingdoms; for if the Duke of <hi>Berry,</hi> who is the younger Brother, keeps the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> not the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> would be more inconſiſtent with his Intereſt, than his Brother <hi>Philip,</hi> who cannot but with Regret ſee him eſtabliſhed on a Throne, which was his Birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, and which he had, with <hi>Eſau,</hi> given up for a Meſs of <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Pottage.</p>
            <p>The Renunciation, join'd with Want of Power, has double Efficacy in this Caſe; and I ſee nothing remaining to doubt the Duke of <hi>Berry</hi> being able to maintain himſelf againſt <hi>Philip,</hi> unleſs we ſhould ſuppoſe a Faction in <hi>France</hi> to Favour King <hi>Philip,</hi> which conſidering the abſolute Dominions of the Kings of <hi>France</hi> is alſo not very probable; but if this ſhould happen, then are all the Confederates engaged as Allies to the Duke of <hi>Berry</hi> to ſupport him in his Claim, and ſo <hi>France, Britain, Holland,</hi> and the <hi>Empire,</hi> are in Confederacy againſt <hi>Spain</hi>; which is ſuch a wild Diſproportion, that the Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger cannot be thought ſufficient to any wiſe Man to make the leaſt Uneaſineſs in our Minds. On the other Hand, if the preſent <hi>Dauphin</hi> lives, and ſhould have Children, as may very probably hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, then the whole <hi>Chimera</hi> vaniſhes at once, and the Renunciation may never come to take Place; or if it do, it may be ſo many Ages hence, that no Man can ſo much as ſuggeſt what the Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0362300200:39"/>
of that Time may be, or make any Proviſion againſt it. Be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> then, that either of theſe Caſes are the preſent State of <hi>Europe,</hi> as one of them muſt be, what rational Doubt can any Man ſtart in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Caſe, why this is not a ſufficient Security to <hi>Europe,</hi> againſt the Fear of uniting the Kingdoms of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi>; ſince to argue againſt it muſt be to argue againſt Human Nature? And ſuppoſe the young Duke of <hi>Berry,</hi> who is a Prince of as much Fire as moſt Men in <hi>Europe,</hi> ſhould tamely and quietly give up his Claim to the Crown of <hi>France</hi>; and that too, after he is in Poſſeſſion of it, and quit it to his Brother, who has been expung'd by his own voluntary Act and Deed; and by a Formal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation, which is made Legal, and accepted in all the moſt effectual and ſtrongeſt Terms in the <hi>French</hi> Conſtitution, and all this to be done by the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Prince to the weakeſt by the Prince; who hath Power in his Hands to keep Poſſeſſion to that Prince, who hath no Power forcibly to diſpoſſeſs him.</p>
            <p>Theſe are Abſurdities neceſſary only to a baffled Argument, and which none but the weakeſt People in the World would lay any Weight upon, and ſerve only to confirm any reaſonable Perſon in the Validity of this Renunciation, and in the Truth of what Her Majeſty has laid down in theſe Three Heads.<list>
