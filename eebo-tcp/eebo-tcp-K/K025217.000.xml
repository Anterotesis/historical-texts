            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <p>ABOUT Five Years ago he felt a Soreneſs in his Left Side, after having rode Four Days together, and made Water, which was firſt coffee-colour'd, and then bloody. Theſe Complaints went off in a ſhort time; however, he became, after this, ſubject to make bloody Water upon Riding: He felt once a moſt violent Pain along the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:1221500600:3"/>Region of the Right Ureter; it laſted only for a Moment, and happened during a Fit of Cholic, occaſioned by eating Strawberries. About Two Years ago he was obliged to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear riding, and could hardly walk without making bloody Water; had Pain in making Water, and a Forcing to go to Stool at the ſame time, but no Stoppage: He began Mrs. <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phens</hi>'s Medicines in <hi>April</hi> laſt; they increaſed the Pain in making Water for ſome time; his Water became turbid at the time of making, had ropy fetid Matter in it, depoſited a thick heavy Sediment, and many ſmall Flakes and Fragments of Stones were voided with it in a ſoft State: In Five or Six Weeks he grew much better, and was able to go over the Stones in his Coach: His general Health was alſo much improved. In the Beginning of <hi>July</hi> he had a Return of the Pain in making Water, with a ſudden Stoppage now and then: Upon this he voided ſeveral Pieces of Stone in a ſoft State, with one pretty large Piece, Part of which was ſoft and white, Part brown and hard, and it gave a little Pain in paſſing: After this the Pain and Stoppage in making Water went off intirely. In <hi>September</hi> he went into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, where he often rides a trotting Horſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Inconvenience; and is free from all Complaints, excepting that he has now and then ſome uneaſy Senſations in the Region of the Kidneys: He has continued the Medicines till a little while ago; but his Water has been in general perfectly clear, during the Uſe of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:1221500600:4"/>them; whereas it has twice been turbid upon diſcontinuing them, and depoſits a red Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which dries into a ſtony Subſtance.</p>

A Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon at <hi>Exeter</hi> examined him twice by the Finger in the Anus, and found both times in the moſt evident manner a Stone in the Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, which he imagined to be as big as an Egg. Mr. <hi>Binford</hi> perceived the Motions of this Stone during the Examinations, and made bloody Water after one of them. He began Mrs. <hi>Stephens</hi>'s Medicines about the middle of laſt <hi>Auguſt,</hi> and in a ſhort time after voided many white Scales, and much brown Grit in a ſoft and rotten State: Since this he has voided many irregular Shells of Stone, of a conſiderable Size, and of ſuch a Thickneſs, as to conſiſt of ſeveral Coats, from Two to Six in Number:
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:1221500600:5"/>Many of theſe, when voided, are covered with a Whiteneſs, which being rubb'd off, the Shell appears to be brown.

Mr. <hi>Binford</hi> has voided many more Pieces of Stone ſince this, and Mrs. <hi>Stephens</hi> is in daily Expectation of his being perfectly well.</p>

               <p>TOWARDS the latter Part of my Life, when in my Fiftieth Year, about 1720, I was ſore pained with the Stone, until I voided a large one; at ſeveral times ſince about a Dozen; Part came away after a little riding, and then I made Water like Coffee: But I imagine, one of the largeſt might ſtay behind; for in 1735 I began to be greatly afflicted; could not endure to ride, or bear a Coach: When I have been making Water, it often
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:1221500600:6"/>ſtopped on a ſudden, cauſing much Pain; and no Perſon in the Country could give Relief, tho' I took a many odd Things. Reading the Papers, I obſerved, ſome Specificks for the Stone were advertized, one a Powder, the other a Liquid: I got 'em, and try'd each; but was not able to go thro' with either of 'em; being of a forcing Nature, increaſed my Pain: Then was adviſed to ſmooth palliating Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, yet Pain ſtill continued, and exceſſive; made me begin to think of coming up to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> to be cut, if it might be ſafely done at my Age: At that time the News informed us, that the Biſhop of <hi>Bath</hi> and <hi>Wells</hi> and others were cured by taking Mrs. <hi>Stephens</hi>'s Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines: I was then more inclinable to come: When I ſet out, my Thoughts were to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo the manual Operation, and had wrote to Mr. <hi>Cheſelden</hi> about it: When I arrived in <hi>London,</hi> and conſulted with ſome Friends, it was thought, as I was in my 68th Year, the ſafeſt way to take Mrs. <hi>Stephens</hi>'s Medicines; and accordingly on the 18th of <hi>July,</hi> 1737, I began with 'em, taking Three Powders, and Three half Pints of Liquid every Day: What Effect, and how they did operate, you will ſee by the following Diary, which I kept as exactly as I could, conſidering the Pain I had by times; which yet prompted me to keep ſtrictly to the Medicines, believing, that by ſo doing, I ſhould the ſooner be made eaſy, and took the Liquid Four times a Day for ſome Weeks.</p>

               <p>HAVING been very much afflicted with the Stone and Gravel, and having by the beſt means I could, endeavour'd to get Relief, at length, in the utmoſt of my Extremity, I was recommended to Mrs. <hi>Stephens;</hi> and ſoon
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:1221500600:20"/>after taking her Medicines, I began to bring away in my Urine a whitiſh Powder, which, when dry, appeared to be what came from a Stone. This continued for ſome time, and in about Two or Three Months I found my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf freed from a Pain, I had felt at times for ſeveral Years, on the Right Side of the Bladder. And I am well aſſured, it was a Stone or cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous Matter, which ſtuck to the Bladder. Beſides this, I had a looſe Stone in the Bladder, which for ſeveral Months after gave me ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme Pain, by its forcing when I made Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; which at length came away in Pieces, almoſt every time I made Water, for about Nine Weeks following; until at laſt it came all away, as appeared by my being freed from all manner of Pain. The Kernel of the Stone itſelf having come away, I thought myſelf then intirely well, tho' afterwards, upon a Journey to <hi>London,</hi> ſome Stones fell from my Kidneys, which came away to the Number of Seven at one time, which made me preſume too far in diſcontinuing the Medicines in great Part, having little or no Pain; when a Stone, which had ſtuck in the Ureters, came down, and ſtopped the Paſſage of the Urine, which occaſioned a Suppreſſion of it, and out of Fear of its not paſſing, I had the Aſſiſtance of Mr. <hi>Cheſelden;</hi> and, I thank God, I am now free of any Pain, and have been ſo ever ſince.</p>

               <p>HAS had Pains in the Region of the Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys, with the voiding of ſmall Stones, ever ſince the Year 1721. In <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1734, had a very bad Fit, but voided no Stone after it. In the <hi>October</hi> following found, that he could neither bear a Coach, ride, nor walk, without a great deal of Pain, and often make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bloody Water. Had frequent Provocations to make Water, and made very little at a time. He began Mrs. <hi>Stephens</hi>'s Medicines on the Third of laſt <hi>October:</hi> Upon this his Water became white, and had ſmall white Gravel in it, like Scrapings of Chalk. He was in great Pain for the firſt Month after he began the Medicines. <hi>November</hi> the Fourth he was examined by the Catheter, and a Stone was found in the Bladder. Since this he has voided ſeveral Scales like Egg-ſhells, white on one Side, and brown on the other, with many white rotten Bits of Stone. He is at preſent very eaſy, can walk very well, and continues the Uſe of the Medicines.</p>

               <p>HE has been ſubject to Pains in his Back, with Vomitings, and the voiding of ſmall Stones, for many Years. About Four or Five Years ago, after a Jolt in a Coach, he had a Pain in making Water, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued about Three Weeks. In <hi>November</hi> 1736, after another Jolt, he had a Return of the ſame ſort of Pain in making Water: This became very violent after ſome time, was often attended with a ſudden Stoppage, and he had great Provocation to make Water, eſpecially upon Motion: Made bloody Water after much Motion in the Chariot; had an uneaſy Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation in the Region of the Bladder, upon turning in Bed, as if ſomething moved within him. Theſe Diſorders continued about Four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Months, at the End of which, <hi>viz.</hi> in <hi>February</hi> laſt, he began to take Mrs. <hi>Stephens</hi>'s Medicines. They increaſed his Pain in make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Water very much for ſome Days; his Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter depoſited a white heavy Sediment, and he voided many Flakes of Stone in a ſoft State, and ſome Fragments in a hard one. He grew eaſy and free from all Complaints in about Two Months, excepting that he had now and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:1221500600:26"/>then ſome ſmall Pains in the Region of the Ureters. However, he continued the Uſe of the Medicines till the End of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> his Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter depoſiting a white heavy Sediment, till the laſt Ten Days or Fortnight of taking. He has continued perfectly well ever ſince, and can ride a trotting Horſe, or go over the Stones in a Coach, without any Inconvenience.</p>

               <p>HE had the uſual Symptoms of a Stone in the Bladder, and began Mrs. <hi>Stephens</hi>'s Medicines in <hi>September</hi> laſt, being about 75 Years old. <hi>October</hi> the Eighth Mr. <hi>Hawkins</hi> examined him, and found a Stone in the Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, which he told Mr. <hi>Thomas,</hi> he believed to be a large one: Upon firſt taking the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines Mr. <hi>Thomas</hi>'s Water depoſited much heavy Sediment, which dried into a ſtony Subſtance: Some time after he voided ſoft white Scales in great Quantities with Grit and Slime, which I ſaw. His Pains were great at this time: They continued, he loſt his Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, grew feveriſh, and died <hi>Jan.</hi> 20. His Body was opened, and a Stone taken out of the Bladder. This Stone Dr. <hi>Shaw</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hawkins</hi> ſaw <hi>Jan.</hi> 30. I ſaw Dr. <hi>Shaw</hi> that Evening, and took down from his Mouth the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:1221500600:27"/>following Words, relating to the Appearance of the Stone.</p>
               <q>The Stone was light, white on the Outſide, a great Part of it covered with a cretaceous Coat, which broke off in Flakes with great Eaſe, perfectly like to thoſe before voided, as appeared by comparing them. The Stone would to any indifferent Perſon plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear as if acted upon by a Solvent, ſo as to have greatly diminiſhed its Bulk. The inner Part of the Stone was reddiſh, and harder than the external, when tried by a Knife. There were Two Bulgings, which roſe pretty high above the Stone, and which appeared to be leſs acted upon by the Solvent than the other Parts. The Stone was not covered equably with the ſame Coat, but what co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered one Part appeared to have been taken off in others.</q>
               <p>The next Day I ſaw Mr. <hi>Hawkins,</hi> and took down from his Mouth the following Words relating to the Appearance of the Stone:
<q>He ſaw a Stone weighing nearly Two Ounces, as Mrs. <hi>Thomas</hi> ſaid. The Surface was of a whitiſh Colour, and in Part covered with a Matter that had all the Appearance of the ſoft Shells that had before come away in Mr. <hi>Thomas</hi>'s Water. This Matter was very ſoft, and ready to fall off and crumble upon the leaſt Touch. By theſe Appearances he ſays, that he ſhould imagine that the Stone had been larger, and that this ſoft Matter ſeem'd to he ready to fall off in a little time. The
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:1221500600:28"/>Part of the Stone not covered with this ſcaly Matter, appeared, when ſcraped with a Knife, of a ruſty Iron Colour, and conſiderably hard.</q>

SINCE I have taken Mrs. <hi>Stephens</hi>'s Medicines, my Urine has been of a more urinous Smell than uſual; tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid at the time of making, and <hi>alkaline,</hi> that is, it turns Syrup of Violets green, and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with the following acid Liquors, Oil of Vitriol, Spirit of Vitriol, Oil of Sulphur, Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Nitre, Spirit of Sea-Salt, Vinegar, and Lemon-Juice. And as far as I can judge, the Caſe is the ſame with all who take theſe Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines. This I thought very remarkable when I firſt obſerved it, and began to hope, that Urine, which was ſo different from common Urine, might have different Effects upon Stones in the Kidneys and Bladder. And I have lately been informed, that even common Urine, when it putrifies, that is, turns alka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:1221500600:30"/>by being kept, will diſſolve and take up the calculous Incruſtations, upon the Sides and Bottoms of Chamber-pots.</p>
            <p n="2">II. In order to ſatisfy myſelf the better in this Affair, I thought it not amiſs to try what Effects my Urine, thus render'd alkaline by the Medicines, would have upon Stones taken from a human Body, by digeſting them in it with a gentle Heat. For this Purpoſe I took the Stones A and B, and ſawed each of them into Four Pieces, of nearly the ſame Shape and Size. A was a white hard Stone of an uniform Subſtance throughout. It conſiſted of Coats indeed, but theſe were all, as far as one could judge, perfectly alike. B was a brown Stone; it's Shell was hard and knotted, but the internal Parts were much ſofter. I called the ſeveral Pieces A 1, B 1; A 2, B 2; A 3, B 3; A 4, B 4; in order to denote thereby the ſeveral Liquors in which each was digeſted; 1 ſtanding for New River Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; 2 for a Mixture of Mrs. <hi>Stephens</hi>'s Powder and New River Water; 3 for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Urine; and 4 for my own Alkaline Urine. I then digeſted all theſe Pieces of Stone for a Week in their reſpective Liquors, with a gentle Heat. This Heat was intended to have been the ſame as that of Urine in the Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; but my Contrivances not being good, it was, at different Times, both conſiderably greater, and conſiderably leſs. I examined them pretty often, and recruited the Liquors as they waſted, with others of the ſame Kind.
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:1221500600:31"/>Two or three Days after they were put into Digeſtion, I obſerved that A 4 had ſome white Scales lying upon its Surface in ſeveral Parts, which fell off upon being preſs'd with my Nail. After a Week's Digeſtion, I took them out, and rubb'd them all with a Cloth. They were then laid in a Window till they became perfectly dry. And the following Table ſhews the Effects which the ſeveral Liquors had upon them.</p>

            <p n="3">III. By this Table it appears, that the Pieces A 4, B 4 in my alkaline Urine, had loſt more than any of the others; A 1, B 1, in New River Water, more than A 2, B 2 in the Mixture of Mrs. <hi>Stephens's</hi> Powder and New River Water; and that A 3, B 3 in common Urine had receiv'd a ſmall Addition. That my alkaline Urine ſhould occaſion the greateſt Loſs, is a Preſumption in favour of Mrs. <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phens</hi>'s Medicines; that the New River Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhould have a greater Effect, than the Mixture of Mrs. <hi>Stephens</hi>'s Powder and New
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:1221500600:32"/>River Water, was owing, I believe, to the Powder's adhering cloſely to the Stones in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Parts; which both kept the Water from coming freely in Contact with the Stones, and alſo added to their Weight; and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of Weight in A 3, B 3, is an Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the ſame Kind with the Growth of Stones in the Body. And upon examining A 3 accurately, I perceived that it had got an exceeding thin Coat in ſeveral Parts, which ſeparated eaſily, and which I ſuppoſed to be an Accretion from the ſtony Particles of the common Urine, in which it had been digeſted.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. After this I waſhed the ſeveral Pieces of the Stone A, and rubb'd them well with a Bruſh, ſo as to take off all looſe Parts; I took out the ſoft internal Parts of the Pieces of B, reſerving proper Portions of each of the hard Shells; I ſawed the Stones C, D, and E into Four Pieces each, of nearly the ſame Shape and Size, and F into Two; I took Two Pieces of the white Shell G, Two of the brown Nucleus H, and gave them all Names as in the following Table, in which 1 denotes New River Water, as before; 2 Mrs. <hi>Stephens</hi>'s Liquid; 3 common Urine, as before; and 4 my own alkaline Urine, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Theſe Pieces were digeſted for a Week, in the Manner above-mentioned, excepting that the Liquors were now changed every Morning, and all the Pieces rubb'd at the ſame Time with a wet Sponge. They were rubb'd alſo when taken out as clean as could
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:1221500600:33"/>be without Violence, and then laid in a Window till they were perfectly dry. And the following Table ſhows the Effects which the ſeveral Liquors had upon them.</p>

            <p n="5">V. By this Table it appears, that the Stones had loſt much more in general by this Week's Digeſtion, than by the former; which without doubt was owing in great meaſure to my hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rubbed them every Morning with a wet Sponge; and it was alſo upon this account, I ſuppoſe, that ſome of the Pieces in common Urine had loſt a little. However, the great Difference of Loſs in the ſeveral Pieces of the ſame Stone could not ariſe from this Cauſe; and the rubbing them gave me an Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of obſerving the Manner in which the ſeveral Liquors acted upon the Stones. This was, in general, giving a Whiteneſs to the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of the Stones, which, when it was rubbed off, left the Stone of its former Colour; but in thoſe which were moſt affected, ſoft white Scales fell off upon being rubbed, and ſome of them were corroded, and honey-combed. Thus the Pieces in New River Water had a White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs upon their Surface, and the Water itſelf became milky; A 2, A 4, C 2, C 4, F 4, and H 4 had all loſt white Scales; B 2, E 2 and E 4 were all pretty much corroded; D 2 a little corroded; B 4 was corroded within, and at the ſame time its knotted external Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face rendered ſmooth; D 4 had its brown Surface turned white, but G 4 ſeemed not to have been affected at all.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. In order to ſatisfy myſelf ſtill farther, I took all the foregoing Stones, H 3 and H 4 excepted, which were loſt by reaſon of their Smallneſs; and digeſted them again in their
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:1221500600:35"/>reſpective Liquors, having now got a Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, by which they were kept in a Heat, not differing materially from that of Urine in the Bladder. I got alſo Two ſmall round Stones from the Reverend Dr. <hi>Hales,</hi> which were both taken out of the Bladder of the ſame Perſon, and which the Doctor judged to be very hard ones, and called them I 3 and I 4. I 3 weighed Twenty-five Grains and an half, and was put into common Urine; I 4 weighed Twenty-one Grains and an half, and was put into my own alkaline Urine. I began the Digeſtion <hi>July</hi> 26. The Liquors were changed every Day during the whole Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion, and the Stones all rubbed with a wet Sponge every Day for the firſt Ten Days; then once in Three or Four Days till <hi>Sept.</hi> 3, but after that not at all. And the following Table ſhews the Day on which each Stone was either ſo far waſted as not to be found, or reduced to ſuch a Size, as to be in Danger of being confounded with the ſmall Pieces, which fell from the reſt.</p>

            <p n="8">VIII. The Manner in which the other Pieces waſted, was in general the ſame as that which is deſcribed above in the 6th Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph, excepting that thoſe in New River
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:1221500600:37"/>Water became after ſome time as much honey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>combed as the reſt, and waſted as faſt; that D 4 and G 4 remained unaltered to Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance for a long time, and then grew quite rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in a few Days; and that I 4, the ſmall hard Stone given me by Dr. <hi>Hales,</hi> had ſeveral Cracks in it, after about a Month's Digeſtion.</p>
            <p n="9">IX. Beſides theſe I made ſeveral other Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments, the Reſult of which it may not be improper juſt to mention.</p>
            <p n="10">X. I digeſted different Pieces of the ſame Stones in my own alkaline Urine, with diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Heats; the one, that of Urine in the Bladder, the other ſo great, that I could not bear my Hand at reſt in it; and I found, that the leſs Heat had the greater Effect.</p>
            <p n="11">XI. I boiled different Pieces of the ſame Stones in common Water, my own alkaline Urine, and common Urine, for Five Hours each. Thoſe in Water and my Urine waſted conſiderably, and the Surface of the laſt was turned white and ſoft; but thoſe in common Urine had little Effect produced upon them.</p>
            <p n="12">XII. I digeſted different Pieces of the ſame Stones in common Water, the diſtilled Water of Water-Pepper, the Juice and the Decoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it; and found that common Water had a greater Effect than any of theſe. The Heat in this and all the following Experiments did not differ materially from that of Urine in the Bladder.</p>
            <p n="13">XIII. I digeſted Pieces of Stones taken from the human Bladder, from the Bladders of
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:1221500600:38"/>Dogs, and the Stomachs of Horſes, in <hi>Thames</hi> Water, and in Pump Water, and found, that both the Waters diſſolved all the human Stones intirely, and waſted the others very much; but the <hi>Thames</hi> Water had the quickeſt Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. The Waters were changed every Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, at which time I obſerved, that the Pump Water poured on the Day before, had always ſome Bubbles upon it. Some of the human Stones were cracked during the Diſſolution.</p>
            <p n="14">XIV. I digeſted Pieces of the ſame Dogs and Horſes Stones in common Urine, and my own alkaline Urine; but did not obſerve any Effect, except that one of the Dog's Stones ſeemed a little ſoftened by my Urine.</p>
            <p n="15">XV. I digeſted a large Kidney-ſtone, Two Pieces that had been boiled in my alkaline Urine, and a round hard Stone in common Urine, which was a Mixture of different Urines. The Kidney-ſtone and the Two Pieces loſt ſomething of their Weight. The round hard Stone grew black at firſt, but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it was waſted or not, I cannot determine from its Appearance, and I had not weighed it. The Surface of the Kidney-ſtone was rendered ſo brittle, that large Scales broke off with very little Force, but they were neither white nor ſoft.</p>
            <p n="16">XVI. I digeſted a large Kidney-ſtone of the ſame Shape, Size and Texture, with the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going, and taken out of the other Kidney of the ſame Perſon, with Twelve different Stones, or Pieces of Stones, in the alkaline Urine of a
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:1221500600:39"/>Gentleman, who took Mrs. <hi>Stephens</hi>'s Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines. They all waſted very faſt, excepting one Piece, which received a ſmall Addition. It was iron-coloured, and exceedingly hard, as I found by ſawing it. It appeared to me, that this Gentleman's Urine had in general a quicker Effect than my own. The Stones mentioned in this, the 10th, 13th, 14th and 15th Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphs, were none of them rubbed.</p>
            <p n="17">XVII. There are ſome Appearances men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in this Abſtract, which I cannot ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for; but if the Experiments were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated with more Accuracy, and other new ones tried, it is probable, that many uſeful Diſcoveries would ariſe. And thus much I think one may venture to conclude, even from theſe Experiments, that the Diſſolutions by the ſeveral Sorts of common Water prove againſt the abſolute Neceſſity of an acrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious Liquid for this Purpoſe, and that thoſe by the Two alkaline Urines are ſtrong Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptions in Favour of Mrs. <hi>Stephens</hi>'s Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, eſpecially when compared with the foregoing Caſes. I ſhall be much obliged to any Gentleman, who will furniſh me with Stones, for the farther Proſecution of this Matter.</p>
