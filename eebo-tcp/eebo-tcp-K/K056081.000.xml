            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>MEN, in delineating the divine attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes,
have too generally blended with
them all their own imperfections. Their
ſeveral, ſeparate intereſts, and contradictory paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
have led them, even under the character of
<hi>the One God,</hi> to repreſent to us almoſt as many dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
gods, as impeached the wiſdom, diſgraced
the worſhip, and ſullied all the glory of the antient
Greeks and Romans. Nay, the ſame perſons, in
their very <hi>Harmonies,</hi> have repreſented one attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute,
as a flat contradiction to another. Blind
and preſumptuous creatures! It is well for your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
that your jarring ſyſtems cannot at all af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
the real character of the Supreme Being. To
the joy of the whole univerſe, whatever you have
ſaid, and whatever you may ſtill ſay, <hi>God is the
ſame yeſterday, to-day, and for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, ſhould it be ſtill aſked, To what cauſes are
we to aſcribe the monſtrous miſrepreſentations of
the Deity which daily occur? After what has been
ſaid above, I need only reply, Is not the cauſe
quite obvious? Or, if deſired to explain myſelf
more particularly, I would obſerve, That men,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0633700300:3"/>
inſtead of ſeriouſly conſulting the works and will
of God, and hence inferring what his perfections
are, have, on the contrary, regarded only their
own tempers and inclinations, and, to vindicate
all the follies and impieties ariſing from theſe, have
endeavoured to perſuade the world, that the
peerleſs Jehovah is <hi>altogether ſuch a one as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</hi>
As men have been interchangeably actuated
with different malignant paſſions, they have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably
repreſented to themſelves a God, who
would be pleaſed with ſuch worſhippers. And thus
have they, at different times, endeavoured to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt
him of his moſt honourable perfections: they
have repeatedly, indeed, been ſo glaringly incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent
with themſelves, as to adore him, in the
ſame breath, as <hi>the Father of all mercies,</hi> and as <hi>a
Being without any mercy at all,</hi> that is, a <hi>reprobating
God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, of all the perfections of the ever bleſſed
God, his juſtice has perhaps, in general, been the
leaſt underſtood. However, under no other cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racteriſtic
whatever, has he been ſo ſhockingly
miſrepreſented and blaſphemed. The juſtice of
God, indeed, has been frequently deſcribed in
ſuch a light, as ſuppoſed him diſpoſſeſſed of every
endearing excellency, as declared him not the
Friend and Father, but the mercileſs Tyrant of the
univerſe, and as led us to think upon his holy
name, not with hope, confidence, and joy. but
with all the trembling horrors of deſpair. Men, in
vindicating what they called the Juſtice of God, have
too often loſt fight of his goodneſs; nay, have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained
and propagated ſuch ideas of juſtice, as
abſolutely militated againſt the poſſibility of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and as forbad us to conſider him as at all
merciful, gracious, compaſſionate, forbearing, and
long-ſuffering. This has been always the caſe,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0633700300:4"/>
when juſtice has been repreſented as an eſſential
obligation, or unchangeable diſpoſition in the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
Being, to puniſh every the leaſt offence,
iniquity, tranſgreſſion, or ſin, in every rational
creature, or, when by ſaying, that <q>God was
juſt,</q> it was meant, that, <q>there was no for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs
with him, without an equivalent ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</q>
But, the bare mention of ſuch an idea
of juſtice, muſt, I ſhould think, convince every
rational being, that it is falſe. It muſt be plainly
ſeen, that juſtice, in this light, or, rather in this
darkneſs, is only another term for rigour, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexible
rigour, and implacable ſeverity; a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
that we deteſt even in man, and which we
cannot therefore apply to the infinitely adorable
God, without being guilty of the moſt outrageous
impiety. It muſt, I ſay, plainly be ſeen, that if
juſtice ſignified rigour, God could not be juſt and
good, at the ſame time: for the one is as contrary
to the other, as light is to darkneſs. This will be
evident, from the univerſally allowed acceptation
of the terms.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place then, goodneſs implies, it is
well known, that benefits are beſtowed without the
proſpect of any return. But rigour implies, as the
proverb goes, that <hi>nothing is done for nothing.</hi>
Again, the goodneſs of God implies, that he is not
ſtrict to mark our iniquities. But rigour, if this
could be ſuppoſed to be one of his attributes, muſt
make him puniſh, with exact weight and meaſure,
every failing, not excepting the ſmalleſt, of which
any being is guilty. Hence, then, it is obvious,
that thoſe who underſtand, by the juſtice of God,
his unchangeable diſpoſition not to pardon the
leaſt violation of his laws, without an equivalent
ſatisfaction, inaſmuch as they thus declare, that
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0633700300:5"/>
there is no forgiveneſs with him, expreſsly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare,
at the ſame time, that he is neither mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful,
nor good. Nor do they at all alter the caſe,
by ſuppoſing that he will accept that debt from
another, which the delinquent himſelf is not able
to pay; for, this is ſtill ſuppoſing, that there is no
forgiveneſs with him, or that there is no goodneſs
with him, for a good being muſt have forgiveneſs
in himſelf. Accordingly, we never aſcribe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs,
or goodneſs, to the man, who inſiſts
upon the whole of his debt, and who will never
be ſatisfied until the whole is paid, though he
ſhould conſent. at the ſame time, to accept this
debt from another beſides the perſon who owes it;
for, by accepting it even from another, he has all
he could demand, and all he could form any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions
to have a right to receive. Nor do we
ever aſcribe any merit or praiſe to ſuch a man;
theſe are due only to him who paid the debt, not
at all to him who received it to the full, though
from the hand of a third perſon: Surely, then,
we cannot compare the ever bleſſed God to ſuch
a man; we cannot diveſt him of goodneſs; we
cannot repreſent him in a light that would fix a
reproach upon any of his imperfect creatures.
We cannot ſuppoſe, that there is any goodneſs or
mercy in the univerſe, if not with him, the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of the whole. We cannot ſuppoſe, that
any of his creatures are more benevolently diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
than the great Creator. We muſt ſuppoſe
that, if there be any love, any tenderneſs, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion,
in any being whatever, theſe muſt reſide,
in their infinite fullneſs, in the Almighty and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
God. Rigour, therefore, cannot be one
of his attributes. His juſtice muſt be ſuch, as ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
him the object of our moſt delightful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templations,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0633700300:6"/>
and as is conſiſtent, therefore, with
all his other moſt glorious perfections. This, I
ſhall now endeavour to ſhew, is not only the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine
of reaſon, but is likewiſe deducible from the
whole volume of ſcripture.</p>
            <p>To this purpoſe, then, a fine field for ſatisfying
all our enquiries is opened to us in the eighteenth
chapter of the book of Geneſis, which, from the
twentieth to the end of the thirty-ſecond verſe, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly
treats of the juſtice of God. <hi>The LORD
ſaid,</hi> to Abraham, <hi>becauſe the cry of Sodom and
Gomorrah is great, and their ſin is very grievous;
I will go down now, and ſee whether they have done
altogether according to the cry of it, which is come
unto me, and if not, I will know</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Mere cavillers only can object to the familiarity of the language uſed in this paſſage.</note>.—<hi>And Abraham
drew near, and ſaid, Wilt thou alſo deſtroy the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
with the wicked? Peradventure there be fifty
righteous within the city: wilt Thou alſo deſtroy and
not ſpare the place for the fifty righteous that are</hi>
therein? <hi>That be far from Thee, to do after this
manner, to ſlay the righteous with the wicked: and
that the righteous ſhould be as the wicked, that be far
from thee: SHALL NOT THE JUDGE OF ALL
THE EARTH DO RIGHT? And the Lord ſaid,
If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city,
then I will ſpare all the place for their ſakes. And
Abraham anſwered and ſaid, Behold now, I have
taken upon me to ſpeak unto the LORD, who am but
duſt and aſhes. Peradventure, there ſhall lack five of
the fifty righteous: wilt thou deſtroy all the city for</hi> lack
of <hi>five? And he ſaid, If I find there forty and five,
I will not deſtroy</hi> it. <hi>And he ſpake unto him yet
again, and ſaid, Peradventure there ſhall be forty
found there. And he ſaid, I will not do it for forty's
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0633700300:7"/>
ſake. And he ſaid unto him, O let not the LORD
be angry, and I will ſpeak: Peradventure there ſhall
thirty be found there. And he ſaid, I will not do it
if I find thirty there. And he ſaid, Behold now, I
have taken upon me to ſpeak unto the LORD: Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure
there ſhall be twenty found there. And he
ſaid, I will not deſtroy it for twenty's ſake. And he
ſaid, Oh let not the LORD be angry, and I will
ſpeak yet but this once: Peradventure ten ſhall be
found there. And he ſaid, I will not deſtroy it for
ten's ſake.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, there is not a ſingle circumſtance in this
hiſtory, which can lead us to conclude, that the
Juſtice of God is repugnant to his merey, but only
that it eſſentially belongs to him, as a juſt being,
to make a diſtinction between the righteous and
the wicked, and not to deſtroy the innocent with
the guilty. Abraham intreated God not to puniſh,
but to ſpare, to ſpare even the guilty, if it ſhould
ſeem good to his infinite wiſdom, or, if they were
found to be paſt hopes, to be incorrigibly hardened
and impenitent, to vindicate his juſtice, by ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
redemption to the righteous. Nor did the
LORD threaten to deſtroy Sodom and Gomor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah,
becauſe the inhabitants were imperfect crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
or becauſe they had fallen into involuntary
errors, or becauſe that, though they might be then
penitent, they had formerly been wicked; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
that they were totally depraved, becauſe
they had irreclaimably given themſelves up to the
fouleſt vices that could be perpetrated or invented,
and that no means of ſalvation that were offered
them, could work a reformation in them, <q>And
the Lord ſaid, becauſe the cry of Sodom and
Gomorrah is <hi>great,</hi> and becauſe their ſin is <hi>very
grievous,</hi> I will ſee whether they have done ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0633700300:8"/>
to the cry of it that is come unto me.</q>
From which it may be concluded, that, if their
ſins had not been of the deepeſt dye, and ſuch as
admitted of no ſort of extenuation; and had they
not reſolved to continue in them too, againſt all
poſſible means of conviction, God would ſtill have
been gracious to them, and granted them a ſpace
for repentance. We learn accordingly, that, after
the inhabitants of Sodom and Gomorrah had been
greatly corrupted, ſentence was not ſuddenly exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
againſt them, but that Lot, on the contrary,
was ſent to ſojourn among them, to reprove them
for their impieties, and to admoniſh and perſuade
them, if poſſible, to repent and live: and it was
not until they had rejected theſe means of grace,
abuſed the divine forbearance and long-ſuffering,
waxed ſtill worſe and worſe, and wholly given them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
up to work all iniquity with greedineſs, that
the impending judgments of God were let looſe
upon them. In his whole conduct towards this
people, his juſtice did not at all interfere with his
mercy, his juſtice did not hinder the calls of grace
and reconciliation for a longtime to take place; his
mercy was extended towards them until the farther
extenſion of it could be of no uſe to them; indeed
until mercy and goodneſs to other nations rendered
their deſtruction neceſſary. Abraham, therefore,
did not addreſs God, ſaying, that his juſtice re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
immediate vengeance upon all his adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
or that his juſtice was irreconcileable with his
pardoning, or forbearing to puniſh, any criminal<note n="*" place="bottom">This, however, muſt have been his language, had he entertained the common ſhocking ideas of the divine juſtice, or any ideas of this divine attribute at all ſimilar to theſe.</note>,
but that his juſtice could not ſuffer any evil to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fal
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0633700300:9"/>
the righteous. <q>Abraham drew near and ſaid,
Wilt thou alſo deſtroy the righteous with the
wicked? Peradventure there be fifty righteous
within the city: wilt thou alſo deſtroy, and not
ſpare the place for the fifty righteous that are
therein? That be far from thee, to do after this
manner: and, that the righteous ſhould be as
the wicked, that be far from thee. Shall not the
judge of all the earth do right?</q> Here, the line
of juſtice is exactly drawn. And it has not, we ſee,
the leaſt reſpect to any kind of implacability in the
Divine Mind, nor does it ſuppoſe that God cannot
<hi>freely</hi> pardon the truly penitent, in perfect conſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency
with the full exerciſe of his juſtice, but is
wholly confined to this rule, that God will make a
proper diſtinction between the righteous and the
wicked, and that he will puniſh none more than
their iniquities deſerve. In other words, the Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of God ſignifies that he is a being of abſolute
and unchangeable rectitude, and that there is not
the moſt diſtant ſhadow of any kind of injuſtice
with him; or, as Moſes deſcribes him, cloathed
with this attribute, that, <hi>he is the rock, his work is
perfect; for all his ways are judgment; a God of
truth, and without iniquity, juſt and right is he.</hi>
But here it ſhould be particularly obſerved, (when
we ſay that the Juſtice of God ſignifies that there
is no <hi>injuſtice</hi> with him) that forgiveneſs of ſin is
not to be included in our idea of injuſtice: for, if
it was, what ſhould become of the whole univerſe
of dependant beings? God chargeth his very an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
with folly; and as to the rational beings in this
world, <hi>what man is he, that liveth and ſinneth not?</hi>
If God was, therefore, ſtrict to mark our iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
or if his juſtice and pardoning mercy were
at variance, miſery muſt inevitably be the portion
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0633700300:10"/>
of the whole human race. But, it is our comfort,
that God is not ſtrict to mark our iniquities, that
he delighteth not in the death of a ſinner, that he
is gracious, forbearing, and long-ſuffering towards
us, and not willing that any ſhould periſh. It is
our comfort that his juſtice is in no reſpect repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
to his goodneſs, that his juſtice freely admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
of the infinite riches of his grace, that his juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
does not at all imply, that he is <hi>an inflexibly ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous
judge,</hi> but only, that, <q>he will make a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
diſtinction between the righteous and the
wicked, that he will not puniſh the wicked more
than their iniquities deſerve, that he will not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appoint
the hopes, nor fruſtrate the expectations
that he has raiſed in his creatures, and that he
is no reſpecter of perſons.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In the firſt place, <q>The Juſtice of God implies,
that he will make a proper diſtinction between
the righteous and the wicked.</q> That the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
ſhould be as the wicked, that be far from
God? Shall not the judge of all the earth do
right? It would be obviouſly wrong to ſlay the
righteous with the wicked, or to put the wicked on
a level with the righteous: and it would be more
wrong ſtill, it would be truly diabolical, to prefer
any of the wicked to any of the righteous, and,
merely to diſplay his power, to introduce any of
the wicked to a place of happineſs, and to conſign
any of the righteous to a place of miſery. God,
therefore, as a juſt being, cannot admit the wicked
to the joys of the righteous; a diſtinction muſt
take place, and a diſtinction among the righteous
themſelves, according as they ſeverally have been
more or leſs obedient to his voice. But, then, it
can be no injuſtice to the righteous, to grant the
wicked a ſpace for repentance; nay, to bear long
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0633700300:11"/>
with them, to ſee if they will turn from their evil
ways, and to give them peace and reconciliation,
when influenced by that wiſdom which deſcended
from above, and following the innate dictates of
their own minds, they truly <hi>ſeek the Lord and find
him.</hi> If this was injuſtice, the righteous themſelves
could have no hope; for they have not been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
found perfect before God, they could, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
only look, in this caſe, for a leſs degree of
puniſhment than would be inflicted on the wicked.
But all the ends of juſtice muſt, it is obvious, be
completely anſwered, by rewarding the righteous,
according to their ſincere though imperfect obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
and by puniſhing the wicked, only when
their puniſhment becomes neceſſary, when they
become reprobate to every good work; when,
therefore, farther forbearance towards them, not
being ſufficient to reform them, could be of no uſe
to themſelves, and might be cruelty to the reſt of
the creation.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <q>The Juſtice of God implies, that,
he will not puniſh the wicked more than their
iniquities deſerve.</q> This is obvious, at firſt view:
for, ſtrict juſtice can never exceed in its ſentence
the proportion of guilt in any offender. God,
therefore, as a juſt being, cannot puniſh us for
what we could not do, nor for what we could
not avoid doing, nor for any iniquities of
others, to which we were no way acceſſary, nor
conſenting. On the contrary, as the moſt juſt
of all beings, he may be long-ſuffering towards us,
and delay his judgments until the ruin of the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
would be the conſequence of any farther de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay;
and, as the moſt holy of all beings, he may
likewiſe graciouſly accept the returning penitent.
How infinitely injurious is it to his juſtice, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
even to inſinuate, that he will inflict endleſs
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0633700300:12"/>
torments upon a very great majority of his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
for a crime that was committed before they
exiſted, ſix thouſand years before <hi>many</hi> of them
exiſted, and that <hi>there are millions of infants in hell
not a ſpan long?</hi> I cannot ſo much as mention this
doctrine of devils without the utmoſt horror. Nor
ſhould I mention it at all, it reflects ſuch diſhonour
and reproach upon the children of men, to ſuppoſe
that any individual of them is capable of believing
it, was it not known that there are ſtill ſome who
zealouſly maintain and propagate it. Let ſuch en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
their ſentiments, if they can. But, while rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
and revelation have any influence upon the
human mind, their God will be conſidered as a
fictitious being, the work of a bewildered imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and as ſuch will be diſcarded out of the
world.</p>
            <p>But, thirdly, <q>The Juſtice of God requires, that
he will not diſappoint the hopes, nor fruſtrate the
expectations which he has raiſed in his creatures.</q>
Juſtice, even among mankind, requires, that we
ſhould perform all our obligations to the full; that,
if we have made any promiſes, we ſhould keep
them, that, if we have cheriſhed any particular
confidence in us, if we have even encouraged of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders
to hope for our favour, we ſhould not
cruelly deceive them. Therefore the Juſtice of
God requires, that he will fulfil all thoſe expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
which we are emboldened to form of his
goodneſs. Though Juſtice could not oblige him
to promiſe immortality to thoſe who never deſerved
it; yet juſtice enſures immortality to the righteous
after it is promiſed; and juſtice enſures pardon to
the truly penitent, after they are once encouraged
to hope for it at the throne of grace. Juſtice, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
muſt ſatify thoſe deſires of living beyond the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0633700300:13"/>
grave, which for ever animate us, muſt crown us
with unfading glory and honour, if we live up to
the terms of the bleſſed goſpel, muſt give us at all
times free acceſs to the throne of mercy, and
crown all our <hi>ſincere</hi> though <hi>imperfect</hi> endeavours,
to humble ourſelves before God, and to ſerve him
in ſpirit and in truth, with all thoſe rewards that
are repreſented to us in the ſacred treaſury of his
word. The apoſtle, therefore, ſays, <q>God is not
<hi>unrighteous</hi> to forget your labour of love;</q> ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying,
that after God has encouraged us, by a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
continuance in well doing, to ſeek for glory,
honour, and immortality, he cannot, conſiſtently
with his juſtice, diſappoint the hopes of his faithful
ſervants.</p>
            <p>But, laſtly, <q>The Juſtice of God requires, that
he ſhould be no reſpecter of perſons.</q> Juſtice,
in the diſtribution of gifts or rewards, can only
conſider the worthineſs or unworthineſs of any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
perſon, cannot reſpect any one man in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
to any other man of exactly the ſame pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions
to favour. In the court of juſtice, the
rich and the poor, the bond and the free, the
prince and the peaſant, muſt be upon the ſame
common level. In the court of juſtice, there can
be no taking of bribes, nor diſtinction of country,
fect, or party. And, here, the good that we would
have done but could not. muſt ſet us in the ſame
light with thoſe, who had the opportunity and abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
as well as the will to do the ſame good. God,
therefore as a juſt being<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> can have no favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites
among his children, independently of their
devotedneſs to his ſervice. He cannot reſpect
their perſons, nor be biaſſed by pompous appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances:
but as he has made of one blood all nations
of men to dwell upon the face of the whole earth,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0633700300:14"/>
whether you be Jew or Greek, ruler or ſubject,
maſter or ſervant, born in the firſt or in the laſt
ages of the world, it makes no difference in his
eye. The only difference that he can make muſt
ariſe from the different circumſtances in which
mankind have been placed. But, this difference
he muſt make as no reſpecter of perſons. He can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
require brick where there was no ſtraw. He
can only require a benevolent heart, where there
is neither ſilver nor gold: and, he cannot judge
thoſe by the law, who had not the law, nor thoſe
by the goſpel who had not the goſpel. Where he
has given ten talents, though there he muſt be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
to look for the improvement of ten; yet,
where he has given only five talents, he can only
look for the improvement of five; and, where he
has given only two talents, he can only look for
the improvement of two. In ſhort, the equally,
ſincere and upright in his ſervice, all the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
or diſadvantages of their ſituation being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered,
muſt be equally acceptable with him, and
equally rewarded by him.</p>
            <p>Having thus endeavoured to give the reader
right apprehenſions of the divine juſtice, and ſuch
as repreſent the great God to us, not in a forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
but in an amiable and endearing light, I
ſhall now proceed to ſhew that the juſtice of God
is, and muſt be ſuch as I have here deſcribed it.</p>
            <p>This I ſhall, firſt, endeavour to ſhew, upon the
principles of reaſon, from his other perfections;
and, ſecondly, from the ſcriptural account of his
dealings with the children of men.</p>
            <p>There can, then, it is obvious, in the firſt place,
be no temptation to injuſtice, but from depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
or want, or from motives of benefitting our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
at the expence of others. God, therefore,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0633700300:15"/>
being ſupremely exalted above all principalities and
powers, the fountain of all being, the Lord of the
whole creation, and poſſeſſing in himſelf an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
and independant fullneſs of all poſſible bliſs,
and it being impoſſible that he can derive any be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
from the oppreſſion, or total extinction of
any, or of all his creatures: God, therefore, I ſay,
cannot poſſibly do an unjuſt thing. As all men
in common are equally his own offspring, ſo far
he can make no diſtinction between them, but
every one man muſt be as much the object of his
care and bounty as every other man. And, as he
could have no poſſible motive to create any being,
but to make that being happy, he therefore cannot
poſſibly take pleaſure in the miſery of any creature,
nor ſuffer any creature to labour under oppreſſion
without ſufficient reaſon, unleſs it be its own fault,
or he ſhould know perplexed and cloudy circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
to be neceſſarily conducive to improve it
in knowledge, virtue, and happineſs. Farther, as
the infinite mind muſt delight in thoſe perfections
in others which he exerciſeth himſelf, muſt love
his own image in his creatures, muſt approve of the
grateful and upright heart, muſt conſequently diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>approve
of the profane and diſobedient wretch;
he muſt, therefore, make a proper diſtinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the righteous and the wicked, muſt crown
the righteous with greater or with leſſer dignity and
glory, according to their ſeveral attainments in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs
and perfection, and muſt debar the wicked
of the joys of the righteous. But, that the juſtice
of God, at the ſame time, is in no caſe repugnant
to his mercy, is demonſtrable from our own exiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
from the numberleſs unceaſing bleſſings
which we daily receive, and from the animating
hopes, we are taught to entertain, of more enlarged
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0633700300:16"/>
communications of the divine favour in a future
ſcene. We know, that we have all ſinned againſt
him, and that if he ſhould ſtrictly deal with us <hi>after
our tranſgreſſions,</hi> or determine not to pardon any
of our treſpaſſes againſt him, we muſt long ago
have been conſumed. We know, therefore, that
his juſtice and mercy are not at variance, that his
juſtice is conſiſtent with his patience, forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
and long-ſuffering, that his juſtice can be
ſlow to puniſh, and ready to pardon, and that it
can ſpare the guilty themſelves, until they have
repeatedly rebelled againſt the divine laws, thrown
off the divine government entirely, and rejected
all thoſe means of conviction and ſalvation, that
could be reaſonably extended towards them, or
be reaſonably expected from infinite benevolence.
Once more, as the only end of deferring puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
can be the reformation of the offender, and
as we have a reliſh for, and are taught to look for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
to a future and everlaſting ſtate of happineſs,
upon our ſincere though imperfect endeavours to
ſerve God; God, therefore, becauſe ſo great, ſo
glorious, and independant a ſovereign, could have
no poſſible motives to mock the creatures of his
power, but certainly intendeth us for ſuch a ſtate,
and certainly will introduce us to ſuch a ſtate, if
we make the beſt preparations in our power for it.
Thoſe hopes of the righteous, <hi>theſe longings after
immortality,</hi> which his infinite goodneſs, without
any claim or merit on our part, originally infuſed
into the ſoul, his infinite juſtice muſt fully ſatisfy.
He cannot, as the univerſal Father, and the all-ſufficient
God, diſappoint any of thoſe expectations
which he has raiſed in his rational creatures. His
juſtice, I ſay, muſt complete thoſe views, and, if
we live up to the dictates of his wiſdom, ſatisfy
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0633700300:17"/>
thoſe boundleſs deſires with which his adorable
and infinite goodneſs has inſpired us.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the ſentiments of reaſon upon this
ſubject: and, in perfect harmony with theſe, are
the hiſtory of God's dealings with the children of
men from the beginning of the world, and the
plain declaration of his revealed will, which are
recorded for our inſtruction in the holy ſcriptures.
The firſt man, Adam, experienced no kind of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnancy
between the divine juſtice and the divine
mercy. It was ſaid even to Cain, after he <hi>was
very wroth, and his countenance fell—If thou doeſt
well ſhalt thou not be accepted?</hi> Nay, the juſtice,
which afterwards puniſhed him for his great wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
admitted of the extenſion of mercy, upon
his repentance; and his puniſhment ſeems to have
been purpoſely calculated to lead him to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.
The doctrine, which I have been endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
to eſtabliſh is ſtill farther confirmed, from
the hiſtory of David, Manaſſeh, and many other
remarkable delinquents. But, as it would be an
endleſs work, ſo it does not ſeem neceſſary to
examine the divine diſpenſations towards each
individual, whoſe virtues, or vices, or whoſe
virtues and vices together, are held up to
our obſervation in the ſcriptures. The hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
of the antediluvian world, the whole hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
of the Jews, from the beginning to end,
the hiſtory of Nineveh and Babylon, and Tyre
and Sidon, and the deplorable ſtate of the
world, when the man Chriſt Jeſus revealed all the
riches of God's grace to his moſt abandoned off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring,
are all to my purpoſe. To my purpoſe
likewiſe are the innate ſentiments of the human
mind, as theſe are ſucceſſively repreſented to us in
the ſcriptures. <q>Doth God pervert judgment,
ſays Bildad, or doth the Almighty pervert juſtice?</q>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:0633700300:18"/>
Meaning, that God could not do an unjuſt thing.
<q>Is it good unto thee,</q> ſays Job, <q>that thou
ſhould'ſt oppreſs? that thou ſhould deſpiſe the
work of thine hands? and ſhine upon the council
of the wicked? He is excellent—in plenty of
juſtice,</q> ſays Elihu; <q>he will not afflict,</q> but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to wiſdom and equity; <q>and he ſhall judge
the world in righteouſneſs,</q> ſays the Pſalmiſt, not
meaning with rigour, but without injuſtice; <q>he
ſhall miniſter judgment to the people in upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
The LORD alſo will be a refuge for the
oppreſſed, a refuge in times of trouble. And they
that know thy name, will put their truſt in thee;
for thou, LORD, haſt not forſaken them that
ſeek thee.</q> Again, the Pſalmiſt ſays, <q>Juſtice
and judgment are the habitation of thy throne;
mercy and truth ſhall go before thy face.</q> In
like manner, God is repreſented, by the prophet
Jeremiah, as proclaiming his own character, <q>I
am the LORD, who exerciſe loving kindneſs,
judgment, and righteouſneſs in the earth; for in
theſe things I delight, ſaith the LORD.</q> Here,
<hi>loving-kindneſs</hi> can evidently bear no oppoſition to
<hi>righteouſneſs</hi> or <hi>juſtice,</hi> though God will make a
diſtinction between the righteous and the wicked,
and inflict tremendous puniſhments upon the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrigibly
wicked, according to the preceding and
following verſes. This is alſo the ſentiment of
Eliphaz, when he ſays. <q>Shall mortal man be
more juſt than his Maker?</q> Farther, the ideas
which I endeavoured to convey of the <hi>impartial</hi>
juſtice of God, are likewiſe uniformly handed
down to us by the ſacred penmen. <q>He accepteth
not the perſons of princes, nor re gardeth the rich
more than the poor,</q> 
               <hi>Job</hi> xxxiv. 19. <q>Are ye
not as the children of the Ethiopians unto me, O
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0633700300:19"/>
children of Iſrael, ſaith the LORD.</q> 
               <q>Of a
truth I perceive, ſays Peter, that God is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecter
of perſons.</q> Paul repeatedly ſays the ſame
thing, and aſks the Romans, <q>Is he the God of
the Jews only? Is he not alſo the God of the
Gentiles? Yea, of the Gentiles alſo.</q> Again,
that the Juſtice of God implies, that he will fulfil
thoſe expectations which he has raiſed in his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
is likewiſe expreſsly aſſerted in the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
<q>I will not leave thee,</q> ſaid he to Jacob,
<q>until I have done that which I have ſpoken to
thee of.</q> 
               <q>Thy councils of old are faithfulneſs
and truth, <bibl>
                     <hi>Iſa.</hi> xxv. 1.</bibl>
               </q> 
               <q>All the promiſes of
God in him, are yea. and in him amen, unto
the glory of God, <bibl>2 <hi>Cor.</hi> i. 20.</bibl>
               </q> 
               <q>The LORD
thy God, he is God, the faithful God, <bibl>
                     <hi>Deute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron.</hi>
vii. 9.</bibl>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>More teſtimonies from the ſacred writings will
come in our way as we proceed. At preſent we
ſee that the ſcriptural accounts of the Juſtice of
God, do not, any more than the poſitive deduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Reaſon, repreſent him in a forbidding,
but, on the contrary, in an endearing light, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
our truſt and confidence in him, and lead
us, if we love him, and keep his commandments,
to caſt all our cares and burthens upon him. If
we ſearch the ſcriptures from beginning to end, we
ſhall not meet with a ſingle paſſage, which informs
us, that he cannot pardon the leaſt tranſgreſſion
without a proportionable recompence, but, on the
contrary, that <hi>he knoweth our frame, and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bereth
that we are duſt,</hi> that he will not, therefore,
make a rigorous enquiry into our paſt tranſgreſſions,
but that, <hi>if we turn unto him, he will turn
unto us,</hi> and that, if the wicked man turneth away
from his wickedneſs which he has committed, He
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0633700300:20"/>
will <hi>abundantly pardon, and ſave his ſoul alive.</hi> In
the ſcriptures, the Juſtice of God is no where re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented
as the cauſe of confuſion and terror to
the righteous, but as their ſtrong hold and ſecurity,
that they ſhall never be moved. Thus we have al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ready
ſeen, that Abraham underſtood it, when he
pleaded for the people of Sodom, and expreſſed
his confidence in God, as the Righteous judge of all
the earth. He did not mean, in any part of his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs,
that thoſe righteous perſons for whom he
pleaded, had never ſinned in thought, word, or
deed. He only ſuppoſed that their hearts were
right towards God for the preſent, and that, of
whatever imperfections they had been guilty in
time paſt, they were now ſincerely devoted to his
ſervice. Upon this foundation, he preſumes that
it would be <hi>unjuſt</hi> in God to involve them in the
ſame deſtruction with the inflexibly impenitent. To
the ſame purpoſe Jehoſaphat inſtructed the judges
of Iſrael.—<q>There is no iniquity with the LORD
our God, nor reſpect of perſons, nor taking of
gifts:</q> by which he did not mean that the judges
ſhould puniſh, with the utmoſt rigour, every miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demeanor
in thoſe delinquents that ſhould come
before them, but only that they ſhould not be biaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
by any rewards, to wink at the oppreſſion of
the innocent, or to patronize the evil-doer. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
we are repeatedly told, that God <hi>delighteth
not in the death of a ſinner, but rather that he ſhould
turn from his wickedneſs and live:</hi> which could not
be the caſe, if the Juſtice of God was at all repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
to his mercy. Nay, when God himſelf ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals
to his juſtice, he not only ſhews that it was
tempered with mercy, but that it was wholly regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
by the moſt tender, boundleſs mercy.
<q>Judge, I pray you,</q> ſays he, <q>between me and my
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0633700300:21"/>
vineyard. What could have been done more to
my vineyard, that I have not done in it?</q> Where
he ſignifies, that the glory of his juſtice, conſiſts in
kindneſs and compaſſions, and in applying every
reaſonable means that can be offered for the reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
and ſalvation of his back-ſliding people.
Words cannot more ſtrongly expreſs this ſentiment
than we find it in <hi>Ezekiel</hi> xviii. 25. <q>Hear now,
O houſe of Iſrael, is not my way equal?</q> The
<hi>way,</hi> or <hi>diſpenſation</hi> of God referred to here, is
that the children ſhould not bear the iniquities of
the fathers, that the ſoul which ſinned alone ſhould
die, and that God has not any pleaſure at all that
the wicked ſhould die, but rather that they ſhould
turn from their evil ways and live. Are not my
ways equal? Am not I juſt? when, inſtead of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing
one for the iniquities of another, or rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly
marking every iniquity committed againſt my
authority, I am even willing to pardon all the
tranſgreſſions, however enormous and inexcuſable,
of the truly penitent. But, as full a proof as can
be given, that no implacability is to be included in
our ideas of the divine juſtice, is to be drawn from
the directions that are given us for our own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct.
We learn, then, that to pleaſe God, we
muſt not only do juſtly, but likewiſe love mercy,
and exerciſe forgiveneſs. Now, here it is evident,
that if, <hi>to do juſtly,</hi> was to puniſh with rigour every
offence committed againſt us, then, if we would
pleaſe God by doing juſtly, we could cxerciſe no
mercy or forgiveneſs. Doing juſtly, therefore, can
only ſignify, that we do no violence ourſelves, that
we ſhould deprive no fellow-creatures of their rights
and privileges, but do unto all others as we would
that they ſhould do unto us. And, in this light we
are to view the divine juſtice; it is ſlow to wrath,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0633700300:22"/>
and keepeth the door of mercy for ever open to
the penitent. <q>Becauſe God is LORD of all,</q>
as the author of the Book of Wiſdom ſays, <q>it
maketh him to be gracious to all.</q> And this
<hi>grace</hi> is without reſpect of perſons. He regardeth
not the high more than the low, but, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
Peter ſays, <q>In every nation, he that feareth
him, and worketh righteouſneſs, is accepted with
him,</q> It is not, till after repeated trials, and men
have been guilty of the moſt daring impieties,
and become totally abandoned, that his judgments
take place. He is not ſpeedy in executing ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
upon them, but chaſteneth them by little
and little, that they might fly from the wrath
to come. And, when he comes forth to judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
we are told, and may be aſſured, that every
mouth ſhall be ſtopped, and that none ſhall be
able to accuſe him of unrighteouſneſs. <q>He will
judge the world in righteouſneſs, and the people
with equity.</q> When this grand and important
day arrives, <hi>ſalvation and glory, and honour and
power,</hi> ſhall be aſcribed <hi>unto the Lord our God, for
his true and righteous judgments;</hi> and, it will then
be found, beyond all queſtion, I dare ſay, that
God inflicteth puniſhment even upon the incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigibly
wicked, not becauſe his juſtice cannot par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
but becauſe mercy to the univerſe renders
their puniſhment neceſſary, and becauſe too, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
there can be no way, conſiſtent with infinite
wiſdom, of making the wicked happy. Beſides,
God, in puniſhing the wicked, will eminently diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play
his juſtice, in proportioning the puniſhment
of every particular criminal, to his leſſer or greater
degree of impenitency and hardneſs of heart.
Thoſe, that have ſinned without law, ſhall alſo
periſh without law; and while ſome are beaten
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0633700300:23"/>
with many ſtripes, others, comparatively ſpeaking,
ſhall be beaten with few ſtripes. <q>With the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
they judge, they ſhall be judged; and with
the meaſure they mete, it ſhall be meaſured to
them again.</q> The ſame juſtice alſo will diſplay
itſelf in rewarding the righteous. To ſome it will
be ſaid. <hi>Come up hither.</hi> He, that ſoweth ſparingly,
ſhall reap alſo ſparingly; and he that ſoweth boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully,
ſhall reap alſo bountifully. While all ſhall
be exempted from every labour, pain, and ſorrow,
the joy of ſome ſhall tranſcendantly exceed that of
others. <q>They that be wiſe ſhall ſhine as the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the firmament; and they that have turned
many to righteouſneſs, <hi>and have been righteous
themſelves,</hi> as the ſtars for ever.</q> The Juſtice of
God, will pardon all their infirmities, and all
their tranſgreſſions, of which they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented,
that is, from which they have turned
away; and, according to the works of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,
which they have done, <hi>he will divide to
each his portion.</hi> His goodneſs has promiſed this.
His juſtice therefore will bring it to paſs. Yes,
Though we have ſinned, yet if we have forſaken
our ſins, acquired a new heart, and a new ſpirit,
and approved ourſelves holy in all manner of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation
and godlineſs; if, in preference to all the
honours, and riches, and pleaſures of the world,
we have, by a patient continuance in well-doing,
ſought for glory and honour, and immortality, then,
notwithſtanding thoſe doings that have not been
good, and which we have ſeriouſly amended, God
will grant us all we want, all the riches of eternal
life. <hi>He is not unrighteous,</hi> as we have already af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
with the apoſtle, <hi>to forget our labour of love.</hi>
He is faithful in all his promiſes, and cannot diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appoint
thoſe hopes, nor fruſtrate thoſe noble ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations
which he has raiſed. Nay, he will not
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0633700300:24"/>
only not fruſtrate thoſe expectations, not only give
us the victory over death and the grave, and intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
us to happineſs, but, <hi>eye has not ſeen, nor ear
heard, neither has it entered into the heart of man
to conceive the things which God has prepared for
them that love him. Thy righteouſneſs,</hi> O Lord,
<hi>is an everlaſting righteouſneſs, and thy law is the
truth.</hi> The heavens <hi>ſhall declare his righteouſneſs;
for God is judge himſelf. Lord God of Iſrael, there
is no God like thee, in heaven above, or on earth
beneath, who keepeſt covenant and mercy with thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
that walk before thee with all their hearts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Such are the notions which reaſon and ſcripture,
clearly, I think, lead us to form of the divine juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice.
A great variety of objections, however, it
will poſſibly be ſaid, may ſtill be urged againſt it.
With all my heart, ſay I, if the objections will go
upon the ſame ground upon which I have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to tread, that is, if reaſon and ſcripture be
the teſtimonies to which they appeal. But the moſt
common objection to this doctrine, or the moſt
common argument by which the contrary doctrine
is ſupported, is nothing more than an impertinent
quotation from the apoſtle Paul. A man riſes up,
and harangues to me, upon a multitude of <hi>unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligibles,</hi>
aſcribes certain random, arbitrary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees
to the infinitely wiſe governor of the univerſe,
then deſcribes his juſtice to be ſuch as I have ſhewn
muſt be an abſolute bar to mercy, and after work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himſelf into a tolerable heat, by much ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>Who art thou,</hi> ſays he, <hi>that replieſt againſt God?</hi>
Now, to ſuch a reaſoner I have only to ſay, <hi>Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
Sir! though thou art a God to thyſelf, thou art
not my God.</hi> But farther, it cannot be ſeriouſly
objected to the doctrine I have been vindicating,
<q>that the wicked frequently bear rule in this life,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0633700300:25"/>
and that their eyes ſtand out with fatneſs; while
the righteous are afflicted, and mourn, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
go down to the grave, labouring under the
rod of oppreſſion and ſorrow.</q> This, I ſay, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be ſeriouſly objected; becauſe this is the very
nature of a ſtate of trial. Beſides, amply to ſatisfy
us upon this head, it is enough to ſay, that all theſe
things will be ſet right on a future day, and that,
for every ſuffering, into which we have fallen for
righteouſneſs ſake, or for the trial of our faith,
we ſhall be infinitely recompenced at the reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the juſt. Beſides, we are often in our proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity,
too apt to forget God; but adverſity natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
leads us to the rock that is higher than we.
The Pſalmiſt, therefore, ſaid, that it was good for
him to have been afflicted, becauſe that before he
was afflicted, he went aſtray. Solomon ſays to
the ſame purpoſe, <q>My ſon, deſpiſe not the chaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tening
of the Lord, neither be weary of his cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection;
for whom the Lord loveth he chaſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
even as a father the ſon in whom he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteth.</q>
And, our own experience teſtifies,
that ſcenes of ſorrow naturally humble the mind,
arreſt our wandering deſires, and diſſipated
thoughts, admoniſh us of our follies and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions,
and point out to us our true duty and
happineſs, and our only refuge from every cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity.
It would be unneceſſary, I hope, to make
a formal reply to many other equally frivolous ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections,
which the reader can anſwer as ſoon as
they occur. I ſhall now, therefore, only conclude
with ſome obvious reflections, which naturally
ariſe from what has been ſaid.</p>
            <p>I would obſerve, firſt of all, that the Juſtice of
God, as I have here endeavoured to repreſent it,
is, like all his other perfections, glorious. It is not
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0633700300:26"/>
ſtrict to mark our iniquities. It admitteth of grace
and reconciliation. It is founded on mercy and
goodneſs. It is a ſecurity to the righteous, that
they ſhall never be moved. And it is a pledge to
the truly penitent of their future crown. It is,
therefore, endearing, and adorable, our refuge in
difficulties, our hope in trouble, our haven of reſt
from all the ſtorms of life, and our tower of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
againſt every enemy, <hi>while we incline our
hearts unto the law, and to the teſtimonies</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <q>The man, whoſe heart does not condemn him (ſays Abernethy) has a confidence toward God, becauſe he is a perfectly juſt governor, by whom no ſervice ſincerely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to him, nor inſtance of reſpect to his command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, will ever be forgotten—a ſelf-approving mind is naturally ſecure, ſupported by this perſuaſion, that right ſhall finally prevail in the univerſe, and therefore looks forward, without conſternations, to the laſt reſult of things, when all irregularities ſhall be rectified, when the proud ſhall be no more proſperous, nor innocence oppreſſed, but all men ſhall receive according to their deeds done in the body, and not according to their outward actions only, but the prevalent affections, and purpoſes of their hearts.</q> See the following note but one at the beginning.</note>.</p>
            <p>But, ſecondly, we ſhould learn, from this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription
of the divine juſtice, what ought to be
the rules of juſtice among men. It ſhould have
no likeneſs, we ſee, to that narrow, unfeeling, vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictive
ſpirit, which actuates the <hi>prieſtly</hi> magiſtrate,
when the trembling wretch, who wanted a morſel
of bread, is brought before him. It ſhould exert
its ſtrength againſt tyranny and oppreſſion, againſt
villainy in power. And, if it ſhould not be allowed,
to pull down the deſpotic monarch from his throne,
and ſhould at the ſame time, moſt inconſiſtently,
and unmercifully, wave its heavy ſcourge over the
neceſſitous delinquent, it ſhould not, however,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0633700300:27"/>
tranſgreſs the boundaries of plain equity. But, it
is manifeſtly unjuſt, it is moſt cruel, and iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous,
to put the life of one man upon a level with
the property of another, to murder the fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creature
who, though wantonly, and muſt unjuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifiably,
and wickedly, hath made inroads upon
the property of his neighbour This is puniſhing
beyond the utmoſt ſtretch of <hi>rigour,</hi> and much
more beyond the line of <hi>juſtice</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Ye ſhedders of blood, what motives can ye have, for ſtill preaching up the doctrine of capital puniſhments, and putting your doctrine in practice? Ye cannot plead the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of crimes: for experience muſt convince you, that all your ſanguinary laws are but a feeble fence againſt the worſt crimes. And the reaſon of this is evident. Labour, and not death, is the great evil, which the malefactor dreads. Make, then, the malefactor work, and you will have no malefactors. Nor will ye then, while ye would be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted the ſervants of Chriſt, moſt ſhamefully oppoſe, both the example and the laws of Chriſt. He came not to <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy</hi> men's lives, but to <hi>ſave</hi> them; not to deprive ſinners of the power of repenting, but to call them to repentance. Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as lewdneſs, debauchery, and gambling, <hi>theſe works of diſhoneſty,</hi> lead to the commiſſion of all thoſe other offences that dis;turb the peace of ſociety; let not the example of thoſe in ſuperior ſtations countenance and encourage thoſe deſtroying vices. Let thoſe of diſtinguiſhed rank, who are too often as eminently infamous, once ſhew themſelves <hi>men,</hi> and they will find none but <hi>men</hi> among their inferiors.</note> And, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
juſtice is ſo far from bearing any kind of
ſimilitude to this, that it is, we have ſeen, entirely
contrary to it. The divine juſtice is ſlow to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
even ſinners according to their deſerts, is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing
and long-ſuffering towards them, at firſt
only puniſheth them with the accuſations of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
to try to reform them, time after time,
uſeth every poſſible means to bring them back to
their duty and obedience; and, if they will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form,
ceaſe to do evil, and learn to do well, is
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0633700300:28"/>
ready to blot out all their iniquities, to receive
them into favour, and to admit them to the riches
of eternal life. We ſhould, therefore, to copy af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the divine juſtice, proportion our mode of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
to the offence that is committed; we
ſhould aim at the reformation of the ſinner, and
endeavour to make his ſituation ſuch, as will both
anſwer this end, and at the ſame time repay ſociety
for the wrongs he has done. Or, while we do
<hi>juſtly</hi> towards all, and injure no man in body or
eſtate, we ſhould likewiſe ſhew <hi>mercy</hi> to the guilty,
and forgive them when they repent<note n="*" place="bottom">After the author had written theſe ſheets, he turned to a diſcourſe of the great Abernethy upon the ſame ſubject; from whom he has tranſcribed the following paſſage, being, in his apprehenſion, perfectly in point with the ſentiments delivered in the above paragraph. <q>God, in his juſtice,</q> ſaid this moſt learned and excellent man, <q>as well as his other moral perfections, is the beſt example for us to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, as far as the frailty of our nature will allow. It is our glory, as reaſonable creatures, to be capable of imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating him, and as our conſciences bear as full teſtimony to the rectitude of this, as to any other part of his law written in our hearts, we muſt be ſelf-condemned, and therefore unhappy, in acting contrary to it.— The exerciſe of human authority, ſhould, as exactly as poſſible, follow the pattern of that perfect righteouſneſs that governs the world. Princes</q> and magiſtrates <q>are called Gods upon earth—Shall they govern by arbitrary will, or by ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>price and paſſion, inſtead of juſtice.</q> Shall they?— But, how ſhall we prevail with them, or thoſe around them, to take the trouble of thinking what is right, or of amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what is wrong?.</note>
            </p>
            <p>But, thirdly, from the view that we have here
taken of the divine juſtice, we may ſee that there
was none occaſion for that infinite ſatisfaction for
ſin, which, among many other ſtrange inventions,
the buſy children of men have found out, and ſtill
confidently proclaim to the world. The divine
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0633700300:29"/>
juſtice is ſurrounded with mercy. The divine
juſtice, therefore, is fully ſatisfied with the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of the offender. The divine juſtice ſitteth
upon a throne of grace, to which every contrite
ſinner has free acceſs, has <hi>always</hi> free acceſs. And
if mercy was not to be obtained thence, where elſe
could it poſſibly be found? Could any other being,
could all the other beings, in the univerſe, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power
the infinite mind? Could any other
being be more benevolent than he? Or, indeed,
dare any other being preſume to direct him, to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the purpoſe he had formed? But there was not
any occaſion for any other being to attempt this.
God was <hi>of himſelf</hi> eternally diſpoſed to have mercy
upon us, and was <hi>never</hi> willing that any ſhould pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh,
but that all ſhould come to repentance and
eternal life. Nay, ſo far was he from being ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reconcileable
to his creatures, or from demanding
an infinite ſatisfaction for every ſin, that he, <hi>of his
own will, gave us his only begotten ſon,</hi> to aſſure us,
that, upon our ſincere repentance, all our ſins
ſhould be blotted out, and that, upon our renewed
obedience, we ſhould be made partakers of eternal
life. <q>
                  <hi>God</hi> ſo loved the world, that <hi>he</hi> gave us his
only begotten ſon, that whoever believeth in him,
might not periſh, but have everlaſting life.</q> Or,
this is his covenant with us, <hi>Repent, and live ye,</hi>
and <hi>turn unto me, and I will turn unto you.</hi> The
bleſſed Chriſt has ſealed, or ratified to us,
this covenant with his own blood, that is, by his
death and reſurrection. The everlaſting Jehovah,
has raiſed Chriſt from the dead, to aſſure us, that
he has ſent him, and that he will, conſequently,
fulfil, to the truly penitent, all thoſe promiſes of
pardon, peace, and love, and everlaſting ſalvation
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0633700300:30"/>
in the heavens, which are given to us in his holy
word<note n="*" place="bottom">Why, if ſuch a doctrine has any foundation in truth, have we no account in the ſcriptures of this infinite ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for ſin? Why, if this be neceſſary to ſalvation, is it not ſo much as mentioned in thoſe books that are able to make us wiſe unto ſalvation? Why did not Nathan, when he was ſent to David to diſplay to him the pardoning mercy of God, refer him to ſuch a ſatisfaction as the only means of eſcaping the wrath to come? Why did not David himſelf, when he humbled himſelf before God for his great tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, rely upon any ſuch ſatisfaction, nor ſpeak of any ſuch ſatisfaction, but pray for <hi>a clean heart and a right ſpirit?</hi> Why, after Chriſt died, did all the apoſtles, inſtead of referring ſinners to ſuch a ſatisfaction, teach them, <hi>that denying ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, and worldly luſt, they ſhould live ſoberly, righteouſly, and godly in this preſent world?</hi> Why did Paul in particular, who gloried ſo much in preaching Chriſt, expreſly declare that <hi>if, while we ſeek to be juſtified by Chriſt, we ourſelves are found ſinners, we deceive ourſelves?</hi> Without ſhewing at large, that this notion of a ſatisfaction deſtroys all diſtinction of charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and expunges every idea of the malignity of evil, why did not our Lord himſelf, who was the true way to eternal life, ever recommend any other means of attaining the mercy of God, than a ſincere repentance, and a thorough reformation? He certainly foreknew that he was to ſuffer death, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peatedly intimated this to his diſciples; but, in none of his converſations upon this ſubject, did he in the leaſt inſinuate that his death would be neceſſary to ſatisfy the juſtice of God, or that it was to be conſidered as an indiſpenſable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>requiſite to appeaſe his wrath. Accordingly, he did not pray to God, that ſinners might learn to rely upon the merits of his blood, but that the apoſtles might be kept from falling, and he prayed for all who ſhould believe on him through their word. He likewiſe, in the laſt ſcene of all, prayed for very murderers—<hi>Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.</hi> But, to what purpoſe any of theſe prayers, if the juſtice of God was fully ſatisfied by the death of his ſon? Our Lord would not then, ſurely, have prayed for criminals, but would, as he had the ſpirit above meaſure, and as he could not therefore be deceived, have demanded their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs as his purchaſed right.</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:0633700300:31"/>
But, finally, the doctrine we have been conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
can afford no kind of encouragement to
the ſinner. On the contrary, the goodneſs, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance,
and long-ſuffering of God, ſhould, above
all things, lead him to repentance. Beſides, though
God is gracious, ſlow to anger, and ready to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give,
yet he will at laſt take vengeance upon his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries,
upon thoſe who deſpiſed his grace, and
rejected all the offers of his mercy. This he hath
repeatedly, and ſolemnly declared, <hi>There is no
peace,</hi> ſaith my God, <hi>to the wicked:</hi> and, <hi>all the
workers of iniquity ſhall be deſtroyed</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <q>If any man ſerve me,</q> ſays our Lord, <q>let him follow me, and where I am, there alſo ſhall my ſervant be: If any man ſerve me, him will my Father honour—and, except your righteouſneſs ſhall exceed the righteouſneſs of the Scribes and Phariſees, ye ſhall in no wiſe enter into the kingdom of heaven.</q> Paul ſays, accordingly, <q>If ye live after the fleſh, ye ſhall die,</q> and, <q>whoremongers and adulterers God will condemn.</q> And John, and all the prophets and apoſtles teach, that <q>he only who doeth righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs is righteous,</q> or ſhall find acceptance at the throne of grace.</note> Since theſe,
then, are his declarations, ſince judgment will be
his work, we may aſſure ourſelves that infinite
mercy will render judgment neceſſary, and that
infinite goodneſs will execute all the threatenings
denounced againſt the finally impenitent. And,
oh, what an aggravation of the wretchedneſs of
the ſinners doom will it be, that infinite mercy
itſelf could not ſave him!</p>
            <p>Let us think of this; and as we know not what a
day or a night may bring forth, let us now, in the
accepted time, ſeek the Lord while he may be
found, deſire his favour better than life, and run
with pleaſure in the way of all his commandments;
that we may hereafter receive thoſe crowns which
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0633700300:32"/>
he has promiſed and prepared for thoſe that love
him, that we may drink for ever at the river of his
pleaſure.</p>
