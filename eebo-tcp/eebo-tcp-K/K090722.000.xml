            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE editor does not undertake to lay before the public the whole of General <hi>Burgoyne</hi>'s orders during the campaign of <hi>1777.</hi>—In ſo extenſive a detail, many would appear quite unintereſting at the preſent moment, and even at the time they were given, except perhaps to the departments immediately concerned, as far as regarded their execution: ſuch are thoſe reſpecting the daily duties, the hoſpital, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſerate, drivers, &amp;c. Thoſe only have been ſelected, that have for their object the general arrangements and movements of the army, and which may tend to illuſtrate the operations of the campaign. There are likewiſe ſome few by Generals <hi>Carleton</hi> and <hi>Philips,</hi> which are introduced here, as relating in particular to General <hi>Burgoyne</hi>'s expedition.</p>
            <p>The editor's principal inducement for offering theſe orders to the public, was drawn not only from the idea that the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0002301000:3"/>
ſtate of the expedition is incomplete without them, but likewiſe from the obſervation of the avidity with which General <hi>Wolfe</hi>'s orders were received by all ranks of people, and particularly by the officers of the army. It was conceived, that if General <hi>Wolfe</hi>'s orders were eſteemed as models to commanding officers of corps, as well as inſtructive leſſons in their profeſſion to thoſe of an inferior rank, General <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goyne</hi>'s would more fully anſwer that deſcription, as they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to military tranſactions far more important, and to ſcenes infinitely more intereſting to the public.—Beſide that the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of them is known to add to the knowledge and experience of the General all the exterior graces and refinement of the ſcholar and the writer.</p>
            <p>It is but juſtice to his Excellency the Lieutenant-General to acknowledge, that theſe orders are publiſhed without his concurrence or authority.</p>

            <p>THE King having been pleaſed to order, that a detachment from the army under my command be ſent upon an expedition under Lieutenant-general Burgoyne, and that this detachment be compoſed of the grenadiers, light-infantry, and 24th regiment; together with the 9th, 20th, 21ſt, 47th, 53d, and 62d regiments (except a detachment of 50 men from each of the ſix laſt-mentioned regiments) and all the German troops, except a detachment of 650—theſe corps will accordingly hold themſelves in readineſs to march at the ſhorteſt notice; orders for which will be given by Lieutenant-general Burgoyne, to whom, in the mean time, they will make all reports, as well as to the commander in chief. The detachments of 50, with a captain, two ſubalterns, and non-commiſſioned officers in proportion, from each of the ſix regiments as above, will aſſemble at the preſent head-quarters of their reſpective regiments, and there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main until further orders.</p>

            <p>MAjor-general Philips has been directed by the commander in chief to inform the commanding officers of regiments of his excellency's deſire, that the army ſhould take the field this campaign in the moſt perfect order.</p>
            <p>This will depend ſo entirely upon the ſeveral regiments being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared by exerciſe and diſcipline<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that it is recommended to you to employ the utmoſt care and attention on ſuch material points, where your own character and honour are ſo intimately connected with the duty and good of his Majeſty's ſervice.</p>
            <p>His excellency the commander in chief has inſtructed Major-general Philips to obſerve to you, that the good diſcipline of a regiment, in its general oeconomy, behaviour, and conduct in action, will depend on the attention of that reſpectable rank of gentlemen, the commanding officers of companies.</p>
            <p>It is from this rank of officers, whoſe time of ſervice and experience give them every poſſible weight and reſpect in a regiment, that the ſubaltern officers are to take their example and their orders. It is by the captains that the younger officers are to be inſtructed, not only in the common military rules, but in that propriety of conduct, ſtrict ſubordination, and indefatigable attention, ſo abſolutely requiſite in a
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0002301000:6"/>
regiment, and by which alone the ſoldiers can be held in that obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to, and confidence in their officers, which will make them bear the fatigues, hardſhips, and dangers of a campaign, with patience, with zeal, and with ſpirit.</p>
            <p>Courage has ever belonged to the Britiſh troops, and there needs only to obſerve, that a well diſciplined body will always add to it a moſt eſſential principle in war—conduct.</p>
            <p>It is neceſſary that the officers ſhould be perfectly acquainted with the ſoldiers of their company, and that ſoldiers ſhould know their officers, and be accuſtomed to the ſound of their voices. The exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing by companies will be the ſureſt means to effect thoſe purpoſes.</p>
            <p>It is well underſtood, that all regiments exerciſe by companies; but it is uſually done with a view of joining in battalion. It is here meant, that each company ſhould be led to conſider itſelf as a ſmall, diſtinct body, and exerciſed in various evolutions independent of the battalion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with every poſſible view for ſingle companies being taught to depend upon themſelves.</p>
            <p>As from the nature of the preſent war, the abilities and military ſkill of officers may be required to be ſhown in detached parties, and as it may frequently happen, that ſingle companies will have to act, when an entire battalion cannot always manoeuvre; by purſuing this idea, which the commander in chief has expreſſed a ſtrong deſire of, it will leave the officers and ſoldiers a dependence and attention on each other, and give confidence to both.</p>
            <p>It will therefore be proper for every officer of a company to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly well acquainted with, and to exerciſe that company—for the commanding officer of a battalion to put himſelf at the head of one company, and to manoeuvre that company; while the other compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, being drawn up at ſmall intervals of diſtance, follow the evolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſo given by the commanding officer.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:0002301000:7"/>
As the commander in chief has already ordered regiments in their exerciſe to make frequent changes of their poſitions and fronts, and to march over difficult ground, it will give the commanding officers of companies opportunities of ſhowing a ready power of taking good poſts; and alſo, though there may be certain ſeparations, owing to incloſures, ravines, ditches of water, marſhy ground, &amp;c. of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necting the companies one with another, and with the battalion.</p>
            <p>Whenever a regiment, when marching or manoeuvring, is obliged to break into parts, from marſhy ground, ravines, ditches, ſmall hills, rocks, or thick underwood, it ſhould be done, if poſſible, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies, which ſhould divide as little as poſſible, and never but in ſuch parts, as an officer or ſerjeant may have command of ſuch ſeparate diviſion; and this not at the will of the ſoldier, but from the diſtinct orders of the officers, ſo that the ſeparated diviſions may join, as ſoon as the ground will permit, into companies, and from companies into battalion.</p>
            <p>The changing the order of companies at times, in drawing up the battalion, will make the ſoldiers ready in forming on general principles, without regarding local ſtations of companies.</p>
            <p>His excellency has in view by this, that the ſoldiers learn to be ſteady and attached to their own company and its officers—that the officers, having a thorough knowledge of their men, and being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to ſuch inſtances of ſeparation as have been deſcribed, ſuffer not the ſoldiers to act, but from their words of command and orders—that every company may form a reſpectable body ſingly, and though attached to its place in battalion, yet always ready to act ſeparate from it, as the nature of the ground may require, or the nature of the local ſervice they may be ſent on make neceſſary.</p>
            <p>Major-general Philips has endeavoured to explain the commander in chief's pleaſure, by ſignifying how much his excellency depends
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0002301000:8"/>
on the ſupport of captains commanding companies in this army; and there can be no doubt of every reſpectable and attentive obedience to his excellency's injunctions and orders. The commander in chief has not directed any thing relative to commanding officers and field officers of battalions; as his excellency, as well as every general officer of the army, has reaſon to depend on their experience, and to be aſſured of the ſtrong exertion, and active and ſpirited zeal of the field-officers for the particular character and credit of their own corps, and for the honour of his Majeſty's ſervice.</p>

The line upon the next movement will encamp in order of battle as follows, and will continue in the ſame order till countermanded. Right wing, firſt brigade of Britiſh, commanded by Brigadier-general Powell, and compoſed of the 9th, 47th, and 53d battalions; ſecond brigade of Britiſh, commanded by Brigadier-general Hamilton, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of the 20th, 21ſt, and 62nd battalions. Left wing, firſt brigade of Germans, commanded by Brigadier-general Specht, compoſed of the regiments of Rhentz, Specht, and Reideſel; ſecond brigade of Germans, commanded by Brigadier-general Gall, and compoſed of the regiments of Prince Frederick and Heſſe Hanau.</p>
            <p>If it ſhould become neceſſary to form two lines, the ſecond line is to form by the ſecond brigade of Britiſh doubling upon the firſt; and by the ſecond brigade of Germans doubling in like manner on their firſt. The brigadiers are always to encamp with their brigade.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>OFFICERS of all ranks commanding out-poſts and detachments are conſtantly to fortify, in the beſt manner the circumſtances of the place and the implements at hand will permit, felling trees with their points outwards, barricading churches and houſes. Breaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works of earth and timber are generally to be effected in a ſhort time, and the ſcience of engineering is not neceſſary to find and apply ſuch reſources.</p>
            <p>The practice of fortifying is uſeful in all ſervices, but eſpecially in this, where the enemy, though infinitely inferior to the King's troops in open ſpace and hardy combat, is well fitted by diſpoſition and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice for the ſtratagems and enterprizes of little war; and neither the diſtance of camps, nor the interference of foreſts and rivers, are to be looked upon as ſecurity againſt their attempts. Upon the ſame prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0002301000:12"/>
it muſt be a conſtant rule, in or near woods, to place advanced ſentries, where they have a tree or ſome other defence, to prevent them from being taken off by ſingle markſmen. Together with theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cautions, officers will ever bear in mind, how much the public ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and their own are concerned in maintaining a poſt; and that to juſtify a retreat in this war, the number of the enemy muſt be much ſuperior to that which would make their juſtification, when acting againſt a brave and diſciplined force.</p>
            <p>The officers will take all opportunities, and eſpecially at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the campaign, to inculcate into the minds of the men a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance upon the bayonet. Men of half their bodily ſtrength, and even cowards, may be their match at firing; but the onſet of bayo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, in the hands of the valiant, is irreſiſtible.</p>
            <p>The enemy, convinced of this truth, place their dependence in entrenchments and rifle-pieces—it will be our glory and preſervation to ſtorm where poſſible. The attention of every officer is to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed on his men; to make uſe of his fuſil, unleſs in very extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary caſes of immediate perſonal defence, would betray an ignorance of his importance and of his duty.</p>
            <p>No occaſion can make it neceſſary to keep the arms loaded in the bell tents; nor are the battalions of the line ever to be loaded on the march, till very near the time they may happen to engage.</p>
            <p>No parties are to go from camp with or without arms, unleſs with a proportionable number of officers.—Not only the diſcipline and honour, but even the ſafety of the troops, require the ſtricteſt prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition from ſtraggling and plundering; and the ſavages, as well as the provoſt, will have orders to puniſh all offenders in theſe reſpects in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly, and with the utmoſt rigour.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:0002301000:13"/>
The camp will always be extended as widely as the ground will admit, for the ſake of cleanlineſs and health—but as it muſt often happen, that the extent will be inſufficient for the line to form in front of the camp, according to the preſent eſtabliſhed rules of open files and two deep—the quarter-maſter-general will therefore mark out at every new camp the proportion of ground each battalion is to clear, over and above its own front, in order to make the work equal. To clear this ground muſt be the immediate buſineſs after arriving in camp; and in this country it may be often neceſſary to have an alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſt cleared in the rear, as well as in front.—By clearing is meant the removal of ſuch obſtructions as might prevent the ready forming of troops, to receive or advance upon the enemy.</p>
            <p>Quarter guards are always to face outwards, and at the diſtance of one hundred yards from the bells of arms, with a flêche of earth or timber thrown up before them. When the encampment of the line is with the front to the water, and too near to admit of this regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the quarter guard is to be poſted in the rear, or thoſe of the flank regiments occaſionally upon the flanks. Though the ground will ſeldom admit a ſtrict regularity in pitching the officers tents, they are never to be placed ſo as to interfere with the line of defence.</p>
            <p>When the Lieutenant-general viſits an out-poſt, the men are not to ſtand to their arms, or pay him any compliment. The articles of war, which regard the men, to be read at the head of every regiment to-morrow, at evening parade; and afterwards theſe regulations.</p>
            <p>The daily duties are to be as follows—One Brigadier-general for the day, who will viſit the out-poſts, and have a general inſpection of the camp. All reports to be made through him, except when any alarm or other exigence requires inſtant notice to the commander in chief—A major of brigade for the day, who is to parade all guards, detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, &amp;c. The picquet, when the laſt brigade arrives, will conſiſt of one field-officer for each wing, one captain each brigade, one ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altern,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0002301000:14"/>
one ſerjeant, one corporal and twenty men each regiment—a drummer to be furniſhed by the regiment that gives the captain. The whole picquet to aſſemble half an hour before gun-firing, at the centre of the line, and to be exerciſed in marching and charging ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yonets, under the inſpection of the brigadier of the day; in order that the Britiſh and German troops may acquire an uniformity of pace and motions, when acting together in the line. Half the pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet is always to be poſted during the night at ſome diſtance from the camp, and at ſuch places as may be expoſed to the ſecret approaches of the enemy. It will be the care of the brigadier of the day to poſt them.</p>

            <p>ON the ſixth, the enemy was diſlodged from Ticonderoga, by the mere countenances and activity of the army, and driven on the ſame day beyond Skeenſborough on the right, and Hubberton on the left; with the loſs of all their artillery, and five of their armed veſſels

taken or blown up (by the ſpirited conduct of Captain Carter of the artillery, with part of his brigade of gun-boats) a great quantity of ammunition, proviſion, and ſtores of all ſorts, and all their baggage.</p>
            <p>On the 7th, Brigadier Fraſer, with little more than half the advanced corps, and without artillery (which with the utmoſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours it was found impoſſible to bring up) came up with 2000 of the enemy ſtrongly poſted, attacked and defeated them, with the loſs, on the enemy's ſide, of their principal officers, 200 men killed on the ſpot, a much greater number wounded, and 300 taken priſoners.</p>
            <p>On the 8th, Lieutenant-colonel Hill, at the head of the ninth regiment, was attacked near Fort Anne, by more than ſix times his number, and repulſed the enemy with great loſs, after a continued fire of three hours. In conſequence of this action, Fort Anne was burnt and abandoned; and a part of this army is in poſſeſſion of the country on the other ſide.</p>
            <p>Theſe rapid ſucceſſes, after exciting a proper ſenſe of what we owe to God, intitles the troops in general to the warmeſt praiſe—and particular diſtinction is due to Brigadier-general Fraſer, who, by his conduct and bravery, ſupported by the officers and ſoldiers under his command, effected an exploit of material ſervice to the king, and of ſignal honour to the profeſſion of arms. This corps have the further merit of having ſupported fatigue and bad weather, without bread and without murmur.</p>
            <p>Divine ſervice will be performed on Sunday morning at the head of the line, and at the head of the advanced corps; and on the ſame day at ſun-ſet, a feu-de-joye will be fired with cannon and ſmall-arms from Ticonderoga, Crown-point, the camp at Skeenſborough, and the poſt of Breymen's corps.</p>

            <p>IT is obſerved that the injunctions, before the army took the field, relative to the baggage of officers, has not been complied with; and that the regiments in general are incumbered with much more baggage than they can poſſibly be ſupplied with means of conveying when they quit the lakes and rivers: warning is therefore given to the officers, to convey by the batteaux, which will ſoon return to Ticonderoga, the baggage that is not indiſpenſably neceſſary to them, or, upon the firſt ſudden movement, it muſt inevitably be left on the ground. Such gentlemen as ſerved in America laſt war may remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that officers took up with a ſoldiers tent, and confined their bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage to a knapſack for months together.</p>
            <p>When opportunity ſhall offer to carry forward the baggage, which will be left at Ticonderoga, ſo as not to interfere with the tranſport of magazines, the Lieutenant-general will be happy to contribute to the convenience and comfort of his officers.</p>

            <p>THE Lieutenant-general having received a report from Lieutenant-colonel Breymen, relative to the action of Saintcoick Mills, and likewiſe having received every collateral information poſſible, thinks it but juſtice to declare publickly, that he has no reaſon to be diſſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with the perſonal ſpirit of the troops; that, on the contrary, the officers commanding corps acted with intrepidity on that occaſion. The failure of the enterpriſe ſeems to be owing, in the firſt inſtance, to the credulity of thoſe who managed the department of intelligence, who ſuffered great numbers of the rebels to paſs and repaſs, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps to count the number of the detachment; and upon ill-grounded confidence induced Lieutenant-colonel Baume to advance too far. The next cauſe was the ſlow movement of Lieutenant-colonel Breymen; who, from bad weather, bad roads, and tired horſes, together with other impediments ſtated by Lieutenant-colonel Brehmen, could not reach 24 miles from eight in the morning of the 15th, to four in the afternoon of the 16th. The ſuccour therefore arrived too late. The failure of ammunition, in the management of which there ſeems to have been ſome improvidence, was another misfortune; the reſt ſeem common occurrences of war. Upon the whole, the enemy has felt very little ſucceſs; and there is no circumſtance to affect the army with further regret or melancholy, than that which ariſes from the loſs of ſome gallant men.—But let the affair of the mill of Saintcoick remain henceforward as a leſſon againſt the impoſition of a treacherous enemy, many of whom, in the very hour of ſwearing allegiance to the

king, fought<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>againſt his troops; and againſt expending ammunition too faſt, which obliged conquering troops to retreat. The reflexion on this affair will moreover excite alertneſs and exertion in every corps marching to the ſupport of another, by ſhowing in whatever degree theſe qualities may be poſſeſſed by the commanding officers, and they are not to be doubted in the preſent inſtance, yet, unleſs they are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, common accidents may become fatal in the courſe of two hours, may decide the turn of an expedition, and may even decide in ſome caſes the fate of a campaign.</p>
