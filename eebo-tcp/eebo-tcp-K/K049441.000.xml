            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Short View OF The preſent State OF THE Proteſtant Religion in
<hi>BRITAIN,</hi> &amp;c,</head>
            <p>I Always obſerved in ſuch Caſes as this, the only
way to come at a Clear Underſtanding of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars,
was to go back to their Generals,
to ſearch the Original of things, and ſee from
thence not how they are repreſented, but how they
really are in their meer Nature, and Native Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.</p>
            <p>In doing this, I ſhall ſtudy as much as in me lies,
to give no Offence to any body, nor concern my ſelf
with any thing, however warmly ſaid on that Head,
but to my utmoſt, keep cloſs to impartial Truth in
Fact, and give my own thoughts as calmly as I
can.</p>
            <p>Perhaps the Hiſtorical part may be counted ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial,
and I am content it be ſo; no body can expect
a ſuccinct Hiſtory of Religion in three Sheets of Paper,
nor ſhall I, <hi>remote as I am from Books, Vouchers, and
Perſons,</hi> enter into many Quotations, deſigning no
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:1068301600:3"/>
other Hiſtory of theſe Affairs; but what every Mans
Memory may reflect on, or by very ſhort reading, be
informed about.</p>
            <p>I have no room to ſpare for Apologies; As I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
no Offence to any one, ſo I hope, no Man will
take Offence at me, miſconſtrue my Meaning, or cavil
at Miſtakes in the manner—. If they do, if they
will raiſe Strife from what is deſign'd for Peace, the
Strife ſhall be theirs, the Peace ſhall be mine; and to
all falſe or railing Accuſations, I anſwer in the words
of the Text, in the 9<hi>th.</hi> Verſe of the Epiſtle of <hi>Jude,</hi>
and no more.</p>
            <p>In the beginning of the Fifteenth Century, this whole
Iſland was under the intire abſolute Dominion of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery;
Rulers and People too much united in following
after Vanity and Idols, and very ſmall faint Gli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merings
of the Glorious Reſurrection of Truth were
then only to be ſeen.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Henry</hi> VII. reigning in <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>James</hi> IV. in
<hi>Scotland,</hi> had nothing in them inclining to an Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Religion, but ſupinely ſlept—under the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible
Operation of the <hi>Roman</hi> Opiat: Prieſt Craft,
and the Pomp of Religion had dozvd Man-kind, and
that Glorious Light which the Spirit of GOD, by the
Preaching of the Apoſtles, had ſpread thro' the World,
ſeem'd ſo overclouded with the Univerſal Vail of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition,
and vile Traditional Performances, that it
look'd as if the General Diſpenſation was at End, the
Church of GOD compleated, and the World given up to
Original Blindneſs.</p>
            <p>I would not be miſunderſtood here, as if there were
no Appearances in Particular Places and Perſons of a
true Light; For God has never left the Church quite de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate:
And I know what has been alledged of the <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſes,
Albigenſes,</hi> and other ſuffering Chriſtians—.
But I deſire to be taken as I mean, that a General and
dreadful Darkneſs had at that Time overſpread the
World, all the Potentates of <hi>Europe</hi> bowed at the Feet
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:1068301600:4"/>
of <hi>Baal;</hi> and the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Pontiff executed a Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick
Power without Controul, if there were any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors
of Truth, they behooved to be Confeſſors alſo;
and what Light appear'd, tho it was received
with Love, it was a Gueſt that brought certain
Death with it—: Indeed the wonderful Power of
the inviſible irreſiſtable Grace of GOD was in nothing
more conſpicuous, than in furniſhing almoſt all to
whom he revealed his Truth, with ſuch a Love to it,
Zeal for it, and Reſolution in it, that Perſecution and
Martyrdom were but meer Agents in the Propagation
of Truth; and <hi>Sanguis Martyrum</hi> was at that time more
than ever prov'd to be <hi>Semen Eccleſiae.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this ſuffering poſture the Affairs of the Church ſtood
at the coming of <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. to the Crown of <hi>England;</hi>
the firſt part of his Reign gave little Hopes to any that a
Reformation could have its Riſe in a Prince who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
the Famous <hi>John Lambert</hi> to the Fire, and appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
qualified to be the moſt Famous Perſecutor of Gods
Church that ever was in the World, being in his Conduct
Politick, in his Nature cholerick and cruel, in his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
Tyrannical, and in his Religion nothing at
all, but—what was guided by his Ambition and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt.</p>
            <p>But
behold how the Divine <hi>Power</hi> is magnified, in
making his Enemies deſtroy themſelves; Pride, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition,
Covetouſneſs, and the Wrath of Man in this
day, brought to paſs the Glorious and determined Deſigns
of God, and the Conſuſions and Extravagancies of the
World aſſiſted to open the Eyes of ſuch whoſe Hearts
God at the ſame time had touch't with His Grace; and
now the Great Light of Truth began to break out be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Clouds, and by wonderful and various ſteps
of Providence, too long to relate, All the Miſts of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
Ignorance and Superſtition fled away, and Truth
in its Native Luſtre ſhone over theſe Parts of the World.</p>
            <p>For now <hi>Luther</hi> had broke in upon Error in <hi>Gorma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny;</hi>
like a Torrent the Kings of the Earth began to hate
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:1068301600:5"/>
the Whore; and all the Northern Part of <hi>Europe</hi> fell off
from Idolatry, both Princes and People.</p>
            <p>The various Turns in <hi>England</hi> under <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the Article of Divorce, the Regale, and other things,
widned a Breach between him and the Pope;
and thoſe lucid Intervals gave ſuch breathings to the
Reformed Religion, that it advanc't exceedingly, till
even in his Reign, it crept into, firſt his Cabinet, and
then his bed.</p>
            <p>In this Criſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, he ſtrook the two great Preliminary
Strokes at the Root of Popery, in which, tho I ſee no
Ground to ſuggeſt, he had any Religious aim, yet Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
who acted him as the Inſtrument, without
giving him the Principle, brought to paſs the End by the
involuntary Agency of what Means he thought ſit.</p>
            <p>Theſe two Blows at Popery, which I call prelimina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rys,
were caſting off the Popes Supremacy, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
theſe Seminaries of Filthineſs and. Superſtition,
the Abbeys and Monaſteries.</p>
            <p>And here any Body may ſee the Reaſon of my
going thus far back in this Account, and which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
they might begin to think impertinent to my
purpoſe. But the Caſe is this, Had King <hi>Henry</hi>'s Zeal
been for Retormation indeed, or rather had he not
been acted by Pride in one, and Avarice in the other,
that Step had been taken another way, which if it had,
the Snares that have follow'd, had been perhaps pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented.
I explain my ſelf thus.</p>
            <p>Had <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. been Enlightned by a true Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
in proportion to his Circumſtance, had his Fury
been a Religious Zeal—, had he been acted by the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian,
not the Monarch, when he pull'd down the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy
of the Pope, he had erected the true Goſpel
Supremacy of Chriſt Jeſus, and in this unhappy Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake,
has been found all the brooding Snakes of Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtick
Tyranny, which this part of the World has been
plagued with ever ſince.</p>
            <p>I'll repeat it another way yet plainer, I hope I ſhall
be excuſed the Tautology.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:1068301600:6"/>
               <hi>Henry</hi> VIII, A meer Tyrant, a Man of no Religion
in his inſide, and but very little in the outſide; for
the Tyrant was too rampant in him, to ſuffer him to
be a Hypocrite, when he pull'd down the Supremacy
of the Pope, immediately ſet up his own; this was,
I ſay, only dethroning one Devil to ſet up another;
however, the Church was yet Popiſh, the Reformation
young, and the Heads of the Reformers were glad to
lay hold of this Handle to pull down what they really
ſtruggled with, as Tyrannical; not foreſeeing
that the Tyranny ſtill remained, tho the Maſters
were chang'd, or that this Monſter call'd the temporal
Supremacy, was big with future Miſchiefs, which ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerating
from one another, would ſtill bring the Church
of God into, at leaſt, unſcriptural Bondage.</p>
            <p>But let no Man read this with Prejudice at the Good
Men who were the Agents, who in the ſimplicity of
their Souls, did this, and by it laid the Ax effectually
to the Root of Religious Subjection; and the impious
Ambition of the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> If God Almighty for
our Sins, and partly for Puniſhment, ſuffered yet this
<hi>Canaanite</hi> to remain in the Bowels of the Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
without doubt he had his Divine Ends in it, which
I ſhall not preſume to enquire into.</p>
            <p>On this Foundation has however been built, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
Structure of Diviſion, which has made ſuch
Chaſms in Gods Church, broke in ſo much upon
our Charity, and fatally upon our more perfect Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
even to this Day.</p>
            <p>For the Supremacy in Matters Eccleſiaſtical, being
reſolved in the King, began to produce ſtrange Effects,
and ſome Martyrs, as they call them, on the <hi>Romiſh</hi>
ſide died for denying it, ſuch as Sir <hi>Thomas Moor,</hi>
Biſhop <hi>Fiſher</hi> and others, as in <hi>Burnets</hi> Hiſtory of the
Reformation, <hi>Vol.</hi> 1. may be ſeen at large.</p>
            <p>I ſhall touch at ſome of the Evils, that ſetting this
Dignity on the head of the Temporal Prince brought
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:1068301600:7"/>
with it, and theſe were two. <hi>Firſt,</hi> That in Matters
indifferent in themſelves, the Command of the Civil
Magiſtrate, has Power to determine us, and make
thoſe indifferent things neceſſary, and hereon is built
all our Ceremonial, that has ſince cauſed ſuch Diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in the Proteſtant Churches here. And, <hi>Secondly,</hi>
This I give as the Reaſon, or rather the Occaſion, that
our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church reformed into Epiſcopacy, and a
Pompous Hierarchy, rather than a <hi>Calviniſtical</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
            <p>This
is what we mean by the <hi>Regale,</hi> which of
courſe brought the Pontificate along with it, and in
this <hi>Scotland</hi> had the Advantage of <hi>England;</hi> for that
the Reformation in <hi>Scotland</hi> being not in the Direction
of the Prince, but rather in Oppoſition to the Regent the
Queen Mother, the Pomp, the Magnificence, and the
outſide of the Matter loſt all the Reverence it had in
the Court of Princes, where it ſeem'd to be Carreſs't
from ſome ſuitableneſs between them in Matters of
Dominion.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, Queen <hi>Mary</hi> reſign'd this Authority to the
Pope, and Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was not very haſty in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming
it again, as 'tis plain from <hi>Burnet's</hi> Hiſtory of
the Reformation.</p>
            <p>The Church of <hi>England,</hi> tho' firſt Reform'd, being under
the Reign of a Young King, he was eaſily prevail'd with
to form the Model of Church Government in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
as having his Eye more at the main Point, <hi>viz.</hi>
The rooting out of Idolatry and Superſtition, but had
not yet had the Epiſcopal Hierarchy debated, or its
Scriptural Authority call'd in Queſtion.</p>
            <p>As to Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> ſhe rather went back in the
Reformation of Ceremonies, than foreward in deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them; for which two Reaſons are aſſign'd by the
Writers of that Age.</p>
            <p>1<hi>ſt.</hi> Policy, That by the preſerving ſome ſunilitude
to the old Rites, ſhe might, if poſſible, bring the Papiſts
to comply with her way, and ſo prevent a Diviſion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:1068301600:8"/>
2. Her natural Gayneſs of Temper, which enclin'd
her to be much in Love with the Pomp and Shows of
Religion.</p>
            <p>In King <hi>James</hi> the firſt, a new and unheard of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
ſtarted into the World, found firſt in the Heads of
his Flatterers, That Kings were immediatly clothed with
their Power from above, that they Governed <hi>Jure Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vino,</hi>
and conſequently muſt be obeyed as Gods Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
and without any Controul.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not run into the dark Particulars of that
wretched Doctrine, nor the Miſchiefs it brought upon
both Nations; but having aſſign'd the proper Original,
both of Prelacy and Ceremonies, the two great things
now debated, I ſhall proceed to examine what has been
the Conſequence of theſe things in theſe Kingdoms.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Firſt,</hi> I muſt own they brought immediat Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
into the Reformed Churches, and afterwards
all the Diviſions, Schiſms ſome call them, and Debates
that have been in the World, ſince their Foundation.</p>
            <p>There were indeed early Differences in the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
Churches in <hi>England,</hi> and Biſhop <hi>Hooper,</hi> and
Biſhop <hi>Ridly</hi> cont<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ded a little too warmly on both
ſides, till Affliction and Suffering taught both of them
more Charity; and when they came both to die for the
Eſſentials of Religion, it taught them to own, the Root
of Religion might be ſound, where the Bloſſom had
not the ſame flagrance; that the Faith, Hope, Love,
and other Chriſtian Graces might be preſerved, where
they differed in the Circumſtances.</p>
            <p>However, I believe no man will Diſpute with me,
that the very Biſhops themſelves in thoſe Times
were Good Men; of Holy and Blameleſs Lives,
ſound and wholſome Doctrine; conſtant and Labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
in Preaching, of firm and unſhaken <hi>Faith,</hi> of
invincible Fortitude in the Cauſe of Chriſt, and ſealed
the Reformation with their Blood; and tho I am as far
from Epiſcopacy in my Opinion as any man in <hi>Scotland,</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:1068301600:9"/>
yet I muſt do Juſtice; theſe were Biſhops, of whom
five beſides Arch-Deacon <hi>Philpot,</hi> paſt the Fiery Trial,
and laid down their Lives in the Glorious Cauſe of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
            <p>Theſe
were not dumb Dogs, but Zealous Teachers
of the Good People, and having taught Chriſt firſt, they
died for him afterwards: A thing eaſier to talk of
than to do.</p>
            <p>In Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Time, the <hi>Regale</hi> and <hi>Pontificat</hi>
continuing ſtill in the Church, Biſhops and Ceremonies,
reſerv'd their Legal Sanction or Confirmation rather; but
as the World began to encreaſe in Knowledge, and Light
ſpread it ſelf further than uſual; ſo People began to
be much out of Love with the Pomp of Service, as with
a thing remote from the true Inſtitution of the Goſpel;
and tho ſeveral Acts of Parliament were made againſt
them, yet their Number increaſed every Day; the
Queen indeed proceeded very ſeverely with them, to
reclaim them: And King <hi>James,</hi> tho bred up under
another kind of Church Government himſelf, carryed it
yet higher.</p>
            <p>But as force never yet could be effectual over Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
ſo all theſe Proceedings ſerv'd but to make the
perſecuted People encreaſe.</p>
            <p>Their Original, and I muſt own, I think a moſt juſt Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
was, that the Church required a yet farther Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
that it was their Duty to ſerve God in the way
which was moſt agreeable to the Scriptures, and they
having diſliked ſeveral things in the Ceremonies and
Liturgy of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> preſſed for a greater
Purity of Worſhip: Hence they were called PURI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TANS.</p>
            <p>The
Holineſs and Blameleſsneſs of their Lives, the
inoffenſiveneſs of their Behaviour to all Perſons, and the
General Character they had, was ſuch, that the
Name firſt given them in Deriſion, was afterwards in
great Honour, both at home, and eſpecially among
the Proteſtant Churches Abroad; and <hi>Eraſmus,</hi> who
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:1068301600:10"/>
was in <hi>England</hi> at that time, and converſt with them;
gave his Opinion of them in this noble Expreſſion,
<hi>Sit anima mea cum Puritannis Anglicanis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet even theſe Puritans, than whom Europe never
ſhew'd better Chriſtians, remain'd in the Communion of
the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and in Subjection to <hi>Epiſcopacy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Reaſon they gave for it was, that tho they
could not join in many things of their Worſhip, yet they
thought it their Duty not to ſeparate, and make a
Breach or Schiſm in the Church.</p>
            <p>Note, for I deſire to be rightly underſtood, I do
not ſay it was their Duty not to ſeparate, but they
were convinc't of its being their Duty, and ſo it
might become a Duty to them.</p>
            <p>And that it was apparently thus, appear'd afterward,
even that when their Kings put that abominable Book
of Sports upon then, for which all the moſt Godly and
Pious Miniſters were deprived; yet they did not ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſeparate Churches, they went about Preaching,
Catechizing, and Inſtructing Private Families; but
they neither Baptized nor adminiſtraed the Lords
Supper, but their People Conform'd in that to the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh't
Church.</p>
            <p>If 'tis enquir'd why I obſerve this, 'tis becauſe,
<list>
                  <item>1. I would note with what Force and unwillingneſs
the Diſſenters in <hi>England</hi> have been driven to
be Diſſenters, and as it were, thruſt out of the
Church.</item>
                  <item>2. Becauſe of alike backwardneſs to ſeparate, which
appeared at the laſt juncture in 1661, which ſome
Cenſure the Diſſenters, I think too ſeverely for.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>But to return to the Puritans:</p>
            <p>The Government being reſolved to puſh them upon
all extremities, and put every thing upon them that
they knew they would not comply with, an Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
offered to try whether it was meerly for the ſake
of Perſecution and Oppreſſion, that they were thus
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:1068301600:11"/>
uſed, or whether being really affraid of them, their
General Abſence would ha' been grateful to them.</p>
            <p>For the Diſcovery of a Planting in the North part
of <hi>America,</hi> called <hi>New England,</hi> happening about this
time, they Petition King <hi>James</hi> for Leave to go over
and plant themſelves there—, which not to enter
here into the Circumſtances of their Addreſs, or its Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception,
tho the Hiſtory of it is very diverting, was
granted them.</p>
            <p>Immediately the whole Kingdom was in motion,
and nothing was to be ſeen, but hiring Ships, packing
up Goods, ſelling Eſtates, Jewels, Houſhold Stuff,
and Equippages, as if the whole Nation was going to
tranſplant.</p>
            <p>The firſt Families that went, met with Terrible ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity
in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>old, Famine, and Want of all things, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
of Habitations in a barren uncultivated Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
but what will not People ſuffer for the Liberty of
their Conſciences? not diſcouraged by the Diſtreſſes they
went thro', they went on, and were followed by ſuch
Multitudes, and with ſuch Wealth, that if I remember
right above 19000 People were found to have gone over
in a very few Years; and ſo generally were they bent u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
it, that the Council had it ſeveral times under de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
to ſtop them.</p>
            <p>But King James dying, and the Confuſions of the
next Reign coming on, the Civil Wars broke out,
and the Power of the Parliament prevailing, the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
before mentioned, of Purity in Worſhip, obtained
on the Nation, Epiſcopacy was wholly ſuppreſt, and a
New form of Church Government erected.</p>
            <p>This not only eſtabliſh't Liberty to all the Puritans,
and put a ſtop to their flying Abroad, but the Scriptures
with the Pattern of the Primitive Churches, being the
Rule of their Eſtabliſhment, a General Aſſembly of
Divines was call'd, who ſat at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi>—, what
their proceedings were, how they entertain'd a Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly
Correſpondence with the Aſſembly in this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:1068301600:12"/>
how they unhappily divided again into different
Opinions, the Conteſts about the <hi>Jus Divinum</hi> of
Church Government, and of their manner in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar;
theſe are things too long to enter upon here, and
ſomething Foreign to my Purpoſe alſo.</p>
            <p>But to come as faſt as poſſible to the preſent Times,
at the Reſtoration of the Monarchy in King <hi>Charles</hi> II.
this whole Fabrick, ſo it ſeem'd good to the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
fell at once, and the Epiſcopal Hierarchy, Liturgy,
Ceremonies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were reſtored.</p>
            <p>The King, whether ſincerely deſirous to unite his
Subjects, in poſſible, or not, is needleſs to determine
here, the Conſequence beſt explain'd his Meaning; but
however, in pretence and outſide he called it, appoints
a Conference at the <hi>Savoy,</hi> and granted a Commiſſion
to certain on both ſides, to treat of an Accommodati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Differences.</p>
            <p>The Miniſters gladly accept of this Conference, and
principally being made to believe that Conceſſions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
made on their ſide, like Conceſſions would be made
on the other, and it might be poſſible to prevent a
Breach in the whole.</p>
            <p>They then had ſeveral Meetings among themſelves,
to conſider how far they might comply, and as they
all thought it their Duty to go as far as poſſible: So
the Latitude of ſome People went farther than others.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not Juſtifie or condemn here, it is not my
preſent Buſineſs; I ſhall readily own ſome Men went
farther than any Body of the Diſſenters in <hi>England</hi>
would go now, and farther than they themſelves would
ever after have gone again.</p>
            <p>They offered to ſubmit to a Superintendency; or
call it what you will, a moderate Epiſcopacy, and I
ſhall not diſpute with any Man, whether they did not
offer to go higher than is conſiſtent with a Presby terian
Parity.</p>
            <p>They ſaw that whole Body going to be rent in Pieces;
they ſaw themſelves going to be depriv'd of their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterial
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:1068301600:13"/>
Function, and rendred uncapable of doing the
Good they were dedicated to, and they thought it their
Duty to go as far as poſſible to avoid the greater Evils
they ſaw before them, to themſelves, the Church of
God, and the Power of Religion in general.</p>
            <p>Let thoſe that pleaſe to condemn their Latitude,
take it in what Senſe they think fit, I readily grant all
that is Matter of Fact in their Conceſſion, and which
Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> has at large given an account of in the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory
of his Life.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not examine how far the preſent Body of the
Diſſenters are affected by it, or are to be cenſur'd for it,
or are any way concern'd in it, and I wave it here for
that Reaſon.</p>
            <p>The Conceſſions of the Diſſenters being delivered in,
the King told them, <hi>He was well pleaſed they agreed to
the Eſſence of Epiſcopacy;</hi> and renew'd his Aſſurances
to them of his earneſt Deſire of an Accommodation.</p>
            <p>What the Treatment they met with from the Church
Party upon theſe Conceſſions was, is very remarkable,
and might put it out of any bodys thought ever to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
a Conjunction.</p>
            <p>Their Conceſſions being rejected, the Miniſters were
immediatly put to the Teſt of their Fidelity, and 'tis
remarkable; that of all theſe that offered their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions,
very few, if any, conform'd; above 3000 of
the beſt, moſt Learned, and Pious of the Miniſters,
and who enjoy'd the largeſt Benefices rejected the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
of Biſhopricks and Preferment, and quitted their
Livings; becauſe they could not comply.</p>
            <p>And thus the Epiſcopal Hierarchy was again re-eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed
in <hi>England</hi>—, ſeveral Perſecutions of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters
followed in the times of King <hi>Charles</hi> II. the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour
and Cruelty of which are ſtanding Teſtimonies
that they are very far from being Epiſcopally enclin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>Several
Acts of Parliament have been ſince made
to render them as uneaſy as poſſible, as the Act of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:1068301600:14"/>
I mean the Amendments to it, the five Mile
Act, the <hi>et cactera</hi> Oath, the Sacramental Teſt, and
others.</p>
            <p>But the Gentlemen on that ſide have ſeen their Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,
and even theſe we call High-Church Men, are now
forewardeſt to make Conceſſions to the Diſſenters, in
order to bring them in to the Church—, what their
Deſign is, he muſt be blinder than I will ſuppoſe any
of my Readers to be, that does not ſee; but they do
the Diſſenters this Service in it, to teſtifie for them, that
no Conceſſions will now bring them in, but ſuch as ſhall
bring the Worſhip and Diſcipline of the Church down to
the Teſt of the Scriptures—, and this farther clears
them of all Suſpicion of being Epiſcopally inclin'd.</p>
            <p>And thus I have brought the Church of <hi>England</hi> part
of this Diſcourſe down to the latter Times of King
<hi>Charles</hi> II.</p>
            <p>At his Death the Succeſſor was a Papiſt, and the firſt
Step he took, was to face about to the Diſſenters, and
by the Gloſs of Charity, and General Juſtice, court
them to his Party, giving them Liberty, but on
the foot of his Prerogative, not the Laws, to draw
them into the Snares, of, at leaſt, a tacit Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Right to do ſo.</p>
            <p>The Generality of the Diſſenters ſaw the hook thro'
this Bait, and tho they accepted their Liberty, and
carryed it dutifully to their Sovereign; yet they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed
their Diſſatisfaction at having it given in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parliamentary
manner.</p>
            <p>Upon which theſe Famous Lines were made which
every Body had in their Prints and Diſcourſe.
<q>
                  <l>The Declaration's but a <hi>Trojan</hi> Horſe,</l>
                  <l>The Form's illegal, and the Matter's worſe.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Some indeed were drawn into the Snares of Addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,
tho they were generally Oppoſed by the beſt and
greateſt part of the Diſſenters, and thoſe that did it,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:1068301600:15"/>
thank't him for the Liberty indeed, yet were ignorant
both in the Deſign, and unbelieving in the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences,
as appear'd in that as ſoon as their Eyes were
opened, they ſtarted back, and teſtified their Concern
for having been drawn in ſo far, of which preſently.</p>
            <p>This alſo farther appear'd in that, when the King,
who thought he had gain'd one Point, was for puſhing
at another, <hi>vlz.</hi> the taking off the Penal Laws and Teſt;
the Diſſenters, tho they had ſuffered ſo deeply, and
theſe Penal Laws were both wicked in their Nature,
and particularly pointed at them; yet they generally
rejected it, and declared they had rather be oppreſt by
the Church of <hi>E.</hi> than have both the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
and themſelves too, torn to Pieces by Popery or
thoſe Laws invaded by the diſpenſing Power of the
Prince; nor could all King <hi>James</hi> his Booted Apoſtles
bring them off from this.</p>
            <p>In the Senſe of this the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and the
Diſſenters made that famous Capitulation, on which the
inviting over the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> afterwards the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Reſtorer of Britains Liberty was built, and which
is expreſt in the Eighth Article of the Memorial to that
Prince, on the Performance of which Treaty, the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhment
of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and the Tolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the Diſſenters are equally built, and ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by Right, Truth, and Fundamental Law, and thus
they both ſtand at this Day.</p>
            <p>I come now to the Reformation of the Church of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
which beginning later than that of <hi>England,</hi> by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
twelve Years, and having no Bonds of Tyranny
upon them, which as I have noted, drew <hi>England</hi> into the
Snare of the Regale; but their Reformation being made
by the People themſelves, and Mr. <hi>Jobn Knox</hi> being their
<hi>Calvin,</hi> and who ſent or went to <hi>Geneva</hi> on purpoſe to
concert the beſt Grounds of a National Settlement,
they had nothing impoſed upon them, nor any body
to impoſe it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:1068301600:16"/>
The Lords which headed them, referr'd the whole
Settlement of Religion to the Miniſters, they had the
Miſchiefs <hi>England</hi> was fallen into by a partial and
pompous Reformation before their Eyes, and thus they
reform'd at once into the compleat Model, both as
to Diſcipline and Worſhip, which we find at this day.</p>
            <p>Nor were they ſo dark in their Foreſight, as not
to expect all the Rage and Oppoſition the Enemies of
ſuch a Reformation could be guilty of, and to ſecure
the People therefore as far as poſſible in the ſtrict Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence
to the mighty Work they were engag'd in,
they contrived the moſt Solemn, Awful and Tremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous
Obligation, that I believe, any Nation ever
bound themſelves in, ſince the Oath of God, which <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>
made the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> take at Mount <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reb.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This
is what they call the National Covenant, in
which the People bind themſelves and their Poſterity,
in the moſt ſolemn manner to God Almighty, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here
to, maintain and defend to the utmoſt of their Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
the Reformation they had ſettled, the Doctrine,
Diſcipline and Government of the Church, as expreſt
in their confeſſion of Faith, and ſeveral other Articles
both of Civil and Eccleſiaſtical Conſtitution therein
expreſt, needleſs, and too long to be repeated here.</p>
            <p>This Covenant was made firſt in the Year, 1581. the
new Reformation being then threatned with many E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies,
as well Foreign as Domeſtick—, and it was
renewed again, in the Year 1590.</p>
            <p>I am far from raiſing the leaſt Scruple at, or making
any Reflection upon the Nature, the Canſe, the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
or Obligation of this Covenant, or any Branch
of it; they that conſtrue me ſo, do it to cover the
Shame of the other ill Treatment which I have dayly
from them.</p>
            <p>I frankly own it a ſolemn, and almoſt juſt Obligation,
and declare I never meant in any thing I ſaid, or printed,
the leaſt Reflection againſt it; and 'tis very juſt I ſhould
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:1068301600:17"/>
have the explaining my own words.</p>
            <p>If what I have ſaid any where, gives a ſeeming Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection,
I ſhould be very ſorry, for the ſake of them
that may ignorantly miſtake me; as for thoſe that
maliciouſly and wilfully miſtake me, they are worth
no Honeſt Mans Notice, nor is it on their account in
the leaſt, that I take notice of it here; but to diſabuſe
thoſe who are impoſed upon by ſuch.</p>
            <p>I freely recognize the National Covenant, and what
I ſaid in the ſixth Eſſay of our Fathers eating theſe
ſowre Grapes, and us their Children's Teeth ſet on
edge by them. I wonder any Man ſhould be ſo unjuſt
as to turn my words to a Meaning, That the Covenant
is a ſowre Grape that ſets the Childrens Teeth on Edge.
I therefore declare it to be only brought as an Alluſion to
thoſe People who load themſelves with more Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in their Notions of the Covenant, than the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
really impoſes upon them—, and the Senſe of
the place in which 'tis brought, will allow me this to
any impartial Perſon.</p>
            <p>I was proving that the National Covenant is not at
all concern'd in the Union; I acknowledge firſt, that
the Covenant is binding to Poſterity, and I add, that
for Argument ſake, I'll grant; <hi>whether I believe it or
no,</hi> it has all that Obligation they alledge, <hi>let that be
what it will</hi>—, ſignifying thereby, they do reckon
greater Obligations than really are in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
and this I call eating ſowre Grapes, 6<hi>th.</hi> Eſſay,
<hi>P.</hi> 20. and this I leave to any impartial Cenſure.</p>
            <p>If this be not Satisfaction to any Honeſt Man, that I
have not the leaſt Diſreſpect for the National Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
I ſhall on any Reaſonable Sentence of indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Judges, make ſuch more ſolemn Declaration or
Acknowledgment as they can deſire.</p>
            <p>But to go on with my Hiſtory of the Reformation in
<hi>Scotland,</hi> there was a great Difference in it from what
had been in <hi>England,</hi> for here it was made perfectly,
without the Aſſiſtance, <hi>and contrary to the Intention</hi> of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:1068301600:18"/>
the Sovereign—, and the Regale therefore found no
body to eſpouſe it, but the Reformers had opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to make their Model as compleat as they could.</p>
            <p>I know it has been objected, that in the Infancy of the
Reformation, they found the very Eſſence of Epiſcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
neceſſary, and that was in the Superintendents na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
in the <hi>Church Policy,</hi> one of the firſt Inſtruments of
ſettlement deviſed for their Church, the Model of which
had been brought from <hi>Geneva</hi> by Mr. <hi>John Knox,</hi> and
ſome have raiſed Pleas from hence for the Prelatick
Power, as the moſt Original Inſtitution, and the like
of the Common Prayers.</p>
            <p>But the Biſhops would be ill pleaſed to be
no other kind of Biſhops than thoſe were, who tho they
had a Dioceſs indeed, yet were ſubject to be depoſed
by the ordinary Miniſters of their own Bounds, and
therefore I do not bring this to juſtify Prelacy, but to
relate as near as I can, the Fact as it lies, and the Uſe
of it ſhall appear preſently,</p>
            <p>The Superintendents indeed had their Dioceſſes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed,
<hi>and 'tis call'd by that very name,</hi> and they had
power to plant Miniſters, ſettle Churches, and do ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
things, which at that time could not be done
without them; but I muſt always inſiſt upon their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
as a Clauſe that Chocks all the Efforts to prove
the firſt Reformation Epiſcopal.</p>
            <p>However, they were Superintendents, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſome kind of Superintendency may not be incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent
with Presbyterian Parity, and thats all the uſe
I ſhall make of it.</p>
            <p>I find another inſtance of this, which ſerves the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Occaſion, and that is a Letter written in the
Year <gap reason="blank" extent="1 word">
                  <desc> _____ </desc>
               </gap> from the Aſſembly of the Church of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
to the Biſhops in <hi>England,</hi> and in a differing
Stile from what we write here now; the letter begins
thus.</p>
            <q>The Superintendents, Miniſters and Commiſſioners of the Church within
the Realm of <hi>Scotland</hi> to their <pb n="20" facs="tcp:1068301600:19"/> Brethren the
Biſhops and Paſtors in <hi>England,</hi> who have renounced the <hi>Roman
Antichriſt,</hi> and have profeſſed with us <hi>the Lord Jeſus</hi>
            </q>
            <p>Here is ſomething very remarkable, and worth
nothing.<list>
                  <item>1. That the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> eſteem'd, <hi>even the
Biſhops</hi> and Paſtors in thoſe days, as Brethren pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>felling
with them the <hi>Lord Jeſus,</hi> a quite different
Language from thoſe who ſtile them <hi>Dumb Dogs,</hi>
poor <hi>Rogues,</hi> &amp;c. Indecencys, which muſt be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive
to modeſt Ears, were the caſe much worſe
than it is.</item>
                  <item>2. The Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> was as far from owning
Epiſcopacy it ſelf then as now, and in the very
Letter, they exclaim againſt the Pomp and
Ceremonies of Worſhip; but it did not at all
break off their Charity from the Perſons of the
Biſhops and Paſtors, whom they ſtill call'd Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,

            <p>Biſhops in thoſe days, tho Prelats, veſted with Civil
Power, wearing the Habit, and every way practiſing
their Church Power as now, yet were Holy and worthy
Chriſtians, and of the ſame Claſs with <hi>Cranmer, Ridly,
Latimer, Farrar,</hi> and Bleſſed <hi>Hooper,</hi> who all of them
ſealed the Reformed Religion with their Blood, and
durſt paſs to the Stake, and the Flames in maintaining
the true Proteſtant Faith, againſt that <hi>Roman Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt</hi>
here mentioned.</p>
            <p>Let no Man ſuſpect me here of favouring Epiſcopacy;
for tho of late Years, the very Men have been a Scandal
to the Office; yet I profeſs were the Biſhops <hi>Now</hi> all <hi>Hoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers</hi>
and <hi>ranmers;</hi> I could not agree to their Church Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment:
However, I cannot call it a damning Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror;
certainly a Biſhop may go to Heaven, or elſe our
want of Charity muſt be great for the Martyrs; I am
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:1068301600:20"/>
therefore for letting them alone, ſo far, I mean as reſpects
Civil Treatment, and fair Uſage—; 'tis enough the
Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> is fenced againſt them by Law, and
the Debt of common Civility is due to all the World.</p>
            <p>In like manner we find the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> uſing
a Liturgy in former Times—, I ſhall not infer that
ſhe ought to be diſtruſted on that Score, as likely to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapfe
to it.</p>
            <p>But this I ſhall obſerve, that Liturgies unimpoſed,
have always been in uſe in the Church, even from the
firſt 300 Years, and therefore are not ſo Frightful as
ſome people make them, and the Directory is a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy
in its kind; all the Reformed Churches have Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgies,
and all that could be deſired in that caſe, by
the Diſſenters in 1661 was, 1. That they be reformed.
And, 2<hi>dly.</hi> That they be not impoſed.</p>
            <p>To prove that a Liturgy and Common Prayer were
uſed in <hi>Scotland,</hi> take the following Inſtances.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. In the Church Policy mentioned before, we have theſe words, <hi>In
great Towns, we think it expedient, that every day there be either Sermon
or</hi> Common Prayer. And again, <hi>On the day of the Publick Sermon, we do
not think the</hi> Common Prayer <hi>needful to be uſed.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2. In the Directory for the publick Worſhip in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> we
have this Introduction or Preface;
<q>"In the beginning of this Bleſſed Reformation, our wiſe and Pious
Anceſtors took care to ſet forth an Order for redreſs of many things,
which they then, by the word, diſcovered to be vain, erroneous
Superſtitions and Idolatrous in the publick Worſhip of God—. <hi>This
occaſioned many Godly and Learned Men to rejoice much in the Book of</hi>
Common Prayer <hi>at that time ſet forth.</hi>"</q>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>The Summ of all this is, not at all to favour either Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy
or Liturgy in their Attempts to be either juſtified
or reſtored in <hi>Britain:</hi> let no Man miſtake me, but to do Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
againſt furious Cenſures, who at the ſame time, that
the Nations profeſſing both ſorts, are going to unite,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:1068301600:21"/>
your to repreſent them as meer Popery or Heathen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm,
that the Diſſenters in <hi>England</hi> may be the eaſier
Cenſured for offers of Complyance with them, and
this I profeſs to be my ſingle Reaſon for giving theſe
Inſtances; as for thoſe who will have me mean what I
never intend, I leave them to their own ways, and
contemn their want of Candour.</p>
            <p>'Tis enough the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> is reform'd from
this, all the burthens of Ceremony, Forms and Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchys
are taken away, and Purity in both Worſhip
and Diſcipline obtained; but there is a Chriſtian Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
and Charity towards the Church of <hi>England</hi> certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
due, who, tho not ſo far reformed, are yet our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
and of whom we yet hope, and ought to pray
that they ſhall one day be effectually Illuminated;
this Temper and Charity, I hope, ſhall now encreaſe
on an Union, and that all the Contention ſhall be to
out-preach, out-live, and out-practiſe one another, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulating,
and thereby provoking one another to Love
and to Good Works.</p>
            <p>But to go back to the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Convulſions ſhe has felt by the Interpoſition of Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny,
Conqueſt, and ſometimes Epiſcopacy, are to be
ſeen at large in the Hiſtorys of both Kingdoms, and I
ſhall not enter upon them.</p>
            <p>The Perſecutions of the Honeſt ſuffering Inhabitants
are a melancholly Teſtiwmony of the Aſſaults the Devil
and his Agents have made upon the Reformation here,
the Courage, Conſtancy, and vigorous Oppoſition of
the Zealous Confeſſors of Chriſt and his Church in this
Nation deſerve a better Hiſtorian, and one leſs a Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
to <hi>Scotland</hi> than I am, to record, and call for more
leiſure, and more room than I have in this ſmall Tract,
and I therefore leave them with this Remark, That no
Nation in the World has with more Zeal and Fidelity
oppoſed all the Impoſitions, Innovations and Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities
of the Enemies of Truth; than this Nation, and
more I cannot ſay here.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:1068301600:22"/>
Under theſe ſuffering Circumſtances, they continued,
with ſome ſhort Intervals, till their being incorporated
with <hi>England</hi> in the time of <hi>Oliver Cromwel,</hi> when tho
they ſeemed to be under a Military Government; yet
they had their Repreſentatives in Parliament, were
Taxed but in Proportion to the Repreſentative; and as
I am inform'd here, their Subjection, ſuch as it was,
was attended with an Encreaſe of Wealth, Trade and
Property.</p>
            <p>At the Reſtoration, they had Epiſcopacy, Tranny
and Superſtition reſtored juſt as in <hi>England;</hi> Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
that could not conform, turn'd out, ſilenced, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted,
fin'd, baniſhed, impriſoned <hi>mutatis mutandis,</hi>
juſt as in <hi>England,</hi> except only that their Cruelties
and Inhumanities here went farther than they did
there.</p>
            <p>Thus they continued till the Revolution, at the
happy coming of the Great Deliverer of the whole
Iſland, King <hi>WIlliam;</hi> when Tyranny fled, and Guilt
drew in her bluſhing Countenance; Law, Truth,
Juſtice and Liberty reviving, the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi>
obtained a Reſurrection from a Hundred Years of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery,
Uncertainty, and Diſtreſs.</p>
            <p>Then Epiſcopay again vaniſh't in its turn, and its
Elder Siſter Tyranny, abdicated with her; the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian
Government of the Church was reſtored to its
Primitive Freedom, and to the full Exerciſe and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
of all its Legal Rights, as it is this day, and thus
far relates to the Hiſtory of both Churches.</p>
            <p>I come Now to the Diſſenters in <hi>England,</hi> as the
third Claſs of People, I am to enter upon.</p>
            <div type="section">
               <head>Of the Diſſenters in England.</head>
               <p>I left them ejected, contemn'd, perſecuted, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt
during the Reign of the late King <hi>Charles;</hi> wheed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
and amuſed, under his Brother King <hi>James,</hi> reſtored
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:1068301600:23"/>
and tolerated under King <hi>William;</hi> and yet farther ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
of that Liberty, tho under ſeveral Invaſions, by
the Vigilance of the Honſe of Lords, and the Honour, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
and ſpecial Favour of her preſent Majeſty, whoſe
Concern for them, Clemency and Juſtice to them, and
free Adherence to their compleat Toleration, I hope
they wlll never forget.</p>
               <p>Here I deſire to ſpeak ſomething to the Matter of
diſſenting from the Church of <hi>England</hi> in general, and
then to the Endeavours of Reconciliation on both ſides;
and I hope that true ſtating the Matter of Fact, will
clear up all the Doubts People may entertain on both
ſides without invectives, perſonal Reproaches, Railery,
or ill Treatment of the Parties, with which I ſhall no
ways concern my ſelf.</p>
               <p>I have deduc't the Diſſenters from the Church of
<hi>England,</hi> from them they came out, the Reaſon of
their diſſenting, I have confin'd to one Main Head,
<hi>viz. Purity of Worſhip,</hi> which was the firſt; ſubſequent
Scruples followed indeed, which were levelled at,
what I call the <hi>Regale and Pontificate,</hi> the Supremacy
of Civil Power, and the Eccleſiaſtical Hierarchy.</p>
               <p>Theſe drove them out of the Church, <hi>and theſe only;</hi>
for as to Doctrinal Articles, they are allow'd to be Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox,
and all the Diſſenters frankly ſubſcribe them,
the Quakers excepted, and the laſt Clauſe of the 27<hi>th.</hi>
Article to the Anabaptiſts.</p>
               <p>It being objected by ſome, That <hi>Offers have been
made by the Diſsenters to come into the Church,</hi> I deſire
to ſpeak directly to it, only to premiſe ſomething
which I think neceſſary in this place, relating to the
Church of <hi>England</hi> her ſelf.</p>
               <p>1. The Diſſenters, in their ſeparating from the Church
of <hi>England;</hi> do by no means diſown her being a true
Church, they charge her with no <hi>Doctrinal Error,</hi>
nothing Heretical or Antichriſtian, I mean <hi>as a Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. No Man can be ſo void of Charity as to judge that
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:1068301600:24"/>
a Man adhering to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>whoſe
Conſcience is not farther enlightned,</hi> cannot be ſaved.</p>
               <p>3. No Man then can deny, but that the Diſſenters in
<hi>England</hi> would <hi>gladly come into</hi> the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
and become one Body with them again, and ought to
do ſo, would they abate, alter, or remove all thoſe
things in which they differ from them, which do not
appear warranted by the Word of God.</p>
               <p>This being laid down, it will follow.<list>
                     <item>1. That a ſimple offer of complying with the Church,
can be no matter of Charge againſt the Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
if the Conditions on which they offer it are
thus qualified.</item>
                     <item>2. Thoſe that have offered more, are not to be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified,
nor ſhall not by me; and thoſe that have
not, ought not to be condemned for the Miſtakes
of their Brethren, and a juſt Diſtinction ſhall be
the Work before me.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>I come then to ſpeak to the Matter of Fact, as ſome
have alledged it, that the Diſſenters in <hi>England</hi> have
made Offers to conform to the Church of <hi>England</hi>—;
<hi>I readily grant it is true,</hi> and I think I may as readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
grant all that has been ſaid upon that Head, which
amounts to this, and no more, That ſome of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting
Miniſters at the Conference at the <hi>Savoy,</hi> and
before at <hi>Breda,</hi> willing, if poſſible, to avoid a Breach,
and keep the Office of their Miniſtry, did offer to
ſubmit to a moderate Epiſcopacy, or as the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
call'd it, <hi>owned the Eſſence of Epiſcopacy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I'll grant, that the latitude of ſome of their Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
and the particular extenſive Charity of others, and
the Circumſtances of the whole at that time, carryed
them farther than would conſiſt with the Presbyterian
Parity now inſiſted on by both Churches.</p>
               <p>Nay, I'll grant more than is asked, <hi>and I perceive,
more than ſome People deſire I ſhould grant,</hi> viz. That
they went farther than themſelves, when they ſaw far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
into it, would afterwards agree to, and a great
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:1068301600:25"/>
deal more than others of their Brethren, even, at that
time, would comply with.</p>
               <p>But I make no queſtion to prove here, that there
can be no juſt Argument drawn from hence, to prove
that the Diſſenters now in <hi>England,</hi> ſhould be charged
with the ſame Complyance, or diſtruſted on the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of what then paſt—. But on the contrary, that
there are very good Demonſtrations to prove they
would by no means comply with any ſuch thing; and
that the diſſenting in <hi>England,</hi> and in <hi>Scotland,</hi> is on the
ſame Foundation with one another, and no other.</p>
               <p>The Debate therefore of the Complyance in 1661, I
take to be at an end here; <hi>Becauſe I grant all that can
be alledged on that head,</hi> I neither Juſtifie nor approve
the Conceſſions offered, tho at the ſame time the other
Party alledged they were no Conceſſions at all, but
what were deſtructive to Epiſcopacy, and, as they
call'd it, a Plot againſt it.</p>
               <p>I muſt own, I think, That ſuppoſe the Comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of thoſe Men as ſinful as we pleaſe, they were
Great and Good Men, they are dead, and gone to their
Reſt, and their Works follow them; their Labours
remain ſtanding Monuments of their Worth and Excellence,
and ſeem to merit that their Infirmities
ſhould be buried in the Grave with them.</p>
               <p>Let any Miniſter in <hi>Britain</hi> firſt make it appear,
that he has been bleſt with being made the Inſtrument
of the Converſion, reſtoring and comforting as many
Souls, as Mr. <hi>Baxters Call to the Unconverted,</hi> his <hi>Saints
everlaſting Reſt,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hows Bleſſedneſs of the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi>
and he ſhall paſs with me for the greateſt Bleſſing
of his kind, that God has left us in this Day.</p>
               <p>Works of this Value deſerve their Savour in the
Hearts of all good Chriſtians, and if ſome Opinions of
theſe Men do not agree with ours; yet Charity ought
to reſtrain our Cenſures of ſuch Men, as God has made
eminently uſeful in his Church, at leaſt let us abſtract
the Good, and let the Bad ſleep, that what we Diſlike
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:1068301600:26"/>
may not prejudge the Minds of thoſe who may receive
Good from the other.</p>
               <p>This I think is a Chriſtian way of dealing with
them, and they that reflect moſt upon their own miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages
and failings will be apteſt to allow for other
people, the reſt is all cavil and indecent.</p>
               <p>Having yielded thus to the utmoſt, I am now to
prove that the Diſſenters in <hi>England</hi> are not of the ſame
Mind now, and would on no account go the ſame
length, the Conſequence of which will be plain, that they
are not to be Cenſur'd or diſtruſted for what was then
done.</p>
               <p>I confeſs my Abſence from Books and Vouchers in
<hi>England,</hi> deprives me of ſome Helps; but I muſt
work with ſuch Tools as I have; and tho my perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
may not be ſo perfect as otherwiſe it would
be; yet I hope it ſhall be convincing, and any mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Perſon will allow for the Diſadvantage of meer
Memory.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> I have living Teſtimony now in this place,
who have heard moſt, if not all the Diſſenting Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
of <hi>England</hi> that have been here, declare in their
own Names, and on account of their Brethren in
<hi>England,</hi> that it is the general Opinion of the Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
in <hi>England,</hi> That if the Church of <hi>England</hi> would
abate their whole Liturgy, Habits, Ceremonies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
yet that they could not conform meerly on account of
Epiſcopacy; and if it ſhall be of any weight to add my
own Teſtimony, I declare I have heard them univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally
profeſs the ſame thing in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to come farther, lets take the Teſtimony of their
Enemies, which is no ill way of coming at a charge;
the Author of the <hi>Regale and Pontificate,</hi> an Eminent
Advocate for the Epiſcopal Hierarchy in <hi>England,</hi>
charging the Diſſenters with their rejecting all offers of
Complyance made from the Church, concludes thus,
<hi>'tis impoſſible that any Union can be made between the
Church and them; becauſe they refuſe the REGALE</hi>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:1068301600:27"/>
and <hi>PONTIFICATE,</hi> and on this he charges them with
<hi>incurable Schiſm.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Author of the <hi>Wolff ſtript,</hi> one of this Countrey
Men, and a great Schollar, inviting, or rather chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenging
the Diſſenters to the ſtating their Scruples be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Convocation, in order to a Reconciliation, has
theſe words—. <hi>We ſhould have little Quarrel with
the Diſſenters about all the Objections they make as to
Habit, Ceremonies, Liturgy, and even the grand Point of
Ordination by Presbyters, if it was not for their Schiſm,
and gathering ſeparate Congregations, in Oppoſition to the
true Epiſcopal Authority of the Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here's Liturgy, Ceremonies, Habits, and almoſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
thing ſacrifiz'd to the Diſſenters, BUT EPIS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>COPACY,
and why did they not accept the Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge;
but becauſe the <hi>Main and Material thing</hi> was
behind, without which there could be no Complyance,
<hi>viz.</hi> Epiſcopal Hierarchy.</p>
               <p>What is the Complyance of Mr. <hi>Baxter, &amp;c.</hi> to
theſe things? what was then done, is near 50 Years ago,
and the State of things is ſomewhat altered ſince that
time; for 'tis otherways now.</p>
               <p>And here I think it will be proper to remind the
Diſſenters Enemies, or thoſe that <hi>diſtruſt them</hi> on this
account, with that many headed Monſter call'd A
COMPREHENSION, which ſome People—, <hi>in the
abundance of their Ignorance,</hi> have charg'd the Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
with contriving.</p>
               <p>I believe the Challenge may very modeſtly be made
in the Name of all the Diſſenters in <hi>England</hi> to any Man,
to prove that a Comprehenſion had ever its Riſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them, or that any Diſſenter ever cloſed with it.</p>
               <p>I know Biſhop <hi>Uſher</hi>'s <hi>Model</hi> was the famous Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and ſeveral Diſſenters, I believe, at that time,
might have come into that.</p>
               <p>But even that Model was far from <hi>a Comprehenſion,</hi>
and when ever the Word <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>omprehenſion came to be
conſidered, and brought down to <hi>the Edge of Practice,</hi>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:1068301600:28"/>
it was always found impracticable, and therefore the
aforeſaid Author of the <hi>Regale and Pontificate</hi> declares
an Union between the Church and the Diſſenters im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible;
becauſe the Diſſenters will not come up to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopacy.</p>
               <p>I know ſome People are foreward to tell us there is
a project in <hi>England</hi> now, of making Abatements to
the Diſſenters to bring them in, I ſhall give a ſhort an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
to it, if it be to take away the <hi>Regale</hi> and <hi>Ponti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficate,</hi>
they will accept it, for that is not coming in
to the Church, but receiving the Church in to us; if it
be only as formerly, to abate Rigorous Exacting of
Conformity, I pledge the Value of all I have ſaid u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
it.<list>
                     <item>1. That 'tis a high Church Project.</item>
                     <item>2. That the Diſſenters reject it.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>Now, I would fain ask thoſe Gentlemen that fear
the Diſſenters and the Church of <hi>England</hi> ſhould unite,
who of the Church, the Diſſenters ſhould be moſt like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to join with, <hi>the High Church</hi> or <hi>the Low Church;</hi>
the Low Church-men do not ſeek it, for they are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to give the Diſſenters all the Liberty and Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
they deſire, knowing they cannot come in; as
to the high Church, I believe no body will ſuſpect the
Diſſenters of coming over to them.</p>
               <p>But here's another Queſtion will be harder to decide
ſtill; How comes it to paſs, that the High-Church
Men quarrel the Low-Church-Men on this Head, and
charge them with ſhifting the Cauſe of the Schiſm off
from themſelves, telling them, they are not ſo willing
to yield in indifferent things to the Diſſenters, as
they are; to prove this the ſame Author quoted before,
inviting the Diſſenters to offer their Demands to the
Convocation, and telling them indifferent things will be
given up to them, has theſe words.</p>

                  <q rend="inline">'The High Church deſire that they and the Low
Ohurch may be tryed by their Actions—</q>, thus you

the High Church of giving up all, or giving up none,
and Comprehenſions, Abatements, <hi>&amp;c</hi> are all offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

               <p>The Reaſon is plain, they ſee an effectual Gate,
to the Ruine of the Diſſenters in making Diviſion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them, by yielding in part—, but are mortally
averſe to giving up the Subſtantial and effectual Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
which once removed, would bring an Univerſal
Conjunction.</p>
               <p>If I am ask't here in General, whether we would on
any terms joyn at all with them. I anſwer. and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
all good Chriſtians will anſwer, <hi>Yes, with all our
Hearts</hi>—, and ſo will the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> too.</p>
               <p>And as 'tis natural to ſay in the next Queſtion, What
are the Conditions, Truely ſuch as on the Foundation
of which, we would all join with the Papiſts, or any
Church in the World, and I hope, no body will take
Offence at the General way of expreſſing it; for 'tis not
ſtepping foreward, but receiving thoſe that ſtep for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
to us.</p>
               <p>If any Chriſtian Church will abate what is either in
their Doctrine, Worſhip, or Diſcipline, not warranted
by the Word of God, I'll readily ſay, we ſhall all join
with that Church. <hi>But to come to Particulars,</hi> as this is
not the firſt time that Queſtion has been ask't and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd,
I'll give five Heads which have been offered
to the Church in this Caſe by the Diſſenters, and on
which, I believe; the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> the Church
of <hi>England,</hi> and the Diſſenters, ſhould ſoon be one
united Body, and theſe are long ſince made publick
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:1068301600:30"/>
in ſeveral Tracts, particularly in an Anſwer to the
High Church Challenge printed in the Year 1704.<list>
                     <item>1. That as to Liturgies, they may ſuffer ſuch amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Alterations as are juſtifiable by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and the Practice of the Primitive Church.</item>
                     <item>2. That when they are ſo amended, they may not be
impoſed, or the Miniſter tyed up, and preſcrib'd
by the Letter of the Book, but be at liberty to
enlarge or abridge as his own abilities may ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,
or the Caſe require.</item>
                     <item>3. That Ordination of Miniſters be eſtabliſh't in
the Presbyters, and no re-ordination or unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Oaths impoſed.</item>
                     <item>4. That Habits and Ceremonies, ſuch as kneeling
at the Sacrament, bowing at the name of Jeſus,
the Croſs in Baptiſm, the Surplice, Veſtments,
and all the reſt, ſcrupled by the Diſſenters, and
own'd to be indifferent, may be wholly left out,
or left at the Diſcretion of the People, as that they
may not be impoſed upon them without their
Conſent.</item>
                     <item>5. That Church Government be reduced to ſuch a
pitch of Authority, and veſted in ſuch Perſons as
may be juſtified by the Scriptures, and no other.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>In all theſe Offers, I do not ſee the leaſt Tendency
towards a Complyance with any thing, either in Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline
or Worſhip, which the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi>
would not agree to, or that can render the Diſſenters
ſuſpected; I do not ſay theſe are all the things to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted
on, and let no Man take that weak hold by the
Barrenneſs of Expreſſion to ſuggeſt a corrupt Meaning;
but I think there is nothing the Church of <hi>England</hi> can
be ask't, but what is contained <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>airly in theſe Generals.</p>
               <p>On the Conceding therefore theſe five Heads, the
Diſſenters, yea, and the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> too, might
very eaſily cloſe with the General Union, and become
one great Proteſtant, and purely reformed Church,
for it would be one Presbyterian Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:1068301600:31"/>
Upon the whole, the Matter of Fact I think is plain,
that the grand Difference between the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
and the Diſſenters, at this time, is juſt the ſame
as in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and no other, I mean Church Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
or, in the High Church Language, <hi>the Regale
and Pontificate,</hi> and all the Diſpute in both may be
ſaid to turn upon two Points.<list>
                     <item>1. Epiſcopal Hierarchy.</item>
                     <item>2. The Supremacy of the Civil Magiſtrate, or his
Power to Impoſe Indifferent Things, and thereby to
make them neceſſary.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>This is the Sum of the Matter, and moſt of it lyes in
the firſt Head too; For, were the Hierarchy reduced,
'tis plain, the Church would ſoon give up the reſt:
And, as the Author before Quoted obſerves, <hi>Would
have little Diſpute about Habits, Ceremonies, Liturgies
and Ordination;</hi> They are indeed but the Pomp and
Jingle of the other, and the Scripture Rule would ſoon
reduce them to Primitive Plainneſs.</p>
               <p>I know the Nicety of the Subject I am writing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and the want of Charity with which ſome will
read, and this forces me to frequent and otherwiſe
needleſs Excurſions.</p>
               <p>I hope I retain an Air of Integrity in my Meaning,
and for Miſconſtructions, <hi>eſpecially wilful ones,</hi> I deſpiſe
them: I ſee nothing in my Diſcourſe, that ſhould
make me be ſuſpected of being Epiſcopally inclin'd—Tho
I cannot be for Sealing all that are of an Epiſcopal
Church to Reprobation.—Nor Treating them as
Antichriſtian: I believe the Hierarchy Unſcriptural,
and enter my publick Proteſt againſt both <hi>Regale</hi> and
<hi>Ponitificate.</hi>—And I think this is as much as any
Chriſtian can be requir'd.—But I cannot call the
Church of <hi>England</hi> Antichriſtian, becauſe neither <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gale</hi>
or <hi>Pontificate</hi> are Eſſentials of Doctrine, and when
ever they ſhall be quitted by them, they are from
that time the ſame individual Reform'd Preſbyterian
Church with this in <hi>Scotland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:1068301600:32"/>
Some have taken pains to prove, that the Diſſenters
in <hi>England, I deſire to be underſtood of the Diſſenters,
the Preſbyterian Diſſenters, except where I explain it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therways,</hi>
declare themſelves <hi>now</hi> for moderate Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy—. But this can never be prov'd upon them;
Nor does Mr. <hi>Calamy</hi> any where ſuggeſt i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, that I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,
if he ſays <hi>No Body Queſtioned the Lawfulneſs
of it at the Conference at the Savoy,</hi> it does not amount
to a Proof, that they allowed the Lawfulneſs of
it, much leſs that they do ſo now.</p>
               <p>But then I find 'tis objected, That they Sign the
37<hi>th</hi> Article of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which Recog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizes
the <hi>Regale,</hi> or Power of the Civil Authority:
But he that Quotes the Words of that Article, and
leaves out the Explanation with which they Sign it,
does not Act the moſt candid part of a Reconciler,
nor Treat them fairly.</p>
               <p>'Tis known, That the Explication is made part of
that Article, and with that Explication the Diſſenters
are ſatisfied; and ſatisfied, that they do not own the
Supremacy of the Civil Power in Eccleſiaſtical Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
<hi>farther than all the Proteſtant Churches in</hi> Europe <hi>do.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Again,</hi> this cannot be brought as a ſingle Argument
to diſtruſt the Preſbyterian Diſſenters, <hi>if it be any
Proof at all, 'tis againſt the whole Body;</hi> For even
the Anabaptiſts Sign that Article, as well as the Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians,
and no Man ever ſuſpected them of owning the
Supremacy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Laſtly, And which is more than all the reſt,</hi> the Church
her ſelf is come off from the <hi>Regale</hi> in General, and the
Oath of Supremacy formerly impoſed was one of the
firſt things left out of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Conſtitution at the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution,
the Act for it repealed, and has never been
impoſed upon any Bo-dy ſince.</p>
               <p>So that I think no Complyance can be charg'd on
the Diſſenters in <hi>England</hi> upon that Foundation.</p>
               <p>I have met with but one thing more, in which the
Diſſenters are attack't, relating to <hi>Scotland,</hi> and that
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:1068301600:33"/>
is, that they ſet up for a Toleration of Diſſenters
there.</p>
               <p>I muſt own, I have not the ſame formidable Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of a Toleration here, as ſome Gentlemen have:
And as to the Epiſcopal Diſſenters here, I firmly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
'tis the true method to diſſolve and reduce them
to nothing, of which hereafter <hi>but this is nothing to
the caſe;</hi> For I ſee no Proof, that the Diſſenters in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
have, one way or other, concern'd themſelves in
it: And therefore, if any Man charges them on that
Head, it ought to be prov'd; For to ſay 'tis ſo, <hi>as
far as we know,</hi> is only to make it appear, we know but
little or nothing of the Matter.</p>
               <p>But to offer at ſomething relating to their Principles
in that caſe, <hi>it may be noted,</hi> 1. that when Eſſays at
Univerſal Toleration have been made in <hi>England,</hi> the
Diſſenters have always oppoſed them; particularly as
in taking off the Penal Laws againſt Papiſts, when they
choſe rather to bear the Unreaſonable Burden of thoſe
Laws themſelves, than to tolerate what was deſtructive
to the General Conſtitution of the Proteſtant Religion.</p>
               <p>2. Another later Inſtance is, in a Famous Letter lately
written by Mr. <hi>Toland</hi> to the reſpective Heads of the
Diſſenters in <hi>England,</hi> preſſing them to declare their
Opinions of the Univerſal Liberty of Chriſtians, and
the Toleration of all Opinions <hi>meerly Religious:</hi> The
Original of which Letter I have here with me, <hi>for it
was never printed,</hi> and ſhall freely ſhow to any Body
that deſires it.</p>
               <p>Upon this Application, back't with Mr. <hi>Stephens</hi>
and ſeveral others—the Diſſenters meeting and
conſulting about it, unanimouſly reſolved, not to give
any Anſwer at all to it, or to make any Declaration
of their Opinion on that Head—. Now if they
have thus refuſed to declare their Opinion in <hi>England</hi>
where accepting Toleration themſelves, 'tis moſt like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
they ſhould be for giving it to others, 'tis very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely
they ſhould officiouſly declare themſelves for it
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:1068301600:34"/>
in <hi>Scotland,</hi> where they have nothing at all to do
with it.</p>
               <p>However to ſuch Objectors I refer them to my Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of that Matter ſtated in the Preface to <hi>Jure Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vino,</hi>
now to be ſeen in this Town, and which I ſhall
take the Freedom to appeal to.</p>
               <p>I think therefore they are free from any of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
thrown on them on that ſcore.</p>
               <p>I find but one thing more objected againſt them
and that is about their prompting the Diſpenſing
Power of the late King in <hi>England,</hi> by their Addreſſes
of Thanks for an Illegal Indulgence.</p>
               <p>This has been directly anſwer'd already, and is
briefly ſum'd up thus,
<q>Some few Diſſenters did Addreſs and Thank
the King for their Liberty, which, <hi>tho' I do
not, nor ever did approve, becauſe that Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
was their Native Right,</hi> yet as Ignorance,
Good Manners, and Wilingneſs to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ultivate
the Benefit which they had many Ages
mourn'd for want of, moved ſome, and the
prevailing Arts of Court Flatteries others, yet
none of thoſe Addreſſes being a real owning
the Diſpenſing Power, they cannot be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
charged. And it was plain, they
were not deſign'd as ſuch by the Addreſſers,
ſince, as ſoon as they diſcover'd the Fraud,
they all ſtarted back, and acknowledg'd the
Miſtake.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nor can it be argued, as is weakly inſinuated,</hi> That
Thanking him for an Indulgence, is a Thanking him for
a Diſpenſing Power, as that Indulgence was a breaking
in upon the Laws by a Diſpenſing Power, <hi>becauſe the one
was apparent, the other concealed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That ſome were drawn in I owne, <hi>but to what?</hi>—To
Thank the King—Well, <hi>what did they Thank him
for?</hi>—For what was <hi>THE EFFECT</hi> of a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſing
Power. <hi>Note again,</hi> not for the Diſpenſing
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:1068301600:35"/>
Power it ſelf, for they did not foreſee it—. The <hi>HOOK</hi>
Tyranny, was cover'd with the <hi>BAIT</hi> Liberty, <hi>as
in all Ages of the World it has been</hi>—. And 'tis Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingenuous
to charge that Ignorance as a Sin againſt
Knowlege, and the more ſo, becauſe as ſoon as their
Eyes were opened, they corrected the Miſtake.</p>

               </p>

ſome of them,</hi> then, if ten Diſſenters did it, it may be

did not do it, it may be as truly ſaid, <hi>The Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>

               <p>So by this bleſſed ſort of School Reaſoning, it may
be true, and very proper to ſay, the Diſſenters <hi>did it,</hi>
and the Diſſenters <hi>did not do it,</hi> both at the ſame time.</p>
               <p>This is the Art of Reaſoning which I confeſs my ſelf
untaught in and when I handle a Cauſe that wants it,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:1068301600:36"/>
I'll go to School to learn it, but I thank GOD I am
defending a Cauſe and a People, who want nothing
but Truth in the plaineſt Dreſs to defend them, and
a plain Fellow is therefore the fitter to plead for
them.</p>
               <p>Sincerity is the Glory of a Chriſtian, it makes his
Life all of a piece with his Profeſſion, this is the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of the Cauſe of the Diſſenters, which is like the
People, plain and ſincere, if they have ſlipt in any
thing, <hi>Humanum eſt Errare,</hi> but they have fallen like
Chriſtians to riſe again: And what People in the World
has done it leſs? in Thirty Years Oppreſſion, they have
ſtood their Ground, they have upheld the Juſtice of
their Non-conformity, till tyred with perſecuting
them, the very Church that oppoſed them has yielded
to Truth, and complyed with their moſt reaſonable
Demands.</p>
               <p>To charge the Body for the Miſtake of a few, is unjuſt
and unfair, and yet I dare ſay, that the Fact is not
right neither, <hi>viz. That they really own'd the Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing

Deſign</p>
               <p>I could ſay a great deal to defend their General Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour
towards the Church.</p>
               <p>They have always behaved decently and reſpectful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,

               <p>They have defended themſelves <hi>againſt their Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
but not againſt their Perſons, they have kept
their Conſciences, but ſubmitted <hi>every thing elſe</hi> to

               <p>You are all built upon Law and Liberty, that is the

like the ſame Arch, the more weight is laid on you, the

it falls by its own weight, into a heap of meer Rubbiſh
and Diſorder.</p>
               <p>Suffer a Stranger to exhort you to what your

               <p>For my ſelf, I ſhall ſay little, I have quitted the juſt
Reſentment at unſufferable Inſolencies, that I might
with the utmoſt Calmneſs of Mind, move <hi>Scotland</hi> to
Peace, and practiſe the thing I exhort to—; the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
that oppoſes me in this, ſhall not rally me on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

I am content to be all that is contemptible and vile in

               <p>I

It ſhall all be in vain—. Slander and Backbiting
ſhall do me no Injury—. I have been an open Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prover

<hi>If my own Practice had been ſcandalous,</hi> as theſe Men
ſuggeſt, I ſhould, long ſince, have had it Printed in
my Forehead; for this is not the firſt time it has been
attempted. I am ſorry they force me to ſay any thing
in my own Defence, <hi>a moſt inſignificant Triffle to what
I am upon:</hi> But as 'tis done with a Deſign to leſſen the
Eſteem of what I ſay in this Cauſe, I am oblig'd to
ſpeak. They report me a Drunkard, a Swearer, a
Sabbath-breaker, and what not—. Impotent Slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders!
what Shift is Malice driven to? The Iſſue is ſhort
and plain, and their Honeſty ſhall be tryed by
it. I challenge them to bring the Man either
here, or in <hi>England,</hi> that ever ſaw me drink to Exceſs,
that ever heard me ſwear; or in ſhort, can charge my
Converſation with the leaſt Vice or Immorality, with
Indecency, Immodeſty, Paſſion, Prophaneneſs, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing elſe that deſerves Reproach; when they can
do this, I'll burn this Book at the Mercat Croſs, and
deſire all the World to regard no more what I ſay, and
till they can do it, all Honeſt Men will abhor the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice.</p>
               <p>'Tis
hard, Gentlemen, to force any Man to ſay
thus much of his own Character, and ſo far, as it looks
like Oſtentation, I ask Pardon for it; I am far from
valuing my ſelf upon negative Vertue; yet I thank
God that I am able to ſay thus much, and thought my
ſelf oblig'd to convince the World how they are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
upon, and how a Stranger is treated here; and
I beg the Gentlemen that uſe me thus, not to oblige me
to recriminate upon their Morals, which I could do
with too much Advantage.</p>
               <p>It wounds every Honeſt Man to the Soul, to ſee a
Spirit of Bitterneſs and Slander gone out among you,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:1068301600:45"/>
biting and devouring, and diſtruſting one another, at a
time, and in a very Debate of National Union.</p>
               <p>I verily believe God in his Providence has determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the Bleſſed Union of theſe two Nations; I foreſee
all the Malice of Hell cannot oppoſe it; the ſtrange
concurrence of Circumſtances points out the Finger of
Providence in every Point of it, 'thas been made up
of Miracle, and unaccountable Junctures in its Periods.
I beſeech you Gentlemen, let not your unbelieving
rob you of the Bleſſing of it, and adjourn the Comforts
ſo, that like the Elders at <hi>Samaria,</hi> you ſhould ſee it,
but not taſte of it.</p>

               <p>If you would compare the certain Evils you have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided

Popery and War—, theſe are avoided, and muſt

theſe.</p>
               <p>If therefore you have any regard to Juſtice, to Truth,
to your Intereſt, to your Religion, Liberty or Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
calm your Minds, and fortify your Souls with
