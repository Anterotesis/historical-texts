            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>HEALTH is so great a blessing, that every attempt directed towards its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation must tend to benefit Society, and deserves a share of public appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation. To relieve the wants of the industrious poor is at all times an act of charity; but when the vigor and strength so necessary for the pursuit of their labors are suspended by the fatal powers of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease, and when perhaps the bread of a numerous family depends upon the spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy recovery of a poor and afflicted pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,—at such a time to open the stores
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:1270401000:3"/>of medicine, to dispense a remedy for the poor sufferer, is an act of exalted humanity. For this purpose I have se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected the following Observations for the assistance of the benevolent, who feel a wish to relieve, though fearful of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribing.</p>
            <p>When medical assistance can be had, it should be preferred; but disorders attack suddenly, and it frequently hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens that neither advice or medicines can be procured: in those seasons, the following hints are recommended, with a sincere wish that they may contribute to the general good of mankind.</p>

               <p>AN absorbent; it corrects acidities in the stomach, relieves the heart-burn, and all symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms that have an acid for their source; as sickness, giddiness, head-ach, vomiting, pain in the stomach, convulsions, and complaints in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident to children, arising from the same cause.</p>

               <p>A mild cathartic; gently astringent, and strengthens the intestines; hence it is preferred in diarrhoeas, dysenteries, and all disorders pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from a debility and laxity of the fibres; it is frequently indeed given with a view rather to this stomachic and corroborating virtue, than to its producing any considerable evacuation. In acute fevers, where there is an apprehension of producing a diarrhoea by purging medicines, Rhubarb is safe. In diarrhoeas and dysenteries, Rhubarb is doubly useful; first, by carrying off the peccant matter, secondly, by strengthening the bowels against a further afflux. A peculiar excellence in Rhubarb is, its evacuating viscid bile, when lodged in the bile ducts; in this case, next to Aloes, it is the best among purging medicines; and it has this advantage over Aloes, <hi>viz.</hi> that it may be given where inflammation is attendant, bleeding being premised. In gross habits, <hi>Rhubarb</hi> is an useful assistant to secure the efficacy of the Bark, if joined with it.</p>

               <p>The febriſuge virtue, for which alone this medicine was at first recommended, is now established by long experience. An emetic, which in most cases is necessary, being taken towards the approach of a paroxysm, (that its operation may be over before the fit comes on), the <hi>Bark</hi> is begun at the end of the paroxysm, or even in the time of the hot fit, and repeated, in doses of half a dram or more, every third or ſourth hour during the intermission: after the fever has been removed, the medicine should be continued for a time, but more sparingly, to prevent a return. During the use of the Bark, the pulse, which between the fits is generally weak and slow, becomes stronger and quicker, the appetite mends, the patient grows more cheerful, and perspiration increases; these may be looked upon as sure presages of its success. At first it frequently occasions a looseness, and this is also salutary; but if the purging continues
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:1270401000:13"/>too long, it is usually checked, by the addition of a little Opium; if too great costiveness en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sues, recourse is had to gentle, opening medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, or clysters. In gross, impure habits, Rhubarb is an useful assistant to secure the efficacy of the Bark, if joined with it: in agues of the inflammatory kind, or accompanied with great heat, a little Nitre is joined or interposed. Peruvian Bark has likewise been found emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently serviceable in gangrenes and mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, proceeding either from an internal or external cause. It has been applied likewise, and not without success, to the cure of periodic head-achs, hysteric and hypochondriac fits, and other disorders which have regular intermissions. By its astringency and aromatic quality it strengthens the whole nervous system, and proves useful in weaknesses of the stomach, and sundry chronical disorders, proceeding from too great a laxity of the fibres. In all cases, mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate exercise generally promotes the effect of the Bark.</p>

Given from ten to fifty or sixty drops, it is an attenuant, alterative, diaphoretic, and diuretic; a few more prove gently cathartic; and two or three drams or tea spoons full, for the most part violently emetic. In general, the Ipecacuanha Powder or Wine is preferred as an <hi>emetic,</hi> being less violent in its operation.</p>

               <p>The principal medical effect of Salt of Wormwood is to attenuate the blood and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours. It destroys acidities in the primae viae, converting them into a mild aperient salt, and thus removes a cause of many chronical diseases. It resolves viscid and glutinous humours, by which, and its gentle stimulus, obstructions are removed, and wherever it passes secretions are promoted.</p>

                  <p>It is also used for making Saline Julaps, often beneficial in ſevers: but as the symptoms of
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:1270401000:20"/>these disorders vary much, medical assistance should be had, as soon as it can be procured. When the symptoms are mild, abstinence in the patient, free dilution, bathing the ſeet in warm water, and keeping in bed to encourage per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration, with the use of the Saline Julap, will often give nature an opportunity of exerting her force to overcome the disease, and by that means stop the progress; but if there is a good deal of oppression and heat, the pulse full and hard, some ſew ounces of blood must be taken away, and of course medical attendance ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered absolutely necessary.</p>
