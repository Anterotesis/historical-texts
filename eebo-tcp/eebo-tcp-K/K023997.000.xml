            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HAT whereas certain <hi>Virtuoſi</hi> Diſaffected to the Government, and
to the Trade and Proſperity of this Kingdom, taking upon them
the Name and Title of the CATOPTRICAL VICTUALLERS, have
preſumed, by Gathering, Breaking, Folding, and Bundling up the
Sun-Beams, by the help of certain <hi>Glaſſes,</hi> to Make, Produce, and
Kindle up ſeveral New <hi>Focus's</hi> or Fires within theſe His Majeſty's
Dominions, and thereby to Boil, Bake, Stew, Fry, and Dreſs all ſorts of Victuals
and Proviſions, to Brew, Diſtil Spirits, Smelt Oars, and, in general, to perform
all the Offices of Culinary Fires; and are endeavouring to procure to themſelves
the Monopoly of this their ſaid Invention. We beg leave humbly to repreſent to
your Honours,</p>
            <p>That ſuch Grant or Patent will utterly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ain and reduce to Beggary your Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners,
their Wives, Children, Servants, and Trades on them depending; there
being nothing left to them, after the ſaid Invention, but Warming of Cellars and
Dreſſing of Suppers in the Winter-time. That the aboliſhing ſo conſiderable a
branch of the Coaſting Trade as that of the Colliers, will deſtroy the Navigation
of this Kingdom. That whereas the ſaid <hi>Catoptrical Victuallers</hi> talk of making
uſe of the <hi>Moon</hi> by Night, as of the <hi>Sun</hi> by Day, they will utterly ruin the
numerous Body of Tallow-Chandlers, and impair a very conſiderable branch of
the Revenue which ariſes from the Tax upon Tallow and Candles.</p>
            <p>That the ſaid <hi>Catoptrical Victuallers</hi> do profane the Emanations of that Glorious
Luminary the <hi>Sun,</hi> which is appointed to <hi>Rule the Day,</hi> and not to <hi>Roaſt Mutton.</hi>
And we humbly conceive, It will be found contrary to the known Laws of this
Kingdom, to Confine, Foreſtall, and Monopolize the Beams of the Sun. And
whereas the ſaid <hi>Catoptrical Victuallers</hi> have undertaken, by Burning-Glaſſes made
of Ice, to Roaſt an Ox upon the <hi>Thames</hi> next Winter: We conceive all ſuch
Practices to be an Encroachment upon the Rights and Privileges of the Company
of <hi>Watermen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the Diverſity of Expoſition of the ſeveral Kitchins in this great City,
whereby ſome receive the Rays of the Sun ſooner, and others later, will occaſion
great Irregularity as to the Time of Dining of the ſeveral Inhabitants, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
great Uncertainty and Confuſion in the diſpatch of Buſineſs: And to thoſe
who, by reaſon of their Northern Expoſition, will be ſtill forced to be at the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences
of Culinary Fires, it will reduce the Price of their Manufacture to ſuch
Inequality as is inconſiſtent with common Juſtice: And the ſame Inconveniency
will affect Landlords in the Value of their Rents.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:0567903200:2"/>
That the Uſe of the ſaid Glaſſes will oblige Cooks and Cook-Maids to ſtudy
Opticks and Aſtronomy, in order to know the due Diſtances of the ſaid <hi>Focus's</hi>
or Fires, and to adjuſt the Poſition of their Glaſſes to the ſeveral Altitudes of the
Sun, varying according to the Hours of the Day, and the Seaſons of the Year;
which Studies, at theſe Years, will be highly Troubleſome to the ſaid Cooks and
Cook-Maids, not to ſay any thing of the utter Incapacity of ſome of them to go
through with ſuch difficult Arts; or (which is ſtill a greater Inconveniency) it
will throw the whole Art of <hi>Cookery</hi> into the Hands of Aſtronomers and Glaſs-Grinders,
Perſons utterly unskill'd in other parts of that Profeſſion, to the great
Detriment of the Health of His Majeſty's good Subjects.</p>
            <p>That it is known by Experience, That Meat Roaſted with Sun-Beams is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
unwholeſome; witneſs ſeveral that have dy'd ſuddenly after eating the
Proviſions of the ſaid <hi>Catoptrical Victuallers</hi>; being that the Sun-Beams taken
inwardly, render the Humours too Hot and Aduſt, occaſion great Sweatings,
and dry up the Rectual Moiſture.</p>
            <p>That Sun-Beams taken inwardly, ſhed a Malignant Influence upon the Brain,
by their natural Tendency towards the Moon; produce Madneſs and Deſtraction
at the time of the Full Moon. That the conſtant uſe of ſo great Quantities of
this Inward Light, will occaſion the Growth of Quakeriſm, to the Danger of the
Church; and Poetry, to the Danger of the State.</p>
            <p>That the Influences of the Conſtellations, through which the Sun paſſes, will,
with his Beams, be convey'd into the Blood; and when the Sun is amongſt the
Horned Signs, may produce ſuch a Spirit of Unchaſtity, as is dangerous to the
Honour of your Worſhips Families.</p>
            <p>That Mankind living much upon the Seeds and other parts of Plants, theſe
being impregnated with the Sun-Beams, may vegetate and grow in the Bowels,
a Thing of more dangerous Conſequence to Human Bodies than Breeding of
Worms; and this will fall heavieſt upon the Poor, who live upon Roots; and the
Weak and Sickly, who live upon Barley and Rue-Gruel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for which we are
ready to produce to your Honours the Opinions of Eminent Phyſicians, That the
Taſte and Property of the Victuals is much alter'd to the worſe by the ſaid <hi>Solar
Cookery,</hi> the Fricaſſes being depriv'd of the <hi>Haut Gout</hi> they acquire by being dreſs'd
over Charcoal.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Should it happen by an Eclipſe of an Extraordinary Length, that this
City ſhould be depriv'd of the Sun-Beams for ſeveral Months; how will His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's
Subjects ſubſiſt in the Interim, when common Cookery, with the Arts de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending
upon it, is totally loſt.</p>
            <p>In Conſideration of theſe, and many other inconveniences, your Petitioners
humbly pray, That your Honours would either totally prohibit the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining
and Manufacturing the Sun-Beams for any of the uſeful Purpoſes
of Life, or in the enſuing Parliament procure a Tax to be laid upon them,
which may anſwer both the Duty and Price of Coals, and which we humbly
conceive cannot be leſs than Thirty Shillings <hi>per</hi> Yard Square, reſerving
the ſole Right and Privilege of the <hi>Catoptrical Cookery</hi> to the <hi>Royal Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
and to the Commanders and Crew of the Bomb-Veſſels, under the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of Mr. <hi>Whiſton,</hi> for finding out the Longitude, who by Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of the Remoteneſs of their Nations, may be reduc'd to Streights for
want of Firing.</p>
            <p>And we likewiſe beg that your Honours, as to the forementioned
Points, would hear the Reverend Mr. <hi>Flamſted,</hi> who is the Legal
Officer appointed by the Government to <hi>look after the Heavenly
Luminaries,</hi> whom we have conſtituted our Truſty and Learned
Solicitor.</p>
