            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>MY aged head now ſtoops its honours low,</l>
               <l>Bow'd with the load of fifty winters' ſnow;</l>
               <l>And for the raven's gloſſy black aſſumes</l>
               <l>The downy whiteneſs of the cygnet's plumes:</l>
               <l>Looſe ſcatter'd hairs around my temples ſtray,</l>
               <l>And ſpread the mournful ſhade of ſickly grey:</l>

I bend beneath the weight of broken years,</l>
               <l>Averſe to change, and chill'd with cauſeleſs fears.</l>
               <l>The ſeaſon now invites me to retire</l>
               <l>To the dear lares of my houſehold fire;</l>
               <l>To homely ſcenes of calm domeſtic peace,</l>
               <l>A poet's leiſure, and an old man's eaſe;</l>
               <l>To wear the remnant of uncertain life</l>
               <l>In the fond boſom of a faithful wife;</l>
               <l>In ſafe repoſe my laſt few hours to ſpend,</l>
               <l>Nor fearful nor impatient of their end.</l>
               <l>Thus a ſafe port the wave-worn veſſels gain,</l>
               <l>Nor tempt again the dangers of the main;</l>
               <l>Thus the proud ſteed, when youthful glory fades,</l>
               <l>And creeping age his ſtiffening limbs invades,</l>
               <l>Lies ſtretch'd at eaſe on the luxuriant plain,</l>
               <l>And dreams his morning triumphs o'er again:</l>
               <l>The hardly veteran from the camp retires,</l>
               <l>His joints unſtrung, and feeds his houſehold fires;</l>

Satiate with fame enjoys well-earn'd repoſe,</l>

               <l>Stern winter in eternal triumph reigns,</l>
               <l>Shuts up the bounteous year and ſtarves the plains.</l>
               <l>My failing eyes the weary waſte explore,</l>
               <l>The ſavage mountains and the dreary ſhore,</l>
               <l>And vainly look for ſcenes of old delight;</l>

No lov'd familiar objects meet my ſight;</l>

               <l>Thus ſhall I reſt, unmov'd by all alarms,</l>

               <l>'TIS paſt! The ſultry tyrant of the ſouth</l>
               <l>Has ſpent his ſhort-liv'd rage; more grateful hours</l>
               <l>Move ſilent on; the ſkies no more repel</l>
               <l>The dazzled ſight, but with mild maiden beams</l>
               <l>Of temper'd light, invite the cheriſh'd eye</l>
               <l>To wander o'er their ſphere; where hung aloft</l>
               <l>DIAN's bright creſcent, like a ſilver bow</l>
               <l>New ſtrung in heaven, lifts high its beamy horns</l>

Impatient ſor the night, and ſeems to puſh</l>
               <l>Her brother down the ſky. Fair VENUS ſhines</l>
               <l>Even in the eye of day; with ſweeteſt beam</l>
               <l>Propitious ſhines, and ſhakes a trembling flood</l>
               <l>Of ſoften'd radiance from her dewy locks.</l>
               <l>The ſhadows ſpread apace; while meeken'd Eve</l>
               <l>Her cheek yet warm with bluſhes, ſlow retires</l>
               <l>Thro' the Heſperian gardens of the weſt,</l>
               <l>And ſhuts the gates of day. 'Tis now the hour</l>
               <l>When Contemplation, from her ſunleſs haunts,</l>
               <l>The cool damp grotto, or the lonely depth</l>
               <l>Of unpierc'd woods, where wrapt in ſolid ſhade</l>
               <l>She muſed away the gaudy hours of noon,</l>
               <l>And fed on thoughts unripen'd by the ſun,</l>
               <l>Moves forward; and with radiant finger points</l>
               <l>To yon blue concave ſwell'd by breath divine,</l>
               <l>Where, one by one, the living eyes of heaven</l>
               <l>Awake, quick kindling o'er the face of ether</l>

One boundleſs blaze; ten thouſand trembling fires,</l>
               <l>And dancing luſtres, where th' unſteady eye</l>
               <l>Reſtleſs, and dazzled wanders unconfin'd</l>
               <l>O'er all this field of glories: ſpacious field!</l>
               <l>And worthy of the maſter: he, whoſe hand</l>
               <l>With hieroglyphics older than the Nile,</l>
               <l>Inſcrib'd the myſtic tablet; hung on high</l>
               <l>To public gaze, and ſaid, adore, O man!</l>
               <l>The finger of thy GOD. From what pure wells</l>
               <l>Of milky light, what ſoft o'erflowing urn,</l>
               <l>Are all theſe lamps ſo fill'd? theſe friendly lamps,</l>
               <l>For ever ſtreaming o'er the azure deep</l>
               <l>To point our path, and light us to our home.</l>
               <l>How ſoft they ſlide along their lucid ſpheres!</l>
               <l>And ſilent as the foot of time, fulfil</l>
               <l>Their deſtin'd courſes: Nature's ſelf is huſh'd,</l>
               <l>And, but a ſcatter'd leaf, which ruſtles thro'</l>
               <l>The thick-wove foliage, not a ſound is heard</l>

To break the midnight air; tho' the rais'd ear,</l>
               <l>Intenſely liſtening, drinks in every breath.</l>
               <l>How deep the ſilence, yet how loud the praiſe!</l>

               <l>A tongue in every ſtar that talks with man,</l>
               <l>And wooes him to be wiſe; nor wooes in vain:</l>
               <l>This dead of midnight is the noon of thought,</l>

               <l>At this ſtill hour the ſelf-collected ſoul</l>
               <l>Turns inward, and beholds a ſtranger there</l>
               <l>Of high deſcent, and more than mortal rank;</l>
               <l>An embryo GOD; a ſpark of fire divine,</l>
               <l>Which muſt burn on for ages, when the ſun,</l>
               <l>(Fair tranſitory creature of a day!)</l>
               <l>Has clos'd his golden eye, and wrapt in ſhades</l>
               <l>Forgets his wonted journey thro' the eaſt.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Ye citadels of light, and ſeats of GODS!</l>

Revolving periods paſt, may oft look back</l>
               <l>With recollected tenderneſs, on all</l>
               <l>The various buſy ſcenes ſhe left below,</l>
               <l>Its deep laid projects and its ſtrange events,</l>
               <l>As on ſome fond and doting tale that ſooth'd</l>
               <l>Her infant hours; O be it lawful now</l>
               <l>To tread the hallow'd circle of your courts,</l>
               <l>And with mute wonder and delighted awe</l>
               <l>Approach your burning confines. Seiz'd in thought</l>
               <l>On fancy's wild and roving wing I ſail,</l>
               <l>From the green borders of the peopled earth,</l>
               <l>And the pale moon, her duteous fair attendant;</l>
               <l>From ſolitary Mars; from the vaſt orb</l>
               <l>Of Jupiter, whoſe huge gigantic bulk</l>
               <l>Dances in ether like the lighteſt leaf;</l>
               <l>To the dim verge, the ſuburbs of the ſyſtem,</l>
               <l>Where chearleſs Saturn 'midſt her wat'ry moons</l>
               <l>Girt with a lucid zone, majeſtic ſits</l>

In gloomy grandeur; like an exil'd queen</l>
               <l>Amongſt her weeping handmaids: fearleſs thence</l>
               <l>I launch into the trackleſs deeps of ſpace,</l>
               <l>Where, burning round, ten thouſand ſuns appear,</l>
               <l>Of elder beam; which aſk no leave to ſhine</l>
               <l>Of our terreſtrial ſtar, nor borrow light</l>
               <l>From the proud regent of our ſcanty day;</l>
               <l>Sons of the morning, firſt born of creation,</l>
               <l>And only leſs than him who marks their track,</l>
               <l>And guides their fiery wheels. Here muſt I ſtop,</l>
               <l>Or is there aught beyond? What hand unſeen</l>
               <l>Impels me onward thro' the glowing orbs</l>
               <l>Of habitable nature; far remote,</l>
               <l>To the dread confines of eternal night,</l>
               <l>To ſolitudes of vaſt unpeopled ſpace,</l>
               <l>The deſarts of creation, wide and wild;</l>
               <l>Where embryo ſyſtems and unkindled ſuns</l>
               <l>Sleep in the womb of chaos; fancy droops,</l>

               <l>Have the broad eye-lids of the morn beheld thee?</l>

               <l>The ſcatter'd tribes; thou haſt a gentler voice,</l>

Dreſt up with ſun, and ſhade, and lawns, and ſtreams,</l>
               <l>A manſion fair and ſpacious for its gueſt,</l>
