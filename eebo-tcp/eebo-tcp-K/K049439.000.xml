            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <hi>Dyers</hi> News Examined as to His <hi>Sweddiſh</hi> Memorial against the <hi>Review.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>HAD not the Town been allarm'd with my Name in Print, and all my Friends ſurpris'd with a proſpect of ſomething Fatal at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending it; I had not for a long time appeared in Print again in this part of <hi>Britain,</hi>—But I can not be ſo far wanting to the deſires of thoſe whom this has amuſed, as to forbear giving the World ſome Account of it.</p>
            <p>'Tis ſent down it ſeems in <hi>Dyers</hi> News from <hi>London,</hi> that the <hi>Sweddiſh</hi> Ambaſſador <hi>Monſieur Liencroon</hi> has delivered in a Memorial to this Court, complaining of the <hi>Review,</hi> as Reflecting on the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands Satisfaction.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Gentlemen, I aſſure you I know nothing of this my ſelf, neither from my Friends in <hi>England,</hi> nor from the Government, neither do I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve one Word of it. I have immediately on Notice of this Written to <hi>England,</hi> and deſir'd ſome of my Friends to wait on the Secretaries of State to acquaint them where I am, and that if it be required, I will on the firſt Notice take Poſt for <hi>London,</hi> and put my ſelf into their Hands, to Anſwer any thing the Law ſhall require.</p>
            <p>In the next place, I have Reviſed what I have Writ of the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> and I profeſs I can ſee nothing in it in the leaſt, that is or ought to be an Affront to His <hi>Swediſh</hi> Majeſty.</p>
            <p>And laſtly, I thank GOD, I Live in a Land where the Liberty of the Subject is ſuch, that ſhould all this be true, I can receive no Hurt but by Law.</p>
            <p>The King of <hi>Sweden</hi> indeed has carried it with ſo high a Hand in ſome parts of the World, that their Princes deliver up their Subjects bound Hand and Foot for him to uſe his Pleaſure with them.—But GOD be Praiſed, the Queen of <hi>England</hi> is none of thoſe: The Liberty of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Men is in a better Caſe, and no Man can be Puniſhed in <hi>England</hi> at the will of the Prince, much leſs at the will of a Forreign Prince.</p>
            <p>In <hi>England</hi> even the Soveraign can not puniſh but by Law, the Subject muſt have a fair Tryal, and a Jury of his Equals muſt Determine the Fact: If the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> ſhould demand the delivering up the meaneſt Subject the Queen has, even a meaner, <hi>if ſuch can be,</hi> than the Author of the <hi>Review,</hi> Her Majeſty would immediately Reply, That it is not in Her Power to deliver any of Her Subjects up, or to puniſh them any farther
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0499302100:2"/>
than as the Law directs: And that the meaneſt and moſt deſpicable Subject in <hi>England</hi> may even ſay to his Soveraign, <hi>That he will not be delivered up.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor do I believe the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> can think he has an Emperor of <hi>Germany</hi> to deal with in the Queen of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> and that he can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand a Count <hi>Zobor</hi> of Her Majeſty.</p>
            <p>I am content to be anſwerable to the Law, if I have offended him or any Body elſe; and it is no Arrogancy to ſay I am a Subject of the Laws of <hi>England,</hi> and of no other Mortal Power in the World.</p>
            <p>This is to be a Subject to GOD and the Queen, for an Obedience to the Law is all the Subjection, <hi>ſpeaking of Humane Affairs,</hi> that either GOD or the Queen requires.</p>
            <p>But what is it you ſaid of the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> ſays the Enquirers, you muſt have ſaid ſome ill thing of him, or elſe he would not have Complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of your Paper by his Ambaſſador?</p>
            <p>Truly, Gentlemen, I'll tell you as near as I can what I ſaid of him—and if I tell it again, you will ſay, 'Tis a ſign I have not much fear upon me of his Reſentment.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I ſaid, That the <hi>Swede</hi> lying in <hi>Saxony</hi> all this Summer with 50000 Men about him, and doing nothing, while he ſuffered his new King of <hi>Poland</hi> to be ruin'd, and the Countrey to be ravaged by the <hi>Muſcovite,</hi> ſignified that he had ſome ſecret deſign in his Head, ſome project on Foot, which no Body knew of but himſelf.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I ſaid, If he had no Deſign, no Meaning, no Proſpect, and yet lay ſtill there, while his Subjects and his Allies were ruined by his Enemies, he was the moſt Impolitick, Nothing-doing Prince in the World.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I ſaid, That for a Prince to neglect the Defence of his own Subjects, and leave them Expoſed to the Invaſion of Cruel and Barbarous Neighbours, when he is at the ſame time puſhing on the Conqueſts and Triumphs of Victory againſt their Neighbours, is all one with a Father who neglects to provide for his Family, of whom the Text ſays, he is worſe than an Infidel.</p>
            <p n="4">4. I ſaid, That if the <hi>Swede</hi> ſhould fall on the Emperor, and thereby oblige him to quitt the Confederacy, <hi>and make a ſeparate Peace with France,</hi> we ſhould have but little Cauſe to thank him for his Care of the Proteſtant Religion.</p>
            <p n="5">5. I ſaid, That if the <hi>Swede</hi> ſhould fall upon the Emperor, and oblige him to draw all his Troops from <hi>Hungaria, Naples, Provence</hi> and the <hi>Rhine,</hi> he would be beaten, and not be able to ſtand before him.</p>
            <p>Theſe and ſuch as theſe is the utmoſt of the Matter, and if the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Ambaſſador has made a Complaint of this, I ſhall always be ready to Anſwer it.</p>
            <p>If I had really ſaid any thing which was Unbecoming me of the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0499302100:3"/>
King of <hi>Sweden</hi> or any Body elſe, I ſhould be willing to acknowledge it, and make Satisfaction; But as what I have ſaid are both known and uſeful Truths, with a great deal of Calmneſs and Satisfaction I ſay I am ready to Anſwer him or any Man elſe, as far as the Liberty and Laws of <hi>Britain</hi> require, and ſo much for the King of <hi>Swedens</hi> Ambaſſador.</p>
            <p>'Tis a Happy thing, Gentlemen, to live under the laws of <hi>England,</hi> I hope you are advancing apace to the ſame Liberty, you may be aſſured no <hi>Nation</hi> in <hi>Europe</hi> enjoys the like Privileges, and I hope you will all partake of them, and learn to value them.</p>
            <p>No Reſentment of Forreign Princes can affect us, no Threatnings terrifie us, an <hi>Engliſh</hi> man is born a free man, no Power can inſult him, no Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior Oppreſs him; The Law only is his Governour, no Magiſtrate, no Counſellor, no Authority, no not the Sovereign has the leaſt illegal Power over him, he can have no Sentence pronounced againſt him, no pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment inflicted, no Fine levied, no not by the Queen Her Self, but according to Law.</p>
            <p>This is the Confidence, the Peace and the Glory of this Iſland, and no Forreign Power can interpoſe in it; If the greateſt King or Emperor in the World demands of the Queen of <hi>Britain</hi> the delivering up any one of Her Subjects to them, they may lawfully refuſe to go,—if the Sovereign puts a Man in Priſon by His Royal Authority,—the Man ſerves the Judge with a Writ of <hi>Habeas Corpus,</hi> and he will let him out again, even Her Majeſty her ſelf, <hi>asking Pardon for the Expreſſion,</hi> cannot detain him.</p>
            <p>He that will abandon this Liberty is not a Fool only but a Knave, a Knave to himſelf, and to his Family, a Knave to his Poſterity, and a Knave to the Conſtitution of the Nation, for he gives up the Right of a Subject, and leaves an Example of wilful Bondage to his Countreymen.</p>
            <p>If there be any ſuch, I have only to ſay, I am ſure, I am not the Man: <hi>Britains</hi> Gentlemen are none of the Tribe of <hi>Iſſachar,</hi> whoſe Coat of Arms is an Aſs couchant; what Burden the Law puts upon us, we freely ſubmit to, and never complain either of the Law or of the Sovereign.</p>
            <p>But we always Kick at Oppreſſion, and Reſiſt Tyrrany, and it has hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, GOD be praiſed, been found in vain to Enſlave us.</p>
            <p>Her Majeſty, the beſt Queen that ever Governed us, has made it Her Glory to Reign over a Free People, the Queen deſpiſes Tyrrany as infinitely below Her; It's Her Pleaſure to ſee the Laws Triumph, 'tis Her Glory to ſee Juſtice Uninterrupted, and 'tis Her Majeſties peculiar Bleſſing that there are none of Her People complaining of Oppreſſion.</p>
            <p>Attempts enough have been made to ſurpriſe the Government into Tyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rany, but both the Attempts and their Authors have found their <hi>Quietus</hi> in Her Majeſties Juſtice, and in Her Native Averſion to Cruelty and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary Power.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:0499302100:4"/>
'Tis from hence, with ſatisfaction, any Subject may ſay, and I ſay it with a ſecret Joy, that I can not expreſs, the Innocent Man may fly with Safety to the Law, if he has not Offended, he is ſure he ſhall not be Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt, if he has, he is ſure to find Juſtice always mingled with the Princes Compaſſion.</p>
            <p>Let none of my Friends be afraid for me, if I have broke the Law, they ought to abandon me to the Law, and I ask no Favour; If I have not, no King, no Power, no Threatning, no not all the Powers of <hi>Europe</hi> can make Her Majeſty break in upon Her Peoples Liberties, or Deviat from Juſtice, in the Satisfaction of which all Her Subjects are eaſie and ſafe, and I among the reſt.</p>
            <p>As to <hi>Dyer's</hi> Letter, he was always Careful that it ſhould not be ſeen in <hi>London,</hi> whether for Shame or Fear is not Material, and from thence he often takes the Liberty to Forge Stories that have not the leaſt ground of Truth in them, and this is not the firſt time he has done ſo by me in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, which Forgeries he ſpreads in the Countrey, and the Letter not being to be had in the City, he is not ſo eaſily contradicted.</p>
            <p>I muſt ſay, however, <hi>Dyer,</hi> the News Writer, ought to have been the laſt Man in the World to have ſaid this in his Paper, ſince Monſieur <hi>Liencroon</hi> never took notice what he wrote in his publick Paper, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Duke of <hi>Marlborrow</hi> obtained his deſire of the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> by Bribing Count <hi>Piper.</hi>
