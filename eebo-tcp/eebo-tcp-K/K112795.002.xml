            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>YOUR true-born Engliſhmen, your bold Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons, who are lions in the field, and ſea lions on the ocean, are, with all their courage, the moſt remarkable of any nation in the world, for being ſeized with a Panick. A battle loſt, or an iſland taken, brings down their high ſpirits in an inſtant, and the nation is undone. An eclipſe, or a comet with the help of ſome profound philoſopher in the magazines, or two or three terrifying paragraphs in the News-papers, ſhall fill the imagination of all the old women, of both ſexes, with horrible ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of the immediate deſtruction of the world; and groaning proſelytes pour in, without number, to Tottenham-Court and Moorfields. It is ſtill freſh in our memories, that two ſlight ſhocks of an earthquake, the moſt violent of which never ſhook the pewter off the kitchen-ſhelves in Groſvenor-Square, turned the minds of the bold Britons topſy-turvy, and all London itſelf ſeemed going out of town. In ſhort, the ſpirits riſe and fall, in the barometer of Engliſh imaginations, with moſt incredible revolutions.
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0587000702:14"/>
Their hopes, unleſs perpetually buoyed up by proſperous circumſtances, are ſure to ſink. Publick Opinions are as delicate as Publick Credit; and it ſeems as impoſſible for Engliſhmen to preſerve a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly evenneſs of temper, as to keep the ſtocks at <hi>par.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe reflections occurred on obſerving the terror, that has diffuſed itſelf through moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, on account of the preſent Epidemical Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper; for ſo, Mr. Baldwin, you, and the reſt of your brother newſmongers, have taught us to call it. They, into whoſe hands our journals may fall in foreign countries, muſt ſuppoſe that a plague is raging amongſt us. The bills of mortality, ſay they, are conſiderably ſwelled in their number; ten are buried in one grave: four or five in a family are carried off in one day; with other particulars, which every body believes though nobody knows to be true. It is ſuppoſed that there muſt be ſome noxious qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in the air, and pieces of beef are ſent up from Highgate Hill, at the tail of ſchool-boys kites; though it is the received doctrine of writers on all plagues, that any peſtilential quality in the air affects dogs, horſes, and other animals, before it reaches men, and would conſequently ſhew itſelf on the live ox, as well as the dead piece of beef. For my part, as a true Briton, I cannot help being
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0587000702:15"/>
moſt ſenſibly offended, that Beef, the ſtaple food of old England, Beef, the glory of our country, ſhould be proſtituted to ſuch purpoſes. In a time of war, when proviſions of all kinds grow dearer and dearer every day, when the price is artfully raiſed on meat, and fiſh is obliged to be brought to town in the machine of Arts and Sciences, I am alarmed, leſt this prodigality ſhould be the means, or at leaſt ſerve the butchers as a pretence, for raiſing the price of meat ſtill higher; and my ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions are redoubled, when my maid aſſures me, on coming from market, that broth being uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally preſcribed in the preſent reigning diſorder, ſcraigs of mutton are grown ſo much in requeſt, that the worſt end ſells for ſix-pence and ſeven-pence <hi>per</hi> pound.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time, to keep our terrors alive, and to prevent the Panick from ſubſiding in the minds of the people, all the Doctors who are authors, begin to tell us from the preſs, that colds caught at this ſeaſon are extremely dangerous; and all the bookſellers who are venders of the medicines, recommend their noſtrums by fifty different arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, inſerted in advertiſements, letters, para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphs, &amp;c.—And here, Mr. Baldwin, I cannot but obſerve by the bye what you, who are a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0587000702:16"/>
muſt often have obſerved yourſelf, and know to be true, that the connection between author and bookſeller, is as inſeparable as that between whore and bawd, a juſtice and his clerk, a counſellor and attorney, or (according to Congreve) a curate and a tobacco-ſtopper;—that this connection, I ſay, has of late years, begun to diſplay itſelf in a new light: for ſince the doctors have pretty gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally become authors, bookſellers and printers have acted as a kind of baſtard ſpecies of apothecaries. In the natural courſe of trade and ſhop-keeping, one would as ſoon think of ſending for a pot of porter to the grocer's, or a leg of mutton to the tallow-chandler's, as for a pill, drop, or an electu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary, to the printing-office; or for a powder, a balſam, or an elixir, to the bookſeller's. Yet ſo it is, medicines and pamphlets are prepared and written by one and the ſame hand, and both <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed</hi> (for that I find is the phraſe in each caſe) at one and the ſame ſhop. Two ſuch ranks of men in combination, who are each of them perpetually addreſſing the publick, have opportunities, like mountebank-practiſers, to hawk their own me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines. It is their intereſt in the firſt place, to perſuade you that you are ſick, or that you will be ſick; and in the next place, to perſuade you
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0587000702:17"/>
that nothing but their <hi>noſtrum</hi> will inſure your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, or prevent your taking the diſtemper.</p>
                  <p>Now, Mr. Baldwin, having myſelf a new diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery in medicine to recommend to the publick, a preparation that will be of the moſt infinite ſervice in the preſent reigning diſtemper, and in all other diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers that ever have affected, or ever will, or can affect human nature, I beg leave to make it known to the world through the channel of your moſt uſeful, moſt excellent, moſt entertaining, moſt inſtructive, paper. Thoſe, you know, are the phraſes which the correſpondents of all publick journals, from your own down to the Farthing Poſt, when there was one, have always made uſe of. I cannot boaſt a patent for my medicine. But as I ſhall plainly appear to have only the publick good at heart, by declaring its virtues in your Chronicle, I will anſwer for it that the Stamp-Office ſhall demand no duty, as for an advertiſement, though you inſert it ever ſo often.</p>

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0587000702:19"/>
for Radcliffe. The Doctor ſoon perceiving the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of his caſe, told him, that he was in poſſeſſion of a ſecret, which was infallible for his diſtemper; but that unluckily it was at that time in the hands of Doctor Pitcairne at Edinburgh, to whom he would write to apply it in favour of the patient, if he himſelf thought it worth while to go ſo far in queſt of it. The patient readily undertook the journey, and travelled to Edinburgh: but when he arrived there, he had the mortification to find that juſt before Doctor Radcliffe's letter reached Edinburgh, Doctor Pitcairne had ſent them edicine to Doctor Muſgrave of Exeter. The patient how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever had reſolution enough on Doctor Pitcairne's advice, to go acroſs the country to Exeter, in fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther purſuit of it: but as ill luck would have it, Doctor Muſgrave told him, that he had, but the day before, tranſmitted it back again to Doctor Radcliffe in London, where the patient naturally returned, to take the benefit of it at home. He could not help laughing with the Doctor at the tour he had taken, and at his ſtrange diſappointments. I went after the medicine, ſaid the patient, to no purpoſe; and yet I cannot tell how it happens, but I am much better than I was when I ſat out. I know it, cries the Doctor, I know it. You have

                  <p>AND ſo, Mr. Baldwin, nothing but Politicks will go down with you at preſent! Your old correſpondents, the Laughers and the Jokers, and the Wits and the Criticks, and the Poets, are all va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed; and in come the Patriots, and the Stateſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, the Advocates of Liberty, and the Quellers of Sedition. Not a man but writes as if his country was at ſtake; not a pen that is not drawn, as it were, <hi>pro aris &amp; focis</hi>; not a drop of ink, that is not ſhed in the cauſe of Liberty, Property, and Religion. Party has divided the whole town, and <hi>Pro</hi> and <hi>Con</hi> takes up every page of your Chronicle.—You call
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0587000702:21"/>
yourſelf impartial, that is, you give both parties a fair opportunity to abuſe each other. <hi>Audi alteram partem,</hi> is your maxim; that is (in your free tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation) <hi>Hear both ſides</hi>! and indeed they are well worth hearing, and what infinite delight muſt a Scotchman receive, after reading a certain portion of abuſe on his country and countrymen, how charmingly muſt his indignation be ſoothed and appeaſed, to find his opponents equally beſpattered in the next column! But as this kind of impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality abuſes all parties, the conſequence is that all parties abuſe you, and each in their turn conſider you as the tool of their adverſaries. Laſt week, in a coffee-houſe near St. James's, I ſaw a Scotch Colonel, who longs for the next regiment that falls, throw your paper into the fire, provoked by the ſeverity of a letter againſt Lord Bute; and the very next morning I ſaw the ſame paper almoſt as hardly dealt with in the Alley, on account of an extract from the Auditor, which reflected on the brokers and Mr. Pitt. Let me tell you, Mr. Baldwin, it is very lucky that you are not obliged to follow your paper, wherever it goes; and that your figure is not as univerſally known as the face of your paper. I knew a country printer that ventured to inſert letters on both ſides of the queſtion in his journal,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0587000702:22"/>
during the county election: and I can aſſure you, Mr. Baldwin, that though he was one of the luſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieſt men in that country, and above ſix feet high, he could ſcarce put his head out of doors in the courſe of the whole controverſy. You, I am told, are a tight built little black man, but by no means ſuch an able-bodied printer as my friend in the country. If you cannot weild thé quarter-ſtaff of party with eaſe, and have not power fairly to cudgel your enemies into good humour, believe me, Sir, 'tis dangerous to hobble along on the unequal and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteady crutches of two oppoſite factions. Your fugitive ſcribblers are unknown, and leave you to ſtand buff to the Publick for their labours. On the contrary, the authors of the ſeveral political papers now extant, keep the names of their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters as ſecret as thoſe of their ſurgeons: and as to themſelves, they are a match for any thing. The club of the Monitor, is, I am told, more formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble than his pen; the Briton, they ſay, is a raw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boned Scotſman; the Auditor a tall Iriſhman; and the North Briton, or the world hugely belies him, has a broader pair of ſhoulders than any author militant in this great metropolis.</p>
                  <p>After all, Mr. Baldwin, I believe you are a mighty good ſort of man, and mean no harm. If

the people of this town will write nothing but Politicks, and read nothing but Politicks, you are reduced of neceſſity to print nothing but Politicks: becauſe your ſtationer muſt be paid, your hawkers muſt be fee'd, nay you muſt give your very devil his due, and have an hot joint every day and a pud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding on Sunday. Yet cannot I forbear admiring the publick ſpirit of our authors; who while, their all is at ſtake, while the very nature of literary property is in queſtion, neglecting to refute the ſtrange and unnatural doctrine, that <q rend="inline">"an author has no right to his own work,"</q> are all up in arms on another occaſion, ſettling the Miniſtry and agitating the Preliminaries of Peace. For my own part, though I have been equally ſollicited by both parties, and though you are ready to inſert my arguments on either ſide of the queſtion, yet I am reſolved, like Scrub, to ſay nothing, <hi>Pro</hi> nor <hi>Con,</hi> till we have a Peace.—In the mean time as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Politicks will go down, to comply in ſome meaſure with the humour of the town, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe I oblige you and your readers, with a critical review of our political writers. I do not mean to give a weekly detail of their arguments, to ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinize their characters, or criticiſe particular parts of their productions. Heaven forbid!—all I
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0587000702:24"/>
intend is to draw their general characters; and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, if I happen to be in the right vein for ſuch a whim, to give a ſhort ſketch of the ſtyle and manner of each of them. And ſo, Maſter Bald<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win till you hear from me again I am,</p>

                                 <p>AN extraordinary circumſtance is a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient apology for a paper extraordinary. The date of this eſſay will immediately denote the ſubject of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0587000702:25"/>
it, and ſhew that I mean to congratulate the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick in general, and my countrymen in particular, on the occaſion of his Majeſty's Birth-day. The North-Briton is not one of thoſe low ſcribblers, who like that ſlave the Briton, or that proſtitute the Auditor, mean to write themſelves into a place or a penſion; nor will he be reſtrained from deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his ſentiments by the fear of fire, pillory, or impriſonment. The Law ſhall be his protection; and while Lord Mansfield ſhall preſide as Lord Chief Juſtice in the Court of King's Bench, the North Briton ſhall dread no oppreſſion.</p>
                                 <p>On this occaſion, as well as on every other, I ſhall ſtudy to ſpeak out. I have not been uſed to be a reſpecter of perſons. I do not, after the manner of the old patriots in the Craftſman, make uſe of nick-names. The ingenious devices of Lord Gawkee, Colonel Catiline, and Colonel Squintum, Lord Gothamſtow, Captain Iago Anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeed, and Parſon Bruin, and Parſon Brawn, I leave to the Briton and Auditor. I uſe no aſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſks; the names of Dukes, and Lords, and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, are written at full length, for I am above all evaſion. Wherefore, without further preface or preamble, I gladly ſeize the opportunity of this great anniverſary, to congratulate thoſe of our
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0587000702:26"/>
inclining, that we have now a Prince upon the throne, who is an abſolute Jacobite.</p>
                                 <p>However paradoxical ſuch an aſſertion may appear, I have no doubt of being able to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate it as clearly as any propoſition in Euclid. <hi>Imprimis,</hi> the groundwork and firſt principle of Jacobitiſm, is to cheriſh the warmeſt ſentiments for the family of Stuart. Lord Bute (I dare venture to aſſert it) is of the Stuart family. He is himſelf a Stuart. He cannot deny it. It is a circumſtance which miniſterial advocates may palliate, but which, like that of his being a true Scot, they cannot diſſemble. Yet, Scot and Stuart as he is, we have ſeen him Secretary of State, and we now ſee him at the head of the Treaſury: I ſay, we ſee a Scotſman (the reader may recollect I have written a whole paper on this ſubject) at the head of the Treaſury. There is a paſſage in Archbiſhop Spotſwood, p. 180 by which it appears, that during the troubles of that condemned Stuart, Charles I. there was at one time in his Majeſty's Treaſury, the immenſe ſum of ſeven ſhillings and ſix-pence.—A ſum that might almoſt rival the contents of the Bank of Edinburgh, which ſometimes diſcounts bills to nearly that amount Yet Lord Bute is at the head of a treaſury, drawing ſchemes to raiſe at one time
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0587000702:27"/>
millions of Engliſh pounds (I might ſay hundreds of millions, did I mean Scotch pounds) double the number of the above ſhillings. How then can we doubt his Majeſty's attachment to the family of Stuart? Demoſthenes ſaid of the Pythian oracle, that it Philipiſed: we do not want an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh Demoſthenes, who might ſay, that his Majeſty Stuartiſeth, that is, being interpreted, He is a Jacobite.</p>
                                 <p>To prove this ſtill further, let us conſider, that during the two former reigns of the preſent family, every Scotſman was kept at as great a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from court, as Edinburgh is from London; and all country-gentlemen (commonly called To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries) were doomed to remain for ever in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, never receiving the leaſt encouragement to come to St. James's. How is all this reverſed at preſent? It is held no crime to be born on the other ſide of the Tweed; nay, the immenſe ſum of four thouſand pounds is allowed by parliament towards building a bridge over that ſtream, to facilitate the communication between the two united king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, or rather to pave the way for Scotſmen to come over into England. And here I would hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſubmit to the commiſſioners, appointed by the legiſlature, that the bridge may contain only a
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0587000702:28"/>
foot-way! for alas! we too well know that their maxim is, <hi>Veſtigia nulla retrorſum</hi>; and when they have once walked hither, not one of them will drive their carriages back again. <hi>Had Cain been Scot, &amp;c.</hi> The paſſage is as well known as any in Fingal, or John Hume's tragedies. Add to all this, that known Tories, men, who during the ſeveral loyal adminiſtrations, were marked for Jacobites, whom Kings were taught to call ſo, are now daily ſeen at St. James's. The rage of party hath entirely ſubſided: places of power and profit are beſtowed on gentlemen of Oxfordſhire, and members of the Cocoa-tree. The Univerſity of Oxford itſelf, which was declared in the Houſe of Commons <q rend="inline">"to be paved with Diſaffection and Jacobitiſm,"</q> begins to receive encouragement; their addreſſes engage attention, and we hear of Oxford Biſhops and Prebendaries: in a word, how could all theſe things be? How could it come to paſs, unleſs his Majeſty were a Jacobite, that Tories ſhould be in place; that Lord Bute ſhould have power; that knights of the Thiſtle ſhould be created knights of the Garter; and Scotſmen be ſeen in broad-cloth and breeches?</p>
                                 <p>The Pretender is now ſaid to be at Avignon. Now in caſe we ſhould ſend an embaſſador extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary

                  <p>I Have been in much pain on your account ſince the publication of the NORTH BRITON EXTRA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ORDINARY, which I encloſed to you in my laſt. I was at firſt very glad to find that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body queſtioned its authenticity, but ſoon began to tremble for its conſequences. Some ſaid that the meſſengers had ſeiſed you, your compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitors, preſs-men, devils, &amp;c. Some foretold mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the King's-Bench provoking vengeance and letting all the terrors of the law looſe upon you. Others prognoſticated your being called up to the bar of both Houſes: while thoſe who were your moſt ſanguine admirers, heartily wiſhed, that for the convenience of carrying on your paper, you had, like the Gazetteer, an houſe adjoining to Newgate. At length, however, I begin to hope that you are quite out of danger, and that in this ſeaſon of the general maſſacre of characters, ſome licence will be allowed to you, as well as your brethren. I would adviſe you, at all events, to give the world freſh proofs of your impartiality, and to ballance the account fairly between both parties. Expel

                              <p>IT is a diſagreeable circumſtance to be ſtationed on guard, like the out-poſts of an army, juſt on the confines of the enemy's camp. Yet are there ſome conſiderable advantages reſulting from ſuch a ſituation: for in ſuch a ſituation the earlieſt intelligence may be obtained, and while <q rend="inline">"the hum of either army ſtilly ſounds,"</q> anecdotes of the moſt curious nature may be collected, as hath already more than once been experienced and manifeſted by the Auditor. Nor can I think that the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this kind of duty is, in the phraſe of Bobadil, <hi>ſervice of danger</hi>; as it is well known, my an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagoniſt, fierce and furious as he is, can take the

field, and come even within piſtol ſhot of his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary, without the leaſt ill conſequence to one party or the other.</p>
                              <p>For my own part, I am poſſeſſed of ſuch a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign contempt for him, or, if you pleaſe, them, be he or they of the ſingular, plural, or (according to the Grecians) of the dual number, that it is not without the utmoſt diſdain, that I thus deſcend, into the <hi>Arena,</hi> with ſuch paltry opponents. The late Mr. Fielding, of humourous memory, in one of his Covent-Garden Journals (though I do not know whether that paper be extant in the elegant edition of his works, lately publiſhed by Arthur Murphy, Eſq.) hath I remember, comically proved, that the moſt contemptuous animal in the creation is a <hi>Louſe</hi>; and has deſcribed one of thoſe animalcules overflowing with a true quality-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the mean creature, whoſe head he inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited.</p>
                              <p>I am, I muſt confeſs, <hi>the Louſe</hi> to the <hi>North Briton.</hi> I ſit weekly in judgement on his head; on the produce whereof he perhaps may live, but I cannot: for the deplorable ſterility of that ſpot feeds nothing but my <hi>contempt.</hi> I run over the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren region, more barren than the country he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually reviles, with all the avidity of the little
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0587000702:34"/>
human blood-ſucker. Here, perhaps, I diſcover an abortive vein of Proſaick Poetry; there branches out many a Ramification of Political Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rulence; and there, in a remote corner of the <hi>Pia Mater,</hi> is lodged a ſmall portion of Bayes's Spirit of Brains, which (like the Spirit of Laws) would require the pen of a Monteſquieu to deſcribe its qualities at large, but it is in fact no other than the Spirit of Dulneſs, which ſerves <q rend="inline">"the lively dunce"</q> inſtead of Wit and Humour, and produces that airy nothingneſs, that vivacious ſtupidity, ſo evident in all his publications.</p>
                              <p>It hath, however, been diſcovered by microſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pical obſervers, that a Louſe is a very louſy animal; in conſequence whereof, while I am thus banquet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the North Briton, ſundry leſſer lice are preying upon me. The engineers of Grub-ſtreet, to change the alluſion, like the garretteers in the ingenious new print of the ingenious Mr. Hogarth, are daily ſquirting upon me: to all theſe, as well as to the Arch-Enemy, I oppoſe nothing but <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt.</hi> I indulge myſelf in a warrantable pride, and the virtuous conſciouſneſs of my own ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority. I exert all my adroitneſs and dexterity to turn their own arms againſt them, and they have at length inſtructed me, as Charles the Twelfth did
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0587000702:35"/>
the Ruſſians, to be their conqueror. Complaining eternally of the lamentable dulneſs and ſcurrility of factious ſcribblers, I ſtop the tide of political ſlander, and open afterwards at pleaſure the ſources for my own uſe and benefit. I ſilence with a tone of authority, the clamours of the malcontent againſt a noble Lord and his coadjutors in employment; and then I immediately raiſe my voice to its higheſt pitch, and cry out luſtily againſt the Grand Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioner and Lord Gawkee. I reprobate the bold practice of licentiouſly printing names at full length, without ſo much as modeſtly embowelling, or rather <hi>emvowelling</hi> them, or pleaſantly holding their own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in greater deriſion, by a contemptuous altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them; after which doctrine, the next pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragraph in my Ayleſbury Journal, recites the names of Wilkes and Churchill, and ſeveral others with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt diſguiſe, while poor Hodges and Beardmore, and Charles Say, run glibly into almoſt every ſentence.</p>
                              <p>Contempt then, ſovereign contempt, is plainly the beſt weapon, offenſive or defenſive, in the hands of a writer of controverſy. And what ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects can be more worthy to excite that paſſion, than thoſe on which I have exerciſed my own?
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0587000702:36"/>
What is Lord Gawkee? that noun-adjective Lord, joining his falſe conſequence, like an idle epithet, to that proud ſubſtantive, the Grand Penſioner? His Temple of Worthies, the collection of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies of Stowe-Temple, is not, I am told, yet complete. Let him fill the vacant niches with his friends! Let him put up his own buſt! and by way of ſupporters, let him place Colonel Catiline on one hand, and his Reverend Co-adjutor on the other! What is the Grand Penſioner? that ſold ſlave for ever bellowing about liberty; that hireling who receives his regular wages, without doing the ſervice for which he is paid. I may perhaps ſome time or other, by the aſſiſtance of Cocker's Arithmetick, ſhew my knowledge in fractions, and ſtrike the balance between him and the nation. Such a political ledger may perhaps prove that he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted to the Publick for more than three thouſand <hi>per ann.</hi> and their gold boxes. What are the city of London? <hi>A mob,</hi> a fooliſh crew with furs and chains huzzaing their idol, their king in ſtilts, as Mr. Hogarth has pictured him, in vain endeavouring to ſet the world on fire, and holding the bellows to blow the dead coal of ſedition. They ſay, I am an advocate for Ariſtocracy. I have turned over

Sidney and Puffendorf, and fifty other writers in the courſe of my little reading, and find no form of government ſo dangerous as a Mobocracy. The clenched fiſts are indeed the patriot arms of ſuch a ſtate: their only law is club law; and their chief logick is the <hi>Argumentum Baculinum,</hi> which is with them the knock down argument. Such is the cuſtom of the city of London. What are all the political writers of the preſent times, except the Briton and <hi>myſelf</hi>? The ſcum of Grub-ſtreet, the dregs of the church, and the refuſe of the legiſlature. I have convicted the apoſtate Monitor, as well as his patron, the Grand Penſioner, of political tergi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation. I have put to rebuke the petulant flip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pancy of the North Briton, and have proved him to be a haberdaſher of ſmall literature, the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſher of a <hi>Chronique Scandaleuſe,</hi> the conductor of a weekly libel. The reverend half of him I have ſhewn to be a mere Oldmixon in politicks, diving among the Naiads of Fleet-ditch, in the mud of Scurrility. The <hi>other</hi> half of him, half military and half legiſlative, I have ſhown to be a down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right Catiline, hatching a conſpiracy or aſſaſſina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion plot againſt the characters of the firſt perſons in the kingdom, and like Lord Shafteſbury in Hudibras,<q>

                  <p>THE following Columns contain nothing more than two ſeparate liſts of the celebrated perſonages, who have at any time been honoured with notice, by the AUDITOR or NORTH BRITON. Theſe liſts I know muſt neceſſarily be imperfect, becauſe they are taken down merely upon memory; and becauſe ſuch keen Satiriſts cannot ſo groſsly have miſpent their time, as to have laſhed ſo few people; yet I have been the leſs curious to render theſe liſts complete, becauſe I know that the writers in queſtion are ſuch ſtirring ſpirits, that they will each be continually ſwelling their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral catalogues, for which reaſon I have contented myſelf with leaving certain vacant ſpaces, for the inſertion of ſuch names already diſtinguiſhed as I muſt without doubt have omitted, or to be filled up as time ſhall ſerve, and the AUDITOR or NORTH BRITON, ſhall hereafter pleaſe to direct.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="34" facs="tcp:0587000702:40"/>Let us, however, do juſtice to the candour, as well as acrimony of our Political Writers. They deal in Panegyrick, as well as Satire. If they throw dirt with the ſcavenger's ſhovel, they alſo lay on Praiſe with a trowel. Every modern con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſial writer in Politicks ſits down with Enco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mium on the right, and Obloquy on the left, like Jupiter between the tubs of Good and Evil; or to lower my ſimile, like brother Pamphlet in the Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holſterer with white-waſh in one hand and black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ball in the other. All their characters, or rather caricatures, may be conſidered as the Rough Draughts of the maſters in the modern ſchool of crayons, who ſometimes draw in Chalk, but moſt commonly in Charcoal. It was my firſt intention to have given both the Chalk and Charcoal Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traits of each of the great maſters in queſtion; but I ſoon reflected that I might ſave that trouble, by deſiring your readers to take it for a general rule, that ſuch as are blackened in the NORTH BRITON are, by Act of Grace, white-waſhed in the AUDITOR, and ſo <hi>vice verſâ.</hi> Every great character, like a poſt or a wainſcot, is deſtined to be painted, in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent colours, at leaſt twice over: and in this various light, we may at pleaſure, conſider the Two Following Columns either as the two principal pillars of the Temple of Slander, or the two tables
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0587000702:41"/>
in the Temple of Fame. As we are now, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, at the very opening of Lent, I would have the noble lords and gentlemen, whoſe names ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in theſe liſts, to regard the peruſal of them, as an act of humiliation and mortification; and to remember that they have been told their own by the great writers, under whoſe aweful names they are here arranged.</p>
                  <p>It muſt, however, be premiſed, as our fixt opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that the AUDITOR is by far the moſt reſpectable character, and the moſt polite and learned writer of the two. The NORTH BRITON ſounded the Nether Trump of Fame at the very firſt onſet, and furiouſly charged the Scots and the Miniſtry at once. The AUDITOR ſet out with profeſſions of moderation and impartiality: he did not ſeek for Defamation, but it lay in his way, and he found it: mark his candid declarations in his firſt number! <q rend="inline">"The malevolent are not to expect to be gratified with Slander, the illiberal with Scurrility, or the inconſiderate with Buffoonery. Ingredients like theſe can have no admiſſion into a paper, which is undertaken upon principles laudable in themſelves; which is intended to reconcile the minds of men to their own good, and to one another; to refute or laugh out of counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0587000702:42"/>
all party-diſtinctions; to extinguiſh na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional prejudices, and to recommend that ſpirit of concord, which alone can make us a ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and preſerve us an happy people. In ſhort it is intended in the conduct of this plan, to try whether it is poſſible to talk Politicks with tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; to delineate characters with Decency; to treat of factions with Good Humour; and to love our Country without hating Individuals."</q> Here are mild words; and yet in the ſecond number, he ſerves up no leſs than ſix or ſeven individuals, and ſome of them no inconſiderable perſonages neither: and yet even this trifling inconſiſtency may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for, if we recollect that the AUDITOR himſelf begins his ninth number with this reflexion: <q rend="inline">"It is a curſe entailed upon the retainers to deſpair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faction, that they are not only Miſerable Men, and Wretched Writers, but they muſt be Lyars into the bargain; they muſt forge Crimes to affright the people, they muſt ſcatter abroad the words of prevarication, &amp;c. &amp;c."</q>

                  <p>The above liſts not only ſhew who have been the Butts of Satire to each writer, but may alſo with due attention to the turnings and windings in the Court Calendar, ſerve as unerring guide-poſts to point out ſuch as ſeem to be in the high road to abuſe from either paper. Being made acquainted with the Colour of the heroes of both parties, we
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0587000702:45"/>
know that if a great officer of the court ſhould be turned out, or to uſe the more courtly phraſe <hi>reſign,</hi> the AUDITOR will immediately tear out the white leaf wherein he ſo lately ſang his praiſes, and, like another Peachum, ſet his name down in his <hi>black book,</hi> and call on him to exerciſe the full powers of the Chriſtian virtue of <hi>reſignation.</hi> We know too, that if a noble Member of one Houſe ſhould call for an able Commoner to lead the buſineſs of the other, the NORTH BRITON will immediately open his deep mouth on that leader, and maul a Manager with as great alacrity as Mr. Thady Fitzpatrick. But as rules and precepts are never clearly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced, unleſs illuſtrated by example, I will ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a ſmall Peep into Futurity to your readers; and as I have in ſome places above, rather made extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary diſtinctions in favour of the AUDITOR, I ſhall here pay my particular compliments to the NORTH BRITON. We have already ſeen whom that writer has abuſed (craving his pardon for the groſſneſs of the expreſſion;) and the AUDITOR's liſt of Scandal (craving his pardon alſo) is a pretty exact catalogue of thoſe, whom the NORTH BRITON has praiſed. I ſhall now therefore, Mr. Baldwin, take upon me to predict, with as much ſagacity as Partridge or even Bickerſtaff,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0587000702:46"/>
whom he <hi>will</hi> praiſe, whom he <hi>will</hi> abuſe, and whom he may poſſibly praiſe or abuſe: and for the fulfilling theſe my predictions I refer to time, or even appeal to the Second Sight of the NORTH BRITON himſelf. Some that are turned out, I know he will take every opportunity to praiſe, and that claſs I ſhall diſtinguiſh by Chalk; ſome that are put in, I know he cannot reſiſt the temptation of diſpraiſing, and that claſs I ſhall diſtinguiſh by Charcoal. But there are another claſs of a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bious indeterminate twilight character, whoſe conduct will not ſuffer us to ſpeak preciſely of the colour of their intentions; a kind of heteroge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous or amphibious animals, Hermaphrodites or Otters in Politicks, neither in nor out, <hi>Pro</hi> nor <hi>Con,</hi> Court nor Country, Whig nor Tory, Scotch nor Engliſh; who are, like Sir Anthony Branville, in a State of Fluctuation, and hang, like Mahomet's coffin, in ſuſpence; who ſeem ready to veer and turn, like approved weather-cocks, with every guſt of politicks; who ſtand between <hi>Ay</hi> and <hi>No,</hi> like the aſs of the ſchoolmen between two bundles of hay; or like Prince Volſcius in love, hip-hop, hip-hop, one boot on, and the other boot off. Theſe Stateſmen of the neuter gender, we can place in neither liſt; and yet they ſeem to bid fair
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0587000702:47"/>
for a place in both. Where then can we ſtation theſe lovers of the Golden Mean, but in the Middle? In the Middle therefore, upon ſtilts between both, one foot on one liſt, the other foot on the other liſt, I have placed one Right Hon. Gentleman, as the grand archetype of political ſcepticiſm. Far be it from me to arraign ſuch commendable Prudence and Moderation! but as the NORTH BRITON, is not ſuch an admirer of impartiality, I have reaſon to think, that he will not long permit this gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to remain in a ſtate of indifferency; he will not be content to ſay of him <hi>ALBUS an ATER homo ſit, neſcio!</hi> but having once brought himſelf to imagine, that he has diſcovered the gentleman's biaſs, he will ſoon be induced to favour us with a portrait of ſo diſtinguiſhed a perſonage either in Chalk or in Charcoal.</p>

                  <p>I Remember to have ſeen many Letters in your Chronicle, and other of the Publick Papers, againſt the Bill for regulating Franks, which Letters I ſuppoſe were written by perſons, whoſe intereſt or convenience was in ſome meaſure likely to be affected by the propoſed regulation. I, Mr. Baldwin, with due reverence to the Hon. Houſe I declare it, am a Member of Parliament, one of thoſe mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers who moſt heartily concurred in paſſing the bill: firſt of all in a patriot view, being perſuaded it would make a yearly addition of ſeventy thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds to the revenue of the Poſt-Office, which is now publick property; and ſecondly in
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0587000702:49"/>
a private light, imagining it would ſave myſelf a great deal of trouble in Franking Letters for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, friends, acquaintance, conſtituents, &amp;c. &amp;c. But, alas, Mr. Baldwin, I find the firſt of theſe benefits expected to reſult from the new limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, very uncertain, and the laſt, merely ideal: and though I have but little of the leaven of oppoſition in my temper, yet I now moſt ſincerely repent of the conceſſions I have made, and wiſh that many others, as well as myſelf, had inſiſted more ſteadily on the preſervation of our Privilege, and not have reſigned it almoſt entirely to the Clerks of the Poſt-Office, who will perhaps be as great gainers by theſe new regulations as the members of both Houſes will be loſers. As to the advantage reſulting to the revenue from theſe reſtrictions, I ſhall leave them to be determined by Fact and Experience: and I ſhall alſo ſhew by Fact and woeful Experience, that the trouble uſually given to Members of Parliament, in the article of Franking, inſtead of being the leaſt diminiſhed will be conſiderably increaſed.</p>
                  <p>Coming home from the Houſe, a few days ago, I found, lying on my writing-table, a large packet with the following ſuperſcription: <q rend="inline">"Mr. L's. compliments to Mr. M. and begs the favour of
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0587000702:50"/>
him to Frank and Direct the incloſed covers: a dozen with the following addreſs:—To Mrs. L. at Sir Hugh Llanvilly's, at Llanvilly Park, near Llanvilly, Merionethſhire, Wales.—Half a dozen—To Mr. Latitat, Attorney at Law at Bewdly, near Worceſter.—Half a dozen—To G. L. Eſq. of Trinity College, Cambridge.—A dozen—To Mr. L. himſelf, in Sackville-Street, Piccadilly, to be uſed by his ſon, when he writes to him from Cambridge; and one dozen more—To Miſs Trippit, at Sir William Trippit's, Grove-Park, Berkſhire, a conſtant correſpondent of Mr. L's eldeſt daughter."—</q>Such, Mr. Balwin, was the ſubſtance of this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite card, and give me leave to ſay that, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mr. L. is but a common acquaintance, with whom I ſometimes take a turn in the Queen's walk, or whom I now and then join in a morning's ride in Hyde-Park, or meet in an evening at the Mount coffee-houſe, I never ſaw a more conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate piece of aſſurance. The cool impudence of it ſtartled me at firſt, but on recollection, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to take no farther notice of it, than to order it, as we do idle papers in the Houſe, to lie upon the table.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="45" facs="tcp:0587000702:51"/>A very ſhort period ſince has, however, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced me, that I am to expect many ſuch applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Several other equally modeſt perſons have taken occaſion to hint to me, that they ſhall expect the like favour; ſome of whom are people, whom I by no means chuſe to offend, and others are ſuch whom I am under ſome kind of neceſſity to oblige. My wife, Mr. Baldwin, if you are a married man, you will eaſily conceive that I cannot refuſe: all the fiddle-faddle correſpondence of my four daughters, my nieces, and ſome other Miſſes of their particular acquaintance, muſt alſo paſs under my Franks and Direction. As to my conſtituents, as I repreſent the inhabitants of a moſt reſpectable city in the Weſt of England, where I am brought in for Nothing—that is, where no Bribery prevails, and it only coſts me about 1500l. in treating, &amp;c.—How, I ſay, Mr. Baldwin, can I forbear to comply with the demands of my conſtituents?</p>
                  <p>Some of my friends, to avoid the trouble of writing their names over and over, provided them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves formerly with a ſtamp; but if they could not away with the ſingle trouble of Franking, how will they digeſt the additional one of Directing? Another inconvenience is, that when the Frank and Addreſs are both in one hand, the incloſed
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0587000702:52"/>
letter muſt alſo naturally be ſuppoſed to come from the ſame perſon. It is eaſy to conceive ſituations wherein this circumſtance muſt be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly diſagreeable, eſpecially to grave old gentlemen, like myſelf; whereas before, all letters, however directed, paſſed without the leaſt imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on the characters of the lords or gentlemen, who franked them. I have known a letter to Grub-Street paſs, without aſtoniſhment, under the ſanction of the Earl of Cheſterfield; and have ſeen a cover franked by an Archbiſhop, filled up, without ſcandaliſing even the poſt-man, with a direction to Haddock's Bagnio.</p>
                  <p>Such, and many more, are the inconveniencies likely to ariſe on this occaſion to members of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament. But we have brought them on ourſelves, and muſt take them for our pains. For my part, my chief concern is the trouble, which I ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to ſave by all the means I am able to deviſe, or which you, Mr. B. or any of the ingenious correſpondents in your Chronicle are able to ſuggeſt. My preſent intention is, to ſend to the fellow whom we committed to Newgate for forging Franks, and who will neceſſarily be enlarged at the riſing of the parliament, offering to take him into pay, in
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0587000702:53"/>
caſe he wants employment, and promiſing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend him to ſeveral lords and gentlemen of my acquaintance.</p>

                  <p>I Have ſeen in your paper, the preface to Poems by a Journeyman Shoemaker, and have alſo peruſed ſeveral of the Poems themſelves with a ſingular pleaſure, though I muſt own with much leſs ſurpriſe than the generality of his readers. That Stephen Duck, the threſher, ſhould leave the barn for the garret; or that Jones, the bricklayer, ſhould attempt to Build the Lofty Rhime, were indeed circumſtances ſomewhat extraordinary; unleſs the firſt had been contented merely to wield the Flail of Satire, and the laſt, to uſe the Trowel of Panegyrick, neither of which were the caſe: But that James Woodhouſe, the journeyman
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0587000702:54"/>
Shoemaker, ſhould, as the preface tells us, <q rend="inline">"ſit at his work with a pen and ink by him, and when he has made a couplet write it down on his knee,"</q> is not, I think, altogether ſo miraculous as the other two inſtances, ſince there always appeared to me to be a very ſtrict analogy between Verſe-making and Shoe-making. Almoſt every Criſpin ſings at his work; why may not our <hi>Criſpinus</hi> alſo compoſe? He may ſurely, by no unnatural aſſociation of ideas, think at one and the ſame time of the Feet of his Verſes and the Feet of his Cuſtomers; or Hammer out a line, while he is Hammering out the ſole of a ſhoe. It is eaſy alſo for him to adapt his poetical exerciſes to the various circumſtances of his Sandalian Employments. He may turn his mind to familiar comick ſubjects, <hi>privatis &amp; prope Socco car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minibus,</hi> while he is manually operating on a pair of leathern ſocks: and he may with the ſame kind of ſympathy between head and hand, riſe to all the heights of the tragick ſublime, <hi>Carmina digna Cothurno,</hi> while he is making a pair of buſkins, which you know, Mr. Baldwin, are now very much in faſhion. If our author's ambition inſpires him too ſoon to Epick, and to ſing with Homer (<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>) <hi>the well-booted Grecians,</hi> he may work on boots. He would, I doubt not, diſpatch
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0587000702:55"/>
a book, with every pair; eſpecially if he throws in a pair or two of ſhoes, now and then, as he goes along, by way of Epiſode. Pindarick Odes, which are often on Equeſtrian ſubjects, may be diſpatched with Spatterdaſhes; light airy Verſes, with Pumps; and all eaſy, careleſs, Gentleman-like Compoſitions with Slippers.</p>
                  <p>Scholars, Mr. Baldwin, who want to engroſs all the provinces of literature, do not care that any body ſhould write but themſelves; and though the Muſes themſelves are females, yèt if a lady makes verſes they are arrogant enough to bid her learn to make a pudding. Verſe-making is in the preſent age, generally ſpeaking, as mechanical as Shoe-making. Why then ſhould not a poor me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanick ſhew his induſtry both ways, eſpecially a Shoe-maker, whoſe profeſſion as I have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to ſhew, is ſo conſiſtent with that of a Poet, and who can write verſes without neglecting his other buſineſs, or rendering himſelf liable to the cenſure contained in the old adage of <hi>ne ſutor ultrà crepidam!</hi>

                  <p>IN a note to one of M. D'Eon's famous letters, written from London, to the Duke of Niver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nois is the following remarkable paſſage:</p>
                  <q>After the earthquakes which happened here in 1750, a Lifeguard Man took it into his head to foretell a third, which was to overthrow London. He called himſelf inſpired, and with an enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical air fixed the day, the hour, and the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute. London being already in a conſternation at the remembrance of two ſhocks, at the exact diſtance of a month from each other, and ſtill more terrified at the expected approach of a third more terrible earthquake, which the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſtical ſoldier had announced for the 5th of April, the Town ſhewed itſelf ſuſceptible of all kinds of impreſſions. More than 50,000 inhabitants on the faith of this oracle, had that day betaken themſelves to flight. The greater part of thoſe whom the arguments or railleries of their friends had detained, waited with trembling the critical inſtant, and ſhewed no kind of cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0587000702:57"/>
till it was over. When the day arrived, the prophecy, like moſt other predictions, was not accompliſhed; the falſe Samuel was ſent ſomewhat too late to Bedlam, and the heads of theſe fierce iſlanders, ſo wiſe and ſo philoſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, were not proof againſt the prophecy of a madman.</q>
                  <p>Such, Mr. Baldwin, are the pictures, which Frenchmen who come among us, frequently draw of our nation. Taking a hearſay ſtory for fact, and paſſing off miſrepreſentations for truth, they pretend to decide from thence, on the manners and character of the people, commonly founding their opinions on vague reports, idle pamphlets and papers, rather than on their own obſervations on real life. Thus the ſtory of the Bottle-Conjurer, firſt ridiculed in pamphlets at home, gave us among foreigners the character of a credulous people; and Bielfield mentions it in his letters as an inſtance of our rage for Spectacles: as if the whole town had been crammed into the Little Theatre in the Haymarket; and as if every body, there preſent on that occaſion, really expected to ſee a man get into a Quart Bottle. This is the opinion that foreigners generally entertain of that affair; and
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0587000702:58"/>
in compliment to their own wiſdom they conclude that the Engliſh are Fools.</p>
                  <p>The ſubject of M. D'Eon's note gives them alſo, as they imagine, another ſpecimen of our charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; and M. D'Eon himſelf having, I ſuppoſe, picked up this ſtory among other table-talk, ſince his arrival in England, puts it into French, and flouriſhes away upon it moſt triumphantly. But did M. D'on ſee the 50,000 who ran out of town? No. Was he in London? No. In England? No. But he has heard that a lifeguardman fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told a third earthquake, and that ſome weak people were frightened at it, Theſe he calls the Town, and multiplies them into fifty thouſand emigrants, and lays on the remaining thouſands, no other reſtraint than ſhame and the fear of ridicule. It is eaſy for a lively Frenchman, to draw the ſevereſt concluſions from ſuch falſe premiſes. But let me aſk him, where is that wiſe and philoſophical me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolis, among which there are no weak perſons? and are they the proper perſons to fit for the true portrait of a nation? Suppoſe exactly the ſame cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances had happened at Paris, would not the <hi>Bois de Boulogne</hi> have been as full of coaches as Hyde-Park was on that occaſion? Would it be candid in an Engliſhman reſiding at Paris fourteen
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0587000702:59"/>
years after not only to multiply 500 to 50,000, but to throw alſo the ſame ridicule, which they had drawn on themſelves, on all the reſt of the town? And yet would it not be very eaſy for ſuch an Engliſhman to give himſelf an inſolent air, and to ſay <q rend="inline">"The faith of this bigotted nation was pinned on a prophecy, perhaps not half ſo ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous as many other articles of their belief: and volatile underſtandings, like chaff before the wind, were blown to and fro by the breath of a madman."</q>

                  <p>WE Two, who have now determined to become your joint correſpondents, and like the two hands to pull together on this occaſion, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though like them, We are always on different ſides; We, Sir, We ſay, and Our anceſtors, have been members of parliament time out of mind;
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0587000702:60"/>
We, as well as Our reſpective predeceſſors, have, it is true, very often changed Our ſides, but then like partners in a country dance, We have each of us <hi>croſſed over</hi> and now and then in caſe of a coalition of parties, <hi>joined hands,</hi> for the ſake of <hi>figuring in.</hi> We are in general not a very talkative family, delighting chiefly in monoſyllables; and thinking a word <hi>from</hi> the wiſe, as well as a word <hi>to</hi> the wiſe, fully ſufficient. The truth is, We are like ſheep, a gregarious kind of animal, and if one leaps over a hedge or into a ditch, all the reſt follow; but though We have little or no cauſe, at leaſt no oſtenſible one, for Our conduct; yet We think ourſelves infinitely obliged to thoſe ingenious gentlemen, who, after all is over, are ſo kind as to aſſign a plauſible reaſon for what We have done. The principal end of this letter, therefore, Mr. Baldwin, is to return thanks in both Our names, to all political writers <hi>Pro</hi> and <hi>Con,</hi> AUDITOR and NORTH BRITON, Defenders of Minority or Majority, for taking the trouble to inveſtigate the motives of Our parliamentary behaviour, and enabling Us to defend Our ſeveral cauſes with arguments We never heard, nor ever thought of before.

We know Our cues, and Our parts are but ſhort; but when We have performed them, We ſhall be obliged to thoſe gentlemen who will again under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to ſhew that We ſeemed to follow nature, and that they could not perceive that We were moved like Puppets; or like live actors, ſtood in need of a Prompter.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Drury Lane.</hi> LAST night was performed at this theatre, for the firſt time, a new comick opera, called the Capricious Lovers, written by Mr. Lloyd, and founded, as the author informs us, on a French piece of Monſieur Favart, called <hi>Les Caprices d' Amour; ou, Ninette à la Cour.</hi> Being no great admirers of Operas, ſerious, or comick, we cannot help ſaying that we think Mr. Robert Lloyd deſerves much cenſure on this occaſion, for theſe two reaſons, firſt for linking
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0587000702:62"/>
his theatrical labours with thoſe of a compoſer; and ſecondly for entering the field of Opera with the arms of Senſe and Poetry. There are charms enough in this piece to ſeduce us into a liking of this Species of the Drama; and Mr. Lloyd is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warily ſacrificing to a Caſtrato Apollo, inſtead of that manly vigorous God of Poetry for whom he and his lamented friend Churchill have always pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed ſo ſincere an adoration. And yet after all, Mr. Lloyd has entirely miſtaken the matter, in writing elegant words in order to be adapted to muſick; for it is a fact founded on experience that nothing is ſo harmonious as nonſenſe; as a recent proof of which maxim we will venture to ſay, that Mr. Ruſh's compoſition in the ſerious Opera of the Royal Shepherd, in which Opera there was ſcarce one line of ſenſe, was infinitely ſuperior to his muſical labours in the Capricious Lovers: in which laſt entertainment we aſſigned to the author the firſt place; to the performers, who were moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, the ſecond; and to the compoſer, but not without an interval betwixt them, the third. Not that we mean to depreciate the talents of Mr. Ruſh, or that we do not readily allow his having exerted them in the compoſition of ſeveral elegant airs in this Opera, but merely to obſerve that (perhaps
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0587000702:63"/>
for want of uſe) ſenſe is not ſo pliant under his hands as nonſenſe, and that he laviſhed much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent muſick, on many a melodious <hi>For,</hi> or <hi>The,</hi> or <hi>And,</hi> in the Royal Shepherd laſt year, which would have been better beſtowed, had he reſerved it for the excellent poetry of the airs in this Opera.—The dialogue alſo has much merit, as well as the airs, for which the author is partly indebted to the original French; though we cannot but obſerve that much of the part of Liſetta, and all the comick ſcenes between Hobbinol and Damon, together with their lively appearance in the cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrophe, with all which circumſtances the audience were ſo highly entertained, are entirely new.—The performers did great juſtice to their characters. It would be great injuſtice not to confeſs the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and uncommon excellence of Mrs. Clive, Mr. Yates, and Mr. Vernon. Indeed the execution of the whole Opera afforded us much entertainment, and we liked it but too well.</p>
                  <p>In order to give our country readers a ſpecimen of the words, we ſhall ſubjoin two ſongs, though indeed they may rather be called elegant little poems, than mere airs in the Opera. There are ſeveral others of equal merit.</p>

                  <head>NOTES on the PREFACE to <hi>Mr. Johnſon's Edition</hi> of <hi>Shakeſpeare</hi> (publiſhed this morning.)</head>
                  <p>JOHNSON's Shakeſpeare! publiſhed! when? this morning—what at laſt!—<hi>vix tandem,</hi> 'egad! he has obſerved Horace's rule of <hi>nonum in annum.</hi> Keep the Piece nine years, as Pope ſays—I know a friend of mine that ſubſcribed in fifty-ſix—&amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Such perhaps is the language of ſome little wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, who thinks his ſatirical ſallies extremely poignant and ſevere; but the appearance of any production of Mr. Johnſon cannot fail of being grateful to the literary world; and, come when
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0587000702:66"/>
they will, like an agreeable gueſt, we are ſure to give them a hearty welcome, though perhaps we may have betrayed ſome little impatience at their not coming ſooner. Nor have the publick in general been deceived. None but ſubſcribers have a right to complain: and they I ſuppoſe, in general, meant to ſhow their reſpect for Mr. Johnſon, rather than to give themſelves a title of becoming clamorous creditors.</p>
                  <p>But granting our editor to be naturally indolent—and naturally indolent we believe him to be—we cannot help wondering at the number, vaſtneſs, and excellence of his productions. A Dictionary of our language; a ſeries of admirable eſſays in the Rambler, as well as, if we are not miſinformed, ſeveral excellent ones in the Adventurer; an edition of Shakeſpeare; beſides ſome leſs conſiderable works, all in the ſpace of no very great number of years! and all theſe the productions of a mere Idler! We could wiſh there were a few more of ſuch indolent men in theſe kingdoms.</p>
                  <p>Of the general merit of this new edition of Shakeſpeare we cannot now be expected to give any account. It was publiſhed but this morning, but as we obtained a ſight of the editor's valuable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face a few days ago, we ſhall now oblige our rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0587000702:67"/>
with a few extracts from it, together with ſome remarks which we have taken the liberty to ſubjoin; for the freedom of which we make no apology, as Mr. Johnſon need not now be told, that notwithſtanding <q rend="inline">"the tenderneſs due to living reputation and veneration to genius and learning, he cannot be juſtly offended at that liberty, of which he has himſelf ſo frequently given an example."</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>After ſome introductory matter concerning the degree of merit, which we may ſuppoſe to be ſtamped on works by the ſuffrage of antiquity, the writer proceeds thus:</p>
                  <q>SHAKESPEARE is above all writers, at leaſt above all modern writers, the Poet of Nature: the Poet that holds up to his readers a faithful Mirrour of Manners and of Life. His characters are not mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dified by the cuſtoms of particular places, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practiſed by the reſt of the world, by the pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarities of ſtudies or profeſſions, which can ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate but upon ſmall numbers; or by the accidents of tranſient faſhions or temporary opinions: they are the genuine progeny of common humanity, ſuch as the world will always ſupply, and obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will always find. His perſons act and ſpeak by the influence of thoſe general paſſions and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0587000702:68"/>
by which all minds are agitated, and the whole ſyſtem of life is continued in motion. In the writings of other poets a character is too often an individual; in thoſe of Shakeſpeare it is commonly a ſpecies.</q>
                  <p>Having given ſome further illuſtration of this argument, the editor proceeds in the following terms:</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>His adherence to general nature has expoſed him to the Cenſure of Criticks, who form their judgments upon narrower principles. Dennis and Rhymer think his Romans not ſufficiently Roman; and Voltaire cenſures his Kings as not completely Royal. Dennis is offended, that Menenius, a Senator of Rome, ſhould play the buffoon; and Voltaire perhaps, thinks decency violated when the Daniſh uſurper is repreſented as a drunkard. But Shakeſpeare always makes nature predominant over accident; and if he preſerves the eſſential character, is not very careful of diſtinctions ſuper-induced and adventitious. His ſtory requires Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans or Kings, but he thinks only on Men. He knew that Rome, like every other city, had men of all diſpoſitions: and wanting a buffoon, he went into the Senate Houſe for that which the Senate Houſe would certainly have afforded him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="63" facs="tcp:0587000702:69"/>He was inclined to ſhew an uſurper, and a mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer, not only odious but deſpicable, he therefore added drunkenneſs to his other qualities, knowing that Kings love wine, like other men, and that wine exerts its natural power upon Kings. Theſe are the petty cavils of petty minds; a poet over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looks the caſual diſtinction of country and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, as a painter, ſatisfied with the figure, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glects the drapery.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>Has not Mr. Johnſon here made too liberal a conceſſion to Dennis? and on an examination of the play of Coriolanus, would it not appear that the character of Menenius, though marked with the peculiarities of an hearty old gentleman, is by no means that of a buffoon? Many have defended Polonius, who is much leſs reſpectable than Menenius.</p>
                  <p>The editor then enters into a very ſenſible and ſpirited vindication of the mingled drama of Shake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeare, and the interchange of ſerious and comick ſcenes in the ſame play. His reflections on this ſubject he cloſes in the following terms:</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>When Shakeſpeare's plan is underſtood, moſt of the criticiſms of Rhymer and Voltaire vaniſh away. The play of Hamlet is opened, without impropriety, by two Centinels; Iago bellows at Brabantio's window, without injury to the ſcheme
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0587000702:70"/>
of the play, though in terms which a modern au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience would not eaſily endure; the character of Polonius is ſeaſonable and uſeful; and the Grave Diggers themſelves may be heard with applauſe.</p>
                     <p>Shakeſpeare engaged in Dramatick Poetry with the world open before him; the rules of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients were yet known to few; the publick judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was unformed; he had no example of ſuch fame as might force him upon imitation, nor cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks of ſuch authority as might reſtrain his extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagance: He therefore indulged his natural diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, and his diſpoſition, as Rhymer has remarked, led him to Comedy. In Tragedy <hi>he often writes with great appearance of toil and ſtudy, what is written at laſt with little facility</hi>; but in his comick ſcenes, he ſeems to produce without labour, what no labour can improve. In Tragedy he is always ſtruggling after ſome occaſion to be comick, but in Comedy he ſeems to repoſe, or to luxuriate, as in a mode of thinking congenial to his nature. In his tragick ſcenes there is always ſomething want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but his Comedy often ſurpaſſes expectation or deſire. His Comedy pleaſes by the thoughts and the language, and his Tragedy for the greater part by incident and action. His Tragedy ſeems to be ſkill, his comedy inſtinct.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="65" facs="tcp:0587000702:71"/>This opinion in which Mr. J. concurs with the Arch Zoilus of our author, is however very diſputable; and we cannot help thinking that what is ſaid in this place, as well as what is after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thrown out on this head, in ſpeaking of his faults, is infinitely too ſtrong. A good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on parts of Othello, Hamlet, Lear, Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth, and other tragick ſcenes of Shakeſpeare, or perhaps a mere peruſal of them, would be the beſt method of confuting theſe aſſertions.</p>

                  <q>IN his comick ſcenes he is ſeldom very ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, when he engages his characters in Reciprocations of Smartneſs and Conteſts of Sarcaſm;</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anglice,</hi> Repartee. Dryden in one of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faces calls it <q rend="inline">"a Quick Chace of Wit;"</q> but ſo many writers, ſo many ſtyles!</p>
                  <q>
                     <pb n="66" facs="tcp:0587000702:72"/>But the admirers of this great poet have moſt reaſon to complain, when he approaches neareſt to his higheſt excellence, and ſeems fully reſolved to ſink them into dejection and mollify them with tender emotions by the Fall of Greatneſs, the Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of Innocence, or the Croſſes of Love.</q>
                  <p>Does Mr. J. mean to refer his readers to the Fall of Wolſey, the Diſtreſſes of Lear, the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Duncan and Deſdemona, &amp;c. &amp;c. or was his mind wholly occupied by ſome quibbling ſcenes in Romeo and Juliet, and the Midſummer's Night's Dream?</p>
                  <q>A quibble was to him the fatal Cleopatra for which he loſt the world, and was content to loſe it.</q>
                  <p>Has not Mr. J. been as culpably fond of writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon Quibble, as Shakeſpeare in perſuing it? and is not his laboured paragraph upon quibble as puerile as a remnant of a ſchool-boy's decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation? Beſides, was it not a vice common to all the writers of that age?</p>
                  <q>Familiar Comedy is often more powerful on the Theatre, than in the page; Imperial Tragedy is always leſs.</q>
                  <p>Imperial Tragedy, ſuch at leaſt as is attended with theſe effects, is of all others the coldeſt; and
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:0587000702:73"/>
that Tragick Writer has but very ill effected the purpoſes of that ſpecies of Drama, whoſe produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are more powerful in the Page, than on the Theatre. Cato, perhaps, may poſſeſs more dignity and force in the cloſet; but we know that Richard, Lear, Othello, &amp;c. have moſt power on the ſtage.</p>
                  <q>Thoſe whom my arguments cannot perſuade to give their approbation to the judgement of Shake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeare, will eaſily, if they conſider the condition of his life, make ſome allowance for his ignorance.</q>
                  <p>There is much good ſenſe, ſound criticiſm, and fine writing in theſe obſervations on the Unities; and it is certain that a ſtrict obſervation of the Unities of Time and Place have not only <q rend="inline">"given more trouble to the poet than pleaſure to the Auditor,"</q> but have perhaps created as many abſurdities as they have prevented: yet it were to have been wiſhed, that Mr. J. had in this, as in all other inſtances, rather maintained the character of a reaſoner, than aſſumed that of a pleader. All liberties may be carried to an exceſs, and the violation of theſe Unities may be ſo groſs as to become unpardonable. Shakeſpeare himſelf ſeems to have been ſenſible of this; and therefore introduced the Chorus into
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0587000702:74"/>
Henry the Fifth to waft us from ſhore to ſhore; and for the ſame reaſon he brings in the perſonage of Time in the character of Chorus in the Winter's Tale, to apologiſe for the lapſe of ſixteen years, the diſtance between the ſuppoſed birth of Perdita, and her appearance as the nymph beloved by Florizel. It might have been worth while therefore to have endeavoured in ſome meaſure to aſcertain how far theſe Unities may allowably be tranſgreſſed. Such an inveſtigation by Mr. J. would have ſtill enhanced the value of this excellent Preface, and muſt have been agreeable to all readers.</p>
                  <q>There has always prevailed a tradition, that Shakeſpeare wanted learning, that he had no regular education, nor much ſkill in the dead languages. Jonſon his friend, affirms, that he had ſmall Latin and no Greek.</q>
                  <p>Mr. J. certainly quotes from memory in this place. The affirmation of Ben Jonſon is, that Shakeſpeare <q rend="inline">"had ſmall Latin, and <hi>leſs</hi> Greek,"</q> which implies his having ſome ſhare of both. Even in our times, a man who has ſome Greek, has commonly a pretty competent knowledge of Latin.</p>
                  <q>
                     <pb n="69" facs="tcp:0587000702:75"/>Such verſe we make when we are writing proſe; we make ſuch verſe in common conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation.</q>
                  <p>It is remarkable that Dennis, though perhaps undeſignedly, has here exemplified his own ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation.</p>

                  <p>I Have ſeen and read the Remarks which you were pleaſed to ſubjoin to the Extracts from Mr. Johnſon's Preface to his Edition of Shake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeare, and hope that the ſame Remarker, having concluded his comments on the Preface, will proceed to examine the work itſelf. In the mean time, if the following obſervations on ſome of our new editor's notes, on the play of Henry the Fifth, appear to be worth your notice, you are welcome to publiſh them in your Chronicle. I had no particular reaſon for ſingling out this play: but when my books, for which I had long ſince ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, came home, the fourth volume happened to be the firſt that I cut open, and Harry V. the

                                    <hi>Cruſh'd Neceſſity</hi> (the reading here retained in this paſſage) is that of the folios. The old quarto has it <hi>Curs'd</hi> Neceſſity. Sir T. Hanmer reads,
<q>
                                       <l>Yet that is not o'Courſe a Neceſſity,</l>

                                 <p>Dr. W. contends for <hi>'Scus'd</hi> Neceſſity, meaning <hi>Excuſed</hi>; and Mr. J. ſays we might read a <hi>Crude</hi> Neceſſity. All the criticks concur in ſupplying a word of the ſame ſignification, ſuppoſing that Ely would ſhew that there is not an Abſolute Neceſſity, which indeed is the ſenſe that the whole context, taken together, ſeems to point out. It appears to me that the old quarto, with a very ſlight emen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, would give the true reading. Omit the ſingle letter (S) and for <hi>Curs'd</hi> Neceſſity (which is an error of the preſs) read <hi>Cur'd</hi> Neceſſity, and that ſmall alteration produces the meaning that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text requires, and the criticks have endeavoured to ſtrike out. A very ingenious gentleman of my acquaintance, propoſes to read, a Cur's Neceſſity, in alluſion to the fable of the dog in the manger. But I think it does not fall in with the reſt of the paſſage.</p>
                                 <p>Not having any other edition by me at preſent, I cannot tell whether the word <hi>Pretty</hi> in the laſt

                                 <p>But the original order pleaſes Me beſt, Mr. Baldwin, nor can I conceive how any reader of the lines can look about for a meaning without finding it; or indeed how he can miſs finding it under his noſe, without looking about at all.

                                    </q>
The meaning of this is, that there was a plot to kill the King in Southampton before he could em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bark on his French expedition. This the King himſelf explains, <q>

                                 <p>Surely the words <q rend="inline">"And in Southampton"</q> did not puzzle Mr. Johnſon.

                  <p>IF you ever, on Sundays or Holydays, beſtow eighteenpence a ſide on a horſe, and turn his head towards the Weſt, you may probably have beheld me, your preſent correſpondent, placed cloſe againſt Hyde-Park Wall, a little beyond St. George's Hoſpital. My travelling name, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the name which travellers on the Weſtern road have given me, is CAPTAIN NOSE, a kind of <hi>Cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomen,</hi> derived, after the Roman cuſtom, from the moſt remarkable prominence of a certain feature of my face. Tully, from a ſimilar reaſon, was ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named CICERO; and Ovid was called NASO, from the very ſame cauſe that I have been chriſtened CAPTAIN NOSE. The poet, on account of ſome illicit amours, was driven into exile. I, who am a veteran in the military ſervice, am rewarded as handſomely as many other veterans; and while the ſoldiers of the three regiments of Foot Guards are put into wooden boxes to watch the ducks in St. James's Park, I am ſtationed a perpetual centry
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:0587000702:84"/>
againſt Hyde-Park Wall, to obſerve the motions of all the goers and comers in and out of this extenſive metropolis.</p>
                  <p>If you ever were at Paris, Mr. Baldwin, you muſt know that it is impoſſible to paſs any of the barriers, without an impertinent fellow of an officer tearing open your coach door, to ſee that you do not export or import ſo much as a bottle of ſour wine, without defraying the duties on it. Were I to take the ſame liberty with every coach that paſſes by my ſtation, ſuch is the jealouſy of military eſtabliſhments in this free country, that I might probably in leſs than a week, fall into the hands of the civil power, be ſeized by Fielding's runners, be carried to give an account of myſelf before the Bow-Street Police, and perhaps ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately be conveyed out of town again towards the North-Weſt, when I might be allotted a more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable ſtation, than that which I occupy at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. To ſay the truth, I do not want to take ſo near an inſpection of paſſengers as an highwayman's horſe, for it is eaſy enough to ſee <hi>how the world goes,</hi> even with half an eye; and though you may perceive that I only glance at them in profile, yet they do not drive ſo haſtily along, but I am able to give a tolerable account of them. Such an account,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:0587000702:85"/>
if you think it will be of ſervice to your Chronicle, is occaſionally at your ſervice. The Tatler pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to maintain an intercourſe with a Spirit, called <hi>Pacolet.</hi> Do not you then diſdain a corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondent in crayons! for perhaps, even the notified Connoiſſeur, Mr. Town, did not collect more intelligence from his couſin Village, than you may receive from me; nor did even the Spectator reap more advantages from his inquiſitive <hi>ſhort face,</hi> than you may derive from my <hi>long noſe,</hi> maſter Baldwin.</p>

                  <p>A Reverend Eſtimator of the Manners and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of the Times, lately deceaſed, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced EFFEMINACY to be the characteriſtick of the Britons of the preſent age; how unjuſtly, Voltaire, no friend to this country, has taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, obſerving that the Engliſh anſwered the charge, by carrying their conqueſts into every quarter of the globe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="81" facs="tcp:0587000702:87"/>Were I to attempt to aſſign the reigning princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that governs all ranks and orders of men in this kingdom, I ſhould not heſitate to mention the Spirit of Prodigality and Extravagance, which may now be ſaid to be epidemical, raging with equal violence in court and city, town and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and confounding high and low, rich and poor, one with another.</p>
                  <p>Set a beggar on horſeback, ſays the old Engliſh proverb, and he will ride to the Devil: though the devil himſelf, as Sir Francis Wronghead obſerves, would ſcarce imagine that he would ride poſt to him: and yet at preſent, every beggar has got on horſeback, and ſeems reſolved to run a race with his ſuperiors.</p>
                  <p>That he, who has nothing, or perhaps is worſe than nothing, ſhould not be afraid of being ruined, is not very wonderful; but that they, who are as happy as a good fortune can make them, ſhould take the greateſt pains to diveſt themſelves of the means of that happineſs, I have ever thought very extraordinary. That a Frog ſhould ſwell with envy, and burſt itſelf in order to become a Bull, is a fable whoſe moral one may readily compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend; but what Aeſop of antiquity would have deſcribed the noble Bull tormented with the ſame
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:0587000702:88"/>
mean pride, and roaring, and toſſing, and bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, till it reduced itſelf even below the ſtate of the wretched animal it might-trample on?</p>
                  <p>Great goings-out, to quote another old ſaying, muſt have great comings in. He who now lives to the extent of his fortune, if he multiplies his expences, muſt multiply his reſources, or ſee ruin before him. Some minds are apt not to be very ſcrupulouſſy delicate in the choice of thoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſources. A ſhopkeeper's apprentice, perhaps, commits violence on the Till; an attorney's clerk takes to the Gaming-Table; a tradeſman <hi>makes a break of it,</hi> and cheats his honeſt creditors of eighteen ſhillings in the pound; a genteel buck takes to the Turf; and a true blood to the Heath. As to ſuperior orders, the gentry and nobility, they are above committing theſe petty larcenies on ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety. If a great commoner, a lord or a duke, run out, they need not deſcend to theſe mean ſhifts. They need not attack individuals, but realiſe the wiſh of Caligula, and cut off the head of a nation at one blow. They need not be guilty of bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glaries, turn Rooks and Sharpers, commit fraudu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent bankruptcies, or put travellers into bodily fear on the king's highway. They have an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of proſtituting their votes, ſelling boroughs,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:0587000702:89"/>
&amp;c.—In ſhort they may unite all the abovemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned glorious characters in one. They may turn robbers of their country.</p>
                  <p>One of the chief ſchools, or rather academies, of Modern Extravagance, is the Gaming-Houſe. The pupils and ſtudents are the Rich; the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors they who want to get their Riches. Game<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, ſay the French, begin by being dupes and end by being ſharpers: and perhaps it is impoſſible even in this country, to become an adept in the ſcience without going through the degrees. The ſeveral colleges of Arthur's, Almack's, Boodle's, Saunder's, &amp;c. &amp;c. in the two pariſhes of St. James, and St. George, have a numerous liſt of ſcholars and diſciples on their books; and ſhould one ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to point out thoſe, whom every body acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges to be as well read in the myſtical parts of the art as Lookup himſelf, who knows but one might incur the danger of a <hi>Premunire</hi> or <hi>Scandalum Magnatûm?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I beg your pardon, Ladies! I have not ſaid a ſyllable about you in particular yet a-while, it is true: but when Extravagance is mentioned as a characteriſtick of the Manners of the preſent age, You muſt be allowed to have your ſhare of it.
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:0587000702:90"/>
Many an honeſt gentleman has been ruined by his wife's inordinate deſire to outvie the wife of his neighbour. A violent paſſion for Dreſs, Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page, and Company, are avowedly female failings; but Gaming, that fiend, which is too hot even for maſculine ſouls, has uſurped a dominion over the minds of our country-women. Converſation, and fire-ſide ſociety, is almoſt quite loſt among us. Family-viſits, Blindman's-buff, and Hot-cockles are no more. Every evening aſſembly is a route; and cards the occupation of every meeting; at which every body who plays, play higher than they can afford, from the Penny-Quadrille of Blackfriars, to the unlimited Lu in the liberties of Weſtminſter.</p>
                  <p>Extravagance, however, like many other vices, commonly counter-acts itſelf, and defeats its own ends. Prodigals, even during the ſhort period of their ſplendor, rather render themſelves ridiculous, than important in the eyes of the multitude. The world is commonly furniſhed with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials to judge pretty accurately of the income of particulars; and they who ſeem palpably to exceed the meaſure of their circumſtances, inſtead of creating admiration excite pity or contempt. It would ſeem almoſt incredible therefore, did not

experience confute all ſpeculation, that any perſons ſhould be ſo mad as to forfeit all the future happineſs of their lives, for the ſake of expoſing themſelves to publick deriſion for a few ſhort months, or at moſt for a very few years. The patience of creditors is ſoon exhauſted, and a diſtreſſed gentleman, who is often put upon Ways and Means, will ſoon find it very difficult, and at laſt quite impoſſible to raiſe the Supplies. He that will not take up in good time, and put himſelf under a proper regimen for the evils incurred by his extravagance, may be aſſured, that the diſeaſe will at laſt cure itſelf. An acquaintance of mine, who loves a pun, often compares a prodigal to a clock: he can <hi>go,</hi> ſays he, as long as he can <hi>tick</hi>; but when he can <hi>tick</hi> no longer, he muſt <hi>ſtand.</hi> I would recommend it therefore to every man, who is about to contract debts, to conſider whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he ſhall be able to pay them; and before he adopts a new ſyſtem of living, to aſk himſelf ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly whether he ſhall be able to ſupport it.</p>
                  <p>I cannot better wind up this rambling diſſerta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, than by annexing to it a copy of a manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript now in my poſſeſſion. The original, I am told, was written by that famous military

                  <p>MATTER, ſay ſome naturaliſts, never pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes: the form indeed is eternally varying, but the eſſence remains. The face of whole coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries may change, animals die, plants decay, and palaces fall to ruin; duſt returns to duſt, but the ſeveral atoms are not loſt. We may, with Hamlet
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:0587000702:93"/>
trace Alexander to the ſtopping a Beer-Barrel; or follow the eminent botaniſt, Dr. Hill, till we leave him among the Compoſt of a Hot-bed of Cucumbers.</p>
                  <p>The moral world, in the opinion of ſome Specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latiſts, reſembles the material. They imagine that the certain portion of virtue and vice, good and ill qualities, which originally actuated mankind, is neither increaſed nor diminiſhed. Forms of Goverment, and Modes of Politeneſs, may indeed have turned them to different ſhapes, tinged them with different colours and transferred them to dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent poſſeſſors; but they have a permanent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence: and it would be as abſurd to maintain that they are annihilated, becauſe they no longer reſide in the ſame perſons, or retain their old names, as to contend that Montague-Houſe is pulled down becauſe it is rendered the Britiſh Muſeum, or that Sir Hans Sloane's curioſities are all loſt, becauſe they are all lodged in Montague-Houſe.</p>
                  <p>To what region the Virtues that have left this iſland are flown, it is difficult to diſcover; but in the moral ſyſtem there ſeems at preſent to be going on a kind of Country-Dance between the Male and Female Follies and Vices, in which they have ſeverally croſſed over, and taken each other's
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:0587000702:94"/>
places. The men are growing delicate and refined, and the women free and eaſy. There is indeed a kind of animal neither male nor female, a thing of the neuter gender, lately ſtarted up amongſt us. It is called a Macaroni. It talks without Meaning, it ſmiles without Pleaſantry, it eats without Appetite, it rides without Exerciſe, it wenches without Paſſion.</p>
                  <p>I may perhaps, on ſome future occaſion, be ample in animadverſion on thoſe Lady-like Gentlemen, who, deſpairing to be thought men, are ambitious of reſembling women. At preſent I ſhall rather confine my obſervations to thoſe adventurous and ſpirited females, who ſeem reſolved to break though the whalebone and buckram fences of Modeſty and Decorum, and would no more endure ſtarch in their manners than in a pair of laced ruffles. A certain maſculine air now diſtinguiſhes the ladies; and if you ſee a female enter a publick place with a bold <hi>knock-me-down</hi> freedom, ſet her down for a perſon of quality!</p>
                  <p>Bath and Tunbridge, Cheltenham and Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough, the Theatres, Vauxhall, Ranelagh, and of late years Soho and Almack's, were ſuppoſed to be the only Shew-Glaſſes for youth and beauty. Taverns and coffee-houſes were appropriated en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:0587000702:95"/>
to the men; and a woman, out of the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieus of Covent-Garden, or the hundreds of Drury, would have fainted away at the thoughts of enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch places of publick entertainment: but in the year 1770 the ladies of the firſt quality, the <hi>mungoes,</hi> the ſuperiors of the times, have abrogated the old Salick laws of libertiniſm, and openly ſet up a tavern in profeſt rivalry of Boodle's, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thur's, and Almack's.</p>
                  <p>Such a convulſion in the moral world is ſurely as extraordinary as any former change or revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the natural or political ſyſtem: but being once effected, who can foretell how far it will proceed, or how rapid will be its progreſs? In a few years the common occurrences of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's life may more nearly reſemble thoſe of a man's, than her riding-habit now approaches to his dreſs. A lady may ſoon perhaps intrigue, and game, and ſwear, and drink, and ſmoke tobacco, more openly than her huſband does at preſent; and ſome future papers may perhaps authenticate the following paragraphs:</p>
                  <p>Yeſterday a duel was fought behind Montague-Houſe between two ladies at the Weſt end of the town. One of the combatants was dangerouſly
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:0587000702:96"/>
wounded, and the other having abſconded, is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to have gained the Continent.</p>
                  <p>Laſt week a lady of the Coterie loſt 3000 gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas at Faro at one ſitting, to ſome other females of that ſociety.</p>
                  <p>Laſt Saturday was run for, on the Beacon Courſe at Newmarket, the Ladies Subſcription Purſe, which was won by Miſs Charlotte Hayes's Eclipſe. The knowing-ones were taken in; and a gentlewoman who has this meeting been convicted of Foul-Play, has been expelled the Side-Saddle Club by the unanimous ſuffrage of that honourable ſociety.</p>
                  <p>Yeſterday twenty-one female priſoners were tried at the Old Bailey, when five were capitally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed, viz. Mary Wharton for breaking and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the houſe of Mr. Jenkins, with intent to ſteal the goods; Margaret Boldboy for a rape on the body of Joſeph Andrews; Rachel Stephens, Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſan Hodges, and Sarah Hughes for the wilful mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Thomas Simple, by ſhooting him with a blunderbuſs. Seven were caſt for tranſportation, and nine acquitted.</p>
                  <p>It is ſaid that great intereſt is making by ſome ladies of the higheſt quality, to obtain a pardon for Mary Flannagan, now lying in Newgate under

ſentence of death, her brother, Patrick Flana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, being in keeping with two or three dutcheſſes.</p>
                  <p>A gang of footpads, in Straw Hats and Red Cloaks, have infeſted the New Road near Iſlington for ſome time paſt. Two of them, very deſperate viragoes, were taken by Mrs. Juſtice Foolding's wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men laſt night, and by her worſhip's warrant com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to New Priſon.</p>
                  <p>We hear that Mrs. Catherine Macaulay will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be the Middleſex member.</p>
                  <p>Laſt night a ſtreet-walker in the Strand, who has long been known among his fellow proſtitutes by the name of Black Tom, was very much mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated by ſome young ladies who had been ſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the evening at the Shakeſpeare tavern. The poor wretch now lies dangerouſly ill, and it is thought will not long ſurvive. One of the young ladies is ſaid to be the eldeſt daughter of a popular counteſs.</p>
                  <p>Laſt week Miſs Theodoſia Forreſter, being on a party of ſhooting near her mama's ſeat in Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetſhire, had the misfortune of loſing her right breaſt by the ſtock of the barrel of the gun burſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the time of her firing.</p>

                  <p>THERE are in every language, ancient and modern, certain heterogeneous words and anomalous expreſſions, which render it more difficult to be acquired by ſtudents and foreigners than even the moſt licentious idiomatick phraſes, or the moſt irregular combination of ſentences. In vain may the laborious Lexicographer boaſt of having traced every radical word through a collateral ſeries of Parallel Ramifications. The Philologiſt ſtill toils with hopeleſs inveſtigation, and finds himſelf bewil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in the maze of petty Familiarity and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled in Colloquial Barbariſms. The Ebullitions of Convivial or Epiſtolary Humour, and the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies of Dramatick Hilarity, the Lucubrations of
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:0587000702:99"/>
the Periodical Eſſayiſt, the Sportive Vein and Dry Intelligence of our Diurnal, Nocturnal, and Heb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domadal Hiſtorians, are almoſt totally unintelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible for want of an adequate interpretation. To remedy this defect in Engliſh Literature, I have, with infinite labour, compiled a Vocabulary or Gloſſary, intended as a Supplement to a larger and more ſolemn Dictionary. It is eaſy to foreſee that the idle and illiterate will complain that I have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed their labours by endeavouring to diminiſh them, and that I have explained what is more eaſy by what is more difficult—<hi>Ignotum per igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius.</hi> I expect, on the other hand, the liberal ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments of the learned. He who is buried in Sholaſtick Retirement, ſecluded from the aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies of the Gay, and remote from the circles of the Polite, will at once comprehend the definitions, and be grateful for ſuch a ſeaſonable and neceſſary Elucidation of his Mother Tongue. Annexed to this letter is a ſhort ſpecimen of the Work, thrown together in a vague and deſultory manner, not even adhering to alphabetical concatenation. The whole will be compriſed in two Folio Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes, and will appear ſome time within the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing twenty years. In the mean while, ſubſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are taken in at all the moſt eminent book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellers

Had his inclination led him to have mixed with the faſhionable world (where he was warmly invited) and had he been a nearer inſpector of the follies, and vices of high life, he would certainly have been called by the election of the beſt criticks to the Poetical Chair, where Pope ſat without a ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val till his death; and then the Laurel, like the kingdom of Macedonia, at the death of Alexander, was divided among many. It muſt be owned that Dr. Johnſon's two Satires in imitation of Juvenal, are among the beſt titles that have been produced for the poetical inheritance.</p>
            <p>Indeed his morals and manners are ſo ill ſuited with looſe opinions, and thoughtleſs diſſipation, that it is no wonder he was ſoon diſguſted with what he ſaw and heard, and which he ſo well painted and felt in his LONDON.—His ſecond Satire (the tenth of Juvenal) though written with great force and energy, yet ſeems more the fruit of ſtudy than obſervation. His ſagacity is wonderful: though <hi>near-ſighted,</hi> he can diſcover and deſcribe with great humour the nice diſcriminations, and almoſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perceptible touches of the various characters of both ſexes: his "<hi>mind's</hi> eye" has a keenneſs and certainty that ſeldom miſſes the mark; and did his pen convey his diſcoveries in characteriſtick lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:0587000702:105"/>
he would be equal to the beſt writers—but <hi>here</hi> he fails.—In his <hi>Ramblers</hi> and <hi>Idlers,</hi> whenever he introduces characters, their actions, deportment, and thoughts, have a moſt accurate, and minute reſemblance to nature, but they all talk one lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, and that language is Dr. Johnſon's. Words are the vehicle of our thoughts, as coaches are of our perſons; <hi>the ſtate-equipage</hi> ſhould not be drawn forth but upon ſolemn occaſions. His peculiarity of diction has given the Publick a ſuſpicion that he could not ſucceed in Dramatick Compoſition. His Tragedy of <hi>Irene</hi> is a work of great and juſt ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent, of Poetical, though not Dramatick Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, fine imagery, and of the <hi>Osmagna Sonaturum</hi>; but the very ſoul of Tragedy, <hi>Pathos,</hi> is wanting; and without that, though we may admire, our hearts will ſleep in our boſoms.—Dr. Johnſon has wit, humour, and a ſtrong imagination, which are often exerted with great effect in converſation. I will give, in a few words, the beſt advice I can to young rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. Let them admire and ſtudy his Strength of Argument, Richneſs of Imagery, and Variety of Sentiment, without being dazzled with the ſplendor of his diction. Let them liſten with attention and delight to his entertaining and improving converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, without imitating his <hi>dreſs</hi> or <hi>manner!</hi>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IT is not unnatural to imagine that, on the firſt glance of your eye over the advertiſement of a new pamphlet, addreſſed to yourſelf, you are apt to feel ſome little emotion; that you beſtow more than ordinary attention on the title, as it ſtands in the news-paper, and take notice of the name of the publiſher.—Is it Compliment or Abuſe?—One of theſe being determined, you are perhaps eager to be ſatisfied, whether ſome coarſe hand has laid on en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comiums with a trowel, or ſome more elegant wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter (ſuch as the author of <hi>The Actor</hi> for inſtance) has done credit to himſelf and you by his panegy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick; or, on the other hand, whether any offended Genius has employed thoſe talents againſt you, which he is ambitious of exerciſing in the ſervice of your Theatre; or ſome common Scribe has taken your
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:0587000702:113"/>
character, as he would that of any other Man or Woman, or Miniſter, or the King, if he durſt, as a popular topick of ſcandal.</p>
            <p>Be not alarmed on the preſent occaſion; nor, with that conſciouſneſs of your own merit, ſo na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural to the Celebrated and Eminent, indulge your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in an acquieſcence with the juſtice of ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand fine things, which you may ſuppoſe ready to be ſaid to you. No private Satire or Panegyrick, but the general good of the Republick of Letters, and of the Drama in particular, is intended. Though Praiſe and Diſpraiſe ſtand ready on each ſide, like the veſſels of Good and Evil on the right and left hand of Jupiter, I do not mean to dip into either: or, if I do, it ſhall be, like the Pagan Godhead himſelf, to mingle a due proportion of each. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, perhaps, I may find fault, and ſometimes beſtow commendation: but you muſt not expect to hear of the Quickneſs of your Conception, the Juſtice of your Execution, the Expreſſion of your Eye, the Harmony of your Voice, or the Variety and Excellency of your Deportment; nor ſhall you be maliciouſly informed, that you are ſhorter than Barry, leaner than Quin, and leſs a favourite of the Upper Gallery than Woodward or Shuter.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:0587000702:114"/>The following pages are deſtined to contain a Vindication of the Works of Maſſinger, one of our Old Dramatick Writers, who very ſeldom falls much beneath Shakeſpeare himſelf, and ſometimes almoſt riſes to a proud rivalſhip of his chiefeſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies. They are meant too as a laudable, though faint, Attempt to reſcue theſe admirable Pieces from the too general neglect which they now labour under, and to recommend them to the Notice of the Publick. To whom then can ſuch an Eſſay be more properly inſcribed than to You, whom that Publick ſeems to have appointed, as its chief <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biter Deliciarum,</hi> to preſide over the Amuſements of the Theatre?—But there is alſo, by the bye, a private reaſon for addreſſing you. Your honeſt friend Davies, who, as is ſaid of the provident Comedians in Holland, ſpends his hours of vacation from the theatre in his ſhop, is too well acquainted with the Efficacy of your Name at the top of a Play-bill, to omit an opportunity of prefixing it to a new Publication, hoping it may prove a charm to draw in purchaſers, like the head of Shakeſpeare on his ſign. My Letter too being anonymous, your name at the head, will more than compenſate for the want of mine at the end of it: and our above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned friend is, no doubt, too well verſed in
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:0587000702:115"/>
both his occupations, not to know the conſequence of Secrecy in a Bookſeller, as well as the Neceſſity of concealing from the Publick many Things that paſs <hi>behind the Curtain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is perhaps no country in the world more ſubordinate to the power of faſhion than our own. Every Whim, every Word, every Vice, every Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, in its turn becomes the mode, and is followed with a certain rage of approbation for a time. The favourite ſtyle in all the polite Arts, and the reigning taſte in Letters, are as notoriouſly objects of caprice as Architecture and Dreſs. A new Poem, or Novel, or Farce, are as inconſiderately extolled or decried as a Ruff or a Chineſe Rail, a Hoop or a Bow Window. Hence it happens, that the publick taſte is often vitiated: or if, by chance, it has made a proper choice, becomes partially at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached to one Species of Excellence, and remains dead to the Senſe of all other Merit, however equal, or ſuperior.</p>
            <p>I think I may venture to aſſert, with a confidence, that on reflection it will appear to be true, that the eminent Claſs of Writers, who flouriſhed at the beginning of this century, have almoſt entirely ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſeded their illuſtrious Predeceſſors. The Works of Congreve, Vanbrugh, Steele, Addiſon, Pope,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:0587000702:116"/>
Swift, Gay, &amp;c. &amp;c. are the chief ſtudy of the Million: I ſay, of the Million; for as to thoſe few, who are not only familiar with all our own Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, but are alſo converſant with the Ancients, they are not to be circumſcribed by the narrow li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of the Faſhion. Shakeſpeare and Milton ſeem to ſtand alone, like firſt-rate Authors, amid the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral wreck of Old Engliſh Literature. Milton per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps owes much of his preſent fame to the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Labours and good Taſte of Addiſon. Shake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeare has been tranſmitted down to us with ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Glories; and you, Sir, have continued, or rather increaſed, his Reputation. You have, in no fulſome ſtrain of compliment, been ſtiled the Beſt Commentator on his Works: But have you not, like other Commentators, contracted a narrow, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive, Veneration of your Author? Has not the Contemplation of Shakeſpeare's Excellencies almoſt dazzled and extinguiſhed your Judgement, when directed to other objects, and made you blind to the Merit of his Cotemporaries? Under your dominion, have not Beaumont and Fletcher, nay even John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ſuffered a kind of Theatrical Diſgrace? And has not poor Maſſinger, whoſe cauſe I have now undertaken, been permitted to languiſh in Obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and remained almoſt entirely unknown?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="112" facs="tcp:0587000702:117"/>To this perhaps it may be plauſibly anſwered, nor indeed without ſome foundation, that many of our Old Plays, though they abound with Beauties, and are raiſed much above the humble level of later Writers, are yet, on ſeveral accounts, unfit to be exhibited on the modern Stage; that the Fable, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of being raiſed on probable incidents in real Life, is generally built on ſome foreign Novel, and attended with Romantick Circumſtances; that the Conduct of theſe Extravagant Stories is frequently uncouth, and infinitely offenſive to that Dramatick correctneſs preſcribed by late Criticks, and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed, as they pretend, by the French Writers; and that the Characters, exhibited in our Old Plays, can have no pleaſing effect on a modern Audience, as they are ſo totally different from the manners of the preſent age.</p>
            <p>Theſe, and ſuch as theſe, might once have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared reaſonable objections: but You, Sir, of all perſons, can urge them with the leaſt grace, ſince your Practice has ſo fully proved their inſufficiency. Your Experience muſt have taught you, that when a Piece has any ſtriking Beauties, they will cover a multitude of Inaccuracies; and that a Play need not be written on the ſevereſt plan, to pleaſe in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation. The mind is ſoon familiarized to Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regularities,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:0587000702:118"/>
which do not ſin againſt the Truth of Nature, but are merely Violations of that ſtrict De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corum of late ſo earneſtly inſiſted on. What patient Spectators are we of the Inconſiſtencies that confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly prevail in our darling Shakeſpeare! What critical Catcall ever proclaimed the indecency of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troducing the Stocks in the Tragedy of Lear? How quietly do we ſee Gloſter take his imaginary Leap from Dover Cliff! Or to give a ſtronger inſtance of Patience, with what a Philoſophical Calmneſs do the audience doſe over the tedious, and unintereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Love-Scenes, with which the bungling hand of Tate has coarſely pieced and patched that rich Work of Shakeſpeare!—To inſtance further from Shakeſpeare himſelf, the Grave-diggers in Hamlet (not to mention Polonius) are not only endured, but applauded; the very Nurſe in Romeo and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liet is allowed to be Nature; the Tranſactions of a whole Hiſtory are, without offence, begun and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated in leſs than three hours; and we are agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably wafted by the <hi>Chorus,</hi> or oftener without ſo much ceremony, from one end of the world to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.</p>
            <p>It is very true, that it was the general Practice of our old Writers, to found their Pieces on ſome fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Novel; and it ſeemed to be their chief aim to
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:0587000702:119"/>
take the ſtory, as it ſtood, with all its appendant incidents of every complection, and throw it into Scenes. This method was, to be ſure, rather inar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial, as it at once overloaded and embarraſſed the Fable, leaving it deſtitute of that beautiful Drama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Connection, which enables the mind to take in all its Circumſtances with Facility and Delight. But I am ſtill in doubt, whether many Writers, who come nearer to our own times, have much mended the matter. What with their Plots, and Double-Plots, and Counter-Plots, and Under-Plots, the Mind is as much perplexed to piece out the ſtory, as to put to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether the disjointed Parts of our Ancient Drama. The Comedies of Congreve have, in my mind, as little to boaſt of accuracy in their conſtruction, as the Plays of Shakeſpeare; nay, perhaps, it might be proved that, amidſt the moſt open violation of the leſſer critical Unities, one Point is more ſteadily purſued, one Character more uniformly ſhewn, and one grand Purpoſe of the Fable more evidently ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed in the productions of Shakeſpeare than of Congreve.</p>
            <p>Theſe Fables (it may be further objected) founded on romantick Novels, are unpardonably wild and extravagant in their Circumſtances, and exhibit too little even of the Manners of the Age in which they
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:0587000702:120"/>
were written. The Plays too are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves a kind of heterogeneous compoſition; ſcarce any of them being, ſtrictly ſpeaking, a Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy, Comedy, or even Tragi-Comedy, but rather an indigeſted jumble of every ſpecies thrown together.</p>
            <p>This charge muſt be confeſſed to be true: but upon examination it will, perhaps, be found of leſs conſequence than is generally imagined. Theſe Dramatick Tales, for ſo we may beſt ſtile ſuch Plays, have often occaſioned much pleaſure to the Reader and Spectator, which could not poſſibly have been conveyed to them by any other vehicle. Many an intereſting Story, which, from the diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of its circumſtances, cannot be regularly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced either to Tragedy or Comedy, yet abounds with Character, and contains ſeveral affecting ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations: and why ſuch a Story ſhould loſe its force, dramatically related and aſſiſted by repreſentation, when it pleaſes, under the colder form of a Novel, is difficult to conceive. Experience has proved the effect of ſuch fictions on our minds; and convinced us, that the Theatre is not that barren ground, wherein the Plants of Imagination will not flouriſh. The Tempeſt, The Midſummer Night's Dream, The Merchant of Venice, As you like it, Twelfth

Night, The Faithful Shepherdeſs of Fletcher, (with a much longer liſt that might be added from Shakeſpeare, Beaumont and Fletcher, and their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporaries, or immediate ſucceſſors) have moſt of them, within all our memories, been ranked among the moſt popular Entertainments of the Stage. Yet none of theſe can be denominated Tragedy, Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, or Tragi-Comedy. The Play Bills, I have obſerved, cautiouſly ſtile them Plays: and Plays indeed they are, truly ſuch, if it be the end of Plays to delight and inſtruct, to captivate at once the Ear, the Eye, and the Mind, by Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions forcibly conceived, and Characters truly delineated.</p>
            <p>There is one circumſtance in Dramatick Poetry, which, I think, the chaſtiſed notions of our modern Criticks do not permit them ſufficiently to conſider. Dramatick Nature is of a more large and liberal quality than they are willing to allow. It does not conſiſt merely in the repreſentation of real Charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, Characters acknowledged to abound in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon life; but may be extended alſo to the exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of imaginary Beings. To create, is to be a Poet indeed; to draw down Beings from another ſphere, and endue them with ſuitable Paſſions, Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, Diſpoſitions, allotting them at the ſame
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:0587000702:122"/>
time proper employment; <q rend="inline">"to body forth, by the Powers of Imagination, the forms of things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, and to give to airy Nothing a local Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and a Name,"</q> ſurely requires a Genius for the Drama equal, if not ſuperior, to the delineation of perſonages, in the ordinary courſe of Nature. Shakeſpeare, in particular, is univerſally acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged never to have ſoared ſo far above the reach of all other writers, as in thoſe inſtances, where he ſeems purpoſely to have tranſgreſſed the Laws of Criticiſm. <q rend="inline">"He appears to have diſdained to put his Free Soul into circumſcription and confine,"</q> which denied his extraordinary talents their full play, nor gave ſcope to the Boundleſneſs of his Imagination. His Witches, Ghoſts, Fairies, and other Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Beings, ſcattered through his plays, are ſo many glaring violations of the common table of Dramatick Laws. What then ſhall we ſay? Shall we confeſs their Force and Power over the Soul, ſhall we allow them to be Beauties of the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite kind, and yet inſiſt on their being expunged? And why? except it be to reduce the Flights of an exalted Genius, by fixing the Standard of Excellence on the practice of Inferior Writers, who wanted parts to execute ſuch great deſigns; or to accommodate
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:0587000702:123"/>
them to the narrow ideas of ſmall Criticks, who want ſouls large enough to comprehend them?</p>
            <p>Our Old Writers thought no perſonage whatever, unworthy a place in the Drama, to which they could annex what may be called a <hi>Seity</hi>; that is, to which they could allot Manners and Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment peculiar to itſelf. The ſevereſt of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients cannot be more eminent for the conſtant Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of Uniformity of Character, than Shake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeare; and Shakeſpeare, in no inſtance, ſupport his Characters with more exactneſs, than in the conduct of his Ideal Beings. The Ghoſt in Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let is a ſhining proof of this excellence.</p>
            <p>But, in conſequence of the cuſtom of tracing the Events of a Play minutely from a Novel, the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors were ſometimes led to repreſent a mere human creature in circumſtances not quite conſonant to Nature, of a diſpoſition rather wild and extravagant, and in both caſes more eſpecially repugnant to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern ideas. This indeed required particular indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence from the ſpectator, but it was an indulgence, which ſeldom miſſed of being amply repaid. Let the writer but once be allowed, as a neceſſary <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> the poſſibility of any Character's being placed
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:0587000702:124"/>
in ſuch a ſituation, or poſſeſt of ſo peculiar a turn of mind, the behaviour of the Character is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly natural. Shakeſpeare, though the Child of Fancy, ſeldom or never dreſt up a common mortal in any other than the modeſt dreſs of Nature: But many ſhining Characters in the Plays of Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont and Fletcher are not ſo well grounded on the Principles of the human Heart; and yet, as they were ſupported by Spirit, they were received with Applauſe. <hi>Shylock</hi>'s Contract, with the Penalty of the Pound of Fleſh, though not Shakeſpeare's own fiction, is perhaps rather improbable; at leaſt it would not be regarded as a happy Dramatick Inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in a modern Play; and yet, having once taken it for granted, how beautifully, nay, how naturally, is the Character ſuſtained!—Even this objection therefore, of a deviation from Nature, great as it may ſeem, will be found a plea inſufficient to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe the total excluſion of our antient Dramatiſts from the Theatre. Shakeſpeare, you will readily allow, poſſeſt Beauties more than neceſſary to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem his Faults; Beauties, that excite our admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and obliterate his errors. True, but did no portion of that Divine Spirit fall to the ſhare of our other old Writers? And can their works be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:0587000702:125"/>
or concealed, without injuſtice to their merit?</p>
            <p>One of the beſt and moſt pleaſing Plays in Maſſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and which, we are told, was originally received with general approbation, is called, <hi>The Picture.</hi> The fiction, whence it takes its title, and on which the ſtory of the Play is grounded, may be collected from the following ſhort ſcene. Mathias, a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of Bohemia, having taken an affecting leave of his wife Sophia, with a reſolution of ſerving in the King of Hungary's army againſt the Turks, is left alone on the ſtage, and the play goes on, as follows:</p>

<pb n="124" facs="tcp:0587000702:129"/>
as a volunteer in the Hungarian army againſt the Turks. A complete victory being obtained, chiefly by means of his valour, he is brought by the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral to the Hungarian court, where he not only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives many honours from the King, but captivates the heart of the Queen; whoſe paſſion is not ſo much excited by his known valour, or perſonal at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractions, as by his avowed conſtancy to his wife, and his firm aſſurance of her reciprocal affection and fidelity to him. Theſe circumſtances touch the pride, and raiſe the envy of the Queen. She re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves therefore to deſtroy his conjugal faith by giving up her own, and determines to make him a deſperate offer of her perſon; and, at the ſame time under pretence of notice of Mathias's being detained for a month at Court, ſhe diſpatches two young noblemen to tempt the virtue of Sophia.

            <p>The ſeveral paſſages will, I hope, be thought by the judicious Reader to be written in the free vein of a true Poet, as well as by the exact hand of a faithful Diſciple of Nature. If any of the above arguments, or, rather, the uncommon excellence of the great Writers themſelves, can induce the Critick to allow the Excurſions of Fancy on the Theatre, let him not ſuppoſe that he is here adviſed to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the Perverſion of Nature, or to admire thoſe who over-leap the modeſt bounds, which ſhe has pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to the Drama. I will agree with him, that Plays, wherein the truth of Dramatick Character
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:0587000702:136"/>
is violated, can convey neither Inſtruction nor De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light. Shakeſpeare, Jonſon, Beaumont and Fletcher, Maſſinger, &amp;c. are guilty of no ſuch violation. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the heroick nonſenſe, which overruns the Theatrical Productions of Dryden<note n="*" place="bottom">Nobody can have a truer veneration for the Poetical Genius of <hi>Dryden,</hi> than the Writer of theſe Reflections; but ſurely that Genius is no where ſo much obſcured, notwithſtanding ſome tranſient gleams, as in his Plays; of which he had himſelf no great opinion, ſince the only plea he ever urged in their favour, was, that the town had ever received with applauſe Plays <hi>equally bad.</hi> Nothing, perhaps, but the notion of Heroick Plays, could have carried the immediate ſucceſſors to the Old Claſs of Writers into ſuch ridiculous contradictions to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.

               </note>, Howard, and the other illuſtrious Prototypes of Bayes in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſal, muſt nauſeate the moſt indulgent ſpectator. The temporary rage of falſe taſte may perhaps betray the injudicious into a fooliſh admiration of ſuch extravagance for a ſhort period: But how will theſe Plays ſtand the blunt of critical indignation, when the perſonages of the Drama are found to reſemble no character in nature, except, perhaps, the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered inhabitants of Bedlam?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="132" facs="tcp:0587000702:137"/>If then it muſt be confeſſed, both from reaſon and experience, that we cannot only endure, but attend with pleaſure to Plays, which are almoſt merely Dramatick Repreſentations of romantick Novels; it will ſurely be a further inducement to recur to the works of our Old Writers, when we find among them many pieces written on a ſeverer plan; a plan more accommodated to real life, and approaching more nearly to the modern uſage. The Merry Wives of Windſor, of Shakeſpeare; the Fox, the Alchymiſt, the Silent Woman, Every Man in his Humour, of Jonſon; the New Way to pay Old Debts, the City Madam, of Maſſinger, &amp;c. &amp;c. all urge their claim for a rank in the ordinary courſe of our Winter-Evening Entertainments, not only clear of every objection made to the above-mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſpecies of Dramatick Compoſition, but adhering more ſtrictly to ancient rules, than moſt of our later comedies.</p>
            <p>In point of character (perhaps the moſt eſſential part of the Drama) our Old Writers far tranſcend the Moderns. It is ſurely needleſs, in ſupport of this opinion, to recite a long liſt of names, when the memory of every reader muſt ſuggeſt them to himſelf. The manners of many of them, it is true,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:0587000702:138"/>
do not prevail at preſent. What then? Is it diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing or uninſtructive to ſee the manners of a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer age paſs in review before us? Or is the mind undelighted at recalling the Characters of our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors, while the eye is confeſſedly gratified at the ſight of the Actors dreſt in their Antique Habits? Moreover, Faſhion and Cuſtom are ſo perpetually fluctuating, that it muſt be a very accurate piece in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and one quite new and warm from the anvil, that catches the Damon or Cynthia of this minute. Some Plays of our lateſt and moſt faſhionable Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors are grown as obſolete in this particular, as thoſe of the firſt Writers; and it may with ſafety be affirmed, that Bobadil is not more remote from mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Character, than the ever-admired and every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where-to-be-met-with Lord Foppington. It may, alſo, be further conſidered, that moſt of the beſt Characters in our old Plays are not merely fugitive and temporary. They are not the ſudden growth of yeſterday or to-day, ſure of fading or withering to-morrow; but they were the delight of paſt ages, ſtill continue the admiration of the preſent, and (to uſe the language of true Poetry)<q>

               <pb n="134" facs="tcp:0587000702:139"/>There is one circumſtance peculiar to the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick Tales, and to many of the more regular Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies of our Old Writers, of which it is too little to ſay, that it demands no apology. It deſerves the higheſt commendation; ſince it hath been the means of introducing the moſt capital beauties into their compoſitions, while the ſame ſpecies of excellence could not poſſibly enter into thoſe of a later period. I mean the poetical ſtile of their dialogue. Moſt nations, except our own, have imagined mere proſe, which, with Moliere's <hi>Bourgeois Gentilhomme,</hi> the meaneſt of us have talked from our cradle, too little elevated for the language of the Theatre. Our neighbours the French, at this day write moſt of their Plays, Comedies as well as Tragedies, in rhyme; a Gothick practice, which our own ſtage once admitted, but long ago wiſely rejected. The Grecian Iambick was more happily conceived in the true ſpirit of that elegant and magnificent ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, which characterized the taſte of that nation. Such a meaſure was well accommodated to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of the mind; and though it refined indeed on nature, it did not contradict it. In this, as well as in all other matters of literature, the uſage of Greece was religiouſly obſerved at Rome. Plautus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

in his richeſt vein of humour, is numerous and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etical. The Comedies of Terence, though we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not agree to read them after Biſhop Hare, were evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently not written without regard to meaſure; which is the invincible reaſon, why all attempts to render them into downright proſe have always proved, and ever muſt prove, unſucceſsful; and if a faint effort, now under contemplation, to give a verſion of them in familiar blank verſe (after the manner of our Old Writers, but without a ſervile imitation of them) ſhould fail, it muſt, I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, be owing to the lameneſs of the execution. The Engliſh heroick meaſure, or, as it is commonly called, blank verſe, is perhaps of a more happy conſtruction than even the Grecian Iambick; ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated equally, but approaching nearer to the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of nature, and as well adapted to the expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Comick Humour, as to the Pathos of Tragedy.</p>
            <p>The mere modern Critick, whoſe idea of blank verſe is perhaps attached to that empty ſwell of phraſeology, ſo frequent in our late Tragedies, may conſider theſe notions as the effect of bigotry to our old authors, rather than the reſult of impartial criticiſm. Let ſuch an one carefully read over the works of thoſe writers, for whom I am an advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate.
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:0587000702:141"/>
There he will ſeldom or ever find that tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of blank verſe, to which he has been ſo much accuſtomed. He will be ſurpriſed with a familiar dignity, which, though it riſes ſomewhat above or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary converſation, is rather an improvement than perverſion of it. He will ſoon be convinced that blank verſe is by no mens appropriated ſolely to the buſkin, but that the hand of a maſter may mould it to whatever purpoſes he pleaſes; and that in comedy it will not only admit humour, but heighten and embelliſh it. Inſtances might be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced without number. It muſt however be la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, that the modern Tragick Stile, free, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, from the mad flights of Dryden, and his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporaries, yet departs equally from nature. I am apt to think it is in great meaſure owing to the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt total excluſion of blank verſe from all modern compoſitions, Tragedy excepted. The common uſe of an elevated diction in comedy, where the writer was often, of neceſſity, put upon expreſſing the moſt ordinary matters, and where the ſubject demanded him to paint the moſt ridiculous emotions of the mind, was perhaps one of the chief cauſes of that <hi>eaſy vigour,</hi> ſo conſpicuous in the ſtyle of the old tragedies. Habituated to poetical dialogue in thoſe
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:0587000702:142"/>
compoſitions, wherein they were obliged to adhere more ſtrictly to the ſimplicity of the language of nature, the Poets learnt, in thoſe of a more raiſed ſpecies, not to depart from it too wantonly. They were well acquainted alſo with the force as well as elegance of their mother-tongue, and choſe to uſe ſuch words as may be called natives of the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, rather than to harmoniſe their verſes, and agoniſe the audience with Latin terminations. Whether the refined ſtyle of Addiſon's Cato, and the flowing verſification of Rowe, firſt occaſioned this departure from ancient ſimplicity, it is difficult to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine: But it is too true, that Southern was the laſt of our Dramatick Writers, who was, in any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, poſſeſt of that magnificent plainneſs, which is the genuine dreſs of nature; though indeed the plays even of Rowe are more ſimple in their ſtyle, than thoſe which have been produced by his ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors. It muſt not, however, be diſſembled in this place, that the ſtyle of our Old Writers is not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out faults; that they were apt to give too much into conceits; that they often purſued an allegorical train of thought too far; and were ſometimes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed into forced, unnatural, quaint, or gigantick expreſſions.

every one of theſe errors may be found; yet it may be ſafely aſſerted, that no other Author, antient or modern, has expreſſed himſelf on ſuch a variety of ſubjects with more eaſe, and in a vein more truly poetical, unleſs, perhaps, we ſhould except Homer: Of which, by the bye, the deepeſt Critick, moſt converſant with idioms and dialects, is not quite a competent judge.</p>
            <p>I would not be underſtood, by what I have here ſaid of Poetical Dialogue, to object to the uſe of Proſe, or to inſinuate that our modern Comedies are the worſe for being written in that ſtyle. It is enough for me, to have vindicated the uſe of a more elevated manner among our Old Writers. I am well aware that moſt parts of Falſtaff, Ford, Benedick, Malvolio, &amp;c. are written in proſe; nor indeed would I counſel a modern Writer to attempt the uſe of Poetical Dialogue in a mere Comedy: A Dramatick Tale, indeed, chequered, like life it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, with various incidents, ludicrous and affecting, if written by a maſterly hand, and ſomewhat more ſeverely than thoſe abovementioned, would, I doubt not, ſtill be received with candour and applauſe. The Publick would be agreeably ſurpriſed with the revival of Poetry on the Theatre, and the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:0587000702:144"/>
of employing all the beſt performers, ſerious as well as comick, in one piece, would render it ſtill more likely to make a favourable impreſſion on the audience. There is a gentleman, not unequal to ſuch a taſk, who was once tempted to begin a piece of this ſort; but, I fear, he has too much love of eaſe and indolence, and too little ambition of literary fame, ever to complete it.</p>
            <p>But to conclude:</p>
            <p>Have I, Sir, been waſting all this ink and time in vain? Or may it be hoped that you will extend ſome of that care to the reſt of our Old Authors, which you have ſo long beſtowed on Shakeſpeare, and which you have ſo often laviſhed on many a worſe Writer, than the moſt inferior of thoſe here recommended to you? It is certainly your intereſt to give variety to the Publick Taſte, and to diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſify the colour of our Dramatick Entertainments. Encourage new attempts; but do juſtice to the old! The Theatre is a wide field. Let not one or two walks of it alone be beaten, but lay open the whole to the Excurſions of Genius! This, perhaps, might kindle a ſpirit of originality in our modern Writers for the Stage; who might be tempted to aim at more novelty in their compoſitions, when the liberality of the popular taſte rendered it leſs
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:0587000702:145"/>
hazardous. That the narrowneſs of Theatrical Criticiſm might be enlarged, I have no doubt. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect, for a moment, on the uncommon ſucceſs of Romeo and Juliet, and Every Man in his Humour! and then tell me, whether there are not many other Pieces of as antient a date, which, with the like proper curtailments and alterations, would produce the ſame effect? Has an induſtrious hand been at the pains to ſcratch up the dunghill of Dryden's Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phitryon for the few pearls that are buried in it, and ſhall the rich treaſures of Beaumont and Fletcher, Jonſon and Maſſinger, lie (as it were) in the ore, untouched and diſregarded? Reform your Liſt of Plays! In the name of Burbage, Taylor, and Bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terton, I conjure you to it! Let the veteran Criticks once more have the ſatisfaction of ſeeing The Maid's Tragedy, Philaſter, King and no King, &amp;c. on the Stage!—Reſtore Fletcher's Elder Brother to the rank unjuſtly uſurped by Cibber's Love Makes a Man! and ſince you have wiſely deſiſted from giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an annual affront to the City by acting The London Cuckolds on Lord-Mayor's Day, why will you not pay them a compliment, by exhibiting The City Madam of Maſſinger on the ſame occaſion?</p>
            <p>If after all, ſir, theſe remonſtances ſhould prove without effect, and the merit of theſe great Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:0587000702:146"/>
ſhould plead with you in vain, I will here fairly turn my back upon you, and addreſs myſelf to the Lovers of Dramatick Compoſitions in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral. They, I am ſure, will peruſe thoſe Works with pleaſure in the cloſet, though they loſe the ſatisfaction of ſeeing them repreſented on the ſtage: Nay, ſhould they, together with you, concur in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining that ſuch Pieces are unfit to be acted, you, as well as they, will, I am confident, agree, that ſuch Pieces are, at leaſt, very worthy to be read. There are many modern Compoſitions, ſeen with delight at the Theatre, which ſicken on the taſte in the peruſal; and the honeſt Country Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who has not been preſent at the repreſentation, wonders with what his London friends have been ſo highly entertained, and is as much perplexed at the Town-manner of writing as Mr. Smith in The Rehearſal. The Excellencies of our Old Writers are, on the contrary, not confined to Time and Place, but always bear about them the Evidences of true Genius.</p>
            <p>Maſſinger is perhaps the leaſt known, but not the leaſt meritorious of any of the old claſs of Writers. His Works declare him to be no mean proficient in the ſame ſchool. He poſſeſſes all the beauties and
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:0587000702:147"/>
blemiſhes common to the Writers of that age. He has, like the reſt of them, in compliance with the Cuſtom of the Times, admitted Scenes of a low and groſs nature, which might be omitted with no more prejudice to the Fable, than the Buffoonry in Venice Preſerved. For his few faults he makes ample atonement. His Fables, are, moſt of them af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting; his Characters well conceived, and ſtrongly ſupported; and his Diction, flowing, various, ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant, and manly. His two Plays, revived by Bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terton, The Bondman, and the Roman Actor, are not, I think, among the number of the beſt. The Duke of Milan, The Renegado, The Picture, The Fatal Dowry, The Maid of Honour, A New Way to pay Old Debts, The Unnatural Combat, The Guardian, The City Madam, are each of them, in my mind, more excellent. He was a very popular Writer in his own times, but ſo unaccountably, as well as unjuſtly, neglected at preſent, that the accurate Compilers of a Work, called, The Lives of the Poets, publiſhed under the learned name of the late Mr. Theophilus Cibber, have not ſo much as mentioned him. He is, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, take him for all in all, an Author, whoſe Works the intelligent Reader will peruſe with Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration: And that I may not be ſuppoſed to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw

my plea for his admiſſion to the modern Stage, I ſhall conclude theſe Reflections with one more Specimen of his Abilities; ſubmitting it to all Judges of Theatrical Exhibitions, whether the moſt maſterly Actor would not here have an opportunity of diſplaying his Powers to Advantage.</p>
            <p>The Extract I mean to ſubjoin is from the laſt ſcene of the firſt act of The Duke of Milan.—Sforſa, having eſpouſed the cauſe of the King of France againſt the Emperor, on the King's defeat, is adviſed by a friend, to yield himſelf up to the Emperor's diſcretion.

               <pb facs="tcp:0587000702:155"/>PREFACE TO THE WORKS OF BEAUMONT AND FLETCHER.</head>
            <p>CONSIDERING the acknowledged excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of our Authors, loudly acknowledged by the moſt eminent of their contemporaries and ſucceſſors, it appears at firſt ſight rather wonderful, that in the ſpace of a hundred and fifty years, which have elapſed ſince the death of theſe Poets, no more than three complete editions of their Works have been publiſhed; we ſay three, becauſe the firſt folio profeſſedly included no more of their Plays, than thoſe which had not before been ſingly printed in quarto.</p>
            <p>To what cauſes are we to attribute this amazing diſparity between the reputation of the Writers, and the publick demand for their productions? Are libraries furniſhed with books, as apartments with furniture, according to the faſhion? or is it neceſſary, becauſe plays were originally written to
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:0587000702:156"/>
be acted, that they muſt continue to be perpetually repreſented, or ceaſe to be read?</p>
            <p>Truth, we fear, obliges us to confeſs that theſe queſtions muſt, without much qualification, be anſwered in the affirmative. Shakeſpeare, admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as he is, certainly owes ſome part of his preſent popularity, and the extraordinary preference given to his plays beyond thoſe of all our other dramatiſts, to the mode adopted by the literary world to extol him. By the changes of faſhion, Nature and right reaſon ſometimes come into vogue; but the multitude take them, like coin, becauſe they are in currency, while men of ſenſe and letters alone appreciate them according to their intrinſick value, and receive merit, wherever they find it, as bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, though it has not the ſtamp of faſhion im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed on it. To ſuch men, the genius of Shake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeare, inſtead of obſcuring, illuſtrates the kindred talents of Beaumont and Fletcher: Yet ſuch men are but rare; and one of the moſt acute and learned editors of Shakeſpeare ſpeaking of his own notes <q rend="inline">"concerned in a critical explanation of the author's beauties and defects; but chiefly of his beauties, whether in ſtile, thought, ſentiment,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:0587000702:157"/>
character, or compoſition,"</q> adds, that <q rend="inline">"the publick judgment hath leſs need to be aſſiſted in what it ſhall <hi>reject,</hi> than in what it ought to PRIZE: Nor is the value they ſet upon a work, a certain proof that they underſtand it. <hi>For it is ever ſeen,</hi> THAT HALF A DOZEN VOICES OF CREDIT GIVE THE LEAD, <hi>and if the public chance to be in good humour, or the author much in their favour,</hi> THE PEOPLE ARE SURE TO FOLLOW."</q>
            </p>
            <p>To the popularity of a Dramatick Writer, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more immediately contributes than the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quency of theatrical repreſentation. Common readers, like barren ſpectators, know little more of an author than what the actor, not always his happieſt commentator, preſents to them. Mutila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Shakeſpeare have been recited, and even quoted, as his genuine text; and many of his dramas, not in the courſe of exhibition, are by the multitude not honoured with a peruſal. On the ſtage, indeed, our Authors formerly took the lead, Dryden having informed us, that in his day two of their plays were performed to one of Shakeſpeare. The ſtage, however, owes its attrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the actor as well as author; and if the able performer will not contribute to give a poliſh and
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:0587000702:158"/>
brilliancy to the work, it will lie, like the rough diamond, obſcured and diſregarded. The artiſts of former days worked the rich mine of Beaumont and Fletcher; and Betterton, the Roſcius of his age, enriched his catalogue of characters from their Dramas, as well as thoſe of Shakeſpeare. Unfortunately for our Authors, the Roſcius of our day confined his round of characters in old plays, too cloſely to Shakeſpeare. We may almoſt ſay of him indeed, in this reſpect, as Dryden ſays of Shakeſpeare's ſcenes of magick,
<q>
                  <l>Within that circle none durſt walk but he;</l>
               </q>
but ſurely we muſt lament, that thoſe extraordinary powers, which have ſo ſucceſsfully been exerted in the illuſtration of Shakeſpeare, and ſometimes proſtituted to the ſupport of the meaneſt writers, ſhould not more frequently have been employed to throw a light upon Beaumont and Fletcher. Their Plays, we will be bold to ſay, have the ſame excellencies, as well as the ſame defects, each perhaps in an inferior degree, with the Dramas of their great maſter. Like his, they are built on hiſtories or novels, purſuing in the ſame manner the ſtory through its various circumſtances; like his, but not always with equal truth and nature, their characters are boldly drawn and warmly
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:0587000702:159"/>
coloured; like his, their dialogue, containing every beauty of ſtyle, and licentiouſneſs of conſtruction, is thick ſown with moral ſentiments, interchanged with ludicrous and ſerious, ribaldry and ſublime, and ſometimes enlivened with wit in a richer vein than even the immortal dramas of Shakeſpeare. In Comedy, the criticks of their own days, and thoſe immediately ſucceeding, gave Beaumont and Fletcher the preference to Shakeſpeare; and although the ſlow award of time has at length juſtly decreed the ſuperior excellence of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious father of our drama beyond all further ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal, yet theſe his illuſtrious followers ought not ſurely to be caſt ſo far behind him, as to fall into contemptuous neglect, while the moſt careleſs works of Shakeſpeare are ſtudiouſly brought forward. The Maid's Tragedy, King and No King, Love's Pilgrimage, Monſieur Thomas, <hi>&amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</hi> would hardly diſgrace that ſtage which has exhibited The Two Gentlemen of Verona.</p>
            <p>Mr. Seward has employed great part of his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face in citing ſimilar paſſages from Shakeſpeare and our Authors, and though we do not entirely agree with him in the compariſons he has drawn, we cannot reſiſt the temptation of adducing one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:0587000702:160"/>
in our opinion, more to the advantage of our Authors than any mentioned in that Preface. It is the entire character of the boy HENGO, in the Tragedy of Bonduca; a character whch is, we think (taken altogether) better ſuſtained, and more beautifully natural and pathetick, than the Prince Arthur of Shakeſpeare. The ſcene in King John between Arthur and Hubert, excellent as it is, almoſt paſſes the bounds of pity and terror, and becomes horrible; beſides which, Shakeſpeare, to whom <q rend="inline">"a quibble,"</q> as Dr. Johnſon ſays, <q rend="inline">"was the fatal Cleopatra for which he loſt the world, and was content to loſe it,"</q> has enervated the dialogue with many frigid conceits, which he has, with more than uſual impropriety, put into the mouth of the innocent Arthur, while he is pleading moſt affectingly for mercy.</p>

            </p>
            <p>The Reader, we imagine, will concur in our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>approbation of the paſſages printed in Italicks. Between Caratach and Hengo we do not remember that a line occurs, affected or unnatural; and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be more exquiſitely tender than the ſeveral ſcenes between them. The whole play abounds with Dramatick and Poetick Excellence.</p>
            <p>Allowing, however, freely allowing, the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral ſuperiority of Shakeſpeare to Beaumont and Fletcher (and indeed to all other poets, Homer per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps only excepted) yet we cannot ſo far degrade our Authors, as to reduce the moſt excellent of their pieces to a level with the meaneſt effuſions of Shakeſpeare; nor can we believe that there are not many of their long-neglected Dramas that might not, with very inconſiderable variations, be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated to the taſte of a modern audience. The
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:0587000702:163"/>
Publick have been long habituated to the phraſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ology of Shakeſpeare, whoſe language, in the opinion of Dryden, is a little obſolete in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of that of our Authors; and irregularities of fable have been not only pardoned, but defended. When the great Engliſh Actor, of whom we have been ſpeaking, firſt undertook the direction of the ſtage, his friend (the preſent Laureat) boldly told him,
<q>
                  <l>A nation's taſte depends on you.</l>
               </q>
The national taſte, under his happy influence, acquired from day to day, from year to year, an encreaſed reliſh for Shakeſpeare; and it is almoſt matter of amazement, as well as concern, that ſo little of his attention was directed to thoſe Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick Writers, whoſe poetical character bore ſo great an affinity to the juſt object of his admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. A deceaſed actor, of great merit, and ſtill greater promiſe, very ſucceſsfully opened his the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atrical career by appearing in the tragedy of Philaſter. At the ſame time, the ſame tragedy contributed not a little to the growing fame of one of our principal actreſſes. That play, the Two Noble Kinſmen, and ſome other pieces of Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont and Fletcher, beſides thoſe we have already enumerated, would undoubtedly become favourite
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:0587000702:164"/>
entertainments for the ſtage, if the theatrical ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents of the performers bore any kind of propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the dramatick abilities of the writers. Since the directors of our theatres in ſome ſort hold the keys of the Temple of Dramatick Fame, let them do honour to themſelves by throwing open their doors to Beaumont and Fletcher! Seeing there are at preſent but ſmall hopes of emulating the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent actor, who ſo long and ſo effectually im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed on our minds the excellence of Shake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeare, let them at leaſt reſcue their performers from an immediate compariſon, ſo much to their diſadvantage, by trying their force on the charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of our Authors! The Two Noble Kinſmen indeed, has been aſcribed (falſely, as we think) to Shakeſpeare. <q rend="inline">"The Two Noble Kinſmen, (ſays Pope) if that play be his, <hi>as there goes a tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> it was, and indeed <hi>it has little reſemblance of Fletcher,</hi> and more of our author, than ſome of thoſe which have been received as genuine."</q> Unhappy Poets! whoſe very excellence is turned againſt them. Shakeſpeare's claim to any ſhare in the Two Noble Kinſmen we have conſidered at the end of that piece, to which we refer the Reader. In this place we ſhall only enter our proteſt againſt
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:0587000702:165"/>
the authority of Pope, who appears to have felt himſelf mortified and aſhamed, when he, <q rend="inline">"diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged the dull duty of an Editor."</q> He ſurely muſt be allowed to diſcharge his duty with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctance, and moſt probably with neglect, who ſpeaks of it in ſuch terms. In his Preface indeed he has, with a moſt maſterly hand, drawn the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line of the poetical character of Shakeſpeare; but in that very Preface, by a ſtrange perverſion of taſte, he propoſes to throw out of the liſt of Shake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeare's plays The Winter's Tale, which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders as ſpurious! On no better foundation, we think, has he aſſerted, that the play of the Two Noble Kinſmen <hi>has little reſemblance of Fletcher.</hi> 
               <q rend="inline">"There goes a tradition,"</q> that <hi>Garth did not write his own Diſpenſary</hi>; <q rend="inline">"there goes a tradition,"</q> that the admirable tranſlator of Homer, like Shakeſpeare himſelf, had <hi>little Latin, and leſs Greek</hi>; but what candid critick would countenance ſuch a tradition? And is ſuch a vague, blind, playhouſe tradition a ſufficient warrant for one great poet to tear the laurel from the brows of another?</p>
            <p>The modern editors of Shakeſpeare contemplate with admiration that indifference to future fame, which ſuffered him to behold with uncommon

apathy ſome of his pieces incorrectly printed dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his life, without attempting to reſcue them from the hands of barbarous editors, or preparing for poſterity a genuine collection of his Works, ſuperviſed and corrected by himſelf.

               </note>. But, be that as it may, his ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed careleſſneſs concerning the fate of his pieces after they had been repreſented, is not ſo very ſingular; many of the plays of Beaumont and Fletcher alſo having been inaccurately printed from ſtolen copies during the lives of the Authors, and the remainder collected ſome years after their deaths, like the Works of Shakeſpeare, by the players. Ben Jonſon appears to have been the only
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:0587000702:167"/>
dramatick Poet of that age, who paid any attention to the publication of his own Compoſitions.</p>
            <p>The old quarto copies of Beaumont and Fletcher have come down to us exactly in the ſame ſtate with the old quartos of Shakeſpeare. The printers of thoſe times not only copied, but multiplied the errors of the tranſcriber. An Editor, nay even a corrector of the preſs, ſeems to have been a character of which they had not the ſmalleſt conception. Even the title-pages appear to exhibit the very names of the Authors at random, ſometimes announcing the play as the work of one Poet, ſometimes of another, and ſometimes as the joint production of both. A Bookſeller is ſomewhere introduced as reprehending <hi>the ſaving ways of an Ode-writer,</hi> who, he ſuppoſed, merely to lengthen his work, would often put no more than three or four words into a line. The old printers ſeem to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the ſame idea of the parſimony of Poets, and therefore often without ſcruple run verſe into proſe, not adverting to meaſure or harmony, but ſolely governed by the dimenſions of the page, whether divided into columns, or carried all acroſs from one ſcanty margin to another. Their orthography<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Their orthography,</hi> &amp;c.] To this article our anceſtors ſeem to have afforded very little attention: <hi>Ingenions</hi> for <hi>ingenuous, alter</hi> for <hi>altar, cozen</hi> for <hi>couſin, deſert</hi> for <hi>defart, talents</hi> for <hi>talons, then</hi> for <hi>than,</hi> &amp;c. &amp;c. continually occur in the old books. Nor does there ſeem to have been any greater regard paid to proper names; one of our Poets, for inſtance, we find called <hi>Fleatcher, Flecher,</hi> and <hi>Fletcher</hi>; and the other, <hi>Beamont, Beamount,</hi> and <hi>Beaumont.</hi> The name of <hi>Shakeſpeare</hi> is ſpelt at leaſt a dozen ways. We are told, in the firſt note on the Dunciad of <q rend="inline">"an <hi>autograph</hi> of <hi>Shakeſpeare</hi> himſelf, whereby it appeared that he ſpelt his own name without the firſt <hi>e.</hi>"</q> Yet even this <hi>auto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph</hi> is not deciſive. In the Regiſter-book at Stratford upon Avon, the name of the family is regularly entered <hi>Shakſpere.</hi> In the Poet's own will, which now lies in the Prerogative-Office, Doctor's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, his name is ſpelt THREE different ways. In the body of the will it is always written <hi>Shackſpere:</hi> This, however, may be aſcribed to the Lawyer. The will conſiſts of three ſheets, the firſt of which is legibly ſubſcribed <hi>Shackſpere</hi>; the two others <hi>Shakſpeare.</hi> It muſt be acknowledged that the hand-writing, as well as ſituation of the firſt ſignature, is different from that of the two following; but it appears extraordinary that a ſtranger ſhould attempt to falſify a ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nature, which is uſually aſcribed to each ſheet for the ſake of giving authenticity to ſo ſolemn an inſtrument, and is, therefore, always taken to be the hand-writing of the teſtator. Mr. Garrick, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, had in his poſſeſſion the leaſe of a houſe formerly ſituated in Black-Friars, and but lately taken down on account of the new bridge, which belonged to that Poet. As a party to that leaſe he ſigns his name <hi>Shakſpeare</hi>; and the firſt ſyllable of his name is now pronounced in his native county, Warwickſhire, with the ſhort <hi>a, Sh<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ak-</hi> and not <hi>Sh<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>akeſpeare.</hi> On the other hand, it muſt be confeſſed, that the dialect of that county is more provincial than claſſical, and we believe that all the families, who are now known by the Poet's name, both ſpell and pronounce it <hi>Sh<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>akeſpeare</hi>; which indeed ſeems moſt reconcilable to etimology, if etimology be at all concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in ſo capricious a circumſtance. Many of the quartos publiſhed in his life-time, not only followed this mode of ſpelling, but ſeemed nicely to mark the proper pronunciation, by printing his name in the title page with a <hi>Hyphen</hi> between the two ſyllables that compoſe it, thus, SHAKE-SPEARE. His cotemporary Jonſon, as well as Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton and Dryden his ſucceſſors, adhered to the ſame orthography. Every thing, however trivial, intereſts an Engliſh reader, from the relation it bears to that Great Poet; which is the only excuſe we have to offer for ſo long a note on a point of ſo little importance.</note> is
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:0587000702:168"/>
ſo generally vicious and unſettled, and their punc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation ſo totally defective, that the regulation of either rarely merits the triumphs that have ſo often been derived from it. On the whole, however, theſe old copies of our Poets may by an intelligent Reader be peruſed with ſatisfaction. The typo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphical errors are indeed groſs and numerous; but their very number and groſſneſs keeps the reader awake to the genuine text, and commonly

<pb n="165" facs="tcp:0587000702:169"/>
renders ſuch palpable inaccuracies not prejudicial. The genuine work of the Author is there extant, though the lines are often, like a confuſed multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, huddled on one another, and not marſhalled and arrayed by the diſcipline of a modern Editor.</p>
            <p>The Firſt Folio, containing thirty-four of our Author's pieces, never till then collected or printed, was publiſhed by the Players, obviouſly tranſcribed
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:0587000702:170"/>
from the prompter's books, commonly the moſt inaccurate and barbarous of all manuſcripts, or made out piecemeal from the detached parts copied for the uſe of the performers. Hence it happens, that the ſtage-direction has ſometimes crept into the text, and the name of the Actor is now and then ſubſtituted for that of the Character. The tranſcribers, knowing perhaps no Language per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly, corrupted all Languages; and vitiated the dialogue with falſe Latin, falſe French, falſe Italian, and falſe Spaniſh; nay, as Pope ſays of the old copies of Shakeſpeare, <q rend="inline">"their very Welch is falſe."</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Players, however, notwithſtanding the cenſure of Pope, <q rend="inline">"yet from Cibber ſore,"</q> ſeem to have been, at leaſt with regard to our Poets, as faithful and able editors as others of that period. It is moſt natural to ſuppoſe that the Playhouſe Manuſcript contained the real Work of the Author, though perhaps ignorantly copied, and accommodated to the uſe of the Theatre. A writer in his cloſet often ſilently acquieſces in the excellence of a continued Declamation; but if at any time the Audience, like Polonius, cry out <q rend="inline">"This is too long,"</q> ſuch paſſages are afterwards naturally curtailed or omitted in the repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:0587000702:171"/>
but the curious Reader, being leſs <hi>faſtidious</hi> 
               <q rend="inline">"than the <hi>proud</hi> Spectator"</q> (for in ſuch terms Horace ſpeaks of the Spectator) is pleaſed with the reſtoration of theſe paſſages in print. <q rend="inline">"Players, ſays Pope, "are juſt ſuch judges of what is <hi>right,</hi> as tailors are of what is <hi>graceful.</hi>"</q> The compariſon is more ludicrous and ſarcaſtick than it is juſt. The Poet himſelf, who makes the Cloaths, may rather be called the Tailor: Actors are at moſt but the empty beaux that wear them, and the Spectators cenſure or admire them. A Tailor, however, if players muſt be the Tailors, though not equal in ſcience to a Statuary or an Anatomiſt, muſt yet be conceived to have a more intimate knowledge of the human form than a Blackſmith or a Capenter; and if many of the actors know but little of the Drama, they would probably have known ſtill leſs of it, had they not been retainers to the ſtage. Some Improvements, as well as Corruptions of the Drama, may undoubtedly be derived from the Theatre. Cibber, <hi>idle</hi> Cibber, wrote for the ſtage with more ſucceſs than Pope. Aeſchylus, Sophocles, Plautus, and Terence, were ſoldiers and freedmen; Shakeſpeare and Moliere were Actors.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="168" facs="tcp:0587000702:172"/>The Second Folio contained the firſt complete collection of the Works of Beaumont and Fletcher. Concerning that edition we have nothing to add to what has been ſaid by other Editors.</p>
            <p>The Octavo Editors of 1711 ſeemed to aim at little more than reprinting our Authors' Plays, and giving a collection of them more portable and convenient than the Folios. Their text, however, is more corrupt than that of either the quartos or folios, the errors of which they religiouſly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, adding many vicious readings of their own, ſome of which have been combated in very long notes by their ſucceſſors.</p>
            <p>In the year 1742, Theobald, on the ſucceſs and reputation of his Shakeſpeare, projected an edition of the Works of Ben Jonſon. What he had executed of it, fell into the hands of Mr. Whalley, and is inſerted in that learned and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious gentleman's edition. At the ſame time he exhibited propoſals for a publication of the Plays of Beaumont and Fletcher; in which he was afterwards aſſiſted by Mr. Seward and Mr. Sympſon: but Theobald dying before he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted more than the firſt and about half the ſecond volume to the preſs, the undertaking was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued by the two laſt-mentioned gentlemen; and
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:0587000702:173"/>
the edition thus jointly, or rather ſeverally, exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted by Theobald, Mr. Seward, and Mr. Sympſon, at length appeared in the year 1750. Theſe gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen were the firſt Editors of our Poets who profeſſed to collate the old copies, to reform the punctuation, and to amend the corruptions of the text. Some attempts alſo were made to elucidate the obſcurities, and enforce the excellencies of their Authors. How far we diſagree or coincide with them will appear on inſpection of the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular paſſages to which their ſeveral obſervations refer. At preſent it will be ſufficient to declare, that we ſhould have been inclined to entertain a more reſpectful opinion of their labours, if they had not very early betrayed that confidence which every Reader is tempted to repoſe in an Editor, not only by their careleſſneſs, but by the more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonable faults of faithleſſneſs and miſrepreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Their reports of the ſtate of the old copies can never ſafely be taken on truſt, and on examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion many of thoſe copies will appear to be both negligently collated, and untruly quoted. Their punctuation alſo, notwithſtanding their occaſional ſelf-approbation, is almoſt as inaccurate as that of the moſt antient and rude editions; and their criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal remarks have, in our opinion, oftener been well
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:0587000702:174"/>
intended, than conceived. Their work, however, has in the main conduced to the illuſtration of our Authors, and we have ſeiſed every fair occaſion to applaud the diſplay of their diligence, as well as the efforts of their critical acuteneſs and ſagacity. Such of their notes as appeared inconteſtible, or even plauſible, we have adopted without remark; to thoſe more dubious we have ſubjoined additional annotations; thoſe of leſs conſequence we have abridged; and thoſe of no importance we have omitted.</p>
            <p>In the preſent Edition, it has been our chief aim to give the old text as it lies in the old books, with no other variations, but ſuch as the Writers themſelves, had they ſuperintended an impreſſion of their Works, or even a corrector of the preſs, would have made. Yet even theſe variations, if at all important, have not been made in ſilence. Notes, however, have been ſubjoined to the text as briefly and as ſparingly as poſſible; but the lapſe of time, and fluctuation of language, have rendered ſome Notes neceſſary for the purpoſe of explaining obſolete words, unuſual phraſes, old cuſtoms, and obſcure or diſtant alluſions. Critical remarks, and conjectural emendations, have been ſeldom hazard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, nor has any ridicule been wantonly thrown on
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:0587000702:175"/>
former Editors, who have only ſometimes been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended for pompous affectation, and more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently for want of care and fidelity. Every ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial comment on theſe Plays has been retained in this Edition, though often without the long and oſtentatious notes that firſt introduced thoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to the publick. At the ſame time, we have religiouſly attributed every obſervation, critical or philological, to its due author, not wiſhing to claim any praiſe as Editors, but by induſtriouſly endeavouring, as an act of duty, to collect from all quarters every thing that might contribute to il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrate the Works of Beaumont and Fletcher.</p>
            <p>To conclude, we have beheld with pity and indignation the mean parade of many modern Editors, and we have endeavoured to fulfil their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties without imbibing their arrogance. We are perhaps too proud to indulge ſo poor a vanity; at leaſt, we are too much occupied to litigate read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings we think of ſmall importance, and too honeſt to claim reſtorations not our own, or to propoſe readings as corrections that are no more than re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorations. The Stationer has not diſgraced our Authors with Tobacco-Paper; the Preſs, we truſt, has done its duty; and the Rolling-Preſs, at a very conſiderable expence, has added its
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:0587000702:176"/>
aſſiſtance. The Cuts, if we are not deceived, are for the moſt part happily deſigned, and well exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, and will probably be deemed an agreeable addition to the Work: at leaſt, we may with truth aſſert, that no authors in the Engliſh language, publiſhed at the ſame price, have ſo many and ſo valuable engravings.</p>
            <p>The province of a Painter and an Editor are directly oppoſite. In the firſt inſtance the canvas receives its chief value from the artiſt, and in the ſecond the artiſt derives almoſt all his conſequence from the canvas. The Editor, if he lives, is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried down the ſtream of time by his Author; and if the Author be excellent, and his commentary judicious,
<q>
                  <l>Still ſhall his little bark attendant ſail,</l>
                  <l>Purſue the triumph and partake the gale.</l>
               </q>
For our parts we have been incited to this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking from a real admiration of theſe Poets, grounded, as we apprehend, on their genuine ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies, and a thorough perſuaſion that the Works of Beaumont and Fletcher may proudly claim a ſecond place in the Engliſh Drama, nearer to the firſt than the third, to thoſe of Shakeſpeare; ſome of their Plays being ſo much in his manner, that they can ſcarcely be diſtinguſhed to be the work of another hand.</p>

               <pb facs="tcp:0587000702:178"/>APPENDIX TO THE SECOND EDITION OF THE TRANSLATION OF THE COMEDIES OF TERENCE.</head>
            <p>THE reverend and ingenious Mr. Farmer, in his curious and entertaining <hi>Eſſay on the Learning of Shakeſpeare,</hi> having done me the honour to animadvert on ſome paſſages in the preface to this tranſlation, I cannot diſmiſs this edition with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out declaring how far I coincide with that gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; although what I then threw out careleſsly on the ſubject of his pamphlet was merely inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental, nor did I mean to enter the liſts as a champion to defend either ſide of the queſtion.</p>
            <p>It is moſt true, as Mr. Farmer takes for granted, that I had never met with the old comedy called <hi>The Suppoſes,</hi> nor has it even yet fallen into my
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:0587000702:179"/>
hands; yet I am willing to grant, on Mr. Farmer's authority, that Shakeſpeare borrowed part of the plot of The Taming of the Shrew, from that old tranſlation of Arioſto's play, by George Gaſcoign, and had no obligations to Plautus. I will accede alſo to the truth of Dr. Johnſon's and Mr. Farmer's obſervation, that the line from Terence, exactly as it ſtands in Shakeſpeare, is extant in Lilly and Udall's <hi>Floures for Latin Speaking.</hi> Still, however, Shakeſpeare's total ignorance of the learned languages remains to be proved; for it muſt be granted, that ſuch books are put into the hands of thoſe who are learning thoſe languages, in which claſs we muſt neceſſarily rank Shakeſpeare, or he could not even have quoted Terence from Udall or Lilly; nor is it likely, that ſo rapid a genius ſhould not have made ſome further progreſs. <q rend="inline">"Our author (ſays Dr. Johnſon, as quoted by Mr. Farmer) had this line from Lilly; which I mention, that it may not be brought as an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his learning."</q> It is, however, an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that he read Lilly; and a few pages further it ſeems pretty certain, that the author of <hi>The Taming of the Shrew,</hi> had at leaſt read Ovid; from whoſe epiſtles we find theſe lines:
<q>
                  <pb n="175" facs="tcp:0587000702:180"/>
                  <l>Hàc ibat Simois; hic eſt Sigeia tellus;</l>
                  <l>Hic ſteterat Priami regia celſa ſenis.</l>
               </q>
And what does Dr. Johnſon ſay on this occaſion? Nothing. And what does Mr. Farmer ſay on this occaſion? Nothing.</p>
            <p>In Love's Labour's Loſt, which, bad as it is, is aſcribed by Dr. Johnſon himſelf to Shakeſpeare, there occurs the word <hi>thraſonical</hi>; another argument which ſeems to ſhew that he was not unacquainted with the comedies of Terence; not to mention, that the character of the Schoolmaſter in the ſame play could not poſſibly be written by a man who had tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled no further in Latin than <hi>hic, haec, hoc.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In Henry the Sixth we meet with a quotation from Virgil,
<q>
                  <l>Tantaene animis coeleſtibus irae?</l>
               </q>
But this, it ſeems, proves nothing, any more than the lines from Terence and Ovid, in the Taming of the Shrew; for Mr. Farmer looks on Shake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeare's property in the comedy to be extremely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putable; and he has no doubt but Henry the Sixth had the ſame author with Edward the Third, which hath been recovered to the world in Mr. Capell's Proluſions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="176" facs="tcp:0587000702:181"/>If any play in the collection bears internal evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of Shakeſpeare's hand, we may fairly give him <hi>Timon of Athens.</hi> In this play we have a fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar quotation from Horace,
<q>
                  <l>Ira furor brevis eſt.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>I will not maintain but this hemiſtich may be found in Lilly or Udall; or that it is not in the <hi>Palace of Pleaſure,</hi> or the <hi>Engliſh Plutarch</hi>; or that it was not originally foiſted in by the players: I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> ſtands, however, in the play of <hi>Timon of Athens.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The world in general, and thoſe who purpoſe to comment on Shakeſpeare in particular, will owe much to Mr. Farmer, whoſe reſearches into our old authors throw a luſtre on many paſſages, the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity of which muſt elſe have been impenetrable. No future Upton or Gildon will go further than North's tranſlation for Shakeſpeare's acquaintance with Plutarch, or balance between Dares Phrygius, and <hi>the Troye booke of Lydgate. The Hyſtorie of Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blet,</hi> in <hi>black letter,</hi> will for ever ſuperſede Saxo Grammaticus; tranſlated novels and ballads will, perhaps, be allowed the ſources of Romeo, Lear, and the Merchant of Venice; and Shakeſpeare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, however unlike Bayes in other particulars, will
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:0587000702:182"/>
ſtand convicted of having <hi>tranſverſed</hi> the proſe of Holingſhead; and at the ſame time, to prove <q rend="inline">"that his <hi>ſtudies</hi> lay in his own language,"</q> the tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Ovid are determined to be the production of Heywood.</p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"That his <hi>ſtudies</hi> were moſt demonſtratively confined to <hi>nature,</hi> and his <hi>own language,</hi>"</q> I readily allow: but does it hence follow that he was ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorably ignorant of every other tongue, living or dead, that he only <q rend="inline">"remembered, perhaps, enough of his <hi>ſchoolboy</hi> learning to put the <hi>hig, hag, hog,</hi> into the mouth of Sir H. Evans; and might pick up in the writers of the time, or the courſe of his converſation, a familiar phraſe or two of French or Italian?"</q> In Shakeſpeare's plays both theſe laſt languages are plentifully ſcattered: but then, we are told, they might be impertinent addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the players. Undoubtedly they might: but there they are, and, perhaps, few of the players had much more learning than Shakeſpeare.</p>
            <p>Mr. Farmer himſelf will allow that Shakeſpeare began to learn Latin: I will allow that his <hi>ſtudies</hi> lay in Engliſh: but why inſiſt that he neither made any progreſs at ſchool; nor improved his acquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions there? The general encomiums of Suckling,

            <p>THIS Appendix to the ſecond Edition of the tranſlation of Terence would not have had a place in this collection, if it had not repeatedly appeared among the numerous <hi>Prolegomena</hi> to the late <hi>Variorum</hi> Editions of Shakeſpeare, accompanied with Annotations which ſeem to require ſome notice.</p>
            <p>Mr. Steevens in a Preface ſubjoined to that of Dr. Johnſon having firſt declared that <q rend="inline">"the diſpute about the learning of Shakeſpeare is now finally ſettled,"</q> the reader is, at the cloſe of the copy of this Appendix, referred to Dr. Farmer's reply in a Note on Love's Labour's Loſt, Act II. Sc. ii. p. 435. Edit. of 1778.</p>
            <p>The Note in queſtion, according to the cuſtom of the Editors, is rather long; but I truſt I ſhall do no

                        <p>Dr. Warburton is certainly right in his ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition that <hi>Florio</hi> is meant by the character of <hi>Holofernes. Florio</hi> had given the firſt affront. <q rend="inline">"The plaies, ſays he, that they plaie in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, are neither <hi>right comedies,</hi> nor <hi>right tragedies</hi>; but repreſentations of <hi>hiſtories</hi> without any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corum."</q>—The ſcraps of Latin and Italian are tranſcribed from his works, particularly the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb about <hi>Venice,</hi> which has been corrupted ſo much. The <hi>affectation of the letter,</hi> which <hi>argues facilitie,</hi> is likewiſe a copy of his manner. We meet with much of it in the ſonnets to his patrons.</p>

I will only add that if Mr. Colman had previouſly looked at the panegyrick on <hi>Cartwright,</hi> he could not ſo ſtrangely have miſrepreſented my argument from it: but thus it muſt ever be with the moſt ingenious men, when they talk <hi>without book.</hi> Let me however take this opportunity of acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging the very genteel language which he has been pleaſed to uſe on this occaſion.</p>

For my own part, though I took no decided part in the queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I muſt confeſs that the wit and pleaſantry of the replies and annotations have not materially al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered my opinion, which the Editors would have more fairly ſubmitted to their readers, if Dr. Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer's reply had been given with the Appendix, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of being transferred to another volume, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſome part of his obſervations related to a character of the play contained in it. I muſt own too that I was rather ſurpriſed to ſee the Reverend Eſſayiſt, whoſe remarks I had treated ſo reſpectfully, making his reply as a flippant Annotator on another publication, and riſing from the bottom of the page of Love's Labour's Loſt, under the wing of that Editor, whom in the ſecond impreſſion of his Eſſay he had ſtyled <q rend="inline">"<hi>one of the firſt Criticks of the Age,</hi> who was pleaſed to declare on reading the former edition, that THE QUESTION IS <hi>now</hi> FOR EVER DECIDED!"</q> With what complacency theſe acute Criticks interchange flatteries and compliments, and how freely do they throw out cenſures and ſarcaſms

            <p>On reading the above note I confeſs that I did not think it neceſſary to conſult Towers's Panegy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick on Cartwright, taking it for granted, on the Eſſayiſt's note, that Towers had applied the line to the ſubject of his panegyrick, as Jonſon had done before him; and yet I cannot even after this frank conceſſion account for Dr. Farmer's triumph on ſo ſlight a miſapprehenſion, that does not at all affect the main queſtion, or eſtabliſh the authority of the various reading. The paſſage in the verſes
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:0587000702:190"/>
of Towers prefixed to the works of Cartwright printed in 1651, runs thus
<q>
                  <l>Thy ſkill in Wit was not ſo poorely meek,</l>
                  <l>As theirs whoſe LITTLE Latin and NO Greek;</l>
                  <l>Confin'd their whole diſcourſe to a ſtreet phraſe,</l>
                  <l>Such dialect as their next neighbours was.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>From this quotation it will not only appear that I have at length conſulted the panegyrick on Cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wright, but that when <hi>talking without book,</hi> I had <hi>not ſo ſtrangely miſrepreſented the Doctor's argument from it.</hi> His own note to the firſt edition of his Eſſay certainly tended to countenance the various reading of <q rend="inline">"<hi>ſmall</hi> Latin and <hi>no</hi> Greek,"</q> by the adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the line by Towers. His Comment on the Appendix implies, either from my wilfulneſs or careleſſneſs, <hi>a miſrepreſentation of his argument</hi>; but ſurely, whether Towers applied the diſputed line to Cartwright, or his ſuppoſed Rivals in the Drama, was of no real conſequence: though by the by his adoption contains more various readings than one; and yet the teſtimony of Ben Jonſon, on which I grounded my opinion, remains unimpeached. On the whole then have not the Criticks <hi>ſtrangely miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repreſented</hi> MY <hi>argument?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="186" facs="tcp:0587000702:191"/>I give due praiſe to the ingenious but <hi>anony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous</hi> Annotator in the laſt edition of Shakeſpeare, who has clearly proved that Dr. Farmer tranſcribed his alluſion to <hi>Pallas</hi> from Dr. Younge, and not from <hi>ſome one elſe.</hi> The thought is obvious, and might without improbability occur to different writers; but the ſimilarity of expreſſion, <q rend="inline">"<hi>at full growth and mature,</hi>"</q> proves beyond controverſy from whence, in the preſent inſtance, the alluſion was taken. But after all, what is that matter to the Learning of Shakeſpeare?</p>
            <p>On that subject I never engaged myſelf as a cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion on either ſide of the queſtion, but having been in ſome ſort forced into the diſpute, I cannot but ſeiſe every occaſion to applaud the ingenuity as well as indefatigable induſtry of the <hi>Variorum</hi> Editors, who in the ſame vein of argument may hereafter proceed to prove that Shakeſpeare could neither read nor write. The almoſt illegible plate, engraved after his hand-writing, will not, perhaps, convince every inſpector that the poet did not write his name as his cotemporaries on the ſtage have handed it down to us; though it differs not only from the recent orthography of the Editors, <q rend="inline">"thoſe new tuners of accents,"</q> as well as from the Stratford
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:0587000702:192"/>
Pariſh Regiſter, to which Mr. Bell, in the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion from his Apollo Preſs has religiouſly adhered. The <hi>Latin</hi> in his plays is ſtill allowed to hold its place; but we are told, leſt the reader ſhould be dazzled by it, that Shakeſpeare was obliged to <q rend="inline">"read and repeat in the courſe of his profeſſion ſuch Latin Fragments as are found in his works."</q> And we are expected to embrace this opinion.</p>
            <p>Before his Poems, inſcribed in his own name to his noble Patron, Southampton, ſtand, as a Motto, two lines from Ovid, as palpable as thoſe in the Taming of the Shrew. But perhaps it will at length be diſcovered, that thoſe Poems were not written by Shakeſpeare; or, if they were, that the lines had before been prefixed to ſome other black lettered pamphlet of that age; or at leaſt that Ben Jonſon, in compaſſion to his illiterate friend, ſuggeſted the Motto, which the <hi>Shake-ſcene</hi> of the times, for ſo the witlings of the day, favouring the old orthography, called Shake-ſpeare, could not himſelf ſupply.</p>
            <p>In return for the <hi>civilities</hi> of the <hi>Variorum</hi> Editors I beg leave to propoſe a ſmall emendation in their LIST OF PLAYS <hi>altered from</hi> SHAKESPEARE, in which they have done me the honour of attributing
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:0587000702:193"/>
to me, without any authority, two alterations of the Midſummer Night's Dream. Of the firſt, it is true, I attended the rehearſals, at the expreſs deſire of Mr. Garrick, on his going abroad; but the revival, as I foretold, failing of ſucceſs, the piece was, by my advice, reduced to two acts under the title of A Fairy Tale, ſo that I was little more than a Godfather on the occaſion, and the Alterations, like ſome of the <hi>Variorum</hi> Annotations, ſhould have been ſubſcribed ANON.</p>

            <p>THERE are few paſſages in the plays of Shakeſpeare, that have been more repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly the ſubject of critical animadverſion than a part of Shylock's reply to the Duke and the Magnificos in the Merchant of Venice.</p>
            <p>The lines in queſtion in the ſecond folio, which now lies before me, run thus: and the ſecond folio is, I believe, in this inſtance, an exact tranſcript of the firſt.<q>

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Rowe, the firſt modern Editor, himſelf a Poet, willing I ſuppoſe to preſerve the poetical expreſſion with no more violation of the text, than what was neceſſary to reconcile it to ſenſe and grammar, gives, as was his manner, without quoting any authority, the fifth and part of the ſixth line thus.<q>

                     <hi>Maſterleſs</hi> paſſion ſways it to the mood</l>

            </p>
            <p>This reading, conveying a clear idea without any great violence to the firſt impreſſions, was received and adopted by Pope, Theobald, and Hanmer.</p>
            <p>Theobald however willing to ſupport a propoſed emendation of his ingenious aſſiſtant Dr. Thirlby, and at the ſame time to introduce a Comment of Warburton, ſtarts a difficulty concerning the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive <hi>it</hi> (ſways <hi>it</hi>) which, according to Rowe's read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, eaſily and neceſſarily refers to the word <hi>Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> in the line immediately preceding.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="191" facs="tcp:0587000702:196"/>Dr. Thirlby's emendation conſiſted in a new mode of punctuation, by which he thus adjuſted the doubtful lines in the paſſage.<q>

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Warburton, with a refined commentary, rejects the reading of Rowe, preſerves the old pointing, but changes the number of the verb, reading <hi>ſway</hi> for <hi>ſways. Affection,</hi> he interprets to be uſed for <hi>ſympathy</hi>; and we learn from the ſecond edition of Dr. Farmer's Eſſay on the Learning of Shakeſpeare, that <hi>Affection,</hi> in the ſenſe of <hi>ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy,</hi> was formerly <hi>technical,</hi> and ſo uſed by Lord Bacon, Sir Kenelm Digby, and <hi>many</hi> other writers.</p>
            <p>Mr. Steevens, in his republication in 1760, of the twenty plays of Shakeſpeare firſt printed in quarto, from a profeſſed collation of four different copies of this play, entitles the Drama "The Comical Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of The Merchant of Venice," and exhibits the paſſage in queſtion, thus<q>
                  <l>Some men there are love not a gaping pig:</l>
                  <l>Some that are mad if they behold a cat;</l>

            <p>Here the old pointing is preſerved, but the ſpelling is in general more modern than even that of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond folio, which was indeed an earlier publication than two of the collated quartos.</p>
            <p>The word <hi>Maſters</hi> is exactly conformable to our preſent orthography; and this noun, governing the verb that follows, is the moſt material in the whole ſentence: ſo material indeed that in order to preſerve it, the Modern Editors, while they embrace the punctuation of Thirlby, make a ſtill further devia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the old copies, and, changing the number of both noun and verb, give the paſſage thus,<q>

            <p>The patient and laborious Capel, who commenced his reſearches long before all the Editors ſince Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and yet ſuffered thoſe Editors to anticipate, and almoſt ſuperſede his own publication, the dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent but tardy Capel adopts the punctuation of Thirlby, and regulates the paſſage thus,<q>
                  <l>For Affection,</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Miſtreſs</hi> of paſſion, ſways it to the mood</l>
                  <l>Of what it likes or loaths.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Capel, with his uſual fidelity, gives the rejected reading <q rend="inline">"<hi>Maiſters of</hi>"</q> at the bottom of the page, and as it ſhould ſeem, from the principle eſtabliſhed in his Introduction, from the oldeſt quarto. Of Capel the <hi>Variorum</hi> Editors take no notice.</p>
            <p>It is remarkable alſo that Theobald in his note reporting Thirlby's propoſed emendation, joins an aſteriſk to the word <hi>Maſter</hi> referring to another various reading or conjecture,—<hi>Or</hi> MISTRESS; but whether this was the original ſuggeſtion of Thirlby, or of himſelf, it is not eaſy to determine. In old books the mode of ſpelling the word <hi>Miſtreſs</hi> often
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:0587000702:199"/>
approaches very near to the word <hi>Maiſters</hi> in the text; and Mr. Steevens, who reads <hi>Maſters,</hi> and for the ſake of Grammatical Concordance changes <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection</hi> to <hi>Affections,</hi> yet quotes a paſſage from Othello, which though produced with another intention, yet countenances in this inſtance the reading of Capel.</p>
            <q>And though we have there a Subſtitute of moſt allowed ſufficiency, yet <hi>Opinion,</hi> a <hi>Sovereign</hi> MIS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TRESS of Effects, throws a more ſafe voice on you.</q>
            <p>I muſt confeſs that I cannot diſcover on what principle all the Editors, ſince Theobald and Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, have followed the punctuation of Thirlby. It is impoſſible, I think, for any reader, accuſtomed to the manner of our old writers, not to feel a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain harſhneſs in the new regulation of the text, or indeed to doubt for a moment, that the old books gave the ſecond line correctly, as at that time ſpoken on the ſtage, and originally written by the Author. <hi>Cannot contain their urine for Affection.</hi> I never heard, excellent and very Shylock as he is, Mack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin's full ſtop in the middle of this verſe without a ſhock; and the following words of the line, not only ſoften the expreſſion, but are moſt eaſy and
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:0587000702:200"/>
natural. We ſtill apply the verb <hi>affect</hi> in the ſame ſenſe that Shylock here uſes the noun derived from it, and the ſimple meaning of the line is, that <q rend="inline">"Others are <hi>ſo affected</hi> by the ſound of the bagpipe that they cannot contain themſelves."</q>
            </p>
            <p>The mode of <hi>Affection</hi> here ſignified, granting the old text to be genuine, muſt be <hi>Sympathy,</hi> illuſtrated by an example oppoſed to thoſe before enumerated; and the oppoſition marked, like the <hi>hic &amp; ille</hi> of the Latin, by the words <hi>ſome and others</hi>; though without the two laſt words of the line the contraſt is leſs clear, and the effect of the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pipe might be a third inſtance of Antipathy. Thirl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by's punctuation, and Rowe's reading, each ſuppoſe <hi>Affection</hi> to ſignify both <hi>Sympathy</hi> and <hi>Antipathy.</hi> Each Critick muſt be allowed to be ingenious: ſome word, or phraſe, or line, expreſſive of an irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtible influence over our <hi>likings</hi> and <hi>loathings,</hi> (for Shylock ſpeaks of both) as well as governing the verb <hi>ſways,</hi> is moſt certainly the grand <hi>Deſideratum,</hi> the one thing requiſite to regulate and explain this difficult paſſage.</p>
            <p>The paſſage, as it ſtands in the old books, is evidently defective or corrupt, or both, and though
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:0587000702:201"/>
the reading <hi>Miſtreſs</hi> for <hi>Maſters</hi> may remedy the corruption, and bring the noun and verb, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the rules of Syntax, to accord with each other, ſtill there remains an imperfection in the context, which has driven the commentators, as their laſt reſource, to a new mode of punctuation. My own method may, perhaps, appear ſtill more deſperate; but deſperate diſeaſes require deſperate remedies, and without ſome topical applications the caſe under conſideration is confeſſedly incurable: and I cannot well explain myſelf without ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſection. I muſt beg leave therefore to give a brief analyſis of Shylock's reply to the Duke, who tells him that the court recommend lenity to Anthonio, and expect a gentle anſwer from the proſecutor.—His anſwer is to this effect.</p>
            <q>I have taken a ſolemn oath to exact the penalty on the Bond, and deny me juſtice at your peril! If you demand why I prefer a pound of fleſh to three thouſand ducats, I anſwer, <hi>it is my humour.</hi> Or, if that anſwer be unſatisfactory; I add that there is an uncontroulable and unaccountable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, affecting the mind, predominating ſo abſolutely over the paſſions, as to impell them, in ſpite of reaſon, and of will, acting in ſome
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:0587000702:202"/>
men by <hi>Antipathy,</hi> and in others by <hi>Sympathy.</hi> There are inſtances of both. I am an inſtance of Antipathy. I abhor, I hate An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thonio: and this Hatred, this Antipathy, is the only anſwer that I will, or <hi>can</hi> give, why I prefer a loſing ſuit to a lucrative compoſition.</q>
            <p>This I take to be a fair abſtract of Shylock's an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, who, waving the <hi>ſic volo</hi> with which he follows up his oath, proceeds to defend his conduct by the example of other men, ſubject, like himſelf, to the irreſiſtible dominion of <hi>Sympathy</hi> and <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipathy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the whole therefore I conceive that the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal punctuation ſhould be maintained, that the word <hi>Maiſters</hi> in the old copies ſhould be read <hi>Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs,</hi> and that the imperfection in the ſenſe, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that reading, ariſes from a line or two loſt or dropt at the preſs, in which the words <hi>Sympathy</hi> and <hi>Antipathy,</hi> ſo congenial to the argument, had moſt probably a place.</p>
            <p>To ſubmit this opinion, and the whole of my comment, fairly to the reader, I ſhall conclude theſe obſervations with a transſcript of the whole ſpeech from the ſecond folio, only introducing <hi>in</hi>
               <pb n="198" facs="tcp:0587000702:203"/>
               <hi>another character</hi> the variation of <hi>Miſtreſs</hi> for <hi>Maiſters,</hi> together with one intercalary line, meant (like the day in Leap-year) to complete the ſyſtem, and to convey the real meaning of the author. His real words are now irrecoverable.</p>
            <p>The Duke concludes the addreſs to Shylock, in behalf of the Senate and himſelf, with theſe words.<q>
                  <l>We do expect a gentle anſwer, Jew.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Shylock's anſwer is as follows:<q>
                  <l>I have poſſeſst your Grace with what I purpoſe,</l>
                  <l>And by our holy Sabbath have I ſworne</l>

having, in my humble opinion, proved unſucceſsful, a cloſe conſideration of the whole paſſage ſuggeſted the former. With what propriety the reader will determine.</p>
            <p>Some difficulties, for Criticks will create difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, have ariſen from other lines in this ſpeech.

I think I have ſeen one: the bag I mean, for the <hi>pipe,</hi> as he ſuppoſes, was of wood.</p>
            <p>The edition alſo of 1778, now under my eye, reads,

ſlight variation might not have the ſanction of the ingenious Editor, but be only an error of the preſs.</p>

               <p>☞ Since the foregoing article was prepared for the preſs, looking into the <hi>Variorum</hi> edition of Shake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeare publiſhed in the year 1785 for the purpoſe of tranſcribing the anonymous Annotation on my Note to the Appendix, I find that Mr. Malone profeſſes to have altered his opinion on this much conteſted paſſage, and now believes, as I do, the old reading of the line <q rend="inline">"<hi>Cannot contain, &amp;c.</hi>"</q> to be genuine, deriving the noun <hi>affection,</hi> as I have done, from the verb <hi>affect,</hi> but applying it, like Theobald, and Thirlby, and the Modern Editors, to both <hi>Sympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi> and <hi>Antipathy.</hi> In conſequence of this inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation he now reads, for the ſake of concord,

THOUGHTS ON PUBLICK EDUCATION.</head>
            <p>LOCKE, who by his intellectual reſearches has made his name as memorable in the annals of Engliſh Literature as thoſe of Bacon or Newton, has among other ſmaller works bequeathed to poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity a ſhort tract entitled "Some Thoughts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Education." In this tract, containing many excellent remarks, many inſtances of ſhrewd penetration, and much valuable information, he has avowed himſelf a declared enemy to Publick
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:0587000702:211"/>
Education, which he conſiders as a ſacrifice of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency to confidence, concluding <q rend="inline">"that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to keep a lad from the ſpreading conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, if <hi>you will venture him abroad</hi> IN THE HERD, and truſt to chance or <hi>his own inclination,</hi> for the choice of his company at ſchool."</q>
            </p>
            <p>Who would not ſhrink at the thoughts of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countering ſo formidable an adverſary, armed at all points with ſtrong natural Senſe, keen Obſervation, Satire, Humour, and Argument? for ſuch weapons he has wielded, and with ſuch armour has he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended himſelf, on the ſubject now under conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, directing all his attacks againſt the principle I have undertaken to defend. Yet exerciſing that freedom, of which he has himſelf given both the precept and example, I venture to think for my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and in my turn to ſubmit my thoughts to the Publick.</p>
            <q>Nullius addictus jurare in verba Magiſtri.</q>
            <p>Locke's <hi>Thoughts on Education,</hi> though publiſhed in one continued ſeries, and ſplit into ſections, according to the cuſtom of the times, is yet, as the
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:0587000702:212"/>
dedication declares, the mere ſubſtance of a corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence with a private friend, and indeed may now fairly be reſolved into three ſeparate letters: for the writer, at three diſtinct periods, reverts to the ſtate of infancy; and twice leads the babe through child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood to youth and manhood: this may eſcape the obſervation of a curſory reader, but to a fair and ſtrict examiner is plain and obvious.</p>
            <p>The following remarks are, like the tract on which they are founded, ſomewhat looſe and deſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory. It is indeed very difficult to follow a writer, who often reſumes a ſubject that he ſeems to have diſmiſſed: yet order and method have been endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to be preſerved, as far as was poſſible under ſuch circumſtances. No material part of the queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it is hoped, remains unnoticed: and it may be added with confidence, that no argument has been intentionally miſrepreſented.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Virtue, Virtue and Wiſdom,</hi> Locke juſtly conſiders as the baſis of all good education. They are indeed as neceſſary to the operations of the mind, as health and vigour to the exertions of the body. We will not therefore diſpute on a ſelf-evident propoſition; but rather endeavour to prove, on the very principles
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:0587000702:213"/>
of the tract now before us, that Publick Education is more conducive to the improvement of the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and leſs dangerous to the morals, than Domeſtick Tuition.</p>
            <p>It muſt be obvious to every reader that Locke himſelf enters on the compariſon with difficulty and diffidence. <q rend="inline">"I confeſs (ſays he with great can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour) both ſides have their inconveniencies."</q> He then proceeds to a laboured invective againſt Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar Schools, as unfavourable to the practice of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; <q rend="inline">"And therefore (ſays he in concluſion) I cannot but prefer <hi>breeding of a young gentleman at home in his father's ſight under a governor,</hi> as much the beſt and ſafeſt way to the great and main end of education, <hi>where it can be had, and is ordered as it ſhould be.</hi>"</q>
            </p>
            <p>Perfection, no doubt, if attainable, were much to be deſired: but, alas! Imperfection is the lot of all human undertakings; and all we can effect is to follow that courſe, which is liable to the leaſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection. The excellence of Locke's plan is in his own opinion evidently hypothetical; ſo that he is at laſt driven to acknowledge that <q rend="inline">"what ſhall be reſolved in the caſe muſt in a great meaſure be
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:0587000702:214"/>
left to the parents, to be determined by their cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances and conveniences."</q>
            </p>
            <p>All that Locke ſays of children, while children, that is while in a mere ſtate of infancy, is in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral well worth notice. He ſeems to enter into all their little feelings with as much penetration, and much leſs romance, than Rouſſeau, whoſe EMILE, with all its merit, and all its originality, is in fact an ingenious amplification of Locke's work, realiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in himſelf the ideal character of the tutor or governor, and in <hi>Emile</hi> the perſon of the pupil, whom he takes up from his cradle, and carries to his mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage bed, juſt as Locke adviſes, on his return from Late Travel. Rouſſeau's work however is not merely the little tract of Locke dilated and perſoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, but in many inſtances a comment; ſometimes too laboured and refined, and ſometimes acute and plauſible. Few will agree with him that inſtruction muſt be delayed till the leſſons can be attended with experiment, or think it reaſonable to refer their little ſtudents to the open volume of nature, denying them the uſe of books, maps, globes, and other helps which Locke recommends. Moſt parents would think Locke's method of teaching Geography as prudent as it is ſimple and eaſy, by ſhewing children firſt the figure and natural parts of the globe, and
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:0587000702:215"/>
the imaginary and artificial lines afterwards: but Rouſſeau deſpiſes ſuch inſufficient methods, throws away maps and ſpheres, and by his own example exhorts teachers to carry their ſcholars at different ſeaſons to the top of a mountain, to ſee the ſun riſe at Midſummer and at Chriſtmas. This appears ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther extravagant, but, at the ſame time, it may be thought that Rouſſeau properly cenſures Locke's maxim of <hi>reaſoning</hi> with children, which he truly ſays Locke himſelf appears ſo much embarraſſed to defend. With equal juſtice he reprobates Locke's method of recommending and encouraging LIBE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RALITY, <q rend="inline">"conſtantly <hi>taking care that the child loſes nothing by it.</hi>"</q> Let all the inſtances he gives of <q rend="inline">"ſuch freeneſs (continues Locke) <hi>be always repaid and with intereſt,</hi> and let him ſenſibly perceive that the kindneſs he ſhews to others, is no bad huſbandry for himſelf; but that it brings a return of kindneſs both from thoſe who receive it, and thoſe who look on!"</q> This, ſays Rouſſeau, is to teach a child to be generous to appearance, and in reality avaricious. He reprehends alſo Locke's opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that <q rend="inline">"the conſideration of <hi>ſpirits</hi> ought to go before that of matter and body:"</q> for what idea, ſays he, can a child entertain of a being incorporeal and immaterial?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="211" facs="tcp:0587000702:216"/>But the management of infants is not the chief object of theſe remarks. Of the treatment of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren Locke ſpeaks with fairneſs and candour; but when they advance to maturer age, his evident prejudice againſt Publick Education obſcures that preciſion, and depraves that liberality ſo remarkable in his other works.</p>
            <p>Locke, while he ſo openly and ſeverely cenſures Publick Education, ſlurs over the defects of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtick tuition, yet his ſubject unavoidably leads him to point out ſome imperfections; and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly the danger <hi>from ſervants:</hi> to which might be added the too frequent hereditary taint of the mind from the maſter and miſtreſs, and the contagion of their friends and acquaintance. The miſchiefs of domeſtick indulgence cannot indeed be more ſtrongly delineated than in the words of Locke himſelf. <q rend="inline">"<hi>He that is not uſed to ſubmit his will to the reaſon of others, WHEN he is YOUNG, will ſcarce hearken or ſubmit to his own reaſon, when he is of an age to make uſe of it.

                  <hi>education. But if we look into the common manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of children, we ſhall have reaſon to wonder, in the great diſſoluteneſs of manners which the world complains of, that there an any footſteps at all left of virtue.

I do not mean by the examples they give, and the pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terns they ſet before them, which is encouragement enough, but that which I would take notice of here, is the downright teaching them vice, and actually putting them out of the way of virtue.</hi>"</q> He then proceeds to ſhew that they principle them with <hi>violence, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,</hi> and <hi>cruelty</hi>; that <hi>lying</hi> and <hi>equivocation</hi> are put into their mouths and commended; that the little ones are taught to be proud of their cloaths, before they can put them on; and tempted and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged to <hi>intemperance</hi> and <hi>luxury.</hi> The ſection concludes with the following paragraph. <q rend="inline">"<hi>I ſhall not dwell any longer on this ſubject, much leſs run over all the particulars, that would ſhew what pains are uſed to corrupt children, and inſtill prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of vice into them: But I deſire parents ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly to conſider what irregularity or vice there is, which children are not viſibly taught, and whether</hi>

            </p>
            <p>The chief officer in Locke's houſehold of private education is a Governour, or Tutor; <q rend="inline">"and if you find it difficult (ſays he) to meet with ſuch a tutor, you are not to wonder."</q>
            </p>
            <p>His deſcription of a Tutor is indeed chimerical. Wiſdom, temperance, tenderneſs, diligence, and diſcretion, are the lead eſſential requiſites in the character of Locke's governour. Such a man as he delineates is ſcarce to be found; and if found, would hardly undertake the taſk aſſigned him.</p>
            <p>His <hi>learning however,</hi> much or little, is no great recommendation. <q rend="inline">"That a tutor ſhould have <hi>Latin and learning,</hi> with the reputation of ſobriety, every one expects: and this generally is thought enough, and is all parents look for. But when ſuch an one <hi>has emptied out into his pupil all the Latin and logick he has brought from the Univerſity,</hi> will that furniture make him <hi>a fine gentleman?</hi> Or can it be expected that he ſhould be better bred, better ſkilled in the world, better principled in the grounds and foundations of true virtue and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity, than his young <hi>Tutor</hi> is?"</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="214" facs="tcp:0587000702:219"/>Such is the deriſion beſtowed by Locke on the <hi>ſcholarſhip</hi> of a tutor; and ſuch is his conſtant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of literature and erudition, under the ſneering denominations of <hi>Latin and learning, a deal of traſh, dry ſyſtems, &amp;c.</hi> which appears very ſtrange from a learned, or, as Locke ſtyles himſelf, a <hi>bookiſh man.</hi> He not only gives the firſt place to <hi>virtue,</hi> without "which no ſcience, polite learning, or talents, can be of value, but much prefers <hi>breeding</hi> to learning. His encomiums on this accompliſhment are equal to any of Lord Cheſterfield's Diſſertations on the <hi>Graces.</hi> It is indeed always difficult to fix a charge of partiality, or incoherency, on ſo cautious and ingenious a writer, becauſe he commonly concludes his remarks with ſome qualifying expreſſions, which however rather ſeem to bring up the rear as a ſaving clauſe, than to be intended to militate againſt the main argument. As one inſtance among many others, of theſe principles and this practice, may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the following paſſage, with which he winds up his recommendation of the firſt eſſential requiſite in a Tutor.</p>
            <q>The Tutor therefore ought IN THE FIRST PLACE TO BE WELL BRED? And a young gentleman who gets this ONE qualification from his GOVERNOR, ſets out with great advantage; and will find that THIS
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:0587000702:220"/>
ONE ACCOMPLISHMENT will more open his way to him, get him more friends, and carry him farther in the world, than all the HARD WORDS, OR REAL KNOWLEDGE he has got from the liberal arts, or his TUTOR'S learned ENCYCLOPOEDIA. Not that thoſe ſhould be neglected, but by no means preferred or ſuffered to thruſt out the other.</q>
            <p>
               <hi>Knowledge of the world</hi> alſo is deemed preferable to <hi>learning</hi> and <hi>languages,</hi> though by the way, he here inadvertently implies the ſuperior force of Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Education, and is obliged to confeſs that the ſtudy of the antients contributes both to that <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> and to <hi>virtue.</hi> The Tutor however, this ſage and exemplary monitor, deſcribed by Locke, muſt enter his pupil into the world, and at the ſame time preſerve him, like the Four Thieves, Vinegar, from the contagion of ſociety; ſo that a youth muſt, it ſeems, after all encounter the danger ſo much dreaded in a Publick Education, the danger of herding with thoſe of his own time of life: and how ill he may be prepared to hazard his morals, his health, and his fortune, in ſuch company, the following picture of many a lad mewed up in a private family, drawn by the maſterly hand of Locke himſelf, will exhibit in the moſt lively colours.</p>
            <q>
               <pb n="216" facs="tcp:0587000702:221"/>The longer he is kept thus hood-winked the leſs he will ſee, when he comes abroad into open day-light, and be the more expoſed to be a prey to himſelf and others. And an old boy at his firſt appearance, with all the gravity of his ivy-buſh about him, is ſure to draw on him the eyes and chirping of the whole town volery. Amongſt which, there will not be wanting ſome birds of prey that will preſently be on the wing for him.</q>
            <p>The Tutor however is not to neglect our young maſter's learning, but is to teach him Latin, like French, by <hi>talking</hi> it into him in conſtant converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for he muſt be conſtantly with his pupil, talk nothing elſe to him, and make him ſtill anſwer in the ſame language; though perhaps the compariſon is not quite fair and appoſite, French being a living language and Latin a dead one. Grammar however is ſtrictly forbidden by <hi>Locke,</hi> as well as <hi>Rouſſeau:</hi> And if the well bred tutor ſhould be incapable, a more agreeable teacher may be found, and the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing method is recommended to all private fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies.</p>
            <q>Whatever ſtir there is made about getting of LATIN, as the great and difficult buſineſs, his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may teach it him herſelf, if ſhe will but ſpend

two or three hours in a day with him, and make him read the Evangeliſts in LATIN to her. For ſhe need but buy a LATIN Teſtament, and having got ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body to mark the laſt ſyllable but one where it is long, in words above two ſyllables (which is enough to regulate her pronunciation and accenting the words) read daily in the GOSPELS, and then let her avoid underſtanding them in LATIN if ſhe can! And when ſhe underſtands the Evangeliſts in LATIN, let her in the ſame manner, read AESOP's FABLES, and ſo proceed on to EUTROPIUS, JUSTIN, and other ſuch books. I do not mention this as an imagination of what I fancie may do, but as of a thing I have known done, and the LATIN Tongue with eaſe got this way.</q>
            <p>Suppoſing the Governor to be intelligent, able, and competent to the inſtruction of his pupil, ſtill the mother is not to lie idle: for <q rend="inline">"Care is to be taken whilſt he is learning Foreign languages, <hi>by ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and reading nothing elſe with his tutor, that he do not forget to read Engliſh,</hi> which may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by his mother, or ſomebody elſe, hearing him read ſome choſen parts of ſcripture, or other <hi>Engliſh</hi> book every day."</q>

               <q rend="inline">"Languages, ſays Locke, <hi>being to be learnt by rote, cuſtom, and memory,</hi> are then ſpoken in the greateſt perfection, when all rules of Grammar are utterly forſaken."</q> Languages may be <hi>ſpoken</hi> by <hi>rote,</hi> but ſurely (dead languages eſpecially) are not, as Locke ſuppoſes, to be learnt ſo; and though an adept may throw away his Grammar, and Dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionary too if he pleaſes, it is ſtrange advice to a ſtudent. In the lower claſſes of Publick Schools moſt of the boys are, during the intervals of the ſchool hours, under the care of one of the aſſiſtants retained, at a very moderate coſt, as a private tutor. His method of teaching them to render Engliſh into Latin, and ſo <hi>vice versâ,</hi> is excellent, though di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly oppoſite to that recommended by Locke; and in my opinion ſo much more excellent, in proportion as it is more oppoſite. To tranſlate a portion of one of the goſpels for the current week is a common exerciſe, and to fit them for the execution of their taſk, they are made to <hi>parſe</hi> every word in the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, and by thus having learnt to what part of ſpeech every one belongs, together with the number, caſe, mood, tenſe, &amp;c. their taſk is made eaſy, and they acquire by degrees a <hi>radical</hi> knowledge of the two languages at once. Locke's propoſal of <hi>talking</hi> children into a language, which he frequently contends
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:0587000702:224"/>
that nobody talks and ſhould pretend to write, is as little eligible as it is feaſible; and his ſubſtituted method of <hi>interlining Latin and Engliſh,</hi> while it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, according to his own confeſſion, a previous explanation of the various terminations of nouns and verbs, their ſeveral genders, caſes, numbers and perſons, proves the neceſſity of the rules of Grammar, while it deprives the little ſtudents of the uſe of them. The reſult muſt be perpetual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, ariſing from ſuperficial inſtructions, and a total impoſſibility of cultivating even their mother tongue, as he afterwards very properly, though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtently with his own doctrine, recommends. Engliſh itſelf ſhould be taught by Grammar, though by natives firſt acquired by rote, cuſtom, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory. The mother tongue is almoſt ſucked in with the mother's milk.</p>
            <q>Take a boy from the top of a Grammar ſchool, ſays Locke, and one of the ſame age bred, <hi>as he ſhould be,</hi> in his father's family, and bring them into good company together, and then ſee which of the two will have the more manly car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, and addreſs himſelf with the more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming aſſurance to ſtrangers. Here I <hi>imagine,</hi> the ſchool boy's confidence will either fail or
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:0587000702:225"/>
diſcredit him: and <hi>if it be ſuch</hi> as fits him only for the converſation of boys, he were better be without it.</q>
            <p>This paſſage is quite of a piece with every other in which Locke mentions Publick Education, on which occaſion he not only, as he himſelf confeſſes, loſes his temper, but alſo drops his uſual liberality and candour. <q rend="inline">"I cannot with patience think, (he cries in another place) that a young gentleman ſhould be put into the herd, and be driven with a whip and ſcourge, as if he were to run the gantlet through the different claſſes <hi>ad capiendum ingenii cultum.</hi>"</q> At other times he terms ſuch youths <hi>ill bred and vicious boys, a mixed herd of unruly boys, learning to wrangle at trap, or rook at ſhun-farthing, practiſing wagferies and cheats, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certing well laid plots of robbing an orchard.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The beſt and perhaps the moſt direct way of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futing theſe common-place invectives were to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce from the ſame tract, in which they have gained a place, as evidences of the partiality of the writer, other paſſages, written when off his guard, that directly contradict theſe aſſertions.</p>
            <q>
               <pb n="221" facs="tcp:0587000702:226"/>There is often <hi>(ſays Locke on one of theſe oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions)</hi> in people, eſpecially children, a clowniſh ſhame facedneſs before ſtrangers, or thoſe above them.

            <p>Plainneſs of manners is, to a certain age, perhaps the moſt ingenuous feature of youth. A <hi>poliſh</hi> is the laſt ſtage of education, as well as of arts and manufactures, and when given too ſoon the varniſh only hides a defect. A boy ſhould not have the manners, nor the dreſs, of a man. Locke himſelf, under the article of <hi>manners,</hi> ſtrongly reprobates the parents and tutors, who teize their children about <hi>putting off hats and making of legs</hi>; and juſtly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes that, <q rend="inline">"if their minds are well diſpoſed, and principled with inward civility, a great part of the roughneſs which ſticks to the outſide for want of better teaching, time and obſervation will rub off as they grow up, if they are bred in good company."</q> To ſay the truth, much of the ſecurity, as well as improvement of youth, depends on their not having attained the finiſhed breeding of men. And the raw diffidence of a ſchool boy
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:0587000702:227"/>
would be ill exchanged for the pert confidence of many a homebred fopling. The words of Rouſſeau on this head will better expreſs my meaning, and are an excellent contraſt to the above paſſage from Locke.</p>

example. The chief duties of female life are do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtick, thoſe of a man are publick. An officer, phyſician, lawyer, or divine, bred with his ſiſter, would not, I conceive, derive due benefit from his Education. Sometimes, however, her ſociety, as well as that of the reſt of his family, might be of advantage both to his morals and underſtanding. It is not neceſſary at preſent to deliver any opinion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the proper education of daughters. <hi>Home</hi> ſeems to be their natural province; yet that <hi>home</hi> is often ſo exceptionable, that perhaps even <hi>they</hi> would in general be in leſs danger abroad.

            <p>Having in the place juſt quoted ſhewn the impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of paying proper attention to pupils in a publick ſchool, in the following paſſages are exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited the methods to be purſued in a private family, both in regard to a ſingle ſcholar, or a ſett of boys.</p>
            <q>Since he prefers this or that (whatever play he delights in) to his book, that only he ſhall do; and ſo in earneſt ſet him on work on his beloved
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:0587000702:231"/>
play, and keep him ſteadily and in earneſt to it morning and afternoon, till he be fully ſurfeited, and would at any rate change it for ſome hours at his book again. But when you thus ſet him a taſk of his play, <hi>you muſt be ſure to look after him yourſelf, or ſet ſome body elſe to do it,</hi> that may conſtantly ſee him employed in it, and that he be not permitted to be idle at that too.</q>
            <q>This I think is ſufficiently evident, that chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren generally hate to be idle. All the care then is, that their buſie humour ſhould be conſtantly employed in ſomething of uſe to them, which, if you will attain, you muſt make what you would have them do a <hi>recreation</hi> to them, and not a <hi>buſineſs.</hi> The way to do this, ſo that they may not perceive you have any hand in it is this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed here; <hi>viz.</hi> To make them weary of that which you would not have them do, by enjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and making them, under ſome pretence or other do it, till they are ſurfeited. For example: does your ſon play at top or ſcourge too much? Enjoin him to play ſo many hours every day, <hi>and look that he do it</hi>; and you ſhall ſee he will quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be ſick of it, and willing to leave it. By this
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:0587000702:232"/>
means making the recreations you diſlike a <hi>buſineſs</hi> to him, he will of himſelf with delight betake himſelf to thoſe things you would have him do; eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if they be propoſed as rewards for having per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed his <hi>taſk</hi> in that play is commanded him. For if he be ordered every day to whip his top ſo long as to make him ſufficiently weary, do you not think he will apply himſelf with eagerneſs to his book, and wiſh for it, if you promiſe it him as a reward for having whipped his top luſtily, quite out all the time that is ſet him? Children, in the things they do, if they comport with their age, find little difference ſo they may be doing. The eſteem they have for one thing above another they borrow from others. So that what thoſe about them make to be a reward to them, will really be ſo. By this art it is in their governour's choice; whether <hi>Scotch-hoppers</hi> ſhall reward their <hi>dancing,</hi> or <hi>dancing</hi> their <hi>Scotch-hoppers</hi>; whether peg-top, or reading, playing at trap, or ſtudying the globes, ſhall be more acceptable and pleaſing to them. All that they deſire being to be buſie and buſie, as they imagine, in things of their own choice, and which they receive as favours from their parents, or others for whom they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, and with whom they would be in credit.
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:0587000702:233"/>
A <hi>ſett of children</hi> thus ordered, and <hi>kept from the ill example of others,</hi> would <hi>all</hi> of them, I <hi>ſuppoſe,</hi> with as much earneſtneſs and delight, learn to read, write, and what elſe one would have them, as others do their ordinary plays. And the eldeſt being thus entered, and this made the faſhion of the place, it would be as impoſſible to hinder them from learning the one, as it is ordinarily to keep them from the other.</q>
            <p>Theſe extracts will perhaps convince moſt readers of the viſionary proſpects preſented to parental <hi>ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations</hi> in many a <hi>practical treatiſe</hi> on Private Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. Several paſſages of the ſame nature occur in the tract now under conſideration.</p>
            <p>One of the ready topicks of Locke's cenſure and raillery of Publick Schools is the <hi>correction</hi> occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionally beſtowed on idle, irregular, or obſtinate pupils. But ſay what he will of the uſe of the <hi>rod</hi> to laſh dull boys into nouns and pronouns, verbs, gerunds, and ſupines, it is rarely exerciſed by a good Schoolmaſter but when <hi>wilfulneſs</hi> or <hi>ill example</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands it: on which occaſions the <hi>continued</hi> ſeverities enjoined by Locke much exceed the utmoſt rigours of Publick Education. As for example!</p>
            <q>
               <pb n="229" facs="tcp:0587000702:234"/>
               <hi>I would have a</hi> father ſeldom ſtrike his child, <hi>but upon very urgent neceſſity and as the laſt remedy;</hi> and then perhaps it will be fit to do it ſo, that the child ſhould not quickly forget it.</q>
            <p>And again.</p>
            <q>
               <hi>Whenever you come to that extremity, it is not enough to whip or beat them, you muſt do it, till you find you have ſubdued their minds, till with ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion and patience they yield to the correction; which you ſhall beſt diſcover by their crying and their ceaſing from it upon your bidding.</hi> Without this the beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of children is but a paſſionate tyranny over them; and it is mere cruelty and not correction to put their bodies in pain without doing their minds any good. As this gives us a reaſon why children ſhould ſeldom be corrected, ſo it alſo prevents their being ſo. For if whenever they are chaſtiſed it were done thus without paſſion, ſoberly and yet eſſentially too, <hi>laying on the blows and ſmart, not furiouſly and all at once, but ſlowly with reaſoning between, and with obſervation how it wrought, ſtopping when it had made them pliant, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent, and yielding</hi>; they would ſeldom need the like puniſhment again, being made careful to avoid the fault, that deſerved it. Beſides, by this
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:0587000702:235"/>
means as <hi>the puniſhment would not be loſt for being too little and not effectual,</hi> ſo it would be kept from being too much, <hi>if we gave off as ſoon as we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that it reached the mind, and that was bettered.</hi> For ſince the chiding or beating of children ſhould be always the leaſt that poſſibly may be, that which is laid on in the heat of anger, ſeldom obſerves that meaſure, but is commonly more than it ſhould be, though it proves <hi>leſs than enough.</hi>
            </q>
            <p>The circumſtance of <hi>laying on the blows with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning between</hi> exhibits a whimſical picture, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minds one of the pedagogue of Swift concluding every period with a laſh. And the idea of perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the very moment, when the cure on the mind is effected by the operation on the tail, is ſtill more ludicrous. The young patient however might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps wiſh to remind the author of another paſſage in an early ſection of this tract, there applied to the regimen of the body, but not inapplicable on the preſent occaſion.</p>
            <q>When ſuch a gentle treatment will not ſtop the growing miſchief, nor hinder it from turning into a formed diſeaſe, it will be time to ſeek the advice of ſome ſober and diſcreet phyſician. In this part I hope I ſhall find an eaſy belief; and
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:0587000702:236"/>
nobody can have a pretence to doubt the advice of one who has ſpent ſome time in the ſtudy of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick when he counſels you, <hi>not to be too forward in making uſe of</hi> PHYSICK OR PHYSICIANS.</q>
            <p>I am unwilling to load the page with too many quotations; but as the following is peculiarly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſting and entertaining, I flatter myſelf the reader will ſcarce think it demands an apology.</p>
            <q>
               <hi>A prudent and kind mother</hi> of my acquaintance, was on ſuch an occaſion, forced to whip her little daughter, at her firſt coming home from nurſe, <hi>eight times ſucceſſively the ſame morning</hi> before ſhe could maſter her <hi>ſtubbornneſs,</hi> and obtain a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance in a very eaſy and indifferent manner. <hi>If ſhe had left off ſooner, and ſtopped at the ſeventh whipping, ſhe had ſpoiled the child for ever</hi>; and by her unprevailing blows, only confirmed her <hi>refractorineſs</hi> very hardly afterwards to be cured. But wiſely perſiſting till ſhe had bent her mind, and ſuppled her will, the only end of correction and chaſtiſement, ſhe eſtabliſhed her authority thoroughly in the very firſt occaſion, and had ever after a very ready compliance and obedience in all things from her daughter. For as this was the
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:0587000702:237"/>
firſt time, ſo <hi>I think it was the laſt too</hi> ſhe ever ſtruck her.</q>
            <p>Correction, when neceſſary; is certainly leſs pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful both to parents and children, when inflicted abroad than at home. It is better that fathers ſhould ſeem unconſcious of the knowledge of all their petty treſpaſſes; and Locke, though he here ſo much commends the repeated flagellations of <hi>a little daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by a prudent</hi> and <hi>kind mother,</hi> yet in the ſection firſt quoted declares, <q rend="inline">"I think it is beſt the <hi>ſmart</hi> ſhould come more immediately <hi>from another's hand,</hi> though by the parent's order <hi>who ſhould ſee it done.</hi>"</q>
            </p>
            <p>In confirmation of the lenity of maſters of Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Schools, I ſhall venture to mention a little anecdote that came within my own knowledge, during the time of my education at Weſtminſter. A gentleman, not long ſince living, was when a ſchool-boy more diſtinguiſhed by the goodneſs of his diſpoſition, than the brilliancy of his parts. Many of the forms, uſually committed to the care of aſſiſtants, were however now and then viſited by the head maſter. On one of theſe occaſions, the gentleman I have ſpoken of was called out by Dr. Nicoll, to read and conſtrue a part of the leſſon to
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:0587000702:238"/>
the form; which, being in the upper ſchool, the leſſon of the day was in Greek. The honeſt lad, conſcious of his inability, obeyed the call: but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of attempting the leſſon, went up to the maſter, and muttered indiſtinctly, <hi>Flog me, Sir!</hi>—Speak out, child! ſays the maſter.—<hi>Flog me Sir, if you pleaſe!</hi> repeats the ſcholar, dropping his book and unbutton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The maſter, with a chaſtiſed ſmile, laying his hand on his young pupil's head, and gently patting him, cried in a mild tone, Go thy ways, boy! get thee to thy place again! Thou art a very honeſt fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, but thou never wilt be a Scholar as long as thou liveſt.</p>
            <p>This ſtory may ſerve as a companion to Locke's pictures of private correction, and may ſerve to ſhew that good hearts may be found in Publick Schools as well as private families; and that the diſcipline of <hi>the rod</hi> is not adminiſtered with more judicious diſcrimination in one ſyſtem of education than the other.</p>
            <p>The <hi>rewards</hi> alſo are at Publick Schools as well choſen and as appropriated as the <hi>puniſhments</hi>; the latter exhibiting, as Locke enjoins, the <hi>diſgrace,</hi> and the former adding to the <hi>reputation</hi> of the young
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:0587000702:239"/>
ſtudent. The little ſhining coin of pennies, two-pences, threepences, and groats <hi>in ſilver,</hi> given on any occaſional diſplay of induſtry or excellence, are as triumphantly prized and carefully treaſured by the young receiver, as a medal by an antiquarian; and are carefully carried home, with joy and pride, as pledges of their merit in their claſs, and tokens of the approbation of their maſter. A ſtill higher mark of favour is the ſeaſonable reward of diſtinguiſhing the diligence and abilities of a riſing lad by promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the ſchool, and anticipating his remove to a ſuperior form. Places and preferments are often gained at Weſtminſter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Emulation,</hi> that great ſpur to improvement, almoſt unknown in Domeſtick Tuition, is greatly encouraged in the field of Publick Education. This Locke himſelf acknowledges. The cuſtom of <hi>challenging,</hi> as it is termed by the ſchool boys, promotes a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful deſire of excelling amongſt young champions for literary pre-eminence. This <hi>challenging</hi> is thus ordered, and proves a keen incitement to diligence and perfection. The boys of the form are called out to their leſſon of the day. The firſt boy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps miſconſtrues his Aeſop or Ovid, the ſecond corrects his miſtake and takes his rank and place;
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:0587000702:240"/>
or, the ſecond failing, the third, the fourth, the fifth, the ſixth, or the ſixteenth, in due order gives the right conſtruction, and ſuperſedes all his ſchool-fellows of the claſs under examination; ſo that a boy is often tranſported in a moment from the lower or <hi>fag</hi> end to the very top of the form. As the young ſtudents advance towards the ſuperior forms, this practice, in reſpect to their maturer years and progreſs in their ſtudies, is judiciouſly diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued.</p>
            <p>When I ſpeak of the cuſtom of Publick Schools, I particularly refer to that of Weſtminſter, where I was bred, and with whoſe cuſtoms I am beſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted, not queſtioning that other Publick Schools have equal advantages.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Verſes</hi> and <hi>Themes,</hi> ſo reprobated by Locke, are intended as exerciſes to teach ſcholars better to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the poetical and proſe compoſitions of the antients, and not meant, as he inſinuates, to render every ſcholar a <hi>poet</hi> or <hi>declaimer.</hi> The various mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of poetry are more eaſily comprehended, and more perfectly read, by thoſe who reduce the rules of proſody to practice. For this purpoſe metrical centoes, ludicrouſly ſtyled <hi>jointed dolls,</hi> fitting the end of one line to the beginning or middle of another;
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:0587000702:241"/>
and even <hi>nonſenſe verſes,</hi> have their uſe. For unleſs Virgil and Horace are to be prohibited to Engliſh pupils, like the Bible to Roman Catholicks, thoſe who ſtudy them ſhould be inſtructed to read them with propriety, not conceiving that they are to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Virgils and Horaces themſelves. <hi>Themes</hi> tend to open the mind, and cannot poſſibly be prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial. To explain the <hi>theſis</hi> to the young ſtudents is no more ridiculous than the other helps which Locke himſelf not only allows, but even preſcribes to be given for the improvement of his pupils. Milton, as well as Locke, objects to <hi>themes and verſes</hi> as ſchool exerciſes, <q rend="inline">"forcing the empty wits of children to acts of ripeſt judgment, and the final work of a head filled, by long reading and obſerving, with elegant maxims, and copious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention."</q> But ſurely ſuch objections deny to the improvement and cultivation of the mind, the means neceſſarily uſed and recommended in the exerciſes of the body. <hi>Nec literas didicit nec natare</hi> was, as Locke obſerves, a proverb to denote an ill and imperfect education. It were as conſiſtent therefore to ſay that a lad muſt not go into the water till he can ſwim, as to forbid all attempts at compoſition, till he has acquired and formed a ſtyle which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends ſo much, like perſonal grace and activity, upon
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:0587000702:242"/>
practice. Falſe concords and falſe quantities, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved and amended, guide the learner by degrees to true proſody and ſyntax. <hi>Barbarizing angliciſms,</hi> ſo offenſive to Milton, lead to pure latinity. <q rend="inline">"An art, ſays Buſby, is the way of doing a thing ſurely, readily, and gracefully,"</q> Grammar is the art of ſpeaking and writing: and was that or any other art ever attained without repeated efforts, lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by inſenſible gradations through error to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection? The Latin pieces of verſe and proſe of Milton now extant were derived no doubt from long reading and obſerving. His <hi>Juvenilia,</hi> admirable as they are, were certainly preceded by more puerile exerciſes and imperfect compoſitions.</p>
            <q>Didicit prius, extimuitque magiſtrum.</q>
            <p>
               <hi>Repetitions by heart</hi> are no more than ſelecting, as Locke himſelf directs, the beautiful paſſages from authors, and impreſſing them on the memory of the reciter. They ſhould not it is true (and they are not) be too long, nor too frequently exacted: yet ſuch exerciſes undoubtedly ſerve to ſtrengthen the memory; for every faculty of the mind, as well as every limb of the body, acquires vigour from uſe and exertion. If <hi>players,</hi> whom Locke ſarcaſtically
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:0587000702:243"/>
inſtances, have not all of them the beſt memories in the world, every player perhaps poſſeſſes that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty in a greater degree, than if he had not been called upon to the conſtant exerciſe of it in his profeſſion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Greek</hi> ought not to be excluded, as Locke ſeems to exclude it, from a young gentleman's education. If languages are to be learnt ſo eaſily and ſo readily, as Locke aſſerts, Greek in particular ought not to be omitted; and if thoſe who have been initiated in that language do generally, as he ſays, ſeldom after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards make any proficiency, how can it be expected that they who have not learnt even the rudiments as boys, ſhould attain that language, when men? This however is his method and propoſal. Give then rather in the courſe of their education the power and poſſibility of becoming adepts! (for this is all that can be done by education) and you have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged your duty. Every ſcholar, who makes a very conſiderable progreſs in any language, art, or ſcience, is chiefly his own maſter. <hi>Greek</hi> is at leaſt as neceſſary and ornamental to a gentleman, as a <hi>trade</hi> ſo earneſtly recommended by Locke, and full as polite and beneficial an accompliſhment as the art of perfumery, varniſhing, graving, working in
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:0587000702:244"/>
iron, braſs, or ſilver, cutting or ſetting of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſtones, or even grinding and poliſhing optical glaſſes!</p>
            <p>Rouſſeau is particularly partial to the occupation of a <hi>joiner,</hi> one of the trades recommended by Locke, and takes notice, with an air of triumph, that the Czar Peter exerciſed the employment of a ſhip's carpenter! As to ſtudy, he denies his pupil all books, except Robinſon Cruſoe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hardineſs,</hi> ſo ſtrongly recommended by Locke, is much more likely to be obtained in a Publick School than at home, where the ill-judged tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the parents, of mamas eſpecially, often pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces effeminacy, which expoſes the little maſter to the ridicule of all his Schoolfellows.</p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"<hi>Sheepiſh ſoftneſs</hi> (it is allowed by Locke) often enervates thoſe who are bred like foplings, at home."</q> He owns too on another occaſion that <q rend="inline">"it is <hi>not unuſual</hi> to obſerve the children of gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men's families treat the ſervants of the houſe with domineering words, names of contempt, and an imperious carriage: as if they were of another race, and ſpecies beneath them."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="240" facs="tcp:0587000702:245"/>Other vices and weakneſſes may alſo be learnt in the parlour, the kitchen, and the ſtable. Of the contagion from a train of vicious domeſticks Locke himſelf always appears extremely ſenſible. In one place his words are theſe. <q rend="inline">"They frequently learn from unbred or debauched ſervants untowardly tricks and vices, as otherwiſe they poſſibly would be ignorant of all their lives."</q>
            </p>
            <p>Locke well obſerves that <q rend="inline">"the peculiar <hi>phyſiog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy of the mind</hi> is moſt diſcoverable in children, before cunning hath taught them to hide defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities and conceal their ill inclinations under a diſſembled outſide."</q>
            </p>
            <p>Publick Education is infinitely better calculated than Domeſtick Tuition for the diſcovery of the natural features of the mind. If a boy wears a maſk, his Schoolfellows will be ſure to tear it off, and betray his real diſpoſition to general obſervation; and indeed I ſcarce remember a ſingle inſtance of a lad bred in a great ſchool, who did not retain ſtrong traces of his puerile character all his life after. <hi>The firſt ſcenes of his life</hi> therefore, to uſe Locke's own words, are beſt acted on a Publick Stage, where his <hi>predominant paſſions</hi> and <hi>prevailing inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> being more open and expoſed, are moſt capable
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:0587000702:246"/>
of correction. His very ſchoolfellows become maſters in this inſtance; for youth commonly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines to the benignant and generous ſide.</p>
            <p>In regard to <hi>morals</hi> and <hi>religion,</hi> thoſe great and important conſiderations, if it is duly weighed that the moſt nice and dangerous part of human life occurs between the commencement and concluſion of the period deſtined to education, it is not won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful that publick ſchool-boys, as well as private pupils, ſhould ſometimes be found to be defective or culpable. The ſap will riſe in the ſpring, blights will ſtrike the nobleſt plant, and froſts will nip the faireſt flower: all that can be ſuggeſted by art is wholeſome manure, and providently to fence and guard againſt the heat or inclemency of the ſeaſon. In publick ſchools the duties of religion are by no means neglected. All that Locke enjoins is duly taught. The exerciſes of Saturday evening, and the leſſons of Monday morning, are from the Bible and Prayer book. The daily buſineſs of the ſchool begins, like that of the Houſe of Commons, with reading prayers. One of the ſenior boys officiates as chaplain, and the prayers are in Latin. Even the Sacrament is at a proper age adminiſtered to the young diſciples; and I have witneſſed, amongſt
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:0587000702:247"/>
thoſe early communicants, a ſolemnity of prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and reception, that would have done them honour at any ſucceeding period of their lives.</p>
            <p>Locke, with an air of aſſumed candour towards the maſter of a ſchool introduces the following ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation.</p>
            <q>The difference is great between two or three pupils in the ſame houſe, and three or fourſcore boys lodged up and down. For let the maſter's induſtry and ſkill be never ſo great, it is impoſſible he ſhould have fifty or one hundred ſcholars under his eye any longer than they are in ſchool together: nor can it be expected that he ſhould inſtruct them ſucceſsfully in any thing but their books. The forming of their minds and manners, requiring a conſtant attention and particular application to every ſingle boy, which is impoſſible in a numerous flock, and would be wholly in vain (could he have time to ſtudy and correct every one's particular defects and wrong inclinations) when the lad was to be left to himſelf, or the prevailing infection of his fellows, the greateſt part of the four and twenty hours.</q>
            <p>The abſolute impoſſibility of <hi>a conſtant application and particular attention to every ſingle boy,</hi> and it
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:0587000702:248"/>
may be added the doubt whether ſuch particular at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention would not rather injure than benefit the pupil by encouraging his ſelf-importance, together with many other obvious difficulties, oblige Locke himſelf at laſt to confeſs, as has before been no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed, <q rend="inline">"what ſhall be reſolved in this caſe muſt in a great meaſure be left to the parents to be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by their circumſtances and conveniences."</q> But not to take advantage of ſuch a reluctant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, let us rather recommend to the maſter of a great ſchool, to keep a watchful eye on the conduct of the boys during the intervals of the ſchool hours, and carefully by himſelf and his aſſiſtants to viſit and regulate the boarding houſes. The maſters and miſtreſſes of thoſe houſes muſt ſubmit to his direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or abandon their employments: for what parent would commit his ſon to a family ſuppoſed to be adverſe to the general diſcipline of the ſchool; and whoſe inmates are indulged in irregularity and diſſipation? It is requiſite alſo for Schoolmaſters to be rather backward in granting leave for too fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent viſits at home; for where they too much pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail, it has happened that <hi>the home</hi> and <hi>the ſchool</hi> have each in their turns, been pleaded by the young truant as an apology for his abſence from both. And this is one of the moſt fatal inroads from private
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:0587000702:249"/>
miſmanagement on the beneficial influence of Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Education, where the wiſdom of the inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is counteracted by the indiſcretion of indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals.</p>
            <p>Suppoſe an author equally inclined to depreciate Domeſtick Tuition, as Locke has in his little tract ſhewn himſelf diſpoſed to ridicule and vilify Publick Education, might not ſuch a writer, abandoning the ſtraight path of candour and impartiality, and aſſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the manners of a ſatyrical pleader and declaimer, expreſs himſelf to the following purport?</p>
            <q>I cannot bear to ſee the free ſpirit and generous nature of a youth, that ſhould look abroad into the world of which he is himſelf a part, <q rend="inline">"ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin'd, cribb'd, confin'd"</q> in the narrow limits of a private family, a puny fondling dandled on the lap of his mother, or at beſt perhaps a tiny ſportſman or ſoaker in company of his father. If they have a country parſon in the houſe, who teaches my young maſter to read, he teaches him to ſmoke at the ſame time, and envelopes in the ſame cloud his perſon and his underſtanding<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> The firſt Latin that he conveys to him is the old axiom of <hi>in vino veritas,</hi> and his Greek (if he
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:0587000702:250"/>
has any) is all <hi>Anacreontick.</hi> It is odds indeed whether his learning extends ſo far. He is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps a mere <hi>Lingo,</hi> or at beſt a <hi>Square</hi> or a <hi>Thwackum</hi> in Mr. Allworthy's ſplendid manſion. Over the ſervants of the family the heir apparent is a little tyrant, and from his ſubjects he learns, as ſoon as he can ſpeak, every ſpecies of provincial bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bariſm; and as ſoon as he can think, or act, every kind of vice and meanneſs. <hi>Virtue, wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, breeding,</hi> and <hi>learning,</hi> are ſeldom to be found under a private roof; but muſt be ſought, like the Deity, in a ſolemn temple conſecrated to ſuch ſacred worſhip!</q>
            <p>Waving ridicule and irony, and adhering as the ſubject requires, to ſtrict truth, it muſt be confeſſed that Publick Education as well as Domeſtick Tui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, has its faults: but many of the corruptions of ſchools are brought by the ſcholars from home. At home are the fooliſh, the idle, and vicious ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, ſo much dreaded by Locke. At home indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence takes the place of diſcipline, and from home they often bring ſums of money far beyond their little occaſions, by which artificial wants are created and diſorders introduced. This laſt evil, wholly owing to the indiſcretion of friends and parents, has
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:0587000702:251"/>
been particularly noxious to Publick Schools. Maſters can only controul and check its influence. Friends and parents alone can prevent and extirpate it.</p>
            <p>Publick Schools ought to cultivate the <hi>mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,</hi> as well as the <hi>claſſicks.</hi> Both might be taught ſufficiently, for the initiation of pupils, during their ſtay at a Publick School; from whence they ought to be ſent to the Univerſities, equally prepared to purſue their philoſophical as their claſſical ſtudies.</p>
            <p>Publick Schools alſo generally detain their pupils too long. Youths ſhould be diſmiſſed from ſchools at the age of ſixteen or ſeventeen at the lateſt. They are afterwards commencing young men, and will not patiently ſubmit to the corrections of children. When the boys at Weſtminſter rebelled becauſe a ſenior ſcholar between eighteen and nineteen years of age would not ſubmit to the diſcipline of the rod, Dr. Barker, then a prebend, contended that the ſcholar was in the right. It was wrong he ſaid, to attempt to ſcourge a youth at that age. It was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt <hi>ſodomy.</hi> Pity that Dr. Barker was not a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral!</p>
            <p>In general it is unadviſable for parents to ſend their ſons to a Great Publick School, ſooner than at
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:0587000702:252"/>
the period of nine or ten years of age; not that I would wiſh the preceding period to be loſt and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in ignorance and idleneſs. Let their children in the mean while be ſent to ſome preparatory aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demy, where they may be taught to write, to read, to ſpeak French, to dance, to draw, and the rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Latin according to the grammar of the ſchool for which they are afterwards intended. A maſter who cannot, by himſelf and his aſſiſtants, ſupply his little ſtudents with theſe helps, is unfit to govern ſuch an academy.</p>
            <p>One great reaſon for preference of Publick to Private Education is this. Schoolboys, being at in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervals called home, partake occaſionally of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments and ſociety of a family. Private pupils, conſtantly confined within one narrow circle, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire none of the freedom and ſpirit of a Publick Education.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Travel,</hi> where it can be afforded, cannot be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with the benefit that ought to attend it from the firſt ſtage of life, one of the periods to which Locke deſtines it: but being certainly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper at the uſual time and in the uſual mode, may be reſerved to Locke's laſt Stage, and therefore
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:0587000702:253"/>
properly ſucceeding to a removal from the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities; when the young traveller, if not fit and able to go alone, had better not go at all.</p>
            <p>Milton has given <hi>A tractate on Education,</hi> contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a plan of a ſchool and univerſity in one, intended to annihilate all other ſchools and univerſities, by inſtituting as many of ſuch academies as might be neceſſary in different parts of the kingdom. Yet in this plan, romantick as he almoſt himſelf ſeems to think it, he has proceeded on principles very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from thoſe of Locke, and ſhewn himſelf the friend and advocate of Publick Education. He rather follows the principles of Plato and Xenophon, than adopts the ſyſtem of Locke.</p>
            <p>His propoſed number of pupils is an hundred and fifty, more or leſs. He directs the teaching of lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, <hi>not by rote,</hi> but by <hi>grammar,</hi> and thoſe not only modern but ancient, and of the ancient not only Latin, but Greek and Hebrew, with the Chaldean and Syrian dialects. So far from objecting to <hi>repetitions,</hi> that he enjoins Grammar leſſons <hi>to be got by heart,</hi> and poems, and orations not merely to be read, but <q rend="inline">"<hi>put to memory</hi> and ſolemnly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced with right accent and grace."</q> And though, like Locke; he regrets the time thrown
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:0587000702:254"/>
away in learning one or two languages, yet himſelf appropriates no leſs time than nine years, from twelve to twenty one, to education. He alſo fixes the age of twenty three or twenty four as the proper time for travel, if travel be neceſſary. So that on the whole, though I have been hardy enough to enter the liſts with ſuch a giant antagoniſt as Locke, I have Milton to ſupport me.</p>
            <p>It appears indeed, on the face of Locke's tract, that the preſent plan of education is highly prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the ſyſtem that prevailed at the time of his writing. The medical management of children is ſo much improved, that many things which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commends, as contrary to the practice of thoſe times, are now in general uſe: and as to the cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivation of their minds, were he now living, he would no longer lament the want of a ſixpenny Hiſtory of the Bible, or an Aeſop with pictures to every fable. The bookſellers have provided the little ſtudents a Lilliputian library, and every toyſhop and Stationer will ſupply them with polygons for the vowels, or the whole alphabet in cards or ivory, unleſs they ſhould rather chuſe to ſwallow it in gin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerbread. Geography is learnt by the dice, like the Game of the Gooſe; maps are diſſected into
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:0587000702:255"/>
kingdoms, and provinces; and perhaps to Locke himſelf we owe many of thoſe valuable atchieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>Univerſities, thoſe dry nurſes that ſucceed to the firſt feminaries of education, are alſo much improved in their principles and practice ſince the aeras of Milton and Locke: and if the ſtudents do not at their departure make due progreſs in their ſeveral purſuits and profeſſions, the failure muſt be imputed to themſelves, who have ſo ill applied the time they have paſſed there. At one univerſity ſince the time of Milton, a great and tranſcendent genius has ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced the career of ſcience as Milton himſelf car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the flights of poetry, <hi>beyond the viſible diurnal ſphere.</hi> At the other an acute and able juriſprudent, whoſe early loſs we ſtill lament, inſtituted a courſe of lectures of eſtabliſhed authority to the profeſſional reader, as well as affording, in the moſt elegant terms, a code of law neceſſary for the inſtruction and peruſal of every private gentleman. The ſtudents too are now leſs bewildered in the labyrinths of lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick and metaphyſicks. To their original reſiſtance to the principles of Locke perhaps we owe much of his prejudice to Publick Education. His prejudices, were he now a living witneſs of the cordial reception
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:0587000702:256"/>
of his doctrines, would perhaps vaniſh: though he might ſtill inſiſt, and not without juſtice, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Tirocinium<note n="*" place="bottom">The <hi>Tirocinium</hi> forms part of a collection of poems by W. Cowper, Eſq. one of which poems is <hi>The Taſk,</hi> a moſt admirable work in blank verſe, which gives a moſt promiſing earneſt of the author's intended Tranſlation of Homer in that meaſure.</note> of my worthy and ingenious friend Mr. Cowper, that <hi>Diſcipline</hi> ſhould ſtand as porter at the gate of every college.</p>
            <p>The ſtudy of Geography, Chronology, Hiſtory, the Elements of Natural Philoſophy and Geometry, may eaſily be reconciled to the plan of the early part of Publick Education, and ſhould be incorporated with it. As to dancing, fencing, and accounts, theſe are generally taught by ſeparate maſters, according to the direction of the parents without need of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular injunction or ſerious diſſertation. Painting and muſick are indeed not in ſo general requeſt, and the truth is that gentlemen practitioners either miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apply much of their time, or fall infinitely below the moſt common artiſts of either profeſſion. If a <hi>trade</hi> is abſolutely neceſſary to a ſtudent and a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, that of a <hi>gardener</hi> ſeems to be the moſt
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:0587000702:257"/>
healthy and agreeable, to which in bad weather may be added the occupation of a joiner or car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penter, as on that account both Locke and Rouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeau recommend it. And a ſchoolboy is perhaps more qualified even for ſuch an apprenticeſhip, as well as for the more honourable and hazardous avo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of the army or navy, than a young gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man bred in a private family.</p>
            <p>Locke concludes his tract on education with theſe words.</p>
            <q>Though I am now come to a concluſion of what obvious remarks have ſuggeſted to me con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Education, <hi>I would not have it thought that I look on it as a juſt treatiſe on this ſubject.</hi> There are a thouſand other things that may need conſideration, eſpecially if one ſhould take in the various tempers, different inclinations, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular defaults that are to be found in children, and preſcribe proper remedies. The variety is ſo great, that it would require a volume; nor would that reach it. Each man's mind has ſome peculiarity, as well as his face, that diſtinguiſhes him from all others, and there are poſſibly ſcarce two children who can be conducted by exactly the ſame method. Beſides that I think a prince, a nobleman, and an ordinary gentleman's ſon,
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:0587000702:258"/>
ſhould have different ways of breeding. But having had here only ſome general views in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the main end, and aims in education, and thoſe deſigned for a gentleman's ſon who being then very little, I conſidered only as white paper or wax, to be moulded and faſhioned as one pleaſes, I have touched little more than thoſe heads which I judged neceſſary for the breeding of a young gentleman of his condition in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral; and have now publiſhed theſe my occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſional thoughts with this hope; that though this be far from being a compleat treatiſe on this ſubject, or ſuch as that every one may find what will juſt fit his child in it, yet it may give ſome ſmall light to thoſe whoſe concern for their dear little ones makes them ſo irregularly bold, that they dare venture to conſult their own reaſon in the education of their children, rather than wholly to rely upon Old Cuſtom.</q>
            <p>If Locke could not call his work <hi>a compleat trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe on Education,</hi> much leſs can I preſume to ſubmit theſe looſe thoughts to the reader in that light; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially as they are not offered under that idea, but mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to vindicate Publick Eſtabliſhments from cenſures that appeared, coming from whomſoever, unjuſt and illiberal. If the awful and revered name of Locke
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:0587000702:259"/>
gave a ſanction to prejudices, it was but acting with the ſpirit, though without the talents, of Locke, to combat them. Almoſt all the ſyſtems of Private Education appear a romantick theory, not reducible to practice. Locke himſelf ſays <q rend="inline">"that a prince, a nobleman, and an ordinary gentleman's ſon ſhould have a different way of breeding."</q> Yet the attention enjoined to be given to his pupil, not to dwell on the character of his <hi>Tutor,</hi> are ſcarce to be expected even by a prince, though he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes that his views and main end were to ſuggeſt hints on thoſe heads, neceſſary for the education of <hi>a gentleman's ſon.</hi> A Telemachus may obtain a Minerva for a Mentor; an Engliſh Prince may command a Markham or a Hurd: but the ſon of a gentleman, the ſon of a nobleman I will venture to ſay will at leaſt derive as much benefit from a Publick Education as from Private Tuition. Neither <hi>themes</hi> nor <hi>verſes,</hi> ſo dreaded by Locke, impede their progreſs to the firſt offices, and moſt important duties. Theſe are facts founded on experience, and the many illuſtrious characters that have begun their career on a royal foundation will fully juſtify my aſſertion.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>CASTING my eye on the London Gazette a few days ago, it gave me infinite pleaſure to ſee particular Orders iſſued from the War-Office, <q rend="inline">"That all His Majeſty's Regiments of Horſe and Dragoons, except the Light Horſe, ſhall be mounted only on ſuch horſes, as have their <hi>full tails, without the leaſt part taken from them.</hi>"</q>
            </p>
            <p>Never ſurely did the tyrant man exerciſe a more wanton piece of cruelty over his ſubjects of the brute creation, than in clipping the Tails of the horſes, and robbing them of their fair and natural proportion. Caſtration itſelf, cruel as it is, carries to ſportſmen and epicures ſome apology along with
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:0587000702:261"/>
it. Fowls become a plumper and more delicious morſel, after being made capons; and horſes, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted into geldings, are thereby rendered more tract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. But we of the <hi>Yahoo</hi> ſpecies have nothing to plead in our excuſe to the generous <hi>Houhnymn</hi> for thus barbarouſly depriving him of a part of his frame, which nature has wiſely given him for ſeveral purpoſes both of uſe and ornament.</p>
            <p>Cuſtom, it is true, has long authoriſed this ſavage practice; yet it has not been able to reconcile us to it entirely. In ſculpture, painting, and tapeſtry, horſes ſtill wear <hi>their full tails, without the leaſt part taken from them.</hi> Do but contemplate the figure of a king on horſeback on a pedeſtal, or of a general in a battle piece, either on canvas or in the arras; the mane and tail of the horſe is as full and flowing as the periwig of the rider. The tail of Bucephalus himſelf has not a bolder ſweep than that of the noble beaſts who bear Lewis the Fourteenth, or the duke of Marlborough. What ſhould we ſay to Stubbs, were he to put a ſet of docked geldings to the chariot of Phaeton? Or how ſhould we conſider the very ſame mutilations, were we to make the experiments on other quadrupeds? Figure to yourſelf the view of a paſture covered with bulls, cows, ſheep, and oxen,
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:0587000702:262"/>
grazing on a common, or a mountain, as bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breeched as a highlander!</p>
            <p>This practice alſo, to the ſhame of our age and nation be it ſpoken, is both local and recent. In the antient times of chivalry what figure would a knight have made on ſuch a maimed ſteed! and what damſel would have deigned to mount a bob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailed palfry? The beginning even of the preſent century ſaw our horſes ſtill in poſſeſſion of their <hi>full tails.</hi> It was then the <hi>Bon Ton.</hi>
               <q rend="inline">"Fopping<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton's <hi>long tails</hi> were known on every road in chriſtendom."</q> At preſent except Lord Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth's ſet of duns, and the royal <hi>octave</hi> of cream-coloured horſes, we have, alas, no <hi>long tails</hi> in the kingdom. But the year one thouſand ſeven hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and ſixty four is, I hope, the happy aera from whence we may date their reſtoration. All the Engliſh Cavalry, except the Light Horſe, <q rend="inline">"ſhall be mounted only on ſuch horſes, as have their full tails <hi>without the leaſt part taken from them.</hi>"</q> It was indeed, high time for ſuch a reformation. Many centuries elapſed before our conſtitution pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided a law againſt attempts to deface and maim the human body: and it was now become equally ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to iſſue the above Orders from the War-Office,
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:0587000702:263"/>
which it is hoped, will operate as a kind of <hi>Coven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try Act,</hi> againſt <hi>hogging, docking,</hi> and <hi>nicking,</hi> the horſes.</p>
            <p>As a true patriot, I am equally anxious to wipe off a national reflection, as to alter the faſhion. This cruel practice is one of the ſtains on our man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, which has given our enemies occaſion to ſtyle us <hi>The Savages of Europe.</hi> In France neither horſe, nor man, nor woman, can have too much hair, but all carry it unviolated on their heads and their tails, <q rend="inline">"without the leaſt part taken from them."</q> In England full-bottoms and full tails vaniſhed at the ſame period. Crop-eared coxcombs and docked horſes, <hi>hogged</hi> manes and <hi>hogged</hi> toupees, came in together. A wonderful analogy between the treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our fellow countrymen's heads, and their horſes tails! From this analogy it is that our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours have imbibed the aſſociated idea of the ſavage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our manners; and an Engliſhman at Paris is ſure to be reproached with the barbarity of our beheading kings, and docking horſes.</p>
