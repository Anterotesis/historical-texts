            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Faults, for I am Conſcious of ſeveral. I confeſs I deſign'd (whatever Vanity or Ambition occaſion'd that Deſign) to have written a true and regular Comedy, but I found it an Undertaking which put me in mind of—<hi>Sudet multum, fruſtraque laboret au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus idem.</hi> And now to make Amends for the Vanity of ſuch a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, I do confeſs both the Attempt, and the imperfect Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance. Yet I muſt take the Boldneſs to ſay, I have not miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in the whole; for the Mechanical part of it is perfect. That I may ſay with as little Vanity, as a Builder may ſay he has built a Houſe according to the Model laid down before him; or a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diner that he has ſet his Flowers in a Knot of ſuch or ſuch a Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure. I deſign'd the Moral firſt, and to that Moral I invented the Fable, and do not know that I have borrow'd one Hint of it any where. I made the Plot as ſtrong as I could, becauſe it was ſingle, and I made it ſingle, becauſe I would avoid Confuſion, and was reſolved to preſerve the three Unities of the Drama, which I have viſibly done to the utmoſt Severity. This is what I ought not to obſerve upon my ſelf; but the Ignorance and Malice of the greater Part of the Audience is ſuch, that they would make a Man turn Herald to his own Play, and Blazon every Character. However, Sir, this Diſcourſe is very impertinent to you, whoſe
<pb facs="tcp:1227801500:3"/>
Judgement much better can diſcern the Faults, than I can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe them; and whoſe good Nature, like that of a Lover, will find out thoſe hidden Beauties (if there are any ſuch) which it wou'd be great Immodeſty for me to diſcover. I think I don't ſpeak im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly when I call you a <hi>Lover</hi> of Poetry; for it is very well known ſhe has been a very kind Miſtreſs to you; ſhe has not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd you the laſt Favour; you have enjoy'd her, and ſhe has been fruitful in a moſt Beautiful Iſſue—If I break off abruptly here, I hope every Body will underſtand that it is to avoid a Commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which, as it is your Due, would be moſt eaſie for me to pay, and too troubleſome for you to receive.</p>
            <p>I have, ſince the Acting of this Play, harken'd after the Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which have been made to it; for I was Conſcious where a true Critick might have put me upon my Defence. I was prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for their Attack; and am pretty confident I could have vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated ſome Parts, and excuſed others; and where there were any plain Miſcarriages, I would moſt ingenuouſly have confeſs'd 'em. But I have not heard any thing ſaid ſufficient to provoke an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. That which looks moſt like an Objection, does not relate in particular to this Play, but to all or moſt that ever have been written; and that is Soliloquy. Therefore I will anſwer it, not only for my own ſake, but to ſave others the Trouble, to whom it may hereafter be Objected.</p>
            <p>I grant, that for a Man to Talk to himſelf, appears abſurd and unnatural; and indeed it is ſo in moſt Caſes; but the Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which may attend the Occaſion, make great Alteration. It of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes happens to a Man, to have Deſigns which require him to himſelf, and in their Nature cannot admit of a Confident. Such, for certain, is all Villany; and other leſs miſchievous Intentions may be very improper to be Communicated to a ſecond Perſon. In ſuch a Caſe therefore the Audience muſt obſerve, whether the Perſon upon the Stage takes any notice of them at all, or no. For if he ſuppoſes any one to be by, when he talks to himſelf, it is monſtrous and ridiculous to the laſt degree. Nay, not only in this caſe, but in any Part of a Play, if there is expreſſed any know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of an Audience, it is inſufferable. But otherwiſe, when a Man in Soliloquy reaſons with himſelf, and <hi>Pro</hi>'s and <hi>Con</hi>'s, and weighs all his Deſigns: We ought not to imagine that this Man either talks to us, or to himſelf; he is only thinking, and thinking ſuch Matter as were inexcuſable Folly in him to ſpeak. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we are conceal'd Spectators of the Plot in agitation, and the Poet finds it neceſſary to let us know the whole Myſtery of his
<pb facs="tcp:1227801500:4"/>
Contrivance, he is willing to inform us of this Perſon's Thoughts; and to that end is forc'd to make uſe of the expedient of Speech, no other better way being yet invented for the Communication of Thought.</p>
            <p>Another very wrong Objection has been made by ſome who have not taken Leiſure to diſtinguiſh the Characters. The Hero of the Play, as they are pleas'd to call him, (meaning <hi>Mellefont</hi>) is a Gull, and made a Fool, and cheated. Is every Man a Gull and a Fool that is deceiv'd? At that rate I'm afraid the two Claſſes of Men, will be reduc'd to one, and the Knaves themſelves be at a loſs to juſtifie their Title: But if an Open-hearted honeſt Man, who has an entire Confidence in one whom he takes to be his Friend, and whom he has oblig'd to be ſo; and who (to confirm him in his Opinion) in all Appearance, and upon ſeveral Trials has been ſo: If this Man be deceiv'd by the Treachery of the other; muſt he of neceſſity commence Fool immediately, only becauſe the other has prov'd a Villam? Ay, but there was Caution given to <hi>Mellefont</hi> in the Firſt Act by his Friend <hi>Careleſs.</hi> Of what Nature was that Caution? Only to give the Audience ſome Light into the Character of <hi>Maskwell,</hi> before his Appearance; and not to convince <hi>Mellefont</hi> of his Treachery; for that was more than <hi>Careleſs</hi> was then able to do: He never knew <hi>Maskwell</hi> guilty of any Villany; he was only a ſort of Man which he did not like. As for his ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting his Familiarity with my Lady <hi>Touchwood:</hi> Let 'em exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the Anſwer that <hi>Mellefont</hi> makes him, and compare it with the Conduct of <hi>Maskwell</hi>'s Character through the Play.</p>
            <p>I would beg'em again to look into the Character of <hi>Maskwell</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they accuſe <hi>Mellefont</hi> of Weakneſs for being deceiv'd by him. For upon ſumming up the Enquiry into this Objection, it may be found they have miſtaken Cunning in one Character, for Folly in another.</p>
            <p>But there is one thing, at which I am more concerned than all the falſe Criticiſms that are made upon me; and that is, ſome of the Ladies are offended. I am heartily ſorry for it, for I declare I would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſoblige all the Criticks in the World than one of the Fair Sex. They are concerned that I have repreſented ſome Women Vicious and Affected: How can I help it? It is the Buſineſs of a Comick Poet to paint the Vices and Follies of Human-kind; and there are but two Sexes, Male, and Female, <hi>Men,</hi> and <hi>Women,</hi> which have a Title to Humanity: And if I leave one half of them out, the Work will be imperfect. I ſhould be very glad of an opportunity to make my Compliment to thoſe Ladies who are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended: But they can no more expect it in a Comedy, than to be
<pb facs="tcp:1227801500:5"/>
Tickled by a Surgeon, when he's letting 'em Blood. They who are Virtuous or Diſcreet, can hardly be offended, for ſuch Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters as theſe diſtinguiſh <hi>them,</hi> and make their Beauties more ſhining and obſerv'd: And they who are of the other kind, may nevertheleſs paſs for ſuch, by ſeeming not to be diſpleas'd, or touch'd with the Satire of this <hi>Comedy.</hi> Thus have they alſo wrongfully accus'd me of doing them a Prejudice, when I have in reality done them a Service.</p>
            <p>I have heard there are ſome who intend to accuſe this Play of Smuttineſs and Bawdy: But I can hardly believe it, becauſe I took a particular Care to avoid it, and if they find any in it, it is of their own making, for I did not deſign it to be ſo underſtood. But to avoid my ſaying any Thing upon a Subject, which has been ſo admirably handled before, and for their better Inſtruction, I earneſtly recommend to their Peruſal, the Epiſtle Dedicatory before the <hi>Plain-Dealer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You will pardon me, Sir, for the Freedom I take of making Anſwers to other People, in an Epiſtle which ought wholly to be ſacred to you: But ſince I intend the Play to be ſo too, I hope I may take the more Liberty of Juſtifying it, where it is in the Right.</p>
            <p>I muſt now, Sir, declare to the World, how kind you have been to my Endeavours; for in regard of what was well meant, you have excus'd what was ill perform'd. I beg you would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue the ſame Method in your Acceptance of this Dedication. I know no other way of making a Return to that Humanity you ſhew'd, in protecting an Infant, but by Enrolling it in your Service, now that it is of Age and come into the World. Therefore be pleas'd to accept of this as an Acknowledgement of the Favour you have ſhewn me, and an Earneſt of the real Service and Gratitude of,</p>

            <lg>
               <l>WELL then; the promis'd Hour is come at laſt;</l>
               <l>The preſent Age of Wit obſcures the paſt:</l>
               <l>Strong were our Syres; and as they Fought they Writ,</l>
               <l>Conqu'ring with Force of Arms, and Dint of Wit;</l>
               <l>Theirs was the Giant Race, before the Flood;</l>
               <l>And thus, when <hi>Charles</hi> Return'd, our Empire ſtood.</l>
               <l>Like <hi>Janus</hi> he the ſtubborn Soil manur'd,</l>
               <l>With Rules of Husbandry the Rankneſs cur'd:</l>
               <l>Tam'd us to Manners, when the Stage was rude;</l>
               <l>And boiſtrous <hi>Engliſh</hi> Wit, with Art indu'd.</l>
               <l>Our Age was cultivated thus at length;</l>
               <l>But what we gain'd in Skill, we loſt in Strength.</l>
               <l>Our Builders were, with Want of Genius, curſt;</l>
               <l>The Second Temple was not like the Firſt:</l>
               <l>'Till You, the beſt <hi>Vitruvius,</hi> come at length;</l>
               <l>Our Beauties equal; but excel our Strength.</l>
               <l>Firm <hi>Dorique</hi> Pillars found Your ſolid Baſe:</l>
               <l>The fair <hi>Corinthian</hi> crowns the higher Space;</l>
               <l>Thus all below is Strength, and all above is Grace.</l>
               <l>In eaſie Dialogue is <hi>Fletcher</hi>'s Praiſe:</l>
               <l>He mov'd the Mind, but had no Pow'r to raiſe.</l>
               <l>Great <hi>Johnſon</hi> did by Strength of Judgment pleaſe:</l>
               <l>Yet doubling <hi>Fletcher</hi>'s Force, he wants his Eaſe.</l>
               <l>In diff'ring Tallents both adorn'd their Age;</l>
               <l>One for the Study, t' other for the Stage.</l>
               <l>But both to <hi>Congreve</hi> juſtly ſhall ſubmit,</l>
               <l>One match'd in Judgment, both o'er-match'd in Wit.</l>
               <l>In Him all Beauties of this Age we ſee;</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Etherege</hi> his Courtſhip, <hi>Southern</hi>'s Purity;</l>

               <l>MOors have this Way (as Story tells) to know</l>
               <l>Whether their Brats are truly got, or no;</l>
               <l>Into the Sea the New-born Babe is thrown,</l>
               <l>There, as Inſtinct directs, to Swim, or Drawn.</l>
               <l>A Barbarous Device, to try if Spouſe</l>
               <l>Have kept Religiouſly her Nuptial Vows.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Such are the Trials, Poets make of Plays:</l>
               <l>Only they truſt to more inconſtant Seas;</l>
               <l>So, does our Author, this his Child commit</l>
               <l>To the Tempeſtuous Mercy of the Pit,</l>
               <l>To know if it be truly born of Wit.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Criticks avaunt; for you are Fiſh of Prey,</l>
               <l>And feed, like Sharks, upon an Infant Play.</l>
               <l>Be ev'ry Monſter of the Deep away;</l>
               <l>Let's have a fair Trial, and a clear Sea.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Let Nature work, and do not Damn too ſoon,</l>
               <l>For Life will ſtruggle long, 'ere it ſink down:</l>
               <l>Let it at leaſt riſe Thrice, before it Drown.</l>
               <l>Let us conſider, had it been our Fate,</l>
               <l>Thus hardly to be prov'd Legitimate!</l>
               <l>I will not ſay, we'd all in Danger been,</l>
               <l>Were each to ſuffer for his Mother's Sin:</l>
               <l>But by my Troth I cannot avoid thinking,</l>
               <l>How nearly ſome good Men might have 'ſcap'd Sinking.</l>
               <l>But Heav'n be prais'd, this Cuſtom is confin'd</l>
               <l>Alone to th' Offspring of the Muſes kind:</l>
               <l>Our Chriſtian Cuckolds are more bent to Pity;</l>
               <l>I know not one <hi>Moor</hi>-Husband in the City.</l>
               <l>I th' Good Man's Arms the Chopping Baſtard thrives,</l>
               <l>For he thinks all his own, that is his Wives.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Whatever Fate is for this Play deſign'd</l>
               <l>The Poet's ſure he ſhall ſome Comfort find:</l>
               <l>For if his Muſe has play'd him falſe, the worſt</l>
               <l>That can befall him, is, to be Divorc'd;</l>
               <l>You Husbands Judge, if that, be to be Curs'd.</l>

Still it gave me leſs Perplexity to prevent the Succeſs of her Diſpleaſure, than to avoid the Importunities of her Love; and of two Evils, I thought my ſelf favour'd in her Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. But whether urg'd by her Deſpair, and the ſhort Proſpect of Time ſhe ſaw, to accompliſh her Deſigns; whether the Hopes of Revenge, or of her Love, terminated in the View of this my Marriage with <hi>Cynthia,</hi> I know not; but this Morning ſhe ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd me in my Bed.—</p>

               <p>Ha, ha, ha, I know her Temper.—Well, you muſt know then, that all my Contrivances were but Bubbles; 'till at laſt I pretended to have been long ſecretly in Love with <hi>Cynthia;</hi> that did my Buſineſs; that convinc'd your Aunt, I might be truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; ſince it was as much my Intereſt as hers to break the Match: Then ſhe thought my Jealouſie might qualifie me to aſſiſt her in her Revenge. And, in ſhort, in that Belief, told me the Secrets of her Heart. At length we made this Agreement, if I accompliſh her Deſigns (as I told you before) ſhe has ingag'd to put <hi>Cynthia</hi> with all her Fortune into my Power.</p>

               <p>'Till then, Succeſs will attend me; for when I meet you, I meet the only Obſtacle to my Fortune. <hi>Cynthia,</hi> let thy Beauty gild my Crimes; and whatſoever I commit of Treachery or Deceit, ſhall be imputed to me as a Merit—Treachery, what Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery? Love cancels all the Bonds of Friendſhip, and ſets Men right upon their firſt Foundations.</p>
               <p>Duty to Kings, Piety to Parents, Gratitude to Benefactors, and Fidelity to Friends, are different and particular Ties: But the Name of Rival cuts 'em all aſunder, and is a general Acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance—Rival is equal, and Love like Death an univerſal Level<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler of Mankind. Ha! But is there not ſuch a Thing as Honeſty? Yes, and whoſoever has it about him, bears an Enemy in his Breaſt: For your Honeſt Man, as I take it, is that nice, ſcrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, conſcientious Perſon, who will cheat no Body but himſelf; ſuch another Coxcomb, as your Wiſe Man, who is too hard for all the World, and will be made a Fool of by no body, but him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: Ha, ha, ha. Well for Wiſdom and Honeſty, give me Cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and Hypocriſie; oh, 'tis ſuch a Pleaſure, to angle for fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fac'd Fools! Then that hungry Gudgeon Credulity, will bite at any thing—Why, let me ſee, I have the ſame Face, the ſame Words and Accents, when I ſpeak what I do think; and when I ſpeak what I do not think—the very ſame—and dear Diſſimulation is the only Art, not to be known from Nature.</p>
               <l>Why will Mankind be Fools, and be deceiv'd?</l>
               <l>And why are Friends and Lovers Oaths believ'd?</l>
               <l>When each, who ſearches ſtrictly his own Mind,</l>

            <byline>Spoken by Mrs. <hi>Mountford.</hi>
            </byline>
            <l>COuld Poets but foreſee how Plays would take,</l>
            <l>Then they could tell what Epilogues to make;</l>
            <l>Whether to thank or blame their Audience moſt:</l>
            <l>But that late Knowledge does much Hazard coſt,</l>
            <l>'Till Dice are thrown, there's nothing won, nor loſt.</l>
            <l>So 'till the Thief has ſtoll'n, he cannot know</l>
            <l>Whether he ſhall eſcape the Law, or no.</l>
            <l>But Poets run much greater Hazards far,</l>
            <l>Than they who ſtand their Trials at the Barr;</l>
            <l>The Law provides a Curb for its own Fury,</l>
            <l>And ſuffers Judges to direct the Jury.</l>
            <l>But in this Court, what Diff'rence does appear!</l>
            <l>For every one's both Judge and Jury here;</l>
            <l>Nay, and what's worſe, an Executioner.</l>
            <l>All have a Right and Title to ſome Part,</l>
            <l>Each chuſing that in which he has moſt Art.</l>
            <l>The dreadful Men of Learning all Confound,</l>
            <l>Unleſs the Fable's good, and Moral ſound.</l>
            <l>The Vizor-Masks, that are in Pit and Gallery,</l>
            <l>Approve, or Damn, the Repartee and Rallery.</l>
            <l>The Lady Criticks, who are better read,</l>
            <l>Enquire if Characters are nicely bred;</l>
            <l>If the ſoft things are penn'd and ſpoke with Grace:</l>
            <l>They Judge of Action too, and Time, and Place;</l>
            <l>In which we do not doubt but they're diſcerning,</l>
            <l>For that's a kind of <hi>Aſſignation Learning.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Beaus judge of Dreſs; the Witlings judge of Songs;</l>
            <l>The Cuckoldom, of Ancient Right, to Cits belongs.</l>
            <l>Thus poor Poets, the Favour are deny'd,</l>
            <l>Even to make Exceptions, when they're Try'd.</l>
            <l>'Tis hard that they muſt ev'ry one admit;</l>
            <l>Methinks I ſee ſome Faces in the Pit,</l>
            <l>Which muſt of Conſequence be Foes to Wit.</l>
            <l>You who can Judge, to Sentence may proceed;</l>
            <l>But tho' he cannot Write, let him be freed</l>
            <l>At leaſt from their Contempt, who cannot Read.</l>
