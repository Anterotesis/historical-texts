            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

CHARACTER
OF
<hi>KATHARINE,</hi>
LATE
Ducheſ of <hi>Buckinghamſhire,</hi>
&amp;c. &amp;c.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>HE was the Daughter of <hi>James</hi> the
Second, and of the Counteſs of <hi>Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter,</hi>
who inherited the Integrity and
Virtue of her Father with happier For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.
She was married firſt to <hi>James</hi> Earl of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gleſey,</hi>
and ſecondly to <hi>John Sheffield</hi> Duke of
<hi>Buckinghamſhire</hi> and <hi>Normanby</hi>; with the former
She exerciſed the Virtues of <hi>Patience and Suffering,</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:0294500300:3"/>
as long as there was any Hopes of doing Good by
either; with the latter all other <hi>Conjugal Virtues.</hi>
The Man of fineſt Senſe and ſharpeſt Diſcernment,
She had the Happineſs to pleaſe; and in that, found
her only Pleaſure. When he died, it ſeem'd as
if his Spirit was only breathed into her, to fulfill
what he had begun, to perform what he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certed,
and to preſerve and watch over what he had
left, <hi>his only Son</hi>; in the Care of whoſe Health,
the forming of whoſe Mind, and the Improvement
of whoſe Fortune, She acted with the Conduct and
Senſe of the <hi>Father,</hi> ſoften'd, but not overcome
with the Tenderneſs of the <hi>Mother.</hi> Her Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
was ſuch as muſt have made a Figure,
had it been in a Man; but the Modeſty of her Sex
threw a Veil over its Luſtre, which nevertheleſs
ſuppreſs'd only the Expreſſion, not the Exertion of
it; for her Senſe was not ſuperior to her Reſolution,
which, when once She was in the Right, preſerv'd
her from making it only a Tranſition to the Wrong,
the frequent Weakneſs even of the beſt Women.
She often followed wiſe Counſel, but ſometimes went
before it, always with Succeſs. She was poſſeſs'd
of a Spirit, which aſſiſted her to get the better
of thoſe Accidents which admitted of any Redreſs,
and enabled her to ſupport outwardly with Decency
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0294500300:4"/>
and Dignity thoſe which admitted of none; yet melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
inwardly through almoſt her whole Life, at a
Succeſſion of melancholy and affecting Objects, the
Loſs of all her Children, the Misfortunes of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
and Friends, publick and private,</hi> and the
Death of thoſe who were deareſt to her. Her
Heart was as compaſſionate as it was great: Her
Affections warm even to Sollicitude: Her Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
not violent or jealous, but rational and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevering:
Her Gratitude equal and conſtant to the
Living; to the Dead boundleſs and heroical. What
Perſon ſoever She found worthy of her Eſteem,
She wou'd not give up for any Power on Earth;
and the greateſt on Earth whom She cou'd not
Eſteem, obtain'd from her no farther Tribute than
Decency. Her Good-Will was wholly directed by
Merit, not by Accident; not meaſured by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
they profeſs'd for her own Deſert, but by her
Idea of theirs: And as there was no Merit which
She was not able to imitate, there was none which
She cou'd envy; therefore her Converſation was
as free from Detraction, as her Opinions from Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
or Prepoſſeſſion. As her Thoughts were her
own, ſo were her Words; and She was as ſincere
in uttering her Judgment, as impartial in forming
it. She was a ſafe Companion, many were ſerv'd,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0294500300:5"/>
none ever ſuffer'd by her Acquaintance: Inoffenſive,
when unprovok'd; when provok'd, not ſtupid: But
the Moment her Enemy ceaſed to be hurtful, She
could ceaſe to act as an Enemy. She was therefore
not a bitter but conſiſtent Enemy: (tho' indeed,
when forced to be ſo, the more a finiſh'd One
for having been long a making.) And her Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
with ill People was more in a calm and
ſteady Courſe, like Juſtice, than in quick and paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate
Onſets, like Revenge. As for thoſe of whom She
only thought ill, She conſidered them not ſo much as
once to wiſh them ill; of ſuch, her Contempt was
great enough to put a Stop to all other Paſſions that
could hurt them. Her Love and Averſion, her
Gratitude and Reſentment, her Eſteem and Neglect
were equally open and ſtrong, and alterable only
from the Alteration of the Perſons who created them.
Her Mind was too noble to be inſincere, and her Heart
too honeſt to ſtand in Need of it; ſo that She never
found Cauſe to repent her Conduct either to a Friend
or an Enemy. There remains only to ſpeak of her
Perſon, which was moſt amiably Majeſtick, the
niceſt Eye could find no Fault in the Outward Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neaments
of her Face or Proportion of her Body;
it was ſuch, as pleas'd wherever ſhe had a Deſire
it ſhou'd; yet ſhe never envy'd that of any other,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0294500300:6"/>
which might better pleaſe in general: In the ſame
Manner, as being content that her Merits were
eſteemed where She deſired they ſhould, She never
depreciated thoſe of any other that were eſteemed or
prefered elſewhere. For She aimed not at a general
Love or a general Eſteem where She was not known;
it was enough to be poſſeſs'd of both wherever ſhe was.
Having lived to the Age of Sixty-two Years; not
courting Regard, but receiving it from all who knew
her; not loving Buſineſs, but diſcharging it fully
whereſoever Duty or Friendſhip engaged her in it;
not following Greatneſs, but not declining to pay
Reſpect, as far as was due from Independency and
Diſintereſt; having honourably abſolv'd all the Parts
of Life; She forſook this World, where She had
left no Act of Duty or Virtue undone, for that
where alone ſuch Acts are rewarded, on the 13th
Day of <hi>March</hi> 1742-3.<note n="*" place="margin">The above Character was written by Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> ſome Years before Her Grace's Death.</note>
