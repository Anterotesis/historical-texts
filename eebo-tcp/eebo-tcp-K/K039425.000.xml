            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE Muſes were ever ambitious of being diſtinguiſh'd, by ſhrouding themſelves under the Patronage of the greateſt Men in all Ages; not made ſo by Titles or Preferment; but ſuch, whoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Principles of Honour, truly ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thoſe their Prince had crown'd them with. From hence ſprung my Preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of laying the following Scenes at Your Grace's Feet; ſince the World muſt allow, that all thoſe Virtues, which compleat a perfect good, as well as great Man, are
<pb facs="tcp:0057602300:3"/>
center'd in the Duke of <hi>Devonſhire</hi>; the loyaleſt Subject, the tendereſt Huſband, and the kindeſt Maſter, that ever Monarch, Wife, or Servant had; Briliant Graces, but ſuch as do not ſhine in every Man of Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. From ſuch Patriots, what may not <hi>Britain</hi> hope? Nay, what might not She command, were all her Sons as fervent for her Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, and diſcharg'd their reſpective Truſts with that Fidelity, and due Regard to the publick Good, as Your Grace has ever done in Yours: Then the hated Name of Faction wou'd be heard no more, and the ſcandalous Wounds of hot-headed Parties heal'd; which is the only way to ſecure this Iſland from foreign Inſults, and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh Peace more firmly, than Armies, tho' vaſt as <hi>Xerxes</hi> led, can do.</p>
            <p>To attempt your Grace's Character, is the ſuperiour buſineſs of a Maſculine Pen, and not to be reach'd by mine: But ſince my Huſband has the Honour to ſerve Her Majeſty, under the Command of Your Grace, as he did the late King of glorious Memory, under that of your noble Father, I cou'd not be prevail'd upon to alter my

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>I Shou'd not have troubled my Courteous Reader with a Preface, had I not lain under the Neceſſity of Clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my ſelf of what ſome People have been pleas'd to charge me with, <hi>viz.</hi> of being the Author of a Paper call'd, <hi>The Female Tattler,</hi> conſequently of a Paragraph in that of the <hi>14</hi>th Inſtant, relating to this Comedy; tho' I think no reaſonable Perſon will believe I could be guilty of ſo much Folly. Tho' Vanity is ſaid to be the darling Vice of Woman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, yet nothing but an Idiot wou'd expreſs themſelves ſo openly; and I hope the World won't think me guilty of Printing, what I muſt bluſh to Read, nor imagine it Wrote even by any Friend of mine, for two Reaſons; Firſt, the Groſſneſs of the Flattery. Secondly, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury it muſt of courſe do me, in the Run of my Play, by putting thoſe People out of Humour, whoſe Action was to give Life to the Piece. I ſuppoſe theſe Reaſons are ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to convince the Judicious part, that I was no ways concerned in thoſe Reflections, but own I was treated with all the ſeeming Civility in the World, till the ſecond Night of my Comedy. I willingly ſubmitted to Mr. <hi>Cibber</hi>'s Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Judgment in ſhortning the Scene of the Ghoſt in the laſt Act, and believed him perfectly in the Right, becauſe too
<pb facs="tcp:0057602300:6"/>
much Repetition is tireſome. Indeed when Mr. <hi>Eſtcourt</hi> ſlic'd moſt of it out, I cou'd not help interpoſing my Deſires to the contrary, which the reſt readily comply'd with; and I had the Satisfaction to ſee I was not deceiv'd in my Opinion, of its pleaſing. This Paſſage I happen'd to mention among my Acquaintance; for 'tis Natural to have a kind of a Tender for our own Productions, but eſpecially if they have the good Fortune to divert others. Now, if from this the Author of the <hi>Tattler</hi> gather'd his Account, I am guilty of ſpeaking, but not deſignedly; for who they are that Write that Paper, or how Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh'd, I am perfectly ignorant, and declare I never was concern'd, either in Writing, or Publiſhing, any of the <hi>Tattlers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I never had the Vanity to think, much leſs to publiſh, that any thing I am capable of doing, cou'd ſupport the Stage, tho' I have had the good Fortune to pleaſe, or to find the Town willing to be pleas'd; tho' at preſent it ſeems a certain Author has enter'd a Caveat againſt all Plays running to a ſixth Night, but his own. Tho' an Opera interfer'd with this Comedy, yet it brought above Forty Pounds the ſecond Night, which ſhew'd it had ſome Merit; for I have known many a Play kept up, that fail'd of half that Money the ſecond Night. Now by the Rules of the Houſe, it ought to have been play'd on: But who can ſecure the Life of a Play, when that of a Man is often Sacrific'd to the Malice of Parties? This Play met with a kind Reception in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and notwithſtanding the Diſadvantages it had to ſtruggle with, by raiſing the Prices the firſt Day, and the Nearneſs of <hi>Chriſtmas,</hi> it would have made its way to a ſixth Night, if it had had fair Play. Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake

me not, I do not mean from the Repreſentation; for I muſt do the Players Reaſon: Had I ſearch'd all the Theatres in the World, I cou'd not have ſelected a better Company, nor had more Juſtice done me in the Action, tho' they have not dealt honourably by me in my Bargain; for they ought not to have ſtop'd the Run, upon any Pique whatever. 'Tis ſmall Encouragment to Write for the Stage, when the Actors, according to the Caprice of their Humours, mangre the Taſte of the Town, have power to ſink the Reputation of a Play; for if they reſolve not to Act it, the Town can't ſupport it.</p>
            <p>Well, if there is any Merit in ſuffering wrongfully, I ſhall find my Account in't one time or other; in the mean while I intreat the <hi>Female Tattler</hi> to be Witty no more at my Expence. I deſire I may not be rank'd in the Number of thoſe that ſupport the Stage, ſince the Stage is become a Noun Subſtantive, and reſolves to ſhew it is able to ſtand by itſelf.</p>

                  <p>Sir, what I am Maſter off, I got fairly under you, part, and part under my Lord <hi>Belville</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> whom I ſerv'd twenty Years in the ſame Poſt I do you; when he died, he truſted me with a Secret, which yet I have divulged to no Man; and when I do, the World will ſay I am an honeſt Man. Love firſt join'd their Hearts, and my Ignorance their Hands; uſe me as you pleaſe, but pardon them.</p>
