            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </opener>
               <p>YOU ſee the Upſhot of the <hi>Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> againſt the BISHOPS; his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty was in the Camp at <hi>Hounſlow,</hi> the Soldiers huzza'd at the News, as loudly as the Mob at <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall.</hi> Mob! did I ſay? It was a Multitude of Nobility, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and Citizens of the beſt Note. The King was terribly chagrin'd; he ask'd what Noiſe was that? They told him, No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but the Soldiers rejoicing at the Acquittal of the Biſhops. Do you call that Nothing, ſays he? <note n="*" place="bottom">Lord Chief Juſtice.</note>
                  <hi>Wright</hi> is an excellent Chief; the Moſt Chriſtian King might find him a very uſeful Magiſtrate in <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guedoc,</hi> at this Time. The Command of a Province in <hi>Turkey</hi> would admirably ſuit his Genius. The Forms of the Law of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0653500404:9"/>
                  <hi>England</hi> were a great Reſtraint upon his Zeal; the Spirit of Tyranny in his Office, and Adulation towards his Prince (which generally go together) had ſuch an Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant over him, that he broke thro' all De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency; he could not converſe with Mr. Juſtice <hi>Powell</hi> upon the Points of Law, without mal-treating him: He has ſuch an Averſion to poor Sir <hi>B. Shower,</hi> and had at the ſame Time ſo little Command of his Temper, that he inſulted him, tho' he was for the Proſecution. This arbitrary Behaviour of great Magiſtrates in ſilencing Counſel, whoſe Faces they do not like, is of greater Conſequence to the Public than People generally ſeem to apprehend: But a fitter Opportunity of treating the Man ill could hardly be choſen; for the Generality of the Audience were prejudic'd againſt him, on Account of the Service he was engaged in, and were therefore pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to approve of all the ill Uſage that could be offer'd to him: On the other hand, the King had little Occaſion for him, for the Sollicitor-General was a Minion, as ſcurrilous as <hi>Billingſgate,</hi> as proſtitute and impudent as <hi>Drury-Lane.</hi> When this Tryal is printed, I hope the odious Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours that the principal Characters will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in, both at the Bar and on the Bench, will have a good Effect on the Gentlemen
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0653500404:10"/>
of the Profeſſion for the growing Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as young <hi>Spartans</hi> were taught to hate Drunkenneſs by ſeeing the odious Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of it upon their Slaves. If Judges and Stateſmen would only examine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by the Faults of thoſe who ſtand con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned in Hiſtory, and ask Queſtions like theſe; Am I <hi>Hubert de Burgo?</hi> Am I <hi>Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilian?</hi> Am I <hi>Sejanus?</hi> Am I <hi>Villers?</hi> Am I guilty of the Crime for which this Man's Memory is juſtly hated? I ſay, were Men thus to reflect, they would forget the Tip-Staves, the Trainbearer and Collar of <hi>SS.</hi> the Coronet and the Blue Ribbon: They would not bear being branded Villains to Poſterity; and if true Philanthropy and Patriotiſm could not enter into every Breaſt, there would at leaſt be an Appearance of them, Men would learn to be affable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nign, Lovers of Juſtice, or to ſeem ſo; there would be that Reſemblance of the Virtues, that Mankind would be deceived and ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. Don't tell me of a Man's Eminence in his Profeſſion, or the high Poſt he fills in the State; his Learning and Knowledge of the World have not enlarged his Mind; he is ſtill a little poor Wretch, if he does not remember what a ſmall Part he makes among the Current of Ages. He looks about him, and fancies the preſent Scene the only one of great Importance, that
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0653500404:11"/>
Time has produc'd; and, three to one, eſteems himſelf the moſt conſiderable Character exhibited in it. Where was this Man bred? Is he ignorant what a Racket the School-Boys make with <hi>Alexander,</hi> and <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and <hi>Sylla;</hi> with <hi>Cato</hi> and <hi>Brutus,</hi> and <hi>Ariſtides?</hi> But enough of this. I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe we ſhall have the Tryal printed in a Month: In the mean while I ſend you Part of what Mr. <hi>Somers</hi> ſaid; he was Junior Counſel for the Biſhops; he was very brief, is much applauded for that little he did ſay, but I ſuppoſe will not ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be made a Judge, nor King's Counſel neither. The Heat of Mens Minds at the Trial was violent on all Sides. <note n="*" place="bottom">The Sollicitor-General.</note>
                  <hi>Williams</hi> did not ſcruple to ſay, that if the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops were commanded to do any Thing againſt their Conſciences, they ſhould have acquieſced till the Meeting of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they ſhould not have petitioned. And this vile immodeſt Aſſertion was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived with ſufficient Indecency: People hiſs'd at him for that and for ſomething elſe in his Speech, as you would at a very bad Play. Mr. Juſtice <hi>Powell</hi>'s Zeal, on the other Side, was ſo eager to ſettle the Point, that the Petition was no Libel, that he did not ſtick to affirm to the Jury, that it could
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0653500404:12"/>
not be a Libel, unleſs it were falſe: But this, I fear, is falſe Doctrine in our Law, tho' 'tis to be wiſh'd it were true: I only men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it, to ſhew you what a Ferment the World is in. Upon the Whole, 'tis thought by ſome of the wiſeſt and moſt loyal Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the Kingdom, that we have but a diſmal Proſpect before us. 'Tis evident, that if the Grand Monarch don't effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally interpoſe and pinch the <hi>Dutch,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> will ſpeedily invade the Kingdom. If he ſhould ſucceed, what loyal Breaſt can bear to think the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences? Will he come here, like a Hero in Romance, only to mind other Peoples Buſineſs, and then be gone again? I trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to reflect what is to become of ſacred Majeſty, to recollect the ſhocking Fates of impriſon'd <hi>Engliſh</hi> Kings, our <hi>Edward, Richard,</hi> and the Royal Martyr, his Adage was verified in them all. On the other hand, what if the Prince ſhould be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, or be defeated?

but 'tis as true, that if there be not Papiſts and Soliders of Fortune enough in <hi>England,</hi> there are in <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> to ſhift out the Proteſtants and Men of Worth; and then if the Cauſe of the Biſhops or of <hi>Magdalen-College</hi> ſhould be brought before them, they will do Buſineſs in a Stile yet more conciſe than <hi>Wright</hi> and <hi>Allybone,</hi> or <hi>Jefferies</hi> and the Biſhop of <hi>Cheſter</hi> can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to.

               <p>I Agree with you, that Kings might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit by reading Hiſtory with Attention, as much as their Miniſters and Judges, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps they might much more, as the Sphere they move in is higher.

their own Religion. There muſt be a Reform firſt, and a Recruit from <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland.</hi> Indeed if a King of <hi>England</hi> were only to deſire to enſlave his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, an Army would make the Game ſure: No Matter how, or on what Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion they came together, they naturally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to continue together; for that is their very Life and Exiſtence: Like Bodies in the animal World, they endeavour their own Preſervation, and that is by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the Rights of Mankind; Food as proper for them, as Graſs for Oxen; having neither Liberty nor Property them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they readily concur to deſtroy them in others; that is only levelling; but it ends better ſtill for them; for when they have enſlaved the People, they are rewarded with the eaſieſt Chains, the uppermoſt Rank among Slaves, and often find out their own Strength, and pleaſe themſelves in chopping and changing their Maſters. I can't be particular on a ſudden; but I believe <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> afford forty or fifty Inſtances to this Purpoſe.</p>
               <p>But we have at preſent, Religion mixed with our Politics, and that puts us out of all Danger; for who doubts the Religion of an Army? Perhaps every one does not apprehend it; but ſeriouſly, Armies ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times have Religion. When <hi>Henry</hi> III. of

                  <hi>France</hi> was murder'd in his Camp, his great Succeſſor loſt two Thirds of the Army in a Month, by Deſertion, becauſe of his Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in Religion, tho' they all ador'd him for many Royal Virtues. Who denies Religion, ſuch as it was, to our <hi>Britiſh</hi> Armies of Covenanters? There was indeed one Army of <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks in the laſt War in <hi>Ireland,</hi> who prefer'd their Loyalty to one of the Tenets of their Religion: The Pope's Nuncio excommunicated the Earl of <hi>Clanrickard</hi> and his Adherents for continuing ſteady in their Allegiance to King <hi>Charles;</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Clanrickard,</hi> at the Head of his Army, excommunicated the Pope's Nuncio by Beat of Drum. But as to our own Army, let its Religion be what it will, I wiſh the King had Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions ſomewhat weaker than he has of Church-of<hi>-England</hi>-Loyalty.

               <p>THE too near Neighbourhood of <hi>Holland</hi> has thrown our Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into a violent Ague; the hot Fit and the cold quickly ſucceed each other. Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Juſtice is in a fluctuating Condition, it depends on the Winds and Weather, like the Rate of Inſurance of Ships on their Voyages.

               <p>An old Gentleman, a Friend of mine, determin'd to mount in Armour for his Majeſty, when firſt he heard of this Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; he has an inveterate Enmity to the Whigs, for cutting down his Timber in the Days of Sequeſtration: But indeed this
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0653500404:18"/>
laſt low, little Shuffling, between Grace and Oppreſſion, has brought him to have a very mean Opinion of the Royal Candour and Integrity, as well as of the Wiſdom and Honeſty of the Counſellors: And now my Friend is reſolved to wait the Event of Affairs in a whole Skin; an Alteration which I ſtrongly ſuſpect to have happen'd to many! and even to ſome of the military People. The Inſtability of our Councils is a ſure Symptom of a languiſhing Cauſe: A Soul by Turns ſo temerarious and puſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanimous, as on every little Opportunity to fly out into Acts of Wrong, and on every little Check ſhamefully to cry, <hi>Peccavi:</hi> Such a ſoul is only fit to animate the worſt of Tyrants.

               <p>I Don't wonder you ſhould ſuſpect me to be almoſt a Whig, for 'tis moſt certain, I can't perſuade myſelf to draw a Sword to deſtroy my Religion and Liberty: And yet I wiſh a Temper could be found to ſave both Prince and People. It is true, that there are Dangers to be apprehended from the Invader, and that muſt be the Caſe let who will draw the Sword for us. I alſo agree with you, that there is no natural Connection between Popery and Slavery; that the Deſign of impoſing both at once on this Nation is only accidental; that a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Prince may forge Chains for his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple as well as a Popiſh one; that Proteſtant <hi>Danes</hi> are Slaves, and Popiſh <hi>Switzers</hi> Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men: But thus ſtands our particular Caſe, Our Prince has avow'd a Deſign to govern without Law; the Invader diſclaims that
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0653500404:20"/>
odious Project: We are certain of our Ruin on the one Hand, we have ſome reaſonable Hopes of eſcaping on the other.</p>
               <p>It would not be eaſy for the Invader im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to become abſolute: That would depend upon a Standing-Army. The Power he brings won't be ſufficient to effect his principal Enterprize without a large Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of <hi>Engliſhmen;</hi> and the Officers will be generally People of Families who will hardly on a ſudden concur with Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners to enſlave themſelves: And I think the Prince's Hands will be too full of Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies both at home and abroad, to hazard the Loſs of his new Friends as ſoon as he has got them, and to provoke the ſame People who invited him in, to turn him out again. No Miniſters that he can em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy will ſuddenly give ſuch Advice. Even Miniſters don't love Standing-Armies; don't deſire to ſee their Prince above Law, unleſs they have had time enough to commit Crimes that make them afraid of Law, and glad of the Refuge of an arbitrary Protection: they approve of, and advance an abſolute Power to protect them, only in Proportion to their own Neceſſities. A Man who has acquir'd a good Fortune, naturally wiſhes to ſecure his Property in it, and to tranſmit that Property ſafe to his Poſterity: Nothing but the Terrors that attend on Guilt can
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0653500404:21"/>
alter that Deſire, and they indeed can alter it. If he knows that his injur'd Country has had Cauſe to demand Vengeance upon him, he verifies the Devil's Obſervation, <hi>All that a Man hath will he give for his Life.</hi>

               <p>THey tell us Wonders here of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Colony of <hi>Londonderry</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> they fight and ſtrave like the ancient <hi>Saguntines.</hi> They deſerve our early Care of them; for if we have done
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0653500404:28"/>
right, I am ſure they cannot be in the Wrong: Their Grievances and their Dangers were much more importunate than our own. I thought every Thing degenerated which was carried into that Country: It ſeems I am miſtaken; or perhaps Oppreſſion, which makes a wiſe Man Mad, can alſo make a Coward Valiant. I fear we are generally too partial to our own Home, and injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ſo with Regard to our Neighbours. A true-bred <hi>Engliſh</hi> Squire believes his Countrymen to be more powerful, more valiant, more wealthy, more numerous, more polite, more learned, more wiſe, not ouly than any other Nation, but than all the Nations on the Face of the Earth put together: If we could look on other Countries with an impartial Eye, we might ſee, that they have Numbers of People, and Sources of Wealth, and that they can either think or fight as well as ourſelves. The old Aldermen in all our Country-Boroughs have learned from <hi>Baker</hi>'s Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicle the Succeſſes of our <hi>Edwards</hi> and our <hi>Henries</hi> againſt <hi>France:</hi> They alſo know enough of our Story to tell us that <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> was not with us in thoſe Days, and that <hi>Ireland</hi> was of no Benefit to us; but they forget, that the beſt Provinces of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern <hi>France</hi> were then under Princes of their own, mortal Enemies to that Crown;
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0653500404:29"/>
they do not perceive the inteſtine Diſorders which made Way for the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Arms; Nor how eaſy it was for a Neighbouring Prince who had their Royal Blood in his Veins to make Parties among a People of his own Religion, and how impoſſible that Piece of Policy has been rendered by the Reformation: Modern <hi>France</hi> has at leaſt twenty Millions of People, and the whole <hi>Britiſh</hi> Empire not half that Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. The like Alteration has been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in <hi>Spain,</hi> long ſince our Black Prince made a Figure on that Part of the Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent. That Country, of many Kingdoms, is become one, So that tho our ancient Kings in the Holy War may have been as great and powerful as any of their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours; yet we have Reaſon to ſuſpect, that not even the Acceſs of <hi>Scotland</hi> under the ſame Allegiance with us, nor the Growth of <hi>Ireland</hi> in People, in Civility, and in Wealth, have been able to make us keep Pace with the vaſt Increaſe of Power in the Crowns of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> ſince the Times I mentioned. And Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven only knows what <hi>Scotland</hi> will do now</p>
               <p>If we expect to be of Importance in <hi>Europe,</hi> ought we not to make a Coali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with thoſe who are both of our own Blood and our own Religion, and not
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0653500404:30"/>
force them by Hardſhips into a Spirit of Faction? <hi>Cromwell</hi> in one of his Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments rejected many Boroughs, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed the Number of Repreſentatives for Counties: I have been told the late Lord <hi>Clarendon</hi> uſed to ſay, <hi>That this was an Amendment to be wiſhed for in better</hi> TIMES. <hi>Oliver</hi> brought the Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of the Three Kingdoms to ſit in one Parliament: Is not this alſo an Alteration to be wiſhed for at all Times? It is a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition which indeed ought to be an Axiom in our Politicks, that theſe King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms can never make a great and happy Empire, whilſt the conſtituent Parts envy the Proſperity of each other, whilſt the Stronger oppreſſes the Weaker, and the Weaker is tempted to wiſh for an Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to chuſe a milder Lord, or even to ſet up for an Independency; which we muſt never think a Thing impoſſible, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in the laſt Century our Great-Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers ſaw Seven little Diſtricts break looſe from the other Ten (the whole being but a ſmall Part of a mighty Empire) and ſet up for themſelves with ſuch ſwift Succeſs, as in the ſame Generation to beat their old Soveraign off the Ocean; and in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Century have not our Fathers ſeen the Revolt of <hi>Portugal</hi> from the ſame ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Empire, tho <hi>Portugal</hi> is a Country,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0653500404:31"/>
neither ſpacious, populous, nor warlike; not defended from <hi>Spain</hi> by the Dangers of boiſterous Seas, nor by the Difficulties of <hi>Alps</hi> or <hi>Appenines.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The People of <hi>Ireland</hi> cannot be ſuppoſed ignorant of their own Story; and indeed it is hard to find out, what has made them Slaves? or to be conſidered as a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered People? eſpecially if it be true, that at leaſt Nine Tenths of the Land-Eſtate in that Kingdom is at preſent in the conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors Hands; and that this preſent War will probably make the like Diviſion of the other Tenth, and this by the Aid and Arms of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Proteſtants of <hi>Ireland.</hi> Do <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> become Slaves by Conquering? Theſe are Reſtrained Provincial-Politicks. Let us ſhew that a limited Monarchy can increaſe and thrive as well as an abſolute one. Let us only rival Foreigners; but let us not depreſs one Country, Province, or Member of our own Empire, in Hopes to raiſe another. I ſuppoſe if the Common-Council of <hi>London</hi> could make Laws for all <hi>England,</hi> we ſhould have all the Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures of all the different Cities and Counties reſtrained to the Freemen of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> only, and only to be carried on within the Sound of <hi>Bow-bell: Norwich</hi> or <hi>Taun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> might probably take as great a Liking to the Woollen Manufacture, and <hi>Birm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham</hi>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:0653500404:32"/>
to the Monopoly of Hard-Ware. What Pity it is that ſuch hopeful Schemes are not carried into Execution! How rich would they render the Nation! How power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful the Prince in Proportion to the other Kings of <hi>Europe!</hi> How ſecurely we ſhould engroſs our Manufactures without any Danger of being under-ſold by our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours! Tho' we have no Occaſion to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the Limits of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Empire, yet, we ſhould purſue ſuch Maxims as will make it flouriſh, for Nature has done her Part for us. Our Situation tells us that we have no Buſineſs on the Continent; that if <hi>France</hi> or <hi>Spain</hi> ſhould make a Preſent to us of a Dozen ſtrong Towns in <hi>Flanders,</hi> they would not be worth the Keeping, and we ſhould only have Occaſion to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve into what Hands to put them. The common Experience of every Trader will tell us, that our Manufactures muſt be made cheap, if we would ſell cheap; and that if our Neighbours can under-ſell us, we may leave off Trade. We ought always to remember that the Woollen Manufacture came from <hi>Flanders,</hi> and the Silk from <hi>France,</hi> to <hi>England,</hi> and both by the Means of Oppreſſion, no Matter whether Religious or Political (tho I think <hi>Grotius</hi> inſiſts that the <hi>Netherlands</hi> fought for Liberty, not for Religion) it ſhould
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0653500404:33"/>
therefore be our Care, that, in guarding againſt a Rival in Trade, we do not miſtake our Mark; and that when we ſuppreſs the <hi>Iriſh</hi> whoſe whole Profits center with us, and add to our Power, we do not advance the <hi>French,</hi> and ſtrengthen the Hands of our moſt dangerous, our Hereditary Enemy. It would indeed be a grateful Return for the Preſent which they have wiſely made us within theſe laſt twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Years of a large Numbers of their induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Artizans; but, I believe, the moſt ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous <hi>Engliſh</hi> Caſuiſt will be content to remain in their Debt on this Account.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not at preſent undertake to ſhew the Probability that, letting <hi>Ireland</hi> into a full Trade and into an Union too, would inrich and aggrandize this Kingdom: I fear you would believe I had taken too many Paradoxes on my Hands at once; but if I find you can digeſt Part of the Doctrines already advanced, I ſhall take another Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to ſhew that the true Scheme of National Trade is, to diſperſe the Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Working-Hands thro the cheapeſt Provinces, and that then you will have <hi>Gold as Braſs, and Silver as Stones in the Streets</hi> of your Metropolis. I would at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to prove, that nothing but a flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Trade, ſupported by wiſe Treaties, brought <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to that happy Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Days of <hi>Solomon:</hi> He raiſed
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0653500404:34"/>
great but not heavy Taxes, for his Wiſdom had brought ſuch a Balance of Trade to his Kingdom, that his People were well able to bear them; they never murmured at them till they got a weak Man for their King, who expected to reap what he had not ſown; and I do not read (tho <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was the Seat of Empire, and <hi>Solomon</hi> was of the Tribe of <hi>Judah</hi>) that there was any Difference made to the Prejudice of the Commerce of the reſt of the Tribes. I could wiſh to give you a Sketch of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Iſles united in one Intereſt and one Parliament, then might we hope for the Dominion of all the Iſles of the Bay of <hi>Mexico</hi> and of the Ocean. A Dominion more open for us to acquire, and more eaſy to retain, than any the moſt incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Part of the Continent of <hi>Europe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is one Thing to be lamented in our Management of Foreign Acquiſitions. We get an uſelels Acceſs of Land, at a great Expence of our People. We hardly ever make a new Subject; we do not natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralize and conciliate the Minds of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives where we come. And we have been in all Ages in the ſame Temper: We were near five hundred Years reducing <hi>Ireland:</hi> We ſent Soldiers thither, and gave them Land: They did not, indeed, ſettle methodically in great Numbers and make populous Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies;
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0653500404:35"/>
but they built Caſtles every where in the Country; made Alliances with the Natives, and degenerated by thouſands, ſo that the Task of reclaiming degenerate <hi>Engliſh</hi> was formerly more difficult than that of civilizing the Natives. And the Loſſes which <hi>England</hi> ſuſtained from Age to Age by this bad Policy have been ſo large and ſo frequent, that perhaps it might be affirmed with Truth, that more <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> have from Time to Time been ſent into <hi>Ireland</hi> than the preſent Number of its Inhabitants amount to. Had we ſent regular Colonies thither, and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted good Numbers of their Natives (eſpecially their Children) into the ſeveral Counties of <hi>England,</hi> we ſhould ſoon have found it a profitable Undertaking. This was the Method of <hi>Aſſyria</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> too, and now is only practiced by the <hi>Turk:</hi> He takes from <hi>Chriſtians</hi> great Numbers of Children, and makes them the moſt bigotted <hi>Muſſelmen:</hi> They recruit his Armies, and indeed without this Policy, it were impoſſible he ſhould have <hi>Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi> Subjects: Such has been the Profuſion of Blood in the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Wars, and ſo nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous are the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> within thoſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions.</p>
               <p>I have ſometimes thought it bad Oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy, that our <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> and <hi>African</hi>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:0653500404:36"/>
Companies do not by Degrees buy up and educate ſome hundreds of the Children of the Natives where their Settlements are, and breed them Chriſtians and Soldiers from Father to Son. It is a fond Partiality to fancy they would have leſs Faith or leſs Courage than thoſe who are ſent from hence: I am perſuaded they would have the Advantage in both Reſpects; they might eaſily know more Religion and leſs Vice than the People who generally take thoſe Journies; would better endure the Climates; and as for Courage and Military Skill, theſe are chiefly to be acquired: The Nations have had and loſt them in their Turns. The Proprietors in theſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies are more than Tenants for Life; their Stock goes to their Executors; and if the Companies Eſtate advances in Value, ſo does every Share of each Proprietor: This ought to encourage them to provide for the future. Nor would it be found a grievous Burthen on the common Stock to execute ſuch a Scheme: Food being cheap, and but little Rayment neceſſary in all the Settlements, the Expence might be defrayed by the Labour of the Children, except the prime Coſt of purchaſing them.</p>
               <p>The Earl of <hi>Shaftesbury</hi> is allowed to have been the great Wheel of Affairs, and has certainly contributed to bring about this
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0653500404:37"/>
Revolution as much as Queen <hi>Maria D'Eſte</hi> or King <hi>William</hi> the Third; but whether in the Spirit of <hi>Rome</hi> or <hi>Geneva</hi> is a nice Queſtion. Perhaps he was in <hi>utrumque paratus,</hi> and (as cunning Game<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters practice) when he found he had made his Bets on the wrong Side, was wiſe enough to move off betimes. He now affects to be thought innocent of all the Blunders, and lawleſs Acts of Power in the laſt Reign; to have adviſed againſt them, but conſtantly to have been over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruled by the <hi>Italian</hi> and Spiritual Counſels co-inciding with his Maſter's Bigottry.—<hi>Credat Judaeus Apella.</hi> Can he who bowed his Knee to <hi>Baal,</hi> who gave up his Redeemer for Idolatry to pleaſe his Prince, be ſuppoſed incapable of giving up his Country into the Bargain?</p>
               <p>He ſtands at preſent under the Proſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of both Monarchs; but which is in <hi>ieſt,</hi> which in <hi>earneſt,</hi> as News-Mongers ſay, <hi>we muſt leave to Time to diſcover.</hi> Our <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh uſed to make a ſtalking Horſe of Mother Church, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated his beſt Friends at St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s-<hi>Croſs,</hi> when by his Command they offered their Service to <hi>Perkin Warbeck</hi> on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to betray him. It is poſſible that the Earl may have precipitated his Maſter's Meaſures with a Deſign to bring about the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0653500404:38"/>
Revolution; it is poſſible he may have on the contrary endeavoured to prevent the dangerous Steps which have been taken; but he can never be juſtifyed in either Light. He ought to have withdrawn from the Scene of Iniquity, and not to have acted one of the moſt conſiderable Parts in it. When Lord Chancellor <hi>Finch</hi> was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to put the great Seal to my Lord <hi>Danby</hi>'s Pardon, he repreſented it as Illegal, and ſurrendered the Seal. This ſhould be the Behaviour of all honeſt Men on the like Occaſion. Nor had his Maſter (who was a Man of fine Underſtanding) the worſe Opinion of his Chancellor.</p>
               <p>Whatever Figure our Earl may happen to make hereafter; we ſhould remember, that a good Judge of Life has made it a Precept of Wiſdom to wonder at nothing.<note n="*" place="bottom">

                  </note> And indeed human Nature is ſo fickle, Fortune ſo Sportive, and the World has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſeen ſo much Variety; that if we are moderately read in Hiſtory, <hi>There is nothing can happen, to deſerve our Admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Military Gentlemen have been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Parliamentary Inſpection. They have (as was very natural to them) brought
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0653500404:39"/>
upon us ſome of the crying Evils which afflicted the worſt Part of the Reign of King <hi>Charles</hi> the 1<hi>ſt.</hi> and this in ſpite of the Bill of Rights.</p>
               <p>We provide and pay for them all, but the Colonel robs the inferior Officer, the inferior Officer robs the common Soldier, and the common Soldier muſt of Courſe extort free Quarter upon the unarmed Countryman. They ſubtract the Soldier's Pay, and ſend him to demand Subſiſtence-Money from his Landlord. I ſuppoſe theſe People have got theſe pretty Notions in <hi>Flander;</hi> by converſing with out <hi>German</hi> Allies, this free-Quarter with a new Name, the very Bane of the Empire, and what muſt in Proceſs of Time eſtabliſh the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of <hi>France</hi> over the greateſt Part of <hi>Germany.</hi> Thoſe Princes look on free Quarters as a more compendious Method of maintaining an Army than regular Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and inſtead of taking a Part of the Farmer's Wealth, they ſuffer him to be robbed of All.</p>
               <p>The <hi>French,</hi> and even the <hi>Turks,</hi> tho' they waſte an Enemy's Country with Fire and Sword, yet govern their Subjects with a milder Sway. Hence it is that the People who have firſt experienced the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> and afterwards either of the other two Soveraigns, ſeldom care to return to
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0653500404:40"/>
their old Allegiance. And yet the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi> cannot ſee this. Tyranny has ſurely a great Mixture of Folly or Madneſs in its Compoſition.</p>
               <p>There are ſome of our Colonels who rob an Officer under Colour of Cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him: They oblige him to take his Cloaths from whom and at what Rate they pleaſe; ſuppoſe at twenty Pounds what is worth twelve at moſt. As if there was any Difference between robbing a Man, and forcing him to buy at your own Price. The Officer thus plundered, naturally ſeeks to reimburſe himſelf.—<hi>Torva Leaena Lupum ſequitur, Lupus ipſe Capellam.</hi> The King has broke one of the Colonels for it. And if one ſingle Reaſon did not interpoſe, I could be content that a King of <hi>England</hi> were as Abſolute as the Grand Signior over the Officers of his Army or Revenue. I am not afraid that he would be at a Loſs for want of Colonels or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners, Captains or Collectors. They would only be more tender of tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing with an Halter about their Necks, than they are now, when the greateſt Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that can befal them is, to be turned out of Employment. A Puniſhment which ſome of them may find it worth their While to undergo.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:0653500404:41"/>
The Objection againſt ſuch a Regulation is only this, that Officers who were to live under ſuch Abſolute Power would be apt to obey without Reſerve; and that blind Obedience might become fatal to the Liberties of their Country. Since then the Crown is not to be truſted with doing ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary Juſtice, I think it would be well if the Parliament took it into their own Hands; and had a ſtanding Committee for that Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, in which no Officer ſhould ſit.</p>
               <p>It were to be wiſhed that every Field-Officer and Captain too had a better Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue in Land than the annual Value of his Commiſſion; and even then, I would exclude him from Parliament and Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary Elections, becauſe he ſhould not have it in his Power to burthen the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to fill his own Pockets. But we have many Soldiers of Fortune in great Poſts, who take large Strides to raiſe Families at once. What Wonder then to ſee a Country pillaged by Free-Quarter? A Regiment cheated of its Cloathing? or fraudulent Bargains driven for Bread or Forage? when the Profit of a ſingle Contract, may be greater than the Value of the Poſt that may be loſt by it.</p>
               <p>The publick Buſineſs (1694) has been at a Stand while we have been opening a new Scene, tracing the ſecret Methods which are
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0653500404:42"/>
ſometimes purſued in procuring Bills to paſs in Parliament. It ſeems the <hi>Eaſt India</hi> Company have been placing Sums in proper Hands. The Speaker and Mr. <hi>Hunger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> are expelled, the Speaker's Bribe was one thouſand Pounds, Mr. <hi>Hungerford</hi>'s but poor thirty Guineas. Surely he thought, he was taking a Fee in <hi>Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter-Hall!</hi> it is unhappy for us that ſuch Inſtances are found in our Senate. <hi>Venalis Populus, Venalis Curia Patrum,</hi> was the State of <hi>Rome</hi> ſinking into Slavery; it is a Symptom of a diſtempered Conſtitution, and threatens our Deſtruction, if we do not aid ourſelves with brisk Remedies. It caſts the ſevereſt Blemiſh on the Age we live in, that even a reaſonable Bill ſhall meet with Rubs, and perhaps miſcarry, if it do not purchaſe its Paſſage.</p>
               <p>I believe it was never doubted, but the Corruption of Bribery alone, has always been ſufficient to ruin any free People among whom it grew predominant; unleſs you will chuſe to ſay, that it never came alone. It is attended with falſe Friendſhip, Breach of Faith, Perjury, neglect of the publick Intereſt, inſatiable Avarice, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Poverty, private Wealth, boundleſs Luxury, endleſs Extortion, Fraud in all Offices, Rapine and Oppreſſion in all the Provinces. It is no Wonder in ſuch a Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0653500404:43"/>
that the People ſhould wiſh for a Change of any Sort, for like a ſick Perſon in grievous bodily Pain, they flatter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves that any Alteration muſt happen for the better.</p>
               <p>And yet to get rid of this Army of Monſters, I never can think it neceſſary to have Recourſe to <hi>Lycurgus</hi>'s Scheme, to baniſh Gold and Silver, and leave no better Money than Iron. This Expedient might ſuit a Tract of Land about the Size of one of our Counties, inhabited by ten or twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thouſand Families who lived upon their Labour and the Fruits of their own Soil; but the World is not thus divided at this Day. We could not ſet forth a <hi>Britiſh</hi> Fleet on ſuch a Fund, to keep what we have got abroad, or even to maintain us in Poſſeſſion of our Home.</p>
               <p>We need only go to <hi>Holland</hi> to obſerve that a People may love Money very well, without having an Opportunity to ſell Juſtice or their Country. There will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be found a ſufficient Number of honeſt Men to ſerve the State, if you reduce the Value of the great Employments Ninety <hi>per Cent,</hi> from Thouſands to Hundreds <hi>per Ann.</hi> A good Man will only deſire to be indemnified as to the Expences of his Attendance (Moderate Expences I mean). Thus may the moſt conſiderable
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0653500404:44"/>
Offices be filled with the worthieſt Patriots unrivalled by the Mercenaries. But inſtead of reducing great Employments to the Value of a competent Subſiſtence for the Poſſeſſors; we can ſhew a ſingle Poſt, which half a Dozen People may enjoy at once, and every one of them make a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune by it.</p>
               <p>The exorbitant Grants (1695/6) which have been made to ſome Favourites have juſtly rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Spirit of the Commons of <hi>England.</hi> The Earl of <hi>Portland</hi> particularly has ſo far exceeded all Bounds of Modeſty, that he has got little leſs than the Principality of <hi>Wales,</hi> and the Lands and Lordſhips that ſhould ſupport the Heir-Apparent of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> are given to this Lord. The Houſe has this Day unanimouſly addreſſed againſt this Grant, and had a gracious Anſwer, that it ſhould be reſumed. They came into this Temper chiefly in Conſequence of an incomparable Speech which Mr. <hi>Price</hi> the Lawyer made on the Occaſion: It has that Eloquence and ſtrong reaſoning in it, which are worthy the Character of a Man of Learning and Underſtanding, and that bold Freedom which becomes an <hi>Engliſh Patriot</hi> in his Place in Parliament. When great Men obtain Grants like theſe, it is well they do not ask the Kingdom alſo. I ſend
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0653500404:45"/>
you an Extract of Mr. <hi>Price</hi>'s Speech, <hi>viz.</hi> This Petition, <hi>ſays he,</hi> tho' ſubſcribed only by a few Hands has the Approbation of many Thouſands who are not influenced by their own Intereſt, but act for the Honour of the Crown and Welfare of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Nation.</p>
               <p>If I could conceive how the Glory and Grandeur of <hi>England</hi> is, or can be upheld by a poor landleſs Crown, and a miſerable neceſſitous People, I might then be eaſily perſuaded to believe, that his Majeſty is well adviſed to grant away all the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues of the Crown; and that his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will thereby be well ſecured, and his People beſt protected, when they have little or nothing left; but I am ſure they are not <hi>Engliſh,</hi> but foreign Politicians, who can revere the King and yet hate his People The Kings of <hi>England</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways reign beſt, when they have the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of their Subjects of which they are ſecure when the People are ſenſible, the King is entirely in their Intereſt, and loves the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Soil as well as the People's Money.</p>
               <p>I muſt needs confeſs that my Thoughts are troubled with ſtrange Apprehenſions of our deplorable State: We are in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy in War; and ſome of thoſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0653500404:46"/>
our Enemies in Trade, tho' planted amongſt us, ſome in the King's Council; ſome in the Army; and the Common Traders have poſſeſſed themſelves of the Outskirts of this great City. We find ſome of them Naturalized and others made Denizens; In every Parliament we find En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours for a general Naturalization, and that warmly ſollicited from Court.</p>
               <p>We ſee our good Coin all gone, and our Confederates openly coining <hi>Dutch</hi> Money of a baſe Alloy for us. We ſee moſt Places of Power and Profit given to Foreigners. We ſee our Confederates in Conjunction with the <hi>Scots</hi> to ruin our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Trade. We ſee the Revenues of the Crown daily given away to one or other, who make Sale of them, and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit their Eſtates elſewhere. We do not find any of them buy Lands or Eſtates amongſt us; but what they can get from us they ſecure in their own Country. How can we hope for happy Days in <hi>England,</hi> when This great Lord, and the Other, Foreigners (tho' Naturalized) are in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and alſo in the <hi>Dutch</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils? If theſe Strangers (tho' now Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates) ſhould be of different Intereſts (as moſt plainly they are in Point of Trade) to which Intereſt is it to be ſuppoſed thoſe great Foreign Counſellors and Favourites
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0653500404:47"/>
would adhere? So that I foreſee, that when we are reduced to extreme Poverty (as now we are very near it) we are to be ſupplanted by our Neighbours, and become a Colony to the <hi>Dutch.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhall make no ſevere Remarks on this great Man, for his Greatneſs makes us Little, and will make the Crown both poor and precarious; and when GOD ſhall pleaſe to ſend us a Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> he may have ſuch a Preſent of a Crown made him as a Pope did to King <hi>John,</hi> who was Sur-named <hi>Sans-Terre,</hi> and was by his Father, King <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond, made Lord of <hi>Ireland:</hi> Which Grant was confirmed by the Pope, who ſent him a Crown of Peacock's Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, in Deriſion of his Power, and the Poverty of his Revenue.</p>
               <p>I would have us to conſider that we are <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> and muſt (like good Patriots) ſtand by our Country, and not ſuffer it to become tributary to Strangers. We have rejoiced that we have beat out of this Kingdom Popery and Slavery, and do now with as great Joy entertain Socinianiſm and Poverty, and yet we ſee our Properties daily given away, and our Liberties muſt ſoon follow.</p>
               <p>I deſire Redreſs rather than Puniſhment; therefore I ſhall neither move for an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment againſt this noble Lord, nor for
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0653500404:48"/>
the Baniſhment of Him; but ſhall only beg that he may have no Power over us, nor we any Dependance upon Him.</p>
               <p>Then he concluded with a Motion for the Addreſs. <hi>March</hi> 24, 1698-9.</p>
               <p>I remember it was always your Opinion and mine, that Liberty might be in Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger as much under a <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Prince as under a <hi>Papiſt.</hi> It ſeems the collective Wiſdom of the Nation is of the ſame Judgment, for they have reſolved to ſend the Red Coats to learn the Arts of Peace in all the Counties and Boroughs of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. They make them in Effect free of all Corporations, and have reſolved that ſeven thouſand Men here, and twelve thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand in <hi>Ireland</hi> are a ſufficient Land Force. The Courtiers had a large Field to expa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate in, concerning the embroiled Condition of <hi>Europe</hi> abroad (notwithſtanding the new Peace,) and the dangerous extenſive Diſaffection at Home: But the Genius of <hi>England</hi> has prevailed. We are not now to be Slaves. His Majeſty, under whoſe Auſpices we have learned to mortgage the Kingdom, is graciouſly pleaſed to ſuffer us to ſee a Poſſibility of redeeming it. The <hi>Dutch</hi> Guards ſtuck much with Him, but they muſt alſo be gone. He is too wiſe a Prince not to know that the Caſuiſtry upon the Titles of contending Pretenders to the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0653500404:49"/>
Crown is but a Trifle in the Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Multitude; it ſurmounts their Theory. The true Ground and Reaſon of Loyalty or Diſaffection in the Populace is nothing elſe but the Senſe of their own preſent Happineſs or Miſery; and let who will reign, he can never have the Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of a People whom he burthens with Taxes to pay for the Inſurance of their own Slavery. A Prince perhaps may have his Option, whether he will govern a People by Force, or found his Authority upon their Affections: He has no Need of (and, I am much miſtaken if he can have) Both.</p>
               <p>The Courtiers have been very loud upon the Topick of our Obligation to the King, for the Benefits we have received from him, and in particular, for this laſt Act of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcention: For my Part, it gives me the Spleen to hear ſuch Stuff. Surely theſe Men would make us believe that we were born the Slaves of ſome Eaſtern Monarch, that we enjoy our Liberties by a Gift re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocable at Pleaſure, and that they are not our Birth-right and Inheritance. Men who advance Notions of this Tendency deſerve the Gibbet equally with <hi>Garnet</hi> the Jeſuit and <hi>Oliver Cromwell;</hi> as being equally Traitors to their Country.</p>
               <p>The King indeed ran the Riſque of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducting our Efforts for Liberty and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0653500404:50"/>
we have ſucceeded, we have paid the Expence of the Undertaking, and raiſed him to the Throne for his Pains. What is more to be done? I hope I am a very good Proteſtant, but I am ſure I never did deſign to truck away all other Rights of an <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhman</hi> for a Deliverance only from King <hi>James</hi>'s Eccleſiaſtical Tyranny. Were our other Rights extinguiſhed, our Religion would be alſo precarious; <hi>Orthodox</hi> with <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> and <hi>Arian</hi> with <hi>Conſtantius.</hi> Such a Deliverance would be Proteſtantiſm with a Witneſs. It would bring us under a very lively Deſcription of biggotted Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which I ſhall not attempt to tranſlate, but here tranſcribe to ſave you the Trouble of turning to it.<q>

               <p>We are at laſt (1701) come to the ſeveral Reſolutions, which I ſend you incloſed, about ſetling the Succeſſion to the Crown; a Point of the utmoſt importance to theſe Kingdoms, and of no ſmall Moment even to the moſt
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0653500404:51"/>
conſiderable Powers in <hi>Europe. France, Spain,</hi> the <hi>Empire</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi> are moſt particularly attentive to this critical Step; for I believe it is by this Time well underſtood that the two late Kings were duped into the Meaſures of <hi>France,</hi> and had no Concern to preſerve the Balance of Power in <hi>Europe.</hi> The Ducheſs of <hi>Savoy</hi> is as importunate to have her Birth-right conſidered at this Juncture, as the Duke's Miniſter was fulſome in his Compliment upon the Revolution; yet ſurely they muſt have then foreſeen their Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions would be prejudiced by that grand Event. We have thrown the Popiſh Pedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees out of the Queſtion: You ſee we do not meddle with the Prince's Birth; if it could be proved ſuppoſititious, that would not remove our Difficulties: We inſiſt on the Security of our Religion as well as our Laws; we have ſeen how weak the Bonds of Duty, of Promiſes and of Oaths are upon a Popiſh Prince, and therefore we cannot ſcruple to exclude a Multitude of the Deſcendants of King <hi>Charles</hi> the 1ſt, in Favour of his Siſter's Children. It is indeed a Wonder that this Work was not begun and perſected many Years ago, for the Occaſion was little leſs than at preſent, except the Chance of the Duke of <hi>Glou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter</hi>'s Life.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:0653500404:52"/>
I fear you will obſerve ſome Cobweb-Nets, or Ropes of Sand in our Reſtrictions upon the Succeſſors: We ſay he ſhall not go out of the Kingdom without Conſent of Parliament. If he ſhould not meet with Parliaments kind enough to conſent <hi>Gratis,</hi> and his Inclinations be very ſtrong for a Tour abroad, he may learn to buy Leave perhaps, once for all by getting the Clauſe repealed: And (which is worſe!) Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of all kinds are in their Effects very like Fornication; it frequently happens that Women <hi>ſin</hi> the firſt Time without a Deſign to make a Practice of it; their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires draw them in only (as they imagine) to gratify themſelves <hi>pro illâ vice;</hi> but the like Appetite recurs on freſh Occaſions; frequent Acts grow into a Habit; and the ſame Perſon who felt a quick Compunction for the firſt Fault, now thinks it a Fault no longer, and is inſenſible of Remorſe and Shame. And indeed I think that Reſtric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion a very idle one. Is it to be feared, that the Elector of <hi>Hanover</hi> (to put the Caſe ſtronger than that of the Dowager Ducheſs) could attempt to make his Electorate the Seat of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Empire; could he think himſelf ſafe in the Poſſeſſion of the Crown if he were to fall upon ſo ridiculous a Project? A Prince of Common-Senſe has no Occaſion for this Reſtriction; and if
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0653500404:53"/>
we had a Fool ſo abſurd, it were no Matter what became of him. A brave, a wiſe, a good King may have Occaſions to go abroad, highly beneficial in their Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences to this Kingdom; and I think we may believe, without taking any Security for it, that <hi>England</hi> will continue the Seat of Empire till it falls under the Sway of a Soveraign who has another Dominion at leaſt equal to it.</p>
               <p>But that Article which ſeems of moſt Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance in Favour of <hi>England</hi> (and which would be truly valuable if it were poſſible duly to fulfil and obſeve it) will be found either <hi>unjuſt</hi> or <hi>impoſſible</hi> in the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It is that which provides—We ſhall not involve ourſelves in the Quarrels or Defence of the Dominions on the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, which may belong to the Succeſſor. With all due Loyalty to his Majeſty and Deference to the Princeſs <hi>Anne</hi> and her Hopes of Iſſue; let us ſuppoſe an Elector of <hi>Hanover</hi> on the Throne of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> and that he may have Occaſion to quarrel for the Rights of theſe King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms with any of his great Neighbours on the Continent; as ſuppoſe the <hi>Swede,</hi> the <hi>Dane,</hi> the <hi>Pole,</hi> the <hi>Pruſſian,</hi> the <hi>Saxon,</hi> or the <hi>Auſtrian;</hi> Will they take a Bull by the Horns? Will they attack him where he is ſtrongeſt, and chuſe to fit out Fleets
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0653500404:54"/>
to diſpute it with <hi>England</hi> on the Seas, where they are certain to be worſted? Will they not rather with Fifty thouſand Men come againſt his Ten thouſand, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm <hi>Brunſwick</hi> as a Reprizal on the King of <hi>Great-Britain?</hi> If this ſhould at any Time be the Caſe, would it be gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, would it be juſt and honeſt to ſuffer it? Would not our Coolneſs on ſuch an Occaſion, tempt or provoke even a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Prince to make Treaties, not quite ſo much to our Advantage as they ought to be, for Fear of cauſing his innocent Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion on the Continent to bear our Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, to be the Scape-Goat of his Iſland-Empire?</p>
               <p>I believe nobody can doubt, that the fine Webs of Politicks may be ſo intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cately woven, and the Affairs of <hi>Europe</hi> ſo much embaraſſed, that private Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men will prove but very indifferent Judges to determine this Queſtion, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether it be only Knight-Errantry, or Neceſſary Juſtice in this Kingdom at ſuch or ſuch a Time to be at the Expence of protecting the Electorate? or to know what is the true Foundation of the Preſent Quarrel?</p>
               <p>We ſhould remember that notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all our Precautions on this Head, the Power of making War and Peace will ſtill reſide in the Crown. It is true the Right
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0653500404:55"/>
of giving Money is in the Commons, and they may refuſe to provide for the Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touneſs of Ambition. I ſhall not preſume to call the Separation of theſe Powers, <hi>of raiſing Armies</hi> and <hi>of raiſing Money,</hi> a Soleciſm in our Conſtitution; nor ſay where I would have them reſide, if to be repoſed in one Conſtituent-part of the Legiſlature; but thus much I may obſerve (becauſe <hi>Charles</hi> II. tho' an indolent Prince, gave us a flagrant Proof of it in the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet at <hi>Chatham</hi>) that if our King makes War without Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; not he, but we are to be the Sufferers, and ſhall then find this Truth,—<hi>delirant Reges, plectuntur Achivi.</hi> I muſt make one further Obſervation of an Hardſhip the Electorate might endure for the Sake of <hi>Great-Britain.</hi> Contrary to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſions of all the Schoolmen and Caſuiſts, it is ſettled as a Principle in the Law of Nations by the Practice of modern Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticians and their Maſters; that, if your Neighbour is too powerful, it is a juſt Cauſe of making War upon him. Now perhaps there is hardly at this Day a little Prince in all <hi>Germany,</hi> who would not exert himſelf in Defence of the Electorate as it ſtands alone: But for the Reaſon given, the Queſtion would be widely different if the ſame Territory were only a ſmall Part of the Dominions of an <hi>Engliſh</hi> King; they
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0653500404:56"/>
would then perhaps conſider the Balance of Power in a new Light; and the more jealous our Neighbours were grown of the Conjunction, the more ſhould we be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in Honour and common Senſe to defend ſo near an Ally, and to ſupply the Want of all other Confederates.</p>
               <p>I would not be underſtood on the whole to ſay, that <hi>England</hi> would be the happier for ſuch an Acceſs of Dominion on the Continent under the ſame Prince. I think quite otherwiſe; and heartily wiſh that we would, in Time, attempt the only Means to obviate all Difficulties. We might try to get it eſtabliſhed by a Law in the Empire, and certainly make it Part of the Act of Succeſſion here, that this Crown devolving on the Duke of <hi>Brunſwick,</hi> his Duchy and Electorate ſhould <hi>co inſtante</hi> diveſt out of him in Favour of ſome Proteſtant of his Family. I am not at all apprehenſive of his rejecting the Crown on theſe Terms; but if they be not previouſly made a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Succeſſion, it will be idle and unreaſonable to expect a Compliment of that Importance afterwards. Now is our Time while we have in our own Hands a Value abundantly more than equivalent to give for it. It will be too late to make Bargains after we have made a Preſent of that Equivalent.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:0653500404:57"/>
But perhaps the Miſtakes of this Age may be cured by Deſign or Chance in ſome future Generation. A Prince may leave only Female Iſſue to inherit the Throne, and then the <hi>German</hi> Dominion would go to collateral Males, or it may be conquered: And in the then ſubſequent Generation this Kingdom will regret the Loſs of it, as little as we now do that of <hi>Bohemia</hi> an hundred Years ago, and of better Countries on the Continent which formerly paid Obedience to our Kings, and which were but ill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended at the ſevere Expence of Deluges of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Blood and Treaſure.</p>
               <p>Theſe remote Speculations will probably be Realities with our Grand-Children, they will be in earneſt about them, and to their Care I leave them: For perhaps it is a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Happineſs that many of us cannot have our Turns in the Diſpoſal of the World. Tho' I might mean very well, and might fancy myſelf a Judge of Affairs, yet to the Coſt of my Fellow-Creatures I might in the Event be found as miſerable a Bungler as — or the Farmer in the Fable who ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained of <hi>Jupiter</hi> Leave to regulate the Weather within his own Grounds; but had not Knowledge enough of the ſecret Springs of Action in the vegetable World to ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance the Powers committed to his Care: Heat and Cold, Moiſt and Dry were too

               <p>I AM perſuaded you have great Satisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the News of the <hi>Queen</hi>'s Gift of the Firſt Fruits and Tenths to the poor Clergy, as it is a ſtrong Proof of her Zeal for our Eſtabliſhed Religion. The <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors who perſecuted Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity before the Days of <hi>Julian</hi> the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, <hi>occiderunt Presbyteros;</hi> but he, in Appearance more moderate, tho' in Truth wilier and more malicious than his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, <hi>occidit Presbyterium.</hi> He ſpoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Churchmen of their Means of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and by this Method had well nigh deſtroyed the Prieſthood, Starving is doubtleſs as effectual a Form for Death to aſſume, as any other, and perhaps one of the moſt terrible Forms it can aſſume.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Queen</hi>'s Piety on this Occaſion is the Contraſt of <hi>Julian</hi>'s Malice; there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing wanting to compleat the Merit of the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0653500404:62"/>
Deſign, but to ſubſtitute the Word Reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, inſtead of Bounty or Donation: However, it muſt be acknowledged, that there was much to be ſaid to juſtify the Right of the Crown to this Branch of Church-Revenues, which King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. laid his Hands on; for this Revenue had been for Ages enjoyed by the <hi>Pope,</hi> as Head of the Church, therefore theveſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it in the Crown, was but a natural Conſequence of our throwing off the uſurped Supremacy of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What farther enhances the Merit of this Gift, is the preſent Exigency of Publick Affairs: It is done at a Juncture when the Crown is not in a giving Condition. It is to be hoped that late Poſterity who ſhall enjoy the Benefit of it, will revere the Memory of the pious Donor; and that our ſucceeding Monarchs may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited by this laudable Example, to raiſe up the drooping Head of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church, plundered and covered with Rags by an unbelieving Prince, and his ſacrile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Creatures, under the Veil of Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. A Prince more dangerous to the Chriſtian Religion, than <hi>Julian</hi> or <hi>Attila,</hi> becauſe <hi>he communed with it in the Houſe of God, as a Friend.</hi> His Title of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender of the Faith gave him an Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to deſtroy his Charge, that Church,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0653500404:63"/>
which is always in the Condition of a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor.</p>
               <p>I am here induced to lament the Ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice of Eccleſiaſticks, who when they had an ample Dominion over the Minds of Men, graſped at too great a Share of the good Things of this World; they were not content with a competent Income; they thought their Power, their Revenues, their Number could never be ſufficiently augmented. Theſe Maxims, joined to their Vows of Celibacy, which took in both Sexes, and their Care to conceal their Shame when they broke theſe Vows, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered them Enemies to Society, to Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Nature. And as Reformations are too apt to run into an Extream, oppoſite to the Evil deſigned to be remedied, the Church of <hi>England</hi> has dearly paid for the Avarice of that of <hi>Rome:</hi> Men know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the Church had obtained too much, eaſily took up a Notion that they could not leave her too little. They knew that the Monks in dark Ages, had importuned from the Fears of intimidated dying Sinners, unreaſonable Grants of great Eſtates, and along with theſe, the Reforming Generation made no Scruple to rob the Church of its Natural Inheritance, which it had enjoyed from the Piety of pureſt Times, in Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of a Pattern given by God himſelf,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0653500404:64"/>
when he condeſcended to compile a Body of Laws both Civil and Eccleſiaſtical for the Government of his choſen People.</p>
               <p>The Land which had been given by ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious Penitents, to found or endow the Nurſeries of Religious Idleneſs, were perhaps very properly reſumed in Favour of the Crown, rather than of the Heirs of the Donors; for had they been reſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the latter, it would have produced ſuch infinite Confuſion among the Claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, as probably would have redounded leſs to their Benefit and the Nation's, than the Method which was taken. But does it alſo follow, that there could be a Difficulty to aſcertain the right Owners of the Paro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chial Tithes, which were found in the Hands of the Monaſteries? It was eaſy to know that the Monaſteries had taken them from the Pariſh-Prieſts, and by worſe Means, if poſſible, than their Influence over the ſtaggering Reſolutions of dying Men. They robbed the ſecular Clergy with a ſtrong Hand, by the Aid of the uſurped arbitrary Power of the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> which was wrought upon by Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to interpoſe in Favour of the Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars; not without an Eye to ſome political Maxims, little leſs than Treaſonable; for the Allegiance of the Subject was divided, by that Soleciſm in Politicks, <hi>imperium in</hi>
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:0653500404:65"/>
                  <hi>imperio;</hi> and frequent Experience told us, that the Regulars knew no Soveraign but the <hi>Pope.</hi> Theſe Sufferings of the Paro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chial Clergy were not a Reaſon, at the Reformation, why they ſhould not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to their own.</p>
               <p>Indeed if it ſhall happen that the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Temper of Poſterity one way or other ſhall bring back the Tithes, or an Equivalent for them, to the Church, I ſhould never wiſh that it might be endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with great Eſtates in Lands into the Bargain. My only Deſire is, that Religion may not ſuffer by making the Clergy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible, who will always be held in Contempt, if they are obliged to live in Poverty.</p>
               <p>In the mean while there might be ſome other Expedients found out, that would contribute to place them in a comfortable Condition to attend their great Charge, the Care of Souls. There are too many Pariſhes in <hi>England,</hi> both in City and Country: It is true, there are ſome Pariſhes too large, which ought to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided; but there are a great many more too ſmall, which would be better united: Two or three inſufficient Proviſions for ſo many Paſtors of little and ill attended Flocks, may amount to a competent Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainance for one able Miniſter, who may
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0653500404:66"/>
do his Duty with Satisfaction to a decent Congregation.</p>
               <p>Perhaps alſo it is not now neceſſary that the Revenues of Colleges ſhould be as ample as formerly for the Education of Youth, when the Nation is overſtocked with Learning already, and there are not Benefices ſufficient to receive the Men who have gone thro' the Courſe of their Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demical Studies. I could therefore rejoice that we had fewer People educated on Charity to fill the Church; not at all dreading the Want of a Supply from thoſe of better Fortunes, if we could contrive to advance the Benefices to a reaſonable Value; which would be much furthered by taking away ſome Superfluities of Schools and Colleges, and beſtowing them in the Endowment of the Church, where they are moſt wanted. I am far from thinking it for the Benefit of Religion or of the Nation, to diminiſh the Number of Profeſſors or Fellows in either Univerſity. It will always be neceſſary to the Perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency of ſound Learning, that there ſhould be a conſiderable Number of Men of good Parts and Education maintained at full Leiſure to attend their Studies in every Branch of Literature. But will this alſo prove that there is a National Advantage in bringing forward yearly, at the publick
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0653500404:67"/>
Expence, an hundred Perſons to the Degree of Batchelor of Arts, who know not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards which Way to turn themſelves, and have Reaſon to wiſh, that inſtead of reading <hi>Ramus</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> they had been taught to throw the Shuttle, or hold the Plough of their Fore-Fathers.</p>
               <p>A poor Man may be as honeſt as a rich one, but it is not generally ſo eaſy to tempt the latter into mean and ſcandalous Actions. The Neceſſities of ſome of the loweſt of the Clergy, are apt to lead them into Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes that cauſe a Clamour againſt the very Prieſthood, and do a real Diſſervice to Religion. And yet theſe meaneſt of the People <hi>(who ſeek the Prieſt's Office, that they may eat a Piece of Bread)</hi> are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ready to fancy themſelves Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, and that their Families are alſo advanced in Blood and Degree. Hence it happens in their Oeconomy, that during the Father's Life-time, the Son is bred at a Free-ſchool, undoubtedly deſigned to be a Biſhop at leaſt; the Father drops off, and then the poor Youth is glad to find Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment as a Drawer in a Tavern, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps to wear a Livery, and it is well if no worſe happens. As for the Daughter, ſhe learns to dance, and play on Muſical Inſtruments; and becauſe ſhe is a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman, ſhe ſcorns to do the Offices of a
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0653500404:68"/>
Country Houſewife at home, or to go to Market along with the Wives and Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Neighbouring Farmers. Her Education is like that which the unhappy Gentry of <hi>Georgia</hi> are ſaid to give their Daughters to fit them for the Seraglios of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> and <hi>Perſian</hi> Grandees, and the Event is often worſe, if poſſible. The beſt Proſpect after ſuch an Education, is an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Servitude.</p>
               <p>Which of the Biſhops (if he has not made himſelf remarkable for Moroſeneſs) is not daily peſtered with Eccleſiaſtical Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gars, the pretended or real Widows and Orphans of indigent Clergymen, beſides Crouds of indigent Clergymen themſelves. I do not obſerve theſe Facts, as believing it improper for Clergymen to marry; but being of Opinion, that thoſe of them who marry and cannot ſave any thing for their Families, ſhould at leaſt teach them to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure and work thro' that low State of Life they are born to: And I alſo conſider it as a Reaſon for augmenting the Value, tho' we ſhould conſiderably diminiſh the Number, of Benefices in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I rejoice as an <hi>Engliſhman</hi> that our Clergy are rather ten thouſand than an hundred thouſand: There are the fewer idle Hands in the Nation, compared with its
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0653500404:69"/>
                  <hi>Popiſh</hi> Neighbours, therefore our Wealth is the greater.</p>
               <p>I rejoice alſo that theſe ten thouſand are not reſtrained from Marriage: For, this ſingle Advantage will in a few Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations ſpread the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Religion over <hi>Europe,</hi> by our gradual Increaſe of People and the Decreaſe of the <hi>Papiſts;</hi> unleſs the Almighty, for his own ſecret Purpoſes, ſhall ſend ſome more Kings to reign in <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant</hi> Kingdoms, like the preſent King of <hi>Sweden.</hi> Were it not that <hi>Cromwell</hi> (in too great Haſte to ſettle that miſerable King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Ireland</hi>) gave vaſt Multitudes of the Natives to the <hi>Spaniard;</hi> and that the late Revolution, and ſome Laws which followed it relating to Religion, and others concerning Trade, have ſent great Numbers of the ſame People to <hi>France</hi> (all which have been replaced by the Natives of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> beſides our large Export to our <hi>American</hi> Colonies) <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this muſt have felt more ſenſibly, how burthenſome their Religion is to the State: And theſe our <hi>Britiſh</hi> Iſlands would have grown up by this Time as populous as the <hi>United Netherlands.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It cannot be pretended that the taking away the Funds from the Scholarſhips, and Exhibitions in the Free-Schools and the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities, to apply them to the Augmenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:0653500404:70"/>
of poor Livings, can work an Injury to any one; it is true, that whoever is in Poſſeſſion of an Income of that Nature, ought to enjoy his legal Eſtate in it; but on the Vacancy, (no Individual having a Right) the Publick may well and juſtly apply it to the moſt laudable Purpoſe; and I believe it is hardly a Queſtion in our Age and Country, which is the more eligible Species of Charity, (the Education of poor Scholars, or Maintainance of poor Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticks with Cure of Souls?) To this I may add, that many of the Eſtates which are in that unneceſſary Method of Charity, were for a like Reaſon taken from another uſeleſs People and given to the preſent Poſſeſſors; whoſe Number is now become a Nuiſance to the Nation.</p>
               <p>I would alſo propoſe that my Lords the Biſhops would contribute to the Dignity and Sanctity of the Prieſthood, by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching nearer to an Equality of Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue among themſelves, with ſuch Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that on the one Hand each might have ſufficient to enable him with Decency to attend his Service in Parliament; and on the other, that their Behaviour there might not be ſo frequently ſuſpected by the Laity, as it has formerly been, as if they were too ready to obey the Nod of a Miniſter of State; and to hope to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0653500404:71"/>
a ſudden Promotion to a tenfold Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue; to take a ſpeedy Flight from the Dreary Mountains of <hi>Snowdon,</hi> to the warm old ſnug Palace of <hi>Lambeth.</hi> What think you, Sir, would not Two thouſand Pounds a Year be a decent Income for a Biſhop? (ſome of them might have ſomething more allotted to them, as my Lord of <hi>London,</hi> and others, who have moſt Occaſion to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide often in Town, or in other expenſive Parts of the Kingdom) and would not Three thouſand Pounds each be a tolerable Income for our two Metropolitans? The reſt of the Epiſcopal Revenues might be applied to the Support of their inferior Bretheren: And without a Bill to prevent Tranſlations (a Bill which honeſt Men have ſometimes been tempted to wiſh for) we might live to ſee a certain Bench filled with Patriots, and this without enduring that abſurd Inconvenience which an Act againſt Tranſlations would introduce. For, under ſuch a Law, if the Prince ſhould have it in his View to advance to the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of Church Preferment, the moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving Prieſt in <hi>England;</hi> when the worſt Dioceſe becomes vacant, he muſt not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote him, becauſe under ſuch a Law it would put a Negative upon his farther Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement; ſo that a Man of the moſt cnoſummate Merit, might after many Years
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0653500404:72"/>
Expectation, die a private and poor Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, becauſe he was deſigned to be Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of <hi>Canterbury.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this long Letter, will paſs with you for one of my Reſveries; eſpecially my laſt Scheme: For nothing like it can ever be executed, unleſs the Temporal Lords ſhould in ſome future Age happen to think as I do, and attend in Parliament with Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, to accompliſh an Alteration.</p>

               <p>THE Union is at length as good as concluded; it was hard, or rather impoſſible, to ſettle the Terms of it to every body's liking, but the grand De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign was always deſirable to the Unpreju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced of both Nations, and our late Blun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders have made it more neceſſary to us than ever it was.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Edinburgh</hi> will doubtleſs ſuffer by the Loſs of the Parliament there, and of the Reſort of their Nobility; but in the main, the Kingdom muſt grow richer upon being let into the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Trade, inſtead of their late wretched Condition, without any va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable Branch of Commerce, or any ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0653500404:73"/>
Proſpect of obtaining one. They are now to be Members of a flouriſhing Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire; an Empire, ſafer and happier <hi>(ſua ſi bona nôrit)</hi> than the greateſt on the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent; becauſe in its Natural (its Naval) Strength, it is much more powerful than any of its Neighbours.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Scotland</hi> uſed to be the Penſioner of <hi>France,</hi> uſed to ravage two or three of our Northern Counties, to burn our Houſes, and run away with our Cattle; and often felt the Severity of our Reprizals. But, in one Generation, that Border will grow enamoured with the Arts of Peace, and ſuch of their great Men as love Penſions, may haply enjoy them with leſs Hazard than of old, without the Danger of ſeeing their Country deſtroyed by Fire and Sword, as a Reward for their mercenary Politicks. As for our Parts, it is no Trifle to remove for ever the Probability of being attacked in the Rear by Enemies far from being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicable in Point of Bravery, and not to be deſpiſed becauſe of their Poverty; for their Poverty contributed to create our Danger. That Poverty and that Bravery will for the future exalt our Hopes, inſtead of creating our Fears. Our People on this Side <hi>Tweed,</hi> may well be ſpared, to ply the Loom and Hammer, while the Heroes of <hi>Cathneſs</hi> and <hi>Sutherland,</hi>—<q>

                     <l>To their great Anceſtors, they glad receive,</l>
                     <l>And hail Flock Beds, Wheat Bread, and <hi>Cheſhire</hi> Cheeſe:</l>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>We have ſome very worthy Men among us, who are much diſguſted at the Care that is taken of the Kirk; the Preſervation of which is a ſundamental Article. They alledge that <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> was unfairly outed, and that the Majority of the Nobility and Gentry of that Kingdom would, if they could, reſtore it at this Day. But the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the Kirk is at preſent a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition without which no Union can be had; the Populace will not yet part with the <hi>Meſs Johns.</hi> That muſt be expected in a cooler Seaſon, and then the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Article will be a Cobweb. It is abſurd to attempt to make irrevocable Laws for Poſterity; every Generation muſt of Neceſſity have a Right to chuſe for it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. This ridiculous Notion of immutable Laws, was however a Maxim in Law among the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians.</hi> Obſerve the Conſequence: Their Emperor To-day pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulges an IMMUTABLE Edict to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy all the <hi>Jews,</hi> and on the Morrow ſends forth another, that they may take Arms for their Defence, and that all his
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0653500404:75"/>
loving Subjects ſhall aſſiſt them. Can any common Lawyer or Civilian deny, that there will be in the united Legiſlature of <hi>Great-Britain</hi> an unlimited Power over the whole Body, and every Part of it; or, that they will have ſufficient Authority to repeal any Law which either of the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Kingdoms made. What the <hi>Sultan</hi> is in <hi>Turky,</hi> and the <hi>Mogul</hi> in <hi>India,</hi> the Parliament of <hi>Great-Britain</hi> muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily be, in the Plenitude of its Power.</p>
               <p>Another Complaint among us is, that the Members which <hi>Scotland</hi> furniſhes to both Houſes, amount to a tenth or a twelfth of the Parliament, tho' they are not to pay above a thirtieth of the Taxes of the united Kingdom: I do not fear being ſuſpected as a Partizan for the <hi>Scots,</hi> when I declare, that I believe this to be ſtill very equal; for tho' we leave them an open Trade, yet the Profits of that will be ſwallowed in the Rents of all their beſt Eſtates, and muſt center in <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Middleſex.</hi> It will be well enough if the publick Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney raiſed among them ſuffices to anſwer all the publick Demands there: Their great Men will live here, and in a Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or two will become mere <hi>Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is one Omiſſion in the Articles of this Union, with regard to the Perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuity
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0653500404:76"/>
of the <hi>Scots</hi> Peerage. There are no new Peers to be made there, and they are always to ſend ſixteen to Parliament, by Election. I believe their Number is pretty large at preſent, ſuppoſe one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty; but theſe will gradually decreaſe, and be extinguiſhed by one Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident or other, for there are no perpetual Succeſſions, no Biſhops among them. I lately obſerved this to a very intelligent Gentleman of that Nation: He looked on it as a remote Evil, <hi>For,</hi> ſays he, <hi>moſt of the Peerages there, are inheritable by the Daughters, when Sons fail;</hi> I allowed this for a Reaſon why Peerages ſhould not eaſily be extinguiſhed; but I am convinced, that thus they will more readily decreaſe by Unity of Poſſeſſion, occaſioned by Marriages both among their own Nobility and ours, which will have a quicker Effect than the Extinction of the Male-Lines by the Courſe of Nature, ſeparate Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and Venery. Almoſt as often as a <hi>Scots</hi> Coronet devolves upon a Female, it will conſolidate that Peerage with ſome other, ſo that in Effect there is a <hi>Scots</hi> Peerage merged for ever.</p>
               <p>There is another Way left open to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh their Number, for tho' a <hi>Scots</hi> Peer muſt not be made an <hi>Engliſh</hi> one, yet his Son or Brother may; and thus
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:0653500404:77"/>
upon the Fall of one Life, there will be one Peer leſs on their Liſt. So it is likely they will hardly have ſixteen Lords left in an hundred Years. I have not been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed whether this Omiſſion was by Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take, but it is really of little or no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence. Since <hi>Scots</hi> are capable of being made Peers of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> it matters not from what Caſtles, Towns or Villages they take their Titles, nor whether North or South of <hi>Tweed:</hi> It will only ſound a little abſurd to Poſterity, that the ſame Perſon who may be called to Parliament as Lord of <hi>Hammerſmith,</hi> ſhall be refuſed Admittance as Duke of <hi>Edinburgh.</hi> For the reſt, the Locality of Titles happens not to be material, for if this Kingdom preſerves its Conſtitution, Poſterity ſhall always find moſt of its largeſt Fortunes and greateſt Men, in the Houſe of Peers of <hi>Great-Britain:</hi> But if, for Our Sins or Theirs, our Poſterity ſhall bow the Knee before a Tyrant, after the Manner of the Nations round about us, and the Houſes of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in a Venal Generation concur to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Conſtitution, it is a Matter of no Sort of Importance who ſhall be the Parri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cides.</p>
               <p>We might be content that the Numbers both of their Lords and Commons to ſit in the United-Parliament were to be double or
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:0653500404:78"/>
treble thoſe agreed on. Thus we ſhould have more of their Wealth drawn hither, and our Conſtitution would be ſafer from the Attempts of the Crown, as it would be harder to manage or gratify ſo great a Number. This is what we ought to attend to on all Occaſions. I deſign to make my Grandſons learn it along with their Prayers and their Creed, That the <hi>Liberties of England can only be deſtroyed by a Standing Army of her own Sons; and that Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary Bribery is the moſt proper Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod to obtain ſuch an Army.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And yet it is ſtrange, that Men can ſell themſelves and Poſterities for an Eſtate at Will! You ſhall find in ſome foreign Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries a Man of Two Thouſand Pounds a Year of Inhertance, who for ſo ſmall a Bribe as an Office or Penſion of Five Hundred Pounds a Year, during Pleaſure, ſhall give his Vote for a Law, which in its Conſequence renders his Inheritance as precarious as the Penſion. Is this being wiſe in our Generation? is this to be juſtified even by the Wiſdom of the Children of this World?</p>
               <p>What Age, what Kingdom can ſhew an immediate Suceſſion of three good abſolute Monarchs? or in what Country have Liberty, Corruption and a Standing Army gone Hand in Hand for forty Years together? It is an idle Imagination to ſuppoſe, that when a King deſigns to rule by his Will, he muſt
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:0653500404:79"/>
do as the <hi>Danes</hi> did, diſcard his States, and rely upon his Troops. That is indeed the ſhorteſt Way, but not the ſafeſt. When <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus</hi> had eſtabliſhed himſelf againſt all Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers, he did not covet a great Army, he choſe to keep a packed Senate in Pay; he gulled the People with an Appearance of Liberty, and the Adminiſtration of his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment was gentle: But <hi>Rome</hi> was ruined, it loſt its Liberty, and was as effectually en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaved under him, as under <hi>Nero</hi> or <hi>Domitian.</hi>

Their Penſion-Senate is a more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant Charge upon them, than a great Army would be. If I were to live in an Age and Country where the Repreſentatives of the People had ſold them to the Prince for Places and Penſions, and given him a Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Force to enſure the Purchaſe; I would concur in and promote a Petition, that the Prince might aſſume the Legiſlative Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, excluſive of ſuch proſtitute Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives: and I think it is evident, that in ſuch
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:0653500404:80"/>
a Caſe, whether a Prince were good or bad, a Wiſe Man or a Fool, the People could more eaſily pay for the Wants or the Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſs of the Monarch alone, than for thoſe and the Wages of ſeveral hundreds of Parricides into the Bargain.</p>
               <p>Nor is a People the ſafer from ſuch At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts, for having a Ruler of their own chuſing. The ambitious Man, when he has climbed all the Rounds of the Ladder of Authority, turns his Back to it, and ſcorns the baſe Degrees by which he roſe. In all mixed Governments, each conſtituent Part muſt be eternally on its Guard. The Prince can eaſily take Care of his Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative, becauſe, being but one, he can al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be true to, and conſiſtent with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. His Individuality gives him thoſe Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, and the <hi>Prae-exiſtent</hi> Temptation of Ambition, that Spur to make uſe of them, that he ought never to be truſted with more than his own Rights, if the Subjects would hold theirs. I tranſcribe for you the Pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a vigorous Prince, riding a Nation after he had defeated its Enemies.<q>

Since I am grown a little pedantick upon the Subject of Slavery, I will put you in Mind of the ridiculous, the miſerable Figure which a Mock-Senate makes: You have two beautiful Sketches of ſuch Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles in <hi>Juvenal,</hi> proper to excite your Laughter and Indignation. In one you have the Prime Miniſter deſtroyed at once, on his Maſter's Letter; the World agrees in an Opinion, <hi>Sejanus</hi> was guilty, but Juſtice would expect ſome Proof of it: <hi>Tiberuis</hi> had too loyal a Senate to wait for any Evidence: their Tyrant ſignified his Pleaſure; and that ſerved for Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to <hi>that very Senate</hi> which had voted Statues to <hi>that very Prime Miniſter.</hi> The other Scene is the merry one, where they take into Conſideration the over-grown <hi>Turbet:</hi> Nothing can be more fantaſtick than the blind Haranguer making a florid Speech in Praiſe of it, and unfortunately turning his Face from it to the contrary Side of the Room, in order to point out and deſcant upon its Beauties. Such are the <hi>Ardua Negotia Imperii</hi> proper to be laid before a Parliament of Slaves. Such are the <hi>Arcana</hi> fit for them to debate on.</p>

               <p>YOU rightly obſerve, that this hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed Prieſt has coſt both Houſes more Time and Trouble than his Head is worth. What matters it if he has been too peremptory in the Pulpit, on a Subject he might better have let alone. Some Parts of his Sermons are little better than Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe, but the general Doctrine may be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by the Authority of all our moſt eminent Divines, and correſponds with that Maxim in Law, that <hi>the King can do no Wrong.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I think the Doctor and his Proſecutors have ſplit on the ſame Rock; an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Caſe, like the Revolution, is quite out of the ordinary Rules of Law, and not defined among the general Learning of the Caſuiſts concerning the Obedience of Subjects to their Soveraign. The Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor ought not to have drawn the Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into the Debate, nor ought we to fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, that the Maxims of the Laws of God,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:0653500404:85"/>
of Nature, and of the Land, are changed by that extraordinary Occaſion and Event. Tho' I am perſuaded the ſame Tenet has been taught ever ſince our Reformation, yet this Gentleman's Manner of teaching it is indiſcreet; and his Warmth has been ſingular ſeveral Years ago. <hi>Defoe,</hi> in his <hi>Hymn to the Pillory,</hi> has long ſince juſtly celebrated the Doctor's intemperate Zeal againſt the Diſſenters; (I think <hi>Defoe</hi> had been then exalted for writing <hi>The ſhorteſt Way with the Diſſenters</hi>) He wiſhes, that all who merit equal Puniſhment might ſtand there along with him; and then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending to Particulars, ſays he,<q>

                     <l>Sounding the firſt Cruſado in the Land.</l>
                     <l>He from a <hi>Church-of-England</hi> Pulpit firſt,</l>
                     <l>All his Diſſenting Brethren curſt,</l>
                     <l>Doom'd them to Satan, for a Prey,</l>

               <p>But the Conſequence of this mighty Eclat is, that moſt People are apt to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider a Sentence againſt this Preacher, (not as a Condemnation of this Temerity by inſtancing the Revolution upon an impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Occaſion, and of his unwarrantable pronouncing Damnation againſt the Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:0653500404:86"/>
but) as an Eſtabliſhment of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretionary Reſiſtance of the Subject, and as a Degradation of Kingly Power in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> to the Condition of the Conſular in <hi>Rome,</hi> controled by the Senate, Tribunes, and People; and all this, by a ſolemn Judgement of the Lords, at the Demand of the Commons.</p>
               <p>Our Political Penmen, who ſwarm in every Age, will not fail hereafter to magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy every Miſtake, every Slip, in every Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration; and even to call Virtue, Vice; Sweet, Bitter; and Good, Evil. <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gernon Sidney</hi>'s Treatiſe of Government will paſs upon many for the Law of the Land; and thoſe who approve moſt of the Revolution, may live to ſee this latitudinarian Allegiance (which the miſguided People will be apt to learn) become troubleſome under the beſt Princes.</p>
               <p>I ſhould think therefore this Proſecution cannot have been a very agreeable Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Queen, nor a pleaſing Specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to thoſe who are in the Courſe of Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion to the Crown.</p>

               <p>But <hi>England</hi> ſeems, as well as <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> to have occaſion for a Peace, and for ſome of the ſame Reaſons.

paying our Blood and Treaſure to ſet <hi>Charles</hi> on the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Throne, when we can leave <hi>Philip</hi> there without farther Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence; and when, of the two, it is rather our Intereſt that <hi>Philip</hi> ſhould fill it; and the beſt of the Jeſt is, that not one of them pretends to ſhew how <hi>Great-Britain</hi> is to be reimburſed a ſingle Stiver, whatever her Expence has been, or may be hereafter.

A ſmall Portion in theſe would anſwer our Purpoſes, better than twenty Capital Fortreſſes on the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent of <hi>Europe.</hi> They would be a Mine, and not an Iſſue of Treaſure.

               <p>I am ſtrangely fond of thoſe <hi>American</hi> Iſlands, and think I can juſtify my Notion by a ſhort Obſervation upon a well known Piece of Hiſtory.

them; but as long as they were kept, they grumbled alſo at the great Expence of main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining them.

               <p>The Dominion of the Seas is what we are able to maintain, it maintains itſelf: The more we have of it, the leſs Danger we are in of being invaded in it by the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vying World confederated againſt us.

               <p>If our Iſland-Colonies were very conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable in Number and Value, we ſhould find this great Convenience, that they would require no Gariſons, becauſe no Armament could appear upon the Seas, ſufficient to diſturb them: Nor ought we to oppreſs them, nor ſuffer them to be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed

rapacious Governors. But while our Neighbours are ſtronger in thoſe Parts than we are, both We are, and the Colonies muſt be burthened with the Expence of an armed Force both by Sea and Land for their Security. Were they ever ſo populous, had they as many People among them as their Mother Country contains; there would be no Danger of their Defection, while we gave them no Cauſe to mourn the Want of Liberty. Their Trade would all paſs thro' our Hands, protected by our Fleets, while they lived at Eaſe, and in as perfect Obedience as the ſeveral Pariſhes of <hi>Middleſex.</hi>

               <p>YOUR Complaint is very juſt, that by the Titles of Impeachments in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, a Man at a Diſtance off cannot gueſs what the Accuſation is. This againſt the Earl of <hi>M**</hi> conſiſted chiefly of two Branches; one, that he ſold the Offices of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters in Chancery for very great Sums of Money; which Offices are in ſome Degree judicial; the Sale of them therefore muſt naturally introduce Corruption in the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, according to the Adage, He that buys Juſtice, muſt ſell Juſtice, The other Branch is, that to conceal this Sin, (as it commonly happens) he fell into a greater: Large Sums of Money, belonging chiefly to Orphans, had by the Authority of the Court been depoſited in the Hands of theſe Maſters; ſome of them thought it a proper Opportunity to grow rich, nor ſcrupled to adventure the Fortunes of their Neighbours: they met with woeful Diſappointments of their Expectations;
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:0653500404:97"/>
there were great Deficiencies, and the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor, to ſcreen them, was guilty of ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Delays of Juſtice, by putting off the Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Cauſes affected by theſe Loſſes</p>
               <p>To the Wonder of the gazing World, and maugre the zealous Endeavours of ſome moſt Noble Peers, this corrupt Man is to continue a Judge, upon his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, of the Lives and Fortunes of <hi>Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men;</hi> he is to continue to make our Laws, and to interpret them. He is condemned in thirty thouſand Pounds, it is true, but, <hi>cui bono?</hi> Not to repair the ſuffering Sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors; but as a Fine to the Crown, (which perhaps may remit it) tho' the People have received the greateſt Injury. How then are the Sufferers to be repaired, think ye? Why, truly, it is rumoured, by a Tax to be laid on the Suitors in that Court. The innocent Suitors, who may be eſteemed ſufficiently unfortunate in having Occaſion to reſort thither, are to be puniſhed for the Iniquities of the Chancellor.</p>
               <p>The Houſe of Lords is not bound by the Forms of the Courts below Stairs, and the Impeachments before them are managed pretty much in the Stile of the Civil Law; it were to be wiſhed, in the Caſe of this Earl, they had adopted a Form of that Law which is proper to produce a juſt and rational Sentence upon Crimes like
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:0653500404:98"/>
theſe they have lately cenſured. The Criminal Proceſs, among the Civilians, is frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if not always, in the Nature of an Action <hi>Qui tam,</hi> &amp;c. I have ſeen a Libel of theirs for Homicide, which amounted to an Appeal, as well as Indictment. In a Caſe like this, they would, in the firſt Place, have given Relief to the Injured out of his Eſtate, and then have made a reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Confiſcation to the Prince, as a Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Crimes. Thus they would have fulfilled the Dictates both of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutative and Diſtributive Juſtice. Reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was barely a Debt, and Confiſcation was a moderate Puniſhment.</p>
               <p>If a Sentence of Sir <hi>George Oxenden</hi>'s, who opened this Impeachment, had been duly weighed, we ſhould hardly ſee the Innocent taxed for the Crimes of the ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Guilty.<note n="*" place="bottom">See the Cloſe of the XVIth Letter.</note> But we have never been fond of changing our Laws, no not even for the better; the Lords in Parliament, four hundred Years ago, to reject a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous Eccleſiaſtical Propoſal, anſwered, <hi>Nolumus leges Angliae mutari.</hi> An anſwer highly laudable on that Occaſion! and ever ſince we have it trumped up to us, as a Maxim, without the leaſt Attention to the Difference of the Matters in Queſtion. I will mention to you Two ſtrong Inſtances (inſtead of twenty) of our ſupine Neglect
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:0653500404:99"/>
in amending our Laws. The Landlord from all Antiquity might diſtrain his Tenant for Rent due, and then the Diſtreſs muſt periſh in his Hands, if the Tenant could not pay; for the Lord could not ſell it, till enabled by a Statute made in the Days of King <hi>Charles</hi> II. This Piece of Common Law we ſent to <hi>Ireland,</hi> but they found the Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy one hundred and fifty Years earlier than we did. Another Inſtance is, that the then Statute of Adminiſtrations (which is but a Tranſlation from the one hundred and eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Novel) was made in the latter End of the ſame Reign, and no earlier; and we are ſure that our Law was a regular and flouriſhing Profeſſion four hundred Years without it. Perhaps it flouriſhed the more, for differing in many Points from common Senſe.</p>

               <p>THERE is one of the Wonders of the World to be accompliſhed this Seſſion; the Salt Tax will be aboliſhed. It is a new Thing for the Crown to loſe Ground in the Revenue. Our Hiſtory ſhews very few Inſtances of the kind. Tho' the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:0653500404:100"/>
Occaſion was moſt urgent when the Tax was impoſed, and tho' the Grant of it was only temporary, and for a very ſhort Time too, yet Pretences have been always found to continue the Burthen, when the Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity ceaſed. Our Oracle in the Law and Records of Parliament obſerves, that Ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage and Poundage were granted firſt to King <hi>Henry</hi> the Fifth, to enable Him to invade and conquer <hi>France;</hi> but his unfortunate Son, who loſt that Acquiſition back again, enjoyed the ſame Revenue, as did alſo Queen <hi>Mary</hi> the Firſt, who loſt <hi>Calais,</hi> the only Fragment of it that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained till her Time. So forcible is a Poſſeſſion in the Crown, that People are apt to ſuffer it to turn to a Right. But this Miſtake coſt King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt dear; it was the Firſt Grievance of his Reign and diſpoſed a knowing, a reſolute Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Freeman (whoſe Spirits were not broken by Taxes and Standing Armies) to examine every thing with Rigour. Yet not all the Difficulties and Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes of his Reign could deter his Son, King <hi>James</hi> the Second (tho' he did not want the Money) from levying the ſame Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue before it was given by Parliament. I think we have one Inſtance in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Hiſtory, of the Monarch's taking leſs than the Subject gave, and that was in the Days
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:0653500404:101"/>
of Good Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> who choſe to reign in the Hearts of her People, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed Monopolies, and particular Schemes of robbing the Publick, and eſteemed the Wealth and Honour of the Nation as her own.</p>
               <p>If Farmers in their Tillage and their Diet, Merchants in Victualling their Ships, Potters in their Manufacture, but above all, the Fiſhery (that <hi>Diu multumque deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deratum</hi> of <hi>Great Britain</hi>) require ſuch immenſe Quantities of Salt, that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to maintain the Officers, and to make any conſiderable Profit of that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue, if we allow Draw-backs for all thoſe Purpoſes (not to ſpeak of the frequent Frauds upon Exportation) and as on the other Hand, we would not have our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours Till their Land, Navigate their Ships, Cure their Fiſh, and even be able to ſell an earthen Pitcher cheaper than we can; it is really amazing to conſider how this Tax came firſt to be granted in this Nation; but it is much more aſtoniſhing that the Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of its Michiefs had not long ago awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened the Legiſlature to redeem it. It is not ſtrange that the People ſhould gladly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the Opportunity of Deliverance from this Oppreſſion; the Miracle is, that a Firſt Miniſter ſhould give his Voice for ſo conſiderable a Reduction of his
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:0653500404:102"/>
Myrmidons, ſhould concur in aboliſhing a Tax which ſeems calculated to create Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterial Dependencies, and to corrupt Voices for Parliamentary Elections. Perhaps, like <hi>Sylla,</hi> he knows he has ſo well convinced the World of his tranſcendent Ability for Miſchief, that he may retire in Safety with the Spoil of Nations, and deſerve the Thanks of Mankind for plaguing them no longer. But if he deſigns to purſue the Plan which he has hitherto proceeded on, the Trained Bands of the Salt-Duty are an ill-judged Reduction of his Forces: He does not uſually commit ſuch Blunders in Domeſtick Politicks, whatever his Enemies object to his Skill and Addreſs in Foreign Treaties. Taxes, burthenſome as This is, make Standing Armies neceſſary; and great Armies cannot be maintained without bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenſome Taxes; they are Bawd and Punk to each other, but the poor Nation is always the Cully.</p>
               <p>It is a Propoſition as demonſtrable as any in <hi>Euclid,</hi> that heavy Taxes muſt naturally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy this or any other trading populous Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which depends greatly on its own Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures. Yet neither the ſmall Vulgar nor the Great can comprehend this Truth. If <hi>France</hi> can maintain her Manufacturer, in proper Provinces, at Ten Pounds <hi>per Ann.</hi> when ours muſt coſt Twenty, and if the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:0653500404:103"/>
Value of 30 <hi>l.</hi> in Wool will employ at leaſt ſix Perſons, at a Medium, <hi>per Ann.</hi> the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Account will ſtand thus, For Wool 30 <hi>l.</hi> for Work, 120 <hi>l.</hi> Total, 150 <hi>l.</hi> The <hi>French</hi> may be ſtated thus, For Wool, 40 <hi>l.</hi> for Work, 60 <hi>l.</hi> Total, 100 <hi>l.</hi> ſo that the <hi>French</hi> may ſell Wares of equal Goodneſs at 100 <hi>l.</hi> which we ſhall not be able to ſell under 150 <hi>l.</hi> and this upon a Suppoſition too, that they pay 20<hi>l.</hi> for one third Part of their Quantity of Wool which coſts us on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly 10 <hi>l.</hi> Thus if we ſuppoſe that they uſe two thirds of their own Growth, they can af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford to give for what they buy from us, or from <hi>Ireland,</hi> double the Price of our Market, and yet ſell ſo much cheaper than we can, as is already ſtated.</p>
               <p>Our Manufacturers make a Noiſe about the running of Wool, and about that only, as if this were their only Evil. They are aſſiſted in their Clamour, and miſled in their Reaſoning, by thoſe whoſe Buſineſs it is to raiſe a Duſt, and to hide the true, the principal Cauſe of the Declenſion of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Trade; that is of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Grandeur. This aſſigning <hi>non cauſa pro cauſa,</hi> is (when it can paſs upon People) the moſt dangerous kind of Sophiſtry; the Principle being falſe, the falfe Deductions from it may be numberleſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:0653500404:104"/>
If a Maſter Weaver, who returns Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Thouſand Pounds a Year in his Trade, ſhould complain that Wool is riſen Ten <hi>per Cent.</hi> by clandeſtine Exportation, and that the Manufacturer is ruined by it; it would be in vain to tell him, that there is a ſingle Evil that prejudices his Manufacture in a much greater Degree: He would laugh at me, as an ignorant Pretender, to preſume to be wiſer than a Man in his own Trade. And yet I may venture to ſay, that the Duty on Soap and Candles is an heavier Clog on the Manufacture, than any probable Advance in the Price of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrought Commodity can amount to. But here is the Difference, the Maſter knows when he pays an advanced Price for Wool, but he forgets that he pays the Candle-Tax in the Wages of the Workman.</p>
               <p>I do not mean upon the Whole, that <hi>France</hi> will be able to cut us out from every particular Branch or Article of the Woollen Manufacture. I doubt not that we are in Poſſeſſion of a Manufacture of ſome Sorts both of Cloths and Stuffs, which they cannot equal; eſpecially without the Help of our Wool, or that of <hi>Ireland.</hi> But then this muſt be admitted, that tho' we could totally cut of the clandeſtine Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation, yet the <hi>French</hi> would ſtill be able to increaſe in the Manufacture of vaſt Quantities of coarſe Goods; and let us
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:0653500404:105"/>
remember, that tho' a Yard of fine Cloth may be worth a Guinea, yet the Proportion of that Export is but ſmall. It is the Cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Millions that makes Millions of Money; and if the <hi>French</hi> are to ſupplant us in foreign Markets for the Sale of coarſe Goods, tho' perhaps the Fountain of our Wealth will not be quite exhauſted, yet I fear it will run miſerably low. It is idle to ſay, that their coarſe Manufactures will not be as good as ours, if they ſell at a lower Price, that will more than compenſate the Difference. The Multitude do not affect the niceſt Goods, they are glad to be warm at a cheap Rate, and I think our Merchants have ſaid ſomething like this in their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Trade to <hi>Lisbon.</hi> They ſay, that the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Goods, are not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable to ours, but becauſe they can un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſell us, they have a ready Market, while ours lye unſold upon the Factors Hands.</p>
               <p>It would be proper to apply this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint againſt <hi>Ireland,</hi> to <hi>France,</hi> and to <hi>Pruſſia</hi> too; for the <hi>Pruſſian</hi> has ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted us very lately in our Trade to <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> to the Value of many Thouſand Pounds a Year for coarſe cloathing for the <hi>Ruſſian</hi> Armies. Does all this depend on the Running of Wool from home? Has the Almighty given fleecy Sheep only to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Ireland?</hi> We may poſſibly hinder Foreigners from getting our Wool, but what
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:0653500404:106"/>
Act of Parliament ſhall prevent their work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up their own? Why do not we make a Law to forbid their Graſs to grow, and to interrupt their Sun-ſhine?</p>
               <p>Nothing but the true Foundation of the Growth of the Wealth of private Dealers, can make a trading Nation flouriſh. We muſt ſell great Quantities and that cannot happen unleſs we ſell at leaſt as cheap as our Neighbours: It is eaſy to ſee, that we cannot effect this, while we are plunged in Debt: It is no Wonder that we are thus in Debt, ſince, after our devouring Land War, we continue to ſupport a great Army at home and abroad ever ſince; and that by Taxes which were half devoured by thoſe who collected them. It is natural for People to flock out of the Mortgaged-Kingdom to <hi>America, France</hi> or <hi>Holland,</hi> or any other Place where their Induſtry may feed and cloath them, which it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not at home: And thus (juſt as it happens in the Caſe of private Perſons) the Increaſe of the Nation's Debt occaſions the Decreaſe of the Means of paying it. The Loſs of the Nation by maintaining a great Army, is not yet ſufficiently ſtated, beſides the poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Loſs of paying them, there is alſo a negative Loſs of at leaſt Two Hundred Thouſand Pounds <hi>per Ann.</hi> which they would and ought to get, if they were left to labour for their Subſiſtence.</p>

                     <p>I Received the Favour of your Lordſhip's Letter, and took it, as I know it was intended, very kindly. The Manner of my receiving the Indignity put upon my Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, was neither like a Chriſtian nor Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher, but like a very worldly Man.

<pb n="107" facs="tcp:0653500404:114"/>
and it affected me accordingly, <hi>i.e.</hi> very little. I am not one that love to be the Talk of the Town, and in this Part I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs I was uneaſy, although I think the Talk was very much in my Favour. The Complaint was <hi>made</hi> by <hi>Hungerford,</hi>
                        <note n="*" place="bottom">A ſneering, trifling, Wrangler, and much more noted, at the Bar, for Noiſe and Clamour, than a Knowledge of the Laws of his Country.</note> and <hi>ſeconded</hi> by <hi>Manley,</hi>

Sir <hi>Peter King,</hi> Sir <hi>Joſeph Jekyll,</hi> Mr. <hi>Lechmere,</hi> and others of the Robe, were very ſtrenuous Advocates in its Behalf, and ſo were other Gentlemen, but to no great Purpoſe, for the <hi>Court</hi> divided 119, and my Friends but 54. If their Deſign was to intimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date me, they have loſt it utterly; or, if to ſuppreſs the Book, it happens much otherwiſe, for every Body's Curioſity is awakened by this <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſage, and the Bookſeller finds his Account in it, above any one elſe. The <hi>Spectator</hi> has conveyed above 14,000 of them into other People's Hands, that would otherwiſe have never ſeen or heard of it. In a word, <hi>My Lord,</hi> when I conſider that theſe Gentlemen have uſed me no worſe,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:0653500404:115"/>
than, I think, they have uſed their own Country, the <hi>Emperour,</hi> the <hi>States,</hi> the <hi>Houſe of Hanover,</hi> and all our Allies Abroad, as well as all the <hi>Braveſt, Wiſeſt,</hi> and the <hi>Honeſteſt</hi> Men we have at Home, I am more inclined to become vain, than any ways depreſs'd at what has befallen me, and intend to ſet up for a Man of Merit upon this very Stock. But Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantry apart, my Heart is wounded within me, when I conſider ſeriouſly whereabouts we are, and whither we are tending. The Court-Party do now own publickly, that except the Allies accept of the Conditions that are offered them, King <hi>Philip</hi> is not to make any <hi>Renunciation;</hi> and certainly the Allies cannot accept of thoſe Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, unleſs they are diſtreſſed to the laſt Degree. We muſt and ſhall have a ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Peace in ſpite of all that can be ſaid, and that muſt be without a <hi>Renunciation</hi> on the Part of <hi>France,</hi> and without a Gua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranty from the Allies; and what a Peace is that like to be? It is now ſaid, that <hi>England</hi> is to conſtrain the King of <hi>France</hi> to content the <hi>States</hi> with a Barrier to their liking, and that the reſt will come in, or ſtand out without any Danger; but I am afraid <hi>England</hi> has loſt all her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining Power, and that <hi>France</hi> thinks ſhe has us in her Hands, and may uſe us as
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:0653500404:116"/>
ſhe pleaſes, which I dare ſay, will be as ſcurvily as we deſerve. What a Change has Two Years made? Your Lordſhip may now imagine you are growing young again, for we are fallen, methinks, into the very Dregs of <hi>Charles the Second</hi>'s Politicks; ſaving, that then they were more reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, becauſe our Enemy was then in ſo full Power and Luſtre, as might both ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify and dazzle a poor luxurious Prince, who would not be diſturbed, nor ſeemed to care much what became of <hi>England</hi> after he was gone. The preſent Times may put you in Mind of thoſe, with this bad Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference ſtill, that now the ruinous Effects of thoſe Advices ſeem to be taking Place after an Interval of five, or ſix, and twenty Years; and after ſuch an Interruption, as one would have thought ſhould have quite baffled and deſtroyed them. I find, <hi>My Lord,</hi> upon reading my Letter, that I have entred upon deep Matters, which, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Times, and the <hi>Spâ</hi> Waters I have taken, I ought not to have done. You will, I hope, excuſe me, for methought I was talking with you, who, I believe favour me. I have, I thank God, an intire Truſt in his Goodneſs, and know he has hitherto preſerved us beyond all reaſonable Hopes, without, and againſt, all our Deſervings; but will he ſtill go on to ſave us againſt
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:0653500404:117"/>
our Will, and in the Midſt of our Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to deſtroy ourſelves? I hope He will, for elſe I think we are a loſt People. I pray God to preſerve your Lordſhip, and all your Family.</p>

                  <p>WHEN a Friend, who is your near Neighbour, informed me of your Return to <hi>Paris,</hi> I reſolved to ſee you, as ſoon as I found myſelf able to ſtir abroad. The Gout obliged me to defer that Happineſs for ſome Time; and when at length I hoped to enjoy it, it was my Misfortune that you was not at home. It remains therefore that I perform by Letter, what I could not do by Word of Mouth; and that I give you hearty Thanks for the many Favours you have conferred on me, of which I ſhall always retain a grateful Remembrance.</p>

Thoſe Preſents of the Books which you have publiſhed of late Years, are to me very valuable, and do me abundance of Honour; for, moſt worthy Sir, I greatly eſteem you, and every Thing of yours. Every thing you write in that Kind of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is finely finiſhed; and I not only pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer you before all other Writers in that Way, but eſteem you as the moſt perfect Maſter both of Style and Sentiment: And tho' I have ſpent ſome little Time and Pains myſelf in Purſuit of this very Study, yet I freely own, that when I read your Works over and over, I learn not only thoſe Things from you which I did not know, but alſo many Things which I thought I had been Maſter of before. Therefore you ſpeak too modeſtly of your Perſorm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, when you ſay it is only calculated for the Inſtruction of Youth. Men who are well acquainted with this Branch of Learning, may certainly read your Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings with Pleaſure, and with Profit. You revive indeed to our Memories Facts that are ancient and well known, but in revive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, you illuſtrate and adorn them; to the Old you add ſomething New; to the Works of Others, ſomething that is intire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly your Own; and by placing good Pictures in a good Light, you bring it to paſs, that they give greater Pleaſure, and appear more
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:0653500404:124"/>
beautiful than ever, even to thoſe who have often ſeen them before.</p>
                  <p>As you frequently turn over <hi>Xenophon,</hi> you clearly ſeem to have borrowed from him both the Matter which you relate in many Places, and the manner of relating it, and you have not only imitated, but have manifeſtly acquired the Perſpicuity and neat Simplicity of his Style: So that, if <hi>Xenophon</hi> had underſtood <hi>French,</hi> I am of Opinion he would have written in no other Words or Manner than you have done upon the ſame Subject.</p>
                  <p>I ſay not theſe Things to flatter (a Vice I am not at all liable to) but from my real Sentiments; and as you have inriched me with the choiceſt Gifts, to which I know myſelf unable to make a ſuitable Return, in the ſame, or any other, Kind of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I was at leaſt deſirous to ſhew a willing and grateful Mind to you, and to make you ſome ſmall Preſent,<note n="*" place="bottom">The Biſhop ſent Him his Sermons.</note> tho' very unlike what I had received. Go on, moſt Learned and Reverend Sir, to deſerve well of the Republic of Letters, in theſe Days too much neglected and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed: Go on to form the Youth of

                  <p>Which that you may accompliſh, may God add many Years to your Life; and may they be attended with Health and Tranquillity. Theſe, Sir, are the hearty Wiſhes of</p>

                  <p>For if a Store of exquiſite Learning can be of any Aſſiſtance in the Diſcharge of this Office, who can diſcharge it with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Applauſe to himſelf, or more Advantage to Us, than One who is well acquainted with <hi>all</hi> Parts of Literature, long and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsfully exerciſed in <hi>moſt</hi> Arts and Studies, moſt accompliſhed and perfect in thoſe Sciences which admit of the greateſt Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection?

The Convention of the Biſhops and Clergy had been now for ſome Years in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted. The Meetings of the States in Parliament for the Management of the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of the <hi>Common-wealth</hi> were frequent; all this time there were no Meetings of the <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>their Clergy,</hi> for the Promotion of the Good of the Church. I don't ſay, I don't think, that this was done with an evil Intent; nay, I am apt to believe, that it proceeded from an Affection to the Church, from a pious Fear of Differences, and an ardent Deſire for the Preſervation of Peace: But however, many Perſons, who neither wanted Honeſty nor Foreſight, thought that this Intermiſſion of Convocations would one time or other prove of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Diſadvantage to the Church. They were under great Apprehenſions, that what they knew was begun by the beſt of Princes, and with the beſt Advice, might by a worſe <hi>Prince,</hi> who had worſe De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, be turned to the Deſtruction of the <hi>Church.</hi> In the mean time many new mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous Doctrines are daily Publiſhed; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Hereſies diffuſe their poiſonous Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples with Impunity; Reproaches and Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies, ſhameful to utter, and horrible to hear, are freely vented againſt the Prieſthood, againſt things Sacred, and the moſt Holy Name of GOD himſelf. The
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:0653500404:138"/>
Authority of a Convocation had formerly given a proper and preſent Antidote againſt theſe Plagues. All good Men implore this Aſſiſtance; without this they think we muſt utterly deſpair of preſerving and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending Religion in theſe Nations.</p>
                  <p>Such was the State of Affairs, when this very Learned <hi>Perſon</hi> thought it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to place <hi>The Rights, Powers and Privileges of an Engliſh Convocation</hi>
                     <note n="†" place="bottom">The Title of Dr. Atterbury's Book in Anſwer to Dr. <hi>Wake</hi>'s <hi>State of the Church, and Clergy of</hi> England. <hi>fol.</hi> 1703.</note> in an open and true Light, and to ſtrengthen them with all the Force they could receive from Laws and Cuſtom. With this View he ſearches carefully into the Antient Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents of the Church, then covered with Duſt and obſcurity, rightly thinking that the Manner and Method of Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Rules and Laws of holding <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations,</hi> was not to be drawn from the modern Diſcourſes of Men, nor from the Memory of us, or our Fathers; but from the Commentaries of the Antients, the Edicts of Kings, and the Regiſters of Popes. For this purpoſe he got into his Poſſeſſion, with great Labour and Coſt, many looſe and ſcatter'd Manuſcripts, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt obliterated by Time, which he care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:0653500404:139"/>
read again and again. By the Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of theſe he firſt ventured to tread a Way involved with Darkneſs, covered with Thorns, and perplexed with Intrica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, without any Guide to conduct him, without any Footſteps of former Travellers to direct him. But he, relying on the Strength and Powers of his Genius, and inflamed with the Zeal for the Diſcovery of Truth, unwound all theſe Mazes, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever difficult and perplexed; Things in themſelves obſcure he brighten'd, the doubtful reduced to Certainty, and poliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the unornamental. He by drawing away the Veil exhibited to publick View and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration the antient Face of the <hi>Church.</hi> In his Writings we with Joy behold her very Picture drawn in proper Colours, and exactly agreeable to the true Features and Lineaments of the Original; and how will that Joy and Veneration be increaſed, when we ſhall view the Matron herſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us, reviv'd as it were from the Dead, breathing, ſpeaking! Much ſhould I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure one endeared to me by the ſtricteſt Rules of Friendſhip, much eſteemed from frequent Trials of his Integrity, if I did not believe his frequent and ſolemn Aſſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, that he did not engage in this Great Work out of any Deſire of Innovations, any private Reſentments, or meaner Views
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:0653500404:140"/>
of Intereſt, but merely for the Good and Advantage of the <hi>Church.</hi> Neither ſhould I act the human, faithful or juſt Part, did I not endeavour to fix in the Minds of others that Character and Opinion of Him, which is intirely rooted in my own; and which I did not raſhly take up from ſlight Conjectures, but from an intimare Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance and long Experience. This Recommendation would be too invidious, and more uneaſy to Him than any one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, ſhould I ſay that he never err'd, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was miſtaken in ſo long a Work, never let ſome Words in the Heat of his Pen paſs from him, which he would not will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly have recalled upon cooler Reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions. Should I ſay that he has not often nor groſly err'd, nor willingly drawn others into Miſtakes; ſhould I poſitively aſſert that there are many Things in theſe Writings that merit the higheſt Praiſe, few that want any Allowances of Excuſe, none but what Men of Humanity might eaſily pardon; I ſhould in that utter my own Opinion, and, if I am not deceived by too great a Fondneſs of Friendſhip, the Opinion of all impartial Judges too. Be there then room left for Pardon, for Praiſe, for Gratitude. If ſome ſharp, warm or free Expreſſions have eſcaped him, a Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of any Humanity will not attribute
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:0653500404:141"/>
them to Envy, Reſentment, or Arrogance, but to a Temper of itſelf too warm, or perhaps to Paſſion eaſily pardonable in a Soldier who contended for all that is dear to Us, in a Son endeavouring to reſcue his Mother from Injury and Violence. But if there is an Overballance of Beauties in his Writings, if he has treated of things in themſelves difficult, uſeful, pleaſing; if he has confirmed them by the ſtrongeſt Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, if he has imprinted them in the Minds of the Readers by a Purity and Perſpicuity of Stile, it is fit that he receive the Applauſe due to Learning from Men of Letters, from the Eloquent the Honour due to Eloquence. If he has bravely aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Privileges and Liberties of CONVO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CATIONS at the Hazard of his own Fortune, if he has preferr'd the publick Advantage to his private Intereſt, let the CLERGY make ſome Returns at leaſt, to the Aſſertor of <hi>The Rights of the Clergy.</hi> May this Man of equal Penetration and Diligence in the Management of Buſineſs, receive this moſt proper Reward of his Services, the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of acting in a larger Sphere, where he may exert all his Powers of Arts and Genius, in contriving, promoting, and confirming <hi>the Peace of the Church.</hi>

                  <p>WITH what Applauſe has he often Preached before the People, the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates,

the Clergy, the Senate, and the Court! How often has the late Queen MARY (now gathered to the Saints above) been charmed with his Eloquence!

The antient Philoſophy has had more allowed, than it could reſonably pretend to. How often has SHELDON's Theatre rung with Encomia on the <hi>Stagyrite,</hi> Who, greater than his own <hi>Alexander,</hi> has long, un-oppoſed, triumphed in our School-Desks, and had the whole World for his Pupils. At length aroſe CARTESIUS, a happier Geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, who has bravely aſſerted the Truth againſt the united Force of all Oppoſers, and has brought on the Stage a new Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of Philoſophizing. But ſhall we ſtig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matize with the Name of Novelty that Philoſophy, which, tho' but lately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived, is more antient than the <hi>Peripate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic,</hi> and as Old as the Matter from whence it is derived. A great Man indeed He was, and the only one we envy FRANCE. He ſolved the Difficulties of the Univerſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt as well as if he had been its Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect. He deſtroyed thoſe Orbs of Glaſs, which the Whims of Antiquity had fixed above, brought to light that Troop of Forms till then unknown, and has almoſt extinguiſhed the Element of Fire; nay, he with ſo much Clearneſs traced out the whole Maſs of Matter, as to leave no Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult Quality untouched. This Philoſopher ſcorned to be any longer bounded within the Streights and Chryſtalline Walls of an <hi>Ariſtotelic</hi> World; No, his Delight is to
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:0653500404:151"/>
ſearch the Regions above, to diſcover new Suns, and new Worlds, which lay hid amongſt the Stars; his Satisfaction is to view that large Kingdom of Air amidſt the unfixed Stars, and Lands that paſs the Milky-Way, and more accurately meaſure this vaſt Machine, a Machine fit for Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind to philoſophize on, and worthy of the Deity, who firſt framed it.</p>
                  <p>Here we have not only New Heavens opened to us, but we look down on our Earth; this Philoſophy affords us ſeveral Kinds of Animals, where, by the Help of the Microſcope, our Eyes are ſo far aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted, that we may diſcern the Produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the ſmalleſt Creatures, while we conſider with a curious Eye the animat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Particles of Matter, and behold with Aſtoniſhment the reptile Mountains of living Atoms. Thus are our Eyes become more penetrating by modern Helps; and even that Work, which Nature boaſts for her Maſter-Piece, is rendered more correct and finiſhed. We no longer pay a blind Veneration to that barbarous <hi>Peripatetic</hi> Jingle, thoſe obſcure Scholaſtic Terms of Art, once held as Oracles, but conſult the Dictates of our own Senſes, and by late invented Engines force Nature herſelf to diſcover plainly her moſt valued Secrets, her moſt hidden Receſſes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="145" facs="tcp:0653500404:152"/>
By the Help of Inſtruments like theſe, that Air, which a bountiful Nature has in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged us, we, as often as we pleaſe, by the Force of Art, abridge other Animals of, and keep them in our Pneumatick Pumps, from its common Benefit: What a Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure is it to ſee the fruitleſs Heavings of the Lights, to exhauſt their Lives, and by a moſt artful Sort of Theft rob them of their Breath? From this nothing is ſafe, nothing ſo long lived, which gradually does not languiſh, and fall dead without a Wound. A divine Piece of Art this, and worthy its Author,<note n="*" place="bottom">The Honourable <hi>Robert Boyle</hi> 
                        <abbr>Eſq</abbr>
                     </note> who in the Conduct of his Life, and the Force of his Arguments, has ſo nobly honoured our Nation, and the new Philoſophy, one who for this Reaſon too deſerves never to want the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of his own Air, or that he, who has ſo often deprived other Animals of their Life, ſhould ever breathe out his own.</p>
                  <p>On no ſuch Grounds as theſe has ARIS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TOTLE built his Philoſophy, who from his own Brain furniſhed out all his Rules of Arts and Sciences, and left nothing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touched on, nothing unregarded but <hi>Truth.</hi> If therefore he precipitated himſelf into the River <hi>Euripus,</hi> becauſe he could not underſtand its Ebb and Flow, by the ſame
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:0653500404:153"/>
Logick he might at his firſt Entrance on Philoſophy have deſtroyed himſelf, and we may fairly doubt, in which of the Elements he ought to have periſhed.</p>
                  <p>After ARISTOTLE's Fate amidſt the Waves of <hi>Euripus,</hi> a new Race of <hi>Peripateticks</hi> ſtarted up, even worſe than their Founder, who handed their Philoſophy to After-Ages in ſo thick an Obſcurity, that it has preſerved it from the Satire and Ridicule of all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, as underſtood by very few.

For it were great Pity to increaſe our Pain, which Abſence alone does ſufficiently, and more than I could ever have thought; bringing to my Mind a Point of Aſtronomy, which is, That the farther the <hi>Moors</hi> are from us, the farther too is the Sun, and yet his Heat is the more ſcorching; ſo it is with our Love, we are at a Diſtance from one another, and yet it keeps its Fervency, at leaſt on my Side.

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0653500404:177"/>
being perſuaded in my own Mind, that I have never committed any Offence againſt you; and it ſeems a very ſmall Return for the great Love I bear to you, to be kept at a Diſtance from the Perſon and Preſence of the Woman in the World that I value the moſt; and if you love me with as much Affection as I hope you do, I am ſure the Diſtance of our Two Perſons would be a little uneaſy to you. Tho' this does not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long ſo much to the Miſtreſs as the Servant. Conſider well, my Miſtreſs, how greatly your Abſence grieves me; I hope it is not your Will that it ſhould be ſo; but if I heard for certain, that you your ſelf deſired it, I could do no other than complain of my ill Fortune, and by Degrees abate my great Folly: And ſo for want of Time, I make an End of my rude Letter, deſiring you to give Credit to this Bearer in all he will tell you from me.

                  <p>THERE came to me in the Night the moſt afflicting News poſſible. For I have reaſon to grieve upon three Accounts. <hi>Firſt,</hi> Becauſe I heard of the Sickneſs of my Miſtreſs, whom I eſteem more than all the World, whoſe Health I deſire as much as my own, and the Half of whoſe Sickneſs I would willingly bear to have her cured.

I pray God he would deliver me from ſo troubleſome a Tormentor. <hi>The Third Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is,</hi> becauſe the Phyſician, in whom I truſt moſt, is abſent at preſent, when he could do me the greateſt Pleaſure. For I ſhould hope by him, and his Means, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain one of my principal Joys in this World, that is my Miſtreſs cured; however, in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault of him, I ſend you the ſecond, and the only one left, praying God that he may ſoon make you well, and then I ſhall love him more than ever. I beſeech you to be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by his Advice, with relation to your Illneſs; by your doing which, I hope ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſee you again, which will be to me a greater Cordial than all the precious Stones in the World.

In the which I muſt require you in the mean Time to accept my Good-Will in the Stead of the Power, the which muſt proceed partly from you, as our Lord knoweth; to whom I beſeech to ſend you long Life, with continuance in Honour.

                  <p>YOUR Grace's Diſpleaſure, and my Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment, are Things ſo ſtrange unto me, as what to Write, or to what to Excuſe, I am altogether ignorant. Whereas you ſend unto me (willing me to confeſs a Truth, and ſo obtain your Favour) by ſuch an one whom you know to be mine antient profeſſed Enemy; I no ſooner received this Meſſage by him, than I rightly conceived your Meaning; and if, as you ſay, confeſſing a Truth indeed may procure my Safety, I ſhall with all Willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Duty perform your Command.</p>
                  <p>But let not your Grace ever imagine that your poor Wife will ever be brought to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge a Fault, where not ſo much as a Thought thereof preceded. And to ſpeak a Truth, never Prince had Wife more Loyal in all Duty, and in all true Affection, than you have ever found in <hi>Anne Boleyn,</hi> with which Name and Place I could willingly have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0653500404:197"/>
my ſelf, if God, and your Grace's Pleaſure had been ſo pleaſed. Neither did I at any Time ſo far forget my ſelf in my Exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or received Queenſhip, but that I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways looked for ſuch an Alteration as now I find; for the Ground of my Preferment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on no ſurer Foundation than you Grace's Fancy, the leaſt Alteration, I knew, was fit and ſufficient to draw that Fancy to ſome other Subject. You have choſen me, from a low Eſtate, to be your Queen and Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, far beyond my Deſert or Deſire. If then you found me worthy of ſuch Honour, Good your Grace let not any light Fancy, or bad Councel of mine Enemies, withdraw your Princely Favour from me; neither let that Stain, that unworthy Stain of a Diſloyal Heart towards your good Grace, ever caſt ſo ſoul a Blot on your moſt Dutiful Wife, and the Infant Princeſs your Daughter: Try me good King, but let me have a Lawful Trial, and let not my ſworn Enemies ſit as my Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſers and Judges; yea, let me receive an open Trial, for my Truth ſhall fear no open Shame; then ſhall you ſee, either mine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency cleared, your Suſpicion and Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſatisfied, the Ignominy and Slander of the World ſtopped, or my Guilt openly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared. So that whatſoever God or You may determine of me, your Grace may be freed from an open Cenſure; and mine Offences being ſo lawfully proved, your Grace is at
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0653500404:198"/>
liberty, both before God and Man, not only to execute worthy Puniſhment on me as an unlawful Wife, but to follow your Affection already ſettled on that Party, for whoſe Sake I am now as I am, whoſe Name I could ſome good While ſince have pointed unto: Your Grace being not ignorant of my Suſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion therein.</p>
                  <p>But if you have already determined of me, and that not only my Death, but an infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Slander muſt bring you the enjoying of your deſired Happineſs; then I deſire of God, that he will pardon your great Sin therein, and likewiſe mine Enemies, the Inſtruments thereof; and that he will not call you to a ſtrict Account for your unprincely and cruel Uſage of me, at his General Judgment-Seat, where both You and Myſelf muſt ſhortly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, and in whoſe Judgment, I doubt not, (whatſoever the World may think of me) mine Innocence ſhall be openly known, and ſufficiently cleared.</p>
                  <p>My laſt and only Requeſt ſhall be, That my ſelf may only bear the Burthen of your Grace's Diſpleaſure, and that it may not touch the innocent Souls of thoſe poor Gentlemen, who (as I underſtand) are likewiſe in ſtrait Impriſonment for my Sake. If ever I have found Favour in your Sight; if ever the Name of <hi>Anne Boleyn</hi> hath been pleaſing in your Ears, then let me obtain this Requeſt: and I will ſo leave to trouble your Grace

               <p>The Time of her <hi>Diſmiſſion</hi> was in <hi>May,</hi> 1528.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>Firſt</hi> LETTER, the <hi>King</hi> makes Excuſes for the Neceſſity of their being aſunder. And in the <hi>Second</hi> complains of her Unwillingneſs to return to Court.

In the <hi>Heat</hi> of his <hi>Royal Gratitude,</hi> he pays a Viſit to his <hi>Miſtreſs,</hi> and They, jointly, wrote a Letter to Cardinal <hi>Wolſey,</hi> wherein the <hi>King</hi> greatly admires, at his not hearing of <hi>Campegio</hi>'s Arrival. He did not ſtay long with her after this; for when
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0653500404:201"/>
ſhe had received <hi>Wolſey</hi>'s Anſwer, <hi>She</hi> wrote the Cardinal a <hi>Second</hi> Letter, without any mention of the <hi>King,</hi> expreſſing her <hi>own</hi> Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience to hear of the Legate's comming; of which his <hi>Majeſty</hi> ſent her the News ſoon after. But to return to the <hi>Fourth</hi> LETTER, which muſt, in all Probability, have been written in <hi>August;</hi> it is the moſt important in all the Collection; for, it fixeth the exact Time of the Riſe of his <hi>Majeſty's</hi> Affection to this <hi>Lady.</hi> He pathetically complaineth therein, that, <hi>He had been above a whole Year ſtruck with the Dart of Love, and was not yet ſure, whether He ſhould fail, or find a Place in her Heart and Affection.</hi> He farther addeth, that, <hi>long before</hi> She <hi>ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected</hi> it, <hi>from his</hi> firſt <hi>ſeeing Her, he felt a Paſſion for</hi> Her.</p>
               <p>It cannot be doubted by any, who read theſe <hi>Letters,</hi> that King HENRY's Affection to <hi>Anne Boleyn,</hi> was altogether upon ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Terms. There appears not the leaſt Pretenſion to the <hi>Last-Favour,</hi> nor Aim to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it, till the <hi>Holy Legate</hi> and <hi>Mother Church,</hi> had paved the Way to Conſumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, (and then, <hi>He! Monſieur</hi> Pope! <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendez vous bien.</hi>)</p>
               <p>The <hi>Last</hi> of theſe <hi>Letters,</hi> mentions the <hi>Legate's</hi> Illneſs, as a Reaſon why he had not performed the Duties of his Function; which makes it apparent that this <hi>Royal Love Correſpondence</hi> ended in <hi>May,</hi> 1529,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0653500404:202"/>
when the Proceſs began, making up juſt one Year.</p>

               <p>BEING poſſeſſed of the following excellent POEMS, All that I have to add, is only a Word or two concerning their <hi>Author.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon Reading them over at St. <hi>James</hi>'s <hi>Coffee-Houſe,</hi> they were attributed by the General Voice, to be the Productions of a <hi>Lady of Quality.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When I produced them at <hi>Button</hi>'s, the <hi>Poetical Jury</hi> there, brought in a different Verdict; and the <hi>Foreman</hi> ſtrenuouſly inſiſted upon it, that Mr. <hi>Gay</hi> was the <hi>Man,</hi> and declared, that in Comparing the TOILETTE with that Gentleman's PASTORALS, he found the <hi>Stile,</hi> and <hi>Turn of Thought,</hi> to be evidently the ſame<note n="*" place="bottom">This is confirmed by Mr. GAY's inſerting this Piece in his Works, 1730.</note>, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed him, and his Brethren, in the Sentence they had pronounced.</p>
               <p>Not content with theſe Two Deciſions, I was reſolved to call in an Umpire; and accordingly choſe a Gentleman of diſtinguiſhed Merit, who lives not far from <hi>Chelſea.</hi>

                     <p>THE Public will, doubtleſs, ſays he, be deſirous to know by what Accident theſe <hi>Letters</hi> fell into my Hands, and what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced me to publiſh them.

                     <p>It was by a very extraordinary Accident, no leſs than that of a Shipwreck, that theſe Letters fell into my Hands.

                     <p>This Inſcription excited my Curioſity; and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining the Trunk, in which I, at firſt, only ſaw ſome old Cloaths, I diſcovered a Bundle of Papers, which put a Stop to my Enquiry for the preſent; I found them to be Letters, but the Hand they were written in was almoſt illegible, from whence I concluded, they had been wrote in a great Hurry. I made a Shift to read them, tho' not without a great deal of Pains, and was ſenſibly moved with the Author's Misfortunes. I was before partly acquainted with what he writes of the <hi>MUSCOVITE Government,</hi> their <hi>Power, Finances,</hi> and <hi>Miniſtry:</hi> But I was an entire Stranger to all the reſt, and not a little ſurprized
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0653500404:225"/>
to find, that the Pains <hi>PETER</hi> I. had taken to civilize this Nation, were hitherto fruitleſs.</p>
                     <p>It is aſtoniſhing, that notwithſtanding all which has been done, for above a Century, to bring theſe People off from their native Barbarity, they, to this Day, retain the ſame Savage Cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms and Manners as will appear from theſe Letters.</p>
                     <p>What Idea then muſt we not form of the <hi>Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners,</hi> who are at the Head of the Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, in that Country, and who, in the moſt flagrant Manner, abuſed the Confidence repoſed in them, by the beſt of PRINCESSES? Muſt they, of Neceſſity, as ſoon as they ſet Foot in the <hi>Ruſſian</hi> Dominions, become very <hi>Muſcovites?</hi> I was not entirely ignorant before, of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of theſe Miniſters: But I could never have believed them capable of carrying Matters this Length. I am aſſured from very good Hands, that their whole Aim was to fill their own Cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, that they might be able to ſcreen themſelves againſt every ſuture Event; and they are proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſo far right: For without any great Skill in Aſtrology, I would venture to preſage, what will be their Fate, whenever the Empreſs, who is now their Support, comes to die. In the mean Time, let them think their Meaſures ever ſo ſecure, I very much queſtion, whether they will eſcape the Storm they are threatned with, if every the Illuſtrious PRINCESS, who has an inconteſtable Right to that Crown, acceed to the Throne.</p>
                     <p>The Manner in which ſhe is treated by theſe Miniſters, cries aloud for Vengeance: For, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of reſpecting her, as the preſumptive Heir
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:0653500404:226"/>
of a vaſt Empire: They do not ſo much as allow her where withal to ſupport her Dignity, and to maintain her antient Domeſticks, who chuſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to linger on in Miſery, than to quit her Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. They have even the Cruelty to keep her in a Sort of Bondage, which deters every one from making their Court to her, and is the Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of her being abandoned by the whole World. This is no Secret to thoſe who travel into that Country, and when they return, they ſpeak of it with the utmoſt Indignation: But, at the ſame Time, they are too well acquainted with the excellent Qualities and Clemency of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Empreſs, to lay any Part of the Blame on her.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Foreign Miniſtry</hi> are the Authors of all this Evil; and as they are not inſenſible how ill they have deſerved, there is Reaſon to believe they will employ all their Skill to keep the next Heir from the Throne. However, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their utmoſt Efforts, I very much doubt of their Succeſs. They are, indeed, at preſent, abſolute Maſters, and diſpoſe of every Thing at their own Will: But they may probably be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted of this Authority, which they now abuſe with Impunity, whenever a Matter of that Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, in which all the Powers of <hi>Europe</hi> ought to concern themſelves, is brought upon the Carpet.</p>
                     <p>The very ſame Reaſons which neceſſarily prompt this <hi>Foreign Miniſtry</hi> to aim at the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion</hi> of the PRINCESS, will of courſe engage the Native <hi>Muſcovites</hi> to give her their <hi>Suffrages:</hi> And if the <hi>latter</hi> gain their Point, I do not doubt but the <hi>former</hi> will meet the Fate they
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0653500404:227"/>
have deſerved. By this Means the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> may ſhake off the heavy Yoke which they now bear, and I dare anſwer for them, they will not let ſo favourable an Opportunity eſcape. In this Caſe, theſe <hi>Foreign Gentlemen</hi> will find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in great Danger: I adviſe them to be early upon their Guard, and I hope they will make a right Uſe of the charitable Advice I give them. I likewiſe hope they will not take it amiſs, that I print theſe Letters, nor will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of my Conduct, with Regard to them. They will, I flatter myſelf, thank me, for the Regard I have ſhewn for them, in following my Author, who is ſo candid to conceal the Names of all his moſt inveterate Enemies, and only to mention thoſe of the Perſons to whom he was obliged.</p>
                     <p>As I am perfectly acquainted with all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues of the <hi>Muſcovite</hi> Miniſtry, it would be no difficult Thing for me to give an exact De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of thoſe who are at the Head of the Affairs of that Kingdom: But, as well out of Prudence, as Caution, I ſhall be contented with what I have already ſaid.</p>
                     <p>As for the <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> I ſhall not need to make any Excuſe on their Account: They are not a People to take Pet at ſo ſmall a Matter, and they will themſelves find, that what is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced, with Reſpect to them, is nothing in Compariſon, of what might be ſaid againſt them.</p>
                     <p>After having ſatisfied my Curioſity with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to theſe Letters, I, with Eagerneſs, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to the <hi>Trunk</hi> which contained them, to
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:0653500404:228"/>
examine more narrowly what was yet behind. I there ſaw the famous <hi>Night-Gown,</hi> which the Author wore, to be taken Notice of by the Empreſs and her whole Court, when they paſſed under the Window of his Priſon. There were yet the ſame Sheep's-skin-Pelt, and the ſame Cap, which were of ſo much Service to him, in his Journey from <hi>Caſan</hi> to <hi>Petersburg.</hi> The <hi>Trunk</hi> was filled with tattered Cloaths, a few Shirts, and other Neceſſaries. Beſides theſe, I opened a <hi>Hamper,</hi> in which were ſome Bottles, Earthen Plates, and Wooden Forks. I, likewiſe, found an Iron Fork, much larger than the others, which probably the ſame our Author mentions in ſeveral Parts of his Letters, and which he imagined, he might have made an advantageous Uſe of, as a Weapon, in Caſe of Need. There was even the very Axe, by the Help of which he ſo dextrouſly opened his <hi>Trunk.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>At Length, I was agreeably ſurprized with a Roll of Paper, which I, at firſt Sight, took for a Manuſcript: But after having unfolded it, with a great deal of Impatience, hoping to find ſome important Secret incloſed; I was amazed to ſee only a few blank Leaves, on which ſome few Characters were perceivable. I ſoon apprehended theſe to be the Papers he mentions to have writ upon with his Silver Pencil, without Ink, and which after the Misfortune he met with, of fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into a Pit, in <hi>Courland,</hi> were become ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible.</p>
                     <p>After having carefully examined, whatever was in the <hi>Trunk,</hi> I acquainted ſeveral Friends with my Reſolution of publiſhing theſe Letters: But I found their Opinions very various. I ſhall
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:0653500404:229"/>
therefore only mention ſome of the principal Reflections that were made on this Account.</p>
                     <p>One of the Events, which, among others, greatly ſurprized us, was that of the Attempt, which our Author endeavours to prove, was made to Poiſon him. We carefully examined his Allegations, and found them all well grounded. Let any Man judge with what Horror we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered ſo black, and ſo deteſtable an Action.</p>
                     <p>Having enquired into this important Point, the next Thing we fell upon was, his Attempt to diſcover the Original of the <hi>Muſcovites.</hi> As Novelty never fails of pleaſing, this Paſſage en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained us ſome Time, and every one was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to give his Opinion freely. At firſt, none would decide upon the Matter, for Fear of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deceived; ſome ſaid the Thought was inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious, but had no Foundation: Others looked upon it as a Thing demonſtrated beyond all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction.</p>
                     <p>While we were thus in Suſpence what to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine, one of the Company propoſed to look upon the Author's Opinion as a mere Conjecture. This every one approved of, and thereby an End was ſoon put to this Diſpute. This Perſon added, that if we would indulge him a Moment, he would ſet us right in ſeveral Circumſtances, which our Author had not mentioned, either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they had eſcaped his Memory; or, perhaps, becauſe he never had an Opportunity of being informed of them. The whole Company having expreſſed an eager Deſire of hearing what he had farther to propoſe, he related a Fact of which we were all ignorant, tho' the Truth of it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conteſtable,
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:0653500404:230"/>
                        <hi>viz.</hi> That the third Expedition of the <hi>Scythians</hi> into <hi>Aſia</hi> is fixed, by the moſt able Chronologiſts, to <hi>A.M.</hi> 3334, which is juſt 676 Years before the <hi>Chriſtian-Aera:</hi> This being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, our Author might with Reaſon ſay, that the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> would be in the wrong, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of the Original he aſcribes to them; for if it be not one of the moſt illuſtrious, it is, at leaſt, one of the moſt antient. He acquainted us farther, that the City, which he calls the <hi>City of Slaves,</hi> is now known by the Name of <hi>Clopi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorod,</hi> and is ſituated in the very Country, thro' which theſe wretched People made their Retreat. Theſe Illuſtrations, put us to reflect upon the Fact in Queſtion, not only as probable, but as an evident Truth.</p>
                     <p>While we proceeded in the Peruſal of theſe <hi>Letters,</hi> every one gave their Opinions, and ſome made very judicious and curious Reflections. But the reading of the <hi>laſt</hi> Letter, made us almoſt forget all that had been ſaid on the foregoing. The ſingle Circumſtance of the <hi>Paſs</hi> given to our Author, fixed the Attention of the whole Company. This Procedure of the <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> by which they expoſed him to be looked upon as the moſt baſe and vileſt of Men, excited a general Indignation in us. Every one exclai med againſt this Piece of flagrant Injuſtice, and the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> were treated as they deſerved. Who could blame us? Can they ſay any Thing in Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of themſelves, for ſullying the Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a <hi>Man of Honour,</hi> without any Cauſe, and brand him with the Character of a Spy, in a ſtrange Country? Was it not enough, that they had detained him ſo long in a grievous Captivity, wherein they had ſubjected him to a thouſand
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:0653500404:231"/>
Evils? A Man of Worth would much rather chuſe to dye, than to ſuffer ſuch a Blemiſh on his Reputation.</p>
                     <p>Juſt as we were going to part, a Gentleman asked, if there was not any one amongſt us, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinable to take a Voyage to <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> in Hopes of making his Fortune? This Propoſal ſurprized us all, ſo much, that we could not but turn it into Ridicule; and ſoon replied in the Negative, alledging, that we ſhould expect the ſame Fate which our Author had undergone. This, ſays he, is the very Anſwer I expected: For theſe <hi>Letters</hi> I muſt own are a ſufficient Warning to all Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, <hi>Felix quem faciunt,</hi> &amp;c. how they truſt to <hi>Muſcovite</hi> Integrity. For which Reaſon the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing of theſe will be a Public Benefit. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, that in Regard to the favourable Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they had formed of theſe Letters, I ſhould not heſitate, but would forthwith print them; but begged Leave to make one Obſervation which eſcaped their Notice, <hi>viz.</hi> That the <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covites</hi> themſelves, and even their <hi>Foreign Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry,</hi> under whoſe Rule they are, ſo far from having Reaſon to complain of the Publication of theſe <hi>Letters,</hi> might be greatly benefitted by them, and could not but be thankful to us for it. For, we all know, that, the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> bear a mortal Hatred to the <hi>Foreigners,</hi> who are at the Head of their Affairs, and wiſh nothing more, than to be rid of them. On the other Hand, it is no leſs certain, that the <hi>Foreigners,</hi> who find they have Power enough to ſupport their Cabal, uſe all the Skill they are Maſters of, to keep other <hi>Foreigners</hi> from getting a Footing in that Court. It is therefore, doing conſiderable Service to Both, to publiſh theſe <hi>Letters:</hi> Since
<pb n="xi" facs="tcp:0653500404:232"/>
it is not to be imagined, that thoſe who read them, will ever think of ſeeking an Employ in <hi>Muſcovy?</hi> By this Means, the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> will have no Reaſon to complain of Interlopers, and the <hi>Foreigners,</hi> who are now employed, need not be apprehenſive of loſing their Places, or being emulated by Rivals.</p>
                     <p>This Obſervation was approved by all who were preſent; but then another Difficulty was, at the ſame Time, ſtarted. It was objected, that theſe <hi>Letters,</hi> being written by an <hi>Italian,</hi> who, perhaps, had never any Thoughts of their being publiſhed, it would be abſolutely neceſſary to reviſe them, and to correct the Stile. To which it was judiciouſly anſwered, That a Work like this, which was written with no other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, but that of obliging a Friend, ought to be given to the Publick, without any Alteration; and it is hoped their intrinſick Worth will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that they ſhould be tranſlated into all the <hi>European</hi> Languages, and may return to <hi>Muſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy</hi> and prove a <hi>Speculum</hi> to thoſe of <hi>other</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions now reſident there. I do not in the leaſt doubt but the <hi>Italians</hi> in particular, would, in Vindication of their Countryman, be the firſt to put their Hands to the Plough, and other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, doubtleſs, will ſoon follow their Example. The <hi>Germans</hi> are principally concerned in this Matter, becauſe a great Number of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen go daily into <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> to <hi>ſeek their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.</hi> The Example of ſome <hi>falſe Brethren</hi> ought not to hinder them from concurring in a Matter from whence ſo much Good may reſult: But if I ſhould even be deceived in my Hopes, I will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver forſake ſo juſt a Cauſe during Life; but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely maintain it.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>OUR generous Behaviour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Me may hereafter ſerve as an Example to all who make Profeſſion of Friendſhip. You had all the Reaſon in the World to believe me loſt to you, and for ever; and yet this did not hinder you from doing for me, whatever could be done by thoſe who are in a Condition to give daily Proofs of their Affection one to the other. This may be ſtiled Friendſhip even to the Dead: Among the Number of whom you could not but account me, ſince you had no News from me, and nothing but Death could be ſuppoſed to prevent my Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. I am more than convinced of all the Effects you ſay my firſt Letter had upon you, and you will be as fully perſuaded of thoſe, which yours could produce in me. We know each other too well to need any farther Explication on this Head.</p>
               <p>You ſay, you cannot forbear looking upon me, as a Perſon riſen from the Dead; and you are ſo
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0653500404:235"/>
far right: I am not dead, indeed, becauſe <hi>Mors miſeros fugit;</hi> but I may, nevertheleſs, be eſteemed a Ghoſt, ſince I am actually returned from another World, where I have made no ſhort Abode. I learn every Day ſomething new and ſurprizing, and that almoſt with the ſame Pleaſure a deaf Man would, who ſhould at once recover the Organs of Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The earneſt Deſire you expreſs, of having a circumſtantial Account of my Adventures, looks as if you expected ſomething extraordinary and wonderful, and therein, you are not miſtaken. Had the ſame Things happened to another, I my ſelf ſhould have been backward in believing them: <hi>Triſte petit munus:</hi> But ſhould I refuſe to ſatisfy your Curioſity, it would be the firſt Time you ever aſked me any thing in vain. I ſhall not, therefore, heſitate a Moment, and the leſs, as a renewed Friendſhip requires more Aſſiduity than that which has never been broken. Ours may well be ſaid to be renewed, ſince it is come back from the other World. What terrifies me is, that Accuracy of Relation which you require of me. For I am ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous enough with you, to endeavour ſtrictly to obey you. Had it not been for an unhappy Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wreck, which I ſuffered, at a Time when I might have thought my ſelf leaſt liable to a Misfortune of that Nature, I ſhould, perhaps, have been able to fulfil your Deſires. Some Memoirs which I had written in a very peculiar Manner, would have been of great Service to my Hiſtory: But they are not at all legible. I have, indeed, preſerved a ſhort Journal, which now muſt ſupply every Thing. Had any one but you made this Requeſt, I ſhould have found more than one reaſonable Excuſe for a Denial. It is not a bare Relation of my Fate will content you; I muſt give you the Hiſtory of a whole Nation, its Manners and Government, and deſcribe it to you, in ſuch a Light as I found it,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0653500404:236"/>
and not ſuch as, perhaps, you, and many others have believed it to be. It is true, ſince the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of this Century, we have had a more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive Knowledge of this Nation, than formerly; and the great Reform which has been attempted in it, has furniſhed ample Occaſion for Diſcourſe. You will ſee how far it has ſucceeded, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Pains which have been taken, and the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents of Blood which have been ſhed, have anſwered Expectation? It is generally ſaid, we muſt travel to know the Manners of People: But, to my Coſt, I have found, that it is requiſite to know them, before we leave our own Home. You will be the more convinced of this Truth, the farther you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in the Hiſtory of my Adventures.</p>
               <p>In my former Letter, I advis'd you, that after the Misfortune which obliged me to leave a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, I ſhall regret to the laſt Period of my Life, tranſported by a juſt Deſpair, I had no other Thoughts but of retiring to ſome Place, where I might be entirely unknown; but my evil Deſtiny continued to purſue me, and directed my Choice to the only Part of the World, where ſhe could exerciſe her moſt cruel Tyranny upon me: For I am perſuaded, there is no other Country, in which I could have been expoſed to the like Events. I ſhall leave you to judge of theſe Matters; be prepared only to give Attention to what I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to relate. You will find ſome Things to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſe and divert you, and others which will juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly raiſe your Indignation, and compel you to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that it is with Truth, I ſay, I am returned from another World.</p>
               <p>Being arrived at <hi>Dantzick,</hi> where I made ſome Stay, I reſolved to conceal my ſelf from the whole World, under the Character of an <hi>Italian</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, with the Name of <hi>Roccaforte.</hi> My Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation probably ſuggeſted this Name to my Mind,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0653500404:237"/>
to encourage me to undergo all my Misfortunes with Conſtancy. In the mean Time, uneaſy, and tired as I was, with a painful Journey by Land, I was for trying if I could leave ſome Share of my Sorrows there, and embarked, in the Beginning of <hi>May,</hi> 1733. on Board a ſmall Veſſel, bound for St. <hi>Peterſburg,</hi> whither my Inclinations led me.</p>
               <p>We departed from the Harbour the next Day, with a tolerable good Wind; but the Day follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, about the ſame Hour, were again in the ſame Place, having been obliged to return faſter than we ſet out. We hoiſted Sail, a ſecond Time: But the Inconſtancy of the Weather, and the Violence of the Winds, drove us, for the ſpace of a Fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, ſometimes on the Coaſts of <hi>Pomerania,</hi> ſometimes on thoſe of <hi>Denmark;</hi> now on the <hi>Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh</hi> Coaſts, and then on the <hi>Livonian;</hi> where a Sight of the Iſland of <hi>Dagho</hi> had like to have coſt us dear, by the Unſkilfulneſs of our Pilot. A Want of Proviſions began to augment our Fears, the Voyage from <hi>Dantzick</hi> to <hi>Peterſburg</hi> being gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally eight or ten Days, whereas we had been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready fifteen, at Sea. We were often in Sight of the Iſland of <hi>Gothland;</hi> but with ſuch ſtormy Weather, as obliged us to keep the Sea. At Length, we happily gained the Eaſtern Coaſt of that Iſland, where, among a Number of Rocks, we found a proper Anchorage. It was with great Pleaſure I went on Shoar, where the firſt thing I obſerved was, by certain Marks, that the Sea was retired from that Place: The next Day, I was fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of it, and ſaw that it had left a good half League of dry Land. We were ſo fortunate to find a Houſe, and whatever we wanted to re-vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual our Ship.</p>
               <p>During our Stay there, which was three or four Days, I diverted my ſelf with taking long Walks, and I found very pleaſant ones all along the Shoar,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0653500404:238"/>
with Situations very proper for the Abode of a Wretch like my ſelf. You will laugh at another Remark I made, in this Iſland; which is, that of one Species of Birds, common every where elſe, at leaſt in <hi>Europe,</hi> and that ſmall part of <hi>Aſia,</hi> I have travelled through, I mean <hi>Sparrows,</hi> not any are to be ſeen there. If you ask me the Reaſon of it, I ſhall ingenuouſly confeſs my Ignorance, ſince there are many other Kinds of Birds. I could gladly have ſtaid ſome Days longer, in this charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Solitude: But the Time for our Departure was come, and we were deſtined to be, another Fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, the Sport of the Winds, which, at length, drove us into the Port of <hi>Revel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe Accidents, which happened to me in my Voyage, were deſigned, by Fate, to give me a Foreſight of what I was to expect when arrived in Port: But I was not capable of Reflection; my Thoughts were bent on nothing but carrying my Deſpair and Sorrows to a Place, where they might not be ſeen or known by any one. After having furniſhed ourſelves with ſome Proviſions at <hi>Revel,</hi> we put to Sea again, and, not to tire your Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence any longer, after a moſt unfortunate Voyage of ſix Weeks, we arrived, the 20th of <hi>June,</hi> at <hi>Peterſburg.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>But before I ſuffer this Exclamation to carry me too far, I muſt ſolemnly proteſt, that being about to treat of the <hi>Muſcovite</hi> Nation, of which, <hi>Difficile eſt Satyram non ſcribere,</hi> I except the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt SOVERAIGN, who now rules it, for whom I have the moſt profound Veneration. I am ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with her extraordinary Qualities, and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially her Religion and Piety. I am not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, in what an excellent Manner ſhe diſpenſes her Juſtice and Clemency; but what is moſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0653500404:239"/>
is her extreme good Nature, a Quality rarely to be met with on the Throne; which, however, ſhe poſſeſſes in the higheſt Degree of Perfection, and extends to the utmoſt of her Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, tho' always far ſhort of her Inclination: So that, in many Caſes, we might juſtly make her ſpeak the Language of <hi>Iphigenia,</hi>
                  <q>
                     <l>Non ego crudelis, juvenes ignoſcite, dixit:</l>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>In ſhort, to ſay every Thing in a few Words; there is nothing wanting in her, that can be deſired; but, on the contrary, what ſhe might reaſonably ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, ſhe is far from poſſeſſing: Her Merits give her a Title to govern another Sort of People, who might be capable of knowing and perceiving the Happineſs they enjoy in her Perſon, and to have another Kind of Subjects about her, who might aſſiſt her in ſupporting the Burthen of ſo vaſt a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
               <p>As for the Illuſtrious <hi>Princeſs,</hi> the only Remains of the Family which now reigns; they only, who have not ſeen nor heard of her, can be at a Loſs to diſtinguiſh her from the reſt of the Nation. The Qualities of her Mind and Body are a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of whatever is excellent: And if I ſhould pretend to give you a Detail of what I have ſeen of one, and heard of the other, I ſhould not be ſo ſoon able to give you Satisfaction, with Regard to my ſelf. Let it then ſuffice, that ſhe poſſeſſes eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Quality, in ſuch a Perfection; <hi>Quâ faemina naſci nulla poteſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having rendered, <hi>Quae ſunt Caeſaris Caeſari,</hi> I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to my Voyage, which we purſued up the <hi>Nieva,</hi> till we came near a fine Bridge of Boats, that croſſes it. I would gladly have landed immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately; but the Officers, who were put on Board our Veſſel at <hi>Cronſtadt,</hi> would not ſuffer us to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0653500404:240"/>
the leaſt Thing from the Ship: I was, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, forced to ſtay on Board, and it was three Days before our Maſter could get his Clearances; which gave me not the beſt Idea of their Regulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with Regard to Trade. In this Interval, all I could do was to amuſe my ſelf with what came within my View. The firſt Thing which offered was the Bridge, which ſerves for a Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication of one Part of the Town with the other. It is little frequented, from whence I concluded the Place not populous, and I was not deceived. The Ships which are ranged on both Sides of the River, in a Symetrical Order, make a pretty agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able View, but the reſt is no way anſwerable to this Part of the Town, which may be called fine. Suffer me now to gueſs at your Deſires: I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded, that amidſt the Accuracy of the Relations you deſire from me, they do not extend to a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of Things; that would be an Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment too groſs for your refined Taſte; nor ſhall I want Matter, without that, to employ a good Part of your Time: For being to give you an Account of a Captivity, which laſted two whole Years, Circumſtances will offer, of ſufficient Importance to deſerve not to be treated in a <hi>Laconic</hi> Manner.</p>
               <p>The firſt Perſon I became acquainted with at <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terſburg</hi> was a Merchant whoſe Name is <hi>Mariotti,</hi> a very honeſt Man, and to whom I am highly oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. He aſſiſted me in every Thing within his Sphere, and I am perſuaded he would have done more had it been in his Power. I went to the <hi>Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic</hi> Church, and viſited the Fathers who officiated in it, whither a pretty many People reſorted. I there uſed my beſt Endeavours to get Information of ſuch Things as were moſt neceſſary, on my Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival in a Country where I propoſed to ſettle. I picked up my Intelligences, ſome here, ſome there, and neglected no Opportunity to be inſtructed.
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0653500404:241"/>
Thus, in a few Days, I eaſily perceived, this was no Country for my Purpoſe; but I was advanced too far to retreat. My Buſineſs was how to get into the Service; I adviſed with Mr. <hi>Mariotti</hi> about it: But he laid ſo many Difficulties before me, as threw me into an unuſual Diſorder.</p>
               <p>While my Thoughts where thus employed what Courſe to take, I accidentally ſaw a Perſon, who I believed might know me, and beſides met with a very ſingular Adventure, which obliged me to take other Meaſures. I formed the Reſolution of going to <hi>Perſia,</hi> where I knew the Prince of <hi>Heſſe-Hom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg</hi> commanded, and the Character I had heard of him gave me Room to hope, that if I made my ſelf known to him, he would not refuſe me the Honour of his Protection. I but juſt hint at theſe Matters now, becauſe you will find a particular Account of them, in a Petition I preſented to the <hi>Czarina</hi>'s Cabinet-Council. But I muſt acquaint you with the chief Motive that put me upon going to <hi>Perſia,</hi> which I could not inſert in that Piece, as you yourſelf will judge. Being continually in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitive after a Knowledge of Things, I likewiſe gathered all the News I could, not only what was publiſhed in the <hi>Gazettes,</hi> but what I could learn from the Perſons I converſed with. Among the latter was one who was perfectly acquainted with the Projects, Deſigns, and Preparations of the Court of <hi>Petersburg,</hi> and who knew the Strength, as well as the weak Side, of this Power, which now ſo much alarms <hi>Europe,</hi> tho' I ſee no Reaſon for it. By all I could learn, I was convinced, that the War in <hi>Poland</hi> was inevitable, and that if I engaged in the <hi>Ruſſian</hi> Service, I ſhould, perhaps, be obliged to draw my Sword againſt a Prince I reſpect, and againſt a Nation I ſhall love with my lateſt Breath, and to which I owe the little Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge I have in the Art of War. You know me
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0653500404:242"/>
ſo much a <hi>Frenchman</hi> at Heart, to be intirely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded, I ſhould rather quit the Profeſſion of a Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier for ever, than engage againſt the Intereſt of King <hi>Staniſlaus,</hi> and the Troops employed to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port his lawful Rights. The Declaration made by the <hi>French</hi> King, to all the Miniſters I had ſeen, left me no Room to doubt, but he would employ all his Force in ſo juſt a Cauſe, for which the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the <hi>French</hi> Name is ſo tenderly concerned. I leave you to judge, whether I could bear to be in the <hi>Muſcovite</hi> Army, in View of the Troops of <hi>France;</hi> I deteſt the very Thoughts of it. This was the true Motive which fixed my Reſolution of going to <hi>Perſia,</hi> and you are by this Time ſenſible I could not inſert it in the Petition mentioned above. As ſoon as my Deſign was formed, I ſpoke to my Friend <hi>Mariotti</hi> to look out for a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency of going thither; and in order to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide what was moſt neceſſary for my Journey, I ſold a good Part of my Equipage, to raiſe Money. My next Care was to get a Paſs, which is not to be obtained without Difficulty, and at a great Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, eſpecially if it be to go out of the <hi>Ruſſian</hi> Dominions: But as this was not my Caſe, I got off for four or five Rubles<note n="*" place="bottom">A <hi>Ruſſian</hi> Coin about the Value of a Crown.</note>: A ſhameful Practice, to oblige People to pay for a Paſs! What muſt a Perſon do who has but juſt enough to bear the Expences of his Journey? Why truly, he muſt remain there, and ſubmit to Slavery, as has been the Caſe of many. A Foreigner, who has lived ſome Time among them, finds it difficult to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his Diſmiſſion. They are no ſooner informed of his Intent, than they raiſe Suſpicions, and carry their Jealouſy and Diſtruſt to an Exceſs. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever has once got a Knowledge of their Affairs, muſt never hope to leave the Country. They imagine, they have Reaſon to apprehend ſuch a one would divulge their <hi>Arcana.</hi> What more ſenſible Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0653500404:243"/>
can there be of the Weakneſs of their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment?</p>
               <p>All I advance on this Head is but too well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounded, and I could give a Number of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances which would ſufficiently evince this Truth: But I ſhall confine myſelf to One, that of an <hi>Itali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> who calls himſelf <hi>Sava,</hi> and who has ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the Empreſs ſuch Services, as put it out of the Power of this Princeſs to acknowledge them. As his Caſe has been already made public, I ſhall not detain you with a long Account of it: And only add, that this Man, after having long ſerved the State, could not obtain Leave to paſs the Reſt of his Days with his Wife, at <hi>Venice.</hi> Does not this ſingle Inſtance of <hi>Muſcovite</hi> Politicks ſurprize you? For my Part, I think it the more ſhocking; as the Perſon I am ſpeaking of deſerves a better Fate. But to return to my own Concerns.</p>
               <p>Having procured a Paſs, I wanted nothing but a favourable Opportunity of departing, and ſoon after one offered, ſuch, I thought, as my Heart could wiſh. I embraced it with the greater Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, as I was convinced I ſhould, by this Means, purſue my Journey, with Safety and Delight. It was not eaſy to foreſee, that ſuch an Opportunity could ever be the Source of a grievous Captivity, and of all my Misfortunes. You, without doubt, know, that the Emperor PETER I. founded an Academy of Sciences, which is yet in being, but in ſo confuſed a State, that the principal Members of it have deſired their Diſmiſſion. Perhaps, likewiſe, you have heard of an Expedition to the North-Eaſtern Parts of <hi>Aſia,</hi> to a Country call'd <hi>Kamtſchatki,</hi> in which the <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covites</hi> have already ſettled ſome Colonies. This Undertaking furniſhed me with the Opportunity I am ſpeaking of. Three Profeſſors of the Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demy, one of Aſtrology, a ſecond of Hiſtory, and a third of Botany, were to be ſent to this Country,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0653500404:244"/>
and they, with ſeveral others, formed a ſort of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravan. Their Way lay through the Kingdom of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſan,</hi> which was likewiſe my Road to <hi>Perſia.</hi> As ſoon as I was informed, that theſe Gentlemen were preparing to depart, I did what I could to be one of the Company. I firſt enquired to whom I muſt make my Application, for this End, and was told to Monſ. <hi>de l'Iſle,</hi> Profeſſor of Aſtronomy, Brother of the late Monſ. <hi>de l'Iſle,</hi> the famous Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grapher to his moſt <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Majeſty. This Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man left <hi>France,</hi> and went to <hi>Petersburg,</hi> in the Time of <hi>Peter</hi> I. who had deſired him of the <hi>French</hi> King. As I ſhall have frequent Occaſion, in the Sequel, to mention him and his Spouſe, I muſt not omit ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king you acquainted with their Characters; but I muſt previouſly tell you, that their Merit infinitely ſurpaſſes whatever I can ſay of them. Good Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Generoſity, Candour, and every other Quality, which can render a Perſon amiable, are perfectly united in them. I may ſay, in ſhort, they are an Honour to the <hi>French</hi> Nation. A rare <hi>Phenome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,</hi> to preſerve ſo many good Qualities among a People, who hardly know one of them! Nothing can be a more convincing Proof of it, than what they did for me during my Captivity.</p>
               <p>When I waited on Monſ. <hi>de l'Iſle,</hi> to concert, with him, the Meaſures I had to take; he received me with an unprecedented Politeneſs, and gave me a moſt favourable Reception. He told me, that he was not to go the Journey himſelf, but that it was his Brother, Monſ. <hi>de la. Croyere,</hi> who, without doubt, would rejoice at having my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. I afterwards ſpoke of it to Monſ. <hi>de la Croyere,</hi> and to the other Profeſſors, who readily granted my Deſire. Some Days after, Monſ. <hi>de la Croyere,</hi> deſired me to come to his Houſe, in Order to depart, the next Day: But, their laſt Diſpatches not being ready, our Journey was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0653500404:245"/>
a good while longer. During this Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val, Monſ. and Madam <hi>de l'Iſle</hi> compelled me to be with them, and treated me as an intimate Friend. There it was I got acquainted with Monſ. <hi>du Vernoi,</hi> a very learned Profeſſor of Anatomy, and a Man of unqueſtionable Worth: To whom I have great Obligations for Services done me; And as I ſhall mention him farther in the Sequel of my Hiſtory, I thought it my Duty to make you acquainted with him. As our whole Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation at Monſ. <hi>de l'Iſle</hi>'s, turned upon the Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to <hi>Kamtſchatki,</hi> I had ſome Inclination to go thither my ſelf, and it was compatible enough with my Reſolution of being unknown. I opened my Mind to Monſ. <hi>de l'Iſle,</hi> and we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated on it ſome Days: But, upon mature En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, finding neither Order nor Management in the Deſign, I thought no more of it. And, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, they were ſo ill prepared for it, that on the very Day intended for our Departure, we were obliged to put it off a Fortnight, to regulate cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Matters, which ought to have been provided for long before. Such is the Cuſtom of the Country; Nothing is done there <hi>To-day,</hi> every Thing is put off till <hi>To-morrow,</hi> which I have too often experienced to my Coſt, and been forced to put up with thoſe <hi>To-days</hi> and <hi>To-morrows,</hi> for three Months together.</p>
               <p>At length, after many Delays, on the moſt fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous Accounts in the World, we were upon the Point of departing: But two of theſe Gentlemen having ſome Doubts, I went before, with a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, Monſieur <hi>de la Croyere</hi> was ſo kind to give me. We agreed upon a Place, where we were all to meet, and purſue our Journey afterwards to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. Monſieur <hi>de l'Iſle</hi> and his Spouſe, not ſatisfied with the Civilities they had ſhewn me, loaded me with ſuch a Quantity of Proviſions, as
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0653500404:246"/>
would have ſerved me quite to <hi>Perſia,</hi> had I been allowed to purſue my intended Journey thither.</p>
               <p>The Day of my Departure was the 15th of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt,</hi> O.S. I embarked on board a ſmall Veſſel as cuſtomary, and went up the River <hi>Nieva</hi> to the famous Canal of <hi>Ladoga.</hi> This Canal is ſituate in a very marſhy Soil, and is of a vaſt Extent; but I very much queſtion, whether the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages accruing from it anſwer the immenſe Sums it coſt at firſt; not to mention the prodigious Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Lives ſacrificed in that Undertaking. I make little or no Doubt, but it will inſenſibly fall to Decay; becauſe it is hardly poſſible to keep it in Repair, without a conſiderable yearly Expence; and, on the other Hand, the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> are not enough inured to Labour to continue ſuch painful Works long.</p>
               <p>From this Canal of <hi>Ladoga,</hi> I entered the River <hi>Wolkowa,</hi> in which there are Currents of an aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing Rapidity, and very difficult to ſtem. The Violence of the Stream broke the Rope which drew my Barque; but, by good Fortune, it happened at a Place, where the Danger was not great, and all the Damage I ſuffered was being carried ſome Diſtance back again. However, not to incur the like Danger again, I took care always to land, when I found myſelf expoſed to it.</p>
               <p>Theſe Currents, or rather Cataracts of the <hi>Lado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ga,</hi> are a Hinderance to the Advantages propoſed by this Canal. The chief Aim of digging it, was to facilitate the Communication of the <hi>Wolga</hi> with the <hi>Baltick,</hi> and ſo far it has ſucceeded; becauſe, by this River, there is a very eaſy Paſſage even to the <hi>Caſpian</hi> Sea. It is, likewiſe, of great Service to the Tranſport from <hi>Muſcow</hi> to <hi>Petersburg.</hi> As for the Tranſport of Goods from <hi>Petersburg</hi> into the Country, I look upon this Deſign as very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult. How is it poſſible Veſſels, heavy laden, ſhould
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0653500404:247"/>
ſtem theſe Currents? What Dangers would they not be expoſed to? And ſuppoſing it practicable, how few Merchants would be at the Expence of an Undertaking of this Nature?</p>
               <p>Having paſſed theſe Currents, I continued my Journey through a Country equally populous and well cultivated. I traverſed the great <hi>Novogrod,</hi> which carried me into the Lake of <hi>Imen;</hi> from thence into the River <hi>Miſta,</hi> which I was likewiſe obliged to go up as far as <hi>Bronitz,</hi> the Rendez-vous ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by my Friend <hi>de la Croyere.</hi> We both rejoiced at our happy Meèting, and after having continued our Journey ſome Days by Land, we embarked on the <hi>Twerſa,</hi> a little River, which falls into the <hi>Wolga,</hi> at <hi>Twer,</hi> whither we repaired. Here we were obliged to ſtay about ten Days, to fit out a large Barque, big enough for the whole Caravan. I muſt confeſs, this Delay was very te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious to me: And I could not conceive, how, in an Undertaking of this Importance, Meaſures could have been ſo ill concerted. But thus, as I obſerved before, it is with every Thing in <hi>Muſcovy;</hi> an eternal Slowneſs rules in all their Actions, and if any thing ever ſucceeds there, it is generally the Effect of meer Hazard.</p>
               <p>All Things being ready for our Departure, Monſieur <hi>de la Croyere</hi> would take me into the ſame Cabbin provided for himſelf. I ſhall not give you any Account of my Remarks, nor of what happened in my Journey from <hi>Petersburg</hi> to <hi>Caſan.</hi> I had kept a little Journal, but the <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covites</hi> thought fit to take away this, and ſeveral other of my Papers. This petty Larceny ſhews the Character of the People: They were apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, the Uſe I ſhould make of this Journal might not turn to their Honour, and perhaps they were not miſtaken: This, however, is certain, that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt is one of the evil Qualities of this Nation.
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0653500404:248"/>
I think I promiſed to ſay ſomething of <hi>Kamtſchatki,</hi> and of the Expedition thither: it is time I keep my Word, and entertain you a Moment on that Head.</p>
               <p>It is certain, that the North-Eaſt Part of <hi>Aſia</hi> differs very much from what it has been long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved to be. It was ſuppoſed to be bordered by the <hi>Promontorium Glaciale,</hi> or Cape of <hi>Swetenoes.</hi> But it is now diſcovered, that, at the End of this Cape, there is a large Continent which ſtretches North and South, for the Space of more than twenty Degrees, and forms a ſort of <hi>Peninſula,</hi> joining to that Part of <hi>Aſia</hi> only on the North. On the Weſtern Side of it, is a Gulph, which ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parates it from <hi>Siberia,</hi> and on the Eaſtern Side is the Sea of <hi>Japan.</hi> Towards the South it is bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by a very narrow Streight, full of Iſlands. For this Diſcovery we are indebted to the People who inhabit the moſt Northern Parts of <hi>Siberia.</hi> Some pretend it was made by Sea, by doubling the Cape of <hi>Swetenoes:</hi> Others, that it was made on the Land-ſide, by advancing very far into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; I ſhall not determine which is the right: But however this be, it is certain the Country is inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited by divers Nations, and that, at this Time, a great Number of <hi>Ruſſian</hi> Colonies are ſettled there. PETER I. ſent a <hi>Daniſh</hi> Sea-Officer thither, called Captain <hi>Berrin;</hi> who, having undertaken the Journey by Land, traverſed <hi>Siberia,</hi> advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to this very Place, and returned. What Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries this Captain made, I cannot pretend ſo juſtly to ſay: But it is to be preſumed, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Meaſures have been ſince taken, are grounded on his Report. The ſame Officer has now under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken this ſecond Journey thither, by Order of the Empreſs, who has intruſted the Direction of this Affair ſolely to him. He departed ſome Months before us, with a large Company, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0653500404:249"/>
of Mariners, and a great Number of Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, who are to be employed in building ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Veſſels there. The Profeſſors hoped to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take them at <hi>Tobolski,</hi> the Capital of <hi>Siberia,</hi> with the reſt of the Caravan.</p>
               <p>This Project was formed with ſeveral Views. The firſt is, to eſtabliſh a Trade with the <hi>Japa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſe.</hi> The ſecond, to work at the Mines, which are very rich and numerous, in the Country alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy known: And a third, to attempt new Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries towards <hi>America,</hi> which, perhaps, is not very far from thence; ſince the Bounds of the North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern Part of <hi>California</hi> are not yet known. It is even ſaid, that Captain <hi>Berrin</hi> has already diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſome Land on that Side. We muſt allow, that nothing has a more promiſing Appearance, than all theſe Views, and, if they ſucceed, great Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages will enſue: But I very much fear, the Court of <hi>Ruſſia</hi> will be deceived in their Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and am concerned for my Friend the Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomer, who has engaged ſo unwarily in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign. Their Meaſures have been hitherto ſo ill concerted, that, in all Appearance, this Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize will never ſucceed. The greater Part of thoſe employed therein are unexperienced Perſons, who have no Talent, nor have I obſerved either Diſcipline or Order among them. Nevertheleſs, a Scheme of this Nature, if well executed, would excite the Attention of all <hi>Europe,</hi> and be an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expreſſible Glory to the Sovereign, under whoſe Reign it has been formed.</p>
               <p>I ſhould be curious to know what the <hi>Dutch</hi> think of this Undertaking; they, who alone, in <hi>Europe,</hi> carry on a Trade to <hi>Japan.</hi> They would not have much Reaſon to be concerned at it: The <hi>Muſcovites</hi> are not a very expeditious People to ſettle ſuch a Commerce. But it may be objected, that the Face of Affairs may change in <hi>Ruſſia;</hi>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:0653500404:250"/>
The Inhabitants of it are not always the ſame; And after all, may not the Deſign, which miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in the firſt Attempt, ſucceed in a Second? Vain Imagination! A Change in the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> is a <hi>Phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomenon</hi> which will not appear ſo ſoon, and which, I confeſs, I look upon as impoſſible. On the other Hand, there are, in the wiſe and mighty Republick of <hi>Holland,</hi> Politicians too refined, and Traders too knowing, not to be watchful for the Security of their Commerce; And if they find ſuch a Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment likely to take Place, they will not want Means to prevent the Conſequences of it. The leaſt Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicions, dextrouſly inſinuated into the jealous Minds of the <hi>Japaneſe,</hi> would alone ſuffice to overthrow all the Schemes of the <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> were they even con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certed with more Prudence and Wiſdom than they are.</p>
               <p>My Journey to <hi>Kamtſchatki</hi> has been no leſs tedious than that from <hi>Twer</hi> to <hi>Caſan.</hi> We entered the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle River of <hi>Caſanka,</hi> which begun to freeze, and going up it, arrived the 20th of <hi>October</hi> about Noon at <hi>Caſan,</hi> where I ſhall take ſome Days Repoſe. Do you the ſame, Sir, expecting a ſecond Letter, in which I ſhall acquaint you only with what regards my ſelf.

               <p>My laſt informed you of our Arrival at <hi>Caſan,</hi> the 20th of <hi>October.</hi> It then began to be ſo cold, that the River was half frozen over. I had ſo little Thoughts of making any ſtay there, that my firſt Care was to inquire, if there was any Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel bound for <hi>Aſtracan:</hi> But it was labour in vain, the Seaſon was too far advanced. I had no Remedy but to hire a Barque to my ſelf, and all Neceſſaries for my Journey were ſoon provided. My Friends were no ſooner informed of my Deſign, than they uſed their utmoſt Endeavours to diſſuade me from it. Monſ. <hi>de la Croyere,</hi> in particular, gave me ſuch an Idea of the Difficulties, and repreſented, in ſuch lively Colours, the Dangers, I was about to expoſe my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to, that I, at length, determined to wait for an Opportunity of continuing my Journey by Land:
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0653500404:252"/>
It was next to impoſſible for me to reſiſt the preſſing Inſtances, which were made me on this Account. My Reſolution being fixed, a ſmall Lodging was provided for me, and as I foreſaw my Abode there might be long, I took care to buy thoſe Things, I ſhould ſtand in need of. The next Point was, what Character I was to appear under: After mature Conſideration, I concluded, it would not become me to remain wholly under Diſguiſe, and as a Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant. I did not in the leaſt doubt, but the Profeſſors made mention of me; But I was intirely at a Loſs what Conſtruction was put upon their Diſcourſe. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing informed that the Governor was a Perſon of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction, who had travelled, and ſpoke <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Italian,</hi> I took that Reſolution, which to me ſeemed alone becoming a Man of Honour. I paid him a Viſit, the 28th of <hi>October,</hi> and opened my ſelf to him, in the following Words:</p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Sir, tho I am perſuaded, it is allowable to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Publick, in Things which concern none but my ſelf, I am, at the ſame Time, convinced, it will not become me to impoſe upon a Perſon of your Quality and Character. My Paſs, you ſee, deſcribes me as a Merchant, by a feigned Name; But I muſt confeſs to you, that I am a Soldier, of ſome Diſtinction. My Deſign is to go into <hi>Perſia,</hi> to offer my Service to the Prince of <hi>Heſſe-Homburg,</hi> to be employed under him, in Her Majeſty's Army. I beg of you, Sir, to give me a Guard, that I may continue my Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney in Safety."</q> I told him my real Name, and the Reaſon, which had induced me to conceal it. He anſwered me courteouſly enough, but with ſome Perplexity. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"I am ſorry (ſaid he) for your Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes, and ſhall take care for your Departure with the firſt Opportunity."</q> Having, thereupon, made me repeat my true Name, he took it down in Writing. He continued his Diſcourſe to me in the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0653500404:253"/>
moſt obliging Manner; But perceiving his Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance did not ſpeak the ſame Language, I replied: <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Sir, as you may have ſome Scruple with Reſpect to my Perſon, I here offer you my Sword, and am ready to ſurrender my ſelf your Priſoner, whenever you ſhall think proper, 'till you know who I am, and in what manner I have behaved."</q> To which he anſwered in theſe very Words: <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Fear Nothing, Sir, I am convinced by your Carriage and your Diſcourſe, that you are the Perſon, you ſay you are: Let nothing diſquiet you, and be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured a Paſſage ſhall be provided for you, in the firſt Ship, that departs for <hi>Aſtracan</hi>:"</q> Upon this, I took my Leave, without, however, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what Courſe to take: The Surprize I had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in his Looks, was to me not the moſt auſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Omen.</p>
               <p>When I left the Governour, I went directly to Monſ. <hi>de la Croyere,</hi> to acquaint him what had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened. I had too much Obligation to conceal any Thing from him. He had Company with him, ſo I did not think it proper to ſpeak of this Matter, 'till he was alone. I had hardly ſat down, when I ſaw the City-Major come in, at the Head of half a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen Soldiers, with their Bayonets on the Muz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zles of their Muskets. He immediately demanded my Sword, which I gave him without Heſitation, telling him, the Governour might have received it himſelf, without taking this Step. He did not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand me, but behaved with much more Polite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, than is uſual in <hi>Muſcovy.</hi> I muſt do him the Juſtice to own, that of all thoſe I had any Concern with, his Carriage was the moſt Gentleman-like. I could almoſt ſwear he is of <hi>Tartarian</hi> Race; At leaſt his Shape and Phiſiognomy had very much the Reſemblance of that Nation, which has Nothing in common with the <hi>Muſcovite.</hi> He ſoon took Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the Room I was in, and obliged Monſ. <hi>de</hi>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:0653500404:254"/>
                  <hi>la Croyere,</hi> with his Company, to go out, and then leaving me to the Care of a Corporal and ſix Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, who kept their Bayonets on the Muzzles of their Muskets, he returned to give the Governour an Account of his Expedition. I deſired Monſ. <hi>de la Croyere,</hi> when he left me, not to be uneaſy, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on his own Account nor mine, aſſuring him, that the Regard he had ſhewn for me could never be of any Prejudice to him. The Major returned in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout half an Hour, and, taking me in his Sled, carried me to my Lodgings, where all that belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to me were examined with the greateſt Exactneſs. This was done by a young Man who had the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of an Officer, but whoſe Carriage beſpoke him nothing leſs. Not the leaſt Thing, in my whole Equipage, could eſcape his Sight. He unfolded my Shirts, and folded them up again, to ſee if he could find any thing concealed in them. In ſhort, his Hands and Eyes were every where. The Major, who ſeemed pleaſed with his performing his Functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with ſo much Care, told him, with a Sneer: <hi>Thou wouldſt make an excellent</hi> Valet de Chambre, <hi>none better.</hi> I took this young Man to be an Officer, by his Dreſs; But if he was ſo, judge what ſort of Officers there are in <hi>Muſcovy.</hi> After a nice Enquiry what was to be found, they bundled up my Books, and ſome Writings of no great Concern, which they ſeized and carried off.</p>
               <p>Having thus diſpoſed of my Effects, the next Thing was to ſecure my Perſon. They carried me to the <hi>Corps de Garde,</hi> which is over-againſt the Governour's Houſe. I was there ſhut up, in the Officer's Room, where a Soldier was placed to guard me, within Sight, with his Sword drawn. I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, with Impatience, that the Governour would either ſend for me, or let me know what he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to do with me. It was already paſt Noon, and I ſaw no Body, but the Officer of the Guard,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0653500404:255"/>
and the Soldiers who went out and in. At length, a very ſlender Dinner was brought for the Officer, and another Perſon who was to dine with him. They were ſo civil to invite me to take Part with them. I returned them Thanks; But enquiring of them, by Signs, if the Governour would not ſend me my Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion likewiſe, they gave me to underſtand he would not. In vain I deſired to have ſomebody I could ſpeak with; I was told I was not to expect it. Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, in the mean time, preſſing, and ſeeing nothing brought me, I thought it was beſt to accept of their Offer. I neither ſaw nor heard of any thing farther, the whole Day; and Night being come, I was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged to take up with a Bench inſtead of a Bed; where, however, I ſlept pretty quietly, after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving taken a Knife out of my Pocket, which was troubleſome to me, and which was ſtolen before Morning, from the Table where I laid it.</p>
               <p>I met with no better Uſage, the Day following: Having therefore expected my Deſtiny, to no Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, 'till Noon, I deſired to ſpeak with the Officer, to whom I gave to underſtand, by Signs, and pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty bluntly, that I was ill uſed; that he ſhould go to the Governour, and tell him, I expected he ſhould either ſend me an Interpreter, or ſuffer me to ſpeak to him my ſelf. This Officer, highly ſurprized to ſee a Priſoner, equally haughty in his Geſttures, and threatning in the Tone of his Voice, went immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately out of the Room, but returned in a Moment, to tell me the Governour was not at Home. Tho this Anſwer gave me little Satisfaction, I endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to make him underſtand ſeveral other Things, but to no Purpoſe. He only perceived, that I want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to know, whether I ſhould have any Thing ſent me to eat, and to this he again anſwered in the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative. I plainly ſaw I was to be at my own Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, and therefore threw a Ruble on the Table, and made Signs to have ſomething provided for me.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:0653500404:256"/>
It may not be amiſs to obſerve here, that in the whole Kingdom of <hi>Caſan,</hi> a Ruble is a conſiderable Sum, ſufficient to maintain a Man elegantly for a whole Month. As Money is extream ſcarce in this Country, every thing is exceeding cheap. A Sheep is not worth above ten Pence,<note n="*" place="bottom">I have tranſlated the <hi>French</hi> Word <hi>Sous,</hi> a Penny, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we have no Denomination of Coin exactly adequate to it, tho' otherwiſe it is not worth above two Thirds of a Penny.</note> a Hen a Penny, and 30 Eggs the ſame. For 4 or 5 Rubles you may buy the beſt Horſe, that is brought to Market, and the beſt Bullock is not worth above Two. You know, without doubt, that a Ruble is a Silver Coin, of about the Value of 4 Livres and a half, <hi>French</hi> Money.</p>
               <p>They returned me my Change; but I ſoon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, that Stewards in <hi>Muſcovy</hi> were no more troubled with Honeſty, than in other Countries. I was, however, under a Neceſſity of being cheated in this Manner, during the whole Time of my Captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. I thought my ſelf happy, when I met with Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple who were contented with a ſmall Gain: But this is a <hi>Phenomenon</hi> which rarely appears in <hi>Muſcovy.</hi> Pardon, I beſeech you, a ſmall Digreſſion. You may, perhaps, be curious to know my Bill of Fare; It conſiſted only in Bread, Beer, and a large Piece of boiled Sturgeon. I no ſooner ſat down to my ſhort Meal, than a Corporal, who was in the Room, came to offer me the Service of a Carver, with the ſame Knife which was ſtolen from me the Night before. I leave you to judge of my Surprize: I fell a laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and, at the ſame Time, laying hold of my Knife, I gave him to underſtand I could diſpenſe with his Office: But finding he would not let go his Hold, I began to talk big, and hector. My Guards were afraid, and thought proper to ſend for their Officer. He came in a great Fright, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing informed of the Matter, he offered me his Hand,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0653500404:257" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and made me give him my Word, that no Miſchief ſhould enſue. Satisfied with my Promiſe, he ordered my Knife to be given me, but I was obliged to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn it again after Dinner. This ſhort Scene let me ſee into what Hands I was fallen, and by this I judged what Treatment I had to expect for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
<q>
                     <l>Me ſcivi in media vivere Barbaria.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>In the Afternoon, my Cloaths were brought me, of which I found they had ſtolen a good Part. The Linnen I had given to waſh, they brought me quite wet: And as they had ſeized, among my other Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, my Laundreſs's Bill, I ſuppoſe that was laid, among the Reſt, before the Empreſs's Cabinet-Council. As for the Receipt for my Rent, which I had paid beforehand, and ſeveral other Things I had bought, they did not think fit to reſtore them, nor was ever any farther Mention made of them. In the mean time, I ſtill perſiſted in demanding an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter, or that I might be carried before the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour; but allIntreaties on thisHead were fruitleſs. I then perceived I muſt prepare to return to <hi>Peterſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg,</hi> and conſequently undergo the Fatigue of a Journey of 5 or 600 Leagues: For this End, I was deſirous at leaſt to buy Neceſſaries to ſcreen me from the Cold; But no Body could or would underſtand me, and I was wholly ignorant what would be my Pate.</p>
               <p>The next Day, a Man brought my printed Books, which he lock'd up in my Trunk, leaving only a <hi>Ruſſian</hi> Almanack, with a little Dictionary, in my Diſpoſal. They likewiſe allowed me ſome Shirts; but every Thing elſe was locked up and ſealed. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Four in the Afternoon, I was carried, by a Guard of a Serjeant and two Soldiers, to one of the Suburbs of the City, where I lay, that Night, in the Houſe of a Peaſant; And here it was that I began
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0653500404:258"/>
to bully in earneſt. I had delivered my Sword, as I have obſerved above, to the City-Major, and it had been kept in my Priſon: When they carried me away, I bid the Serjeant take it with him: But the Officer of the Guard, who probably took a Liking to it, refuſed it, under Pretext, as far as I could underſtand, that the Major would ſend it after me. After having waited for it, ſome Time, in vain, I told the Serjeant I was reſolved not to go away without my Sword. I ſpoke to him of it, with ſuch an Air of Authority, that he, at length, thought fit to go for it, and brought it me in a Moment. Happily for me, the Woman of the Houſe where I was, had a Sheep-ſkin Pelt, quite new, which ſhe ſeemed very willing to part with, becauſe the Wool began to fall off. We ſoon agreed for the Price, and it was of great Service to me in the Sequel. During my Stay at <hi>Twer,</hi> I had likewiſe got a Cap made of a black <hi>Fox</hi>-ſkin Muff, which coſt me a great deal of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, tho it was then of no Uſe to me. I yet keep theſe two Pieces of Fur, with the whole Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture of my Captivity, hoping one Time or other to divert you with a Sight of them.</p>
               <p>The next Day being appointed for my Depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, they put me into the worſt Sled they could find, and it was the firſt Time, in my Life, I had ever croſſed a River in a Sled. This River is called the <hi>Caſana,</hi> and was then ſo frozen as to bear great Burdens: But the Paſſage over the <hi>Wol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ga</hi> had like to have proved fatal to me. This Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is very broad, at the Place where I was to go over it: I believe I ſpeak within Compaſs, if I ſay, it is at leaſt half a League broad. The Ice was pretty ſtrong, to ſome Diſtance from the Banks; but when we came farther, we met with large Pieces of floating Ice, driving with the Stream. In the Middle of the River, lay a Barque which waited
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0653500404:259"/>
for me: But when we came within three or four hundred Paces of it, there was no other Way to get at it, but by jumping from one Flake of Ice to the other. I was, at firſt, terrified with the Danger, and thought it raſh to attempt this Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage: However, after ſome Reflections, I took Courage, and reſolved to run the Hazard of it. I was willing to ſet an Example to three <hi>Muſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites,</hi> who were to follow me. There were ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Perſons more, who deſigned to have gone over with us; but who, after having viewed the Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger they were like to expoſe themſelves to, wiſely reſolved to return.</p>
               <p>There remained only two <hi>Tartars</hi> and a <hi>Muſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite</hi> on the Banks. Seven or eight Men offered me their Aſſiſtance, with ſome Planks, to be made uſe of, in the moſt dangerous Places. But upon ſecond Thoughts, I believed it adviſeable to ſee firſt what Courſe the two <hi>Tartars</hi> would take, to overcome theſe Difficulties. I beheld them, tho not without laughing, leaping from one Piece of Ice to the other, and ſoon after getting into the Boat, without any Accident. Encouraged by their Example, I was not long in reſolving to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them. Having pulled off my Cloak, I or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered two Men to walk before me, whom I fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed Step for Step. I thought there was leſs Danger in tracing their Footſteps, than if I had taken any other Way. The Walk ſeemed pretty tedious to me; but, at length, I had the Pleaſure to take my laſt Leap, into the Barque. My two <hi>Tartars</hi> expreſſed their Joy, by Signs, to ſee me with them, and I no leſs rejoiced, at having eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped ſo great a Danger. Thoſe who followed me had, likewiſe, the good Fortune to get into the Barque to us.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Muſcovite,</hi> more timorous than the reſt, would be the laſt, and was near being loſt. He
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0653500404:260"/>
was not half way, when he ſunk down, between two Pieces of Ice, which, by good Fortune, prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſtrong enough to bear him up by his two Arms. One of the Paſſengers, who happened to be near him, came to his Aſſiſtance, and helped him up, on the Ice again; when perceiving he was nearer the Shoar than the Bark, he choſe rather to go back, than to expoſe himſelf to new Perils. This Bark carried us over, tho with great Difficulty: For, every Moment, large Pieces of Ice came driv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon us, without any Poſſibility of avoiding them.</p>
               <p>Being happily arrived, on the other Shoar, I ran towards ſome Houſes, which were not far off, to ſcreen my ſelf from a very piercing Cold, and a North-Wind, which blew hard. My Guards who were not yet recovered from the Fright, which ſo dangerous a Paſſage had put them into, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing beſides taken up with getting my Goods on Shoar, had forgot to keep an Eye upon me. In the mean Time, having found all the Houſes ſhut, I went into a little Church; where I heartily thanked GOD, for having delivered me from ſo apparent a Danger. I ſtaid there ſome Time, with no other Deſign, but to be ſcreen'd from the Cold. Our People, at length, having loſt Sight of me, were alarmed, and ran, with all their Might, directly towards the Houſes, not doubting but I was got into one of them. They were great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſurprized when they got thither, and I, who ſawtheir Uneaſineſs, took a Pleaſure in leaving them in it. However, not to carry the Jeſt too far, I appeared again a Moment afterwards, and eaſed them of the Fears of my being eſcaped.</p>
               <p>We took up our Lodging at a Houſe near the Place of our Landing, being reſolved to ſpend the Night there, to reſt from our great Fatigue. Tho our Journey, this Day, had been but ſhort, it
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0653500404:261"/>
might be reckoned one of the moſt ſevere we had to undergo. Being come to our Quarters, I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to convince the Serjeant, who had Care of me, that he might be very eaſy on my Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, and I promiſed him to do nothing contrary to his Orders. He underſtood me, and taking me by the Hand, expreſſed a Satisfaction in my Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour. From this Time forwards, I was no longer a Priſoner, but my Guard became my Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants. After a light Supper, I laid my ſelf down to reſt. The Night was long, and I had Time enough to ſleep, and to think, at Leiſure, on my unhappy Fate. It may, perhaps, not be diſagre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to you to know what were my Reflections on this Occaſion.</p>
               <p>They chiefly ran upon my Adventures. I firſt called to Mind all that <hi>Peter,</hi> the <hi>Great,</hi> had done, the Pains he had taken, and the Torrents of Blood he had ſhed, to extricate his Subjects, from that Barbarity and Ignorance into which they were plunged. I then reflected on his Voyages, Enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, Labours, and Eſtabliſhments; and I ſaid to myſelf; where are now the Effects of all the Pains this great Monarch took to reform his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple? Is it poſſible that his Subjects ſhould be yet in the ſame State of Barbarity, they were in, long before his Reign? Where are then the Fruits of his Labour? I could not find that this Prince had changed the Genius of his Nation, and I had but too much Experience of the contrary.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Peter</hi> I. has been often heard to ſay, That he had made Men of Beaſts; but that after his Death, they would turn to Beaſts again; and the Author of theſe Letters ſeems to juſtify his Prophecy.</note>
               </p>
               <p>From theſe Thoughts, coming to the Uſage I had met with, the moſt injurious that could be imagined, I began to make other Reflections. The Government of <hi>Caſan</hi> (ſaid I) ought, for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0653500404:262"/>
Reaſons, to be looked upon as one of the principal Employments conferred by the <hi>Ruſſian</hi> Court.<note n="†" place="bottom">The Kingdom of <hi>Caſan</hi> is one of the ten Governments, into which <hi>Peter</hi> I. parcel'd out his vaſt <hi>Empire.</hi> He firſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided it into eight only, of which the Kingdoms of <hi>Caſan</hi> and <hi>Aſtracan</hi> together made one: But upon enlarging his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts otwards <hi>Perſia,</hi> theſe two Kingdoms were ſeparated, and made two Governments, which made them nine in all, and he afterwards divided the two into three, in Order to make ten Governments; in Veneration to the Number Ten; (as it is ſaid) that Number being held ſacred by the <hi>Ruſſians.</hi>
                  </note> Conſequently the Perſon, who now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joys it, ſhould be eſteemed one of the moſt wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Subjects belonging to it. And yet this Man, who is ſtamped with ſuch a Character, behaves himſelf in the moſt unjuſtifiable Manner in the World. He has neither Chriſtianity, nor even any Principle of Humanity. He is the moſt vile and ungenerous of Men: In a Word, he is a very <hi>Barbarian.</hi> Has not he ſhewn himſelf to be the moſt abandoned of the human Species, with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to me? Where is the Juſtice of impriſoning a Foreigner, who, relying upon the Laws of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, travels under a feigned Name, and in whom there does not appear the leaſt Cauſe of Suſpicion? Is it a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Uſage, to force a Man to travel in a Seaſon, in which a <hi>Muſcovite,</hi> who is the moſt inured to Hardſhip, is obliged to keep his Home? Ought not he to have enquired, whether I was provided with Neceſſaries to reſiſt the Inclemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of a hard Winter, in a Climat I was no Ways accuſtomed to? Was it not a Cruelty to abandon me in a Priſon, without ever informing, himſelf if I had where withal to ſubſiſt? He knew I was ignorant of the Language of the Country; I was not capable of asking for what I ſtood moſt in need of. Ought he not, by his Orders, to have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented my being robbed of Part of what I had? In ſhort, Sir, would it not have excited your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0653500404:263"/>
paſſion, to have ſeen me going over the <hi>Wolga?</hi> And if I had periſhed in that Paſſage, had not the Governour of <hi>Caſan</hi> been the Cauſe of my Death? I cannot but look upon this Event as the moſt dangerous I ever encountered with, during the whole Courſe of my Life.</p>
               <p>But to go father: To whom is it this Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour ſhews ſuch unworthy Treatment? Why, to a Man of Quality, one whom he himſelf has ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged to be ſo, and pitied him in his Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes. A Perſon, who, with a ſincere and open Heart, throws himſelf into his Power, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treats his Protection. That he might the better ſurprize and betray me, he begins, by giving me good Words, he aſſures me I have nothing to fear, and that he will procure me an Opportunity of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing my Journey, in all Safety. Weak, ungene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Action! Tell me, I beſeech you, was there no other Way to ſecure me but by Treachery? In any other Country, a little more civiliz'd, a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of a Province would have behaved in a very different Manner. He would have ſaid; <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Sir, I am ſorry I cannot grant you the Favour you aſk, the preſent Juncture, and the poſitive Orders I have from Court, oblige me indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſably to ſecure your Perſon: However, be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, I will do every thing, that is in my Power, to relieve you, and make your Captivity eaſy."</q> Had the Governour of <hi>Caſan</hi> treated me with ſuch Language, he would no leſs have executed the Orders of his Court, ſuppoſing he had any: And for me, far from having Reaſon of Complaint, I ſhould certainly have acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Favours: But this is not their Manner of Proceeding in <hi>Muſcovy.</hi> Their Way there is to ſeize a Perſon without any Cauſe, without any Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination, and, without even alledging the leaſt Pretext for it; they treat him immediately as a
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0653500404:264"/>
State-Criminal, he is guarded within View, and with Sword in Hand, he is refuſed the Uſe of his Knife and Fork, and his Equipage is rifled. Can a People, who behave in this Manner, be called ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilized? And who then are <hi>Barbarians,</hi> if they are not ſo? Certainly, if I had fallen into the Hands of <hi>Murſa,</hi> the Chief of the <hi>Tartars,</hi> who dwells in <hi>Caſan,</hi> I ſhould never have met with ſuch Treatment: And yet theſe paſs for <hi>Barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and no one has yet been at the Pains to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceive the World in this Point. There is an enormous Difference between them and the <hi>Muſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites;</hi> but it conſiſts in this, that they are not guilty of the Vices, the latter are ſo juſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached with. The very Sight of the <hi>Tartars</hi> inclines one to believe all that Fame tells us of thoſe noble Enterprizes, by Means of which they extended their Conqueſts throughout all <hi>Aſia,</hi> and a Part of <hi>Europe.</hi> But at this Time, by the greateſt of all Misfortunes, ſeveral Branches of this valiant Nation are brought under the <hi>Muſcovite</hi> Yoke. I muſt confeſs, this ſurpaſſes my Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and I am at a Loſs to comprehend it. It is true, the <hi>Ruſſians</hi> ſhew a great Regard for them, which is one Reaſon why they are ſo eaſy: But as they are not born to creep to ſuch Maſters, I hardly queſtion but they will, ſoon or late, ſhake off their Yoke.</p>
               <p>You will judge, Sir, of the Length of the Night, by that of my Reflections: But, at length Day appears, and I muſt riſe to purſue my Way, to <hi>Muſcow,</hi> in a Seaſon, when the Ground is eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where covered with Snow. We had a pretty good Journey, this Day, chiefly thro Woods and By-ways. I was obliged to lie all along in my Sled, to avoid the Branches of the Trees: But then I was almoſt buried in the Snow, which was every Moment falling upon me. We came, in
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0653500404:265"/>
in the Evening, to a Village, the Houſes of which appeared to me very different from thoſe of the <hi>Muſcovites.</hi> Both Men and Women had other Habits, and their Language bore no Analogy to the <hi>Ruſſian.</hi> Upon Enquiry, I found I was among the <hi>Scherimiſſian Tartars,</hi> and I rejoiced at it. The Character I had heard of this Nation, and what I had obſerved myſelf of them, while at <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſan,</hi> gave me an advantageous Idea of them. I took great Delight in viewing their Houſes and Furniture, but more eſpecially the Dreſs of their Women, which is very ſingular.</p>
               <p>While I was diverting myſelf in this Manner, I had the Diſſatisfaction, to ſee my Guard ſcuffling with my Landlady. Theſe Raſcals had their Views, in taking this Way, which is not the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Road. The moſt brutal among them began to abuſe the poor old Creature, for no other Crime but endeavouring to ſecure her own. I thought it my Duty to ſtand by this Woman: I therefore wreſted a large Pole out of the Hands of a Soldier, who had ſeized it, and, what with Signs and Words, had the good Fortune to appeaſe him. I found, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, that the poor <hi>Scheremiſſi,</hi> had been obliged to treat theſe Soldiers, and to furniſh them with what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they asked. For my Part, I was contented with a ſmall Matter, conformable to the Bill of Fare I had preſcribed my ſelf for the whole Journey. It may be proper to inform you, that, in <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> there are no Houſes of Entertainment, where a Man may lodge and be boarded. In the Publick Houſes they have, they only ſell Beer and Brandy. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving therefore thrown down ſome Money on the Table, I made a Sign for them to get me ſome Eggs, They took but one Penny, for which they brought me thirty. I began to laugh at ſeeing ſo large a Number for ſo little Money. I picked out ſix of the freſheſt, and gave the reſt to my Landlady.
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0653500404:266"/>
One of my greedy Guard would have laid hold on them; but I gave him to underſtand, by a Sign, that he was already well enough ſerved. My whole Supper conſiſted of theſe ſix Eggs, and a little Brandy mixed with Water. I might have had Beer, but it was ſo bad, there was no drinking it. This was all my Food from <hi>Caſan</hi> to <hi>Muſcow,</hi> and this Way of Living was ſo far from impairing my Health, that I was perfectly well, at my Arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val there. My Bedding was as mean as my Food; a Bench was the only Conveniency offer'd me, and all a Traveller has to expect throughout whole <hi>Muſcovy.</hi> I had happily provided my ſelf, before my Departure, with a good Mattraſs, which was of ſingular Uſe to me, as well now as afterwards.</p>
               <p>We continued our Journey, the next Morning. My Guard, whoſe chief Views were Pillage, were for putting up at Noon: I plainly ſaw their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign; But did not know how to prevent it. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, conſidering how much this retarded my Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, I took the Serjeant aſide, and endeavoured, by good Words, to convince him, that this Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour of his Men, might be the Occaſion of a Riot. My Admonition produced no great Effect; he alledged ſome poor Reaſons, in their Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which I was obliged to put up with. I had every Day the Mortification to ſee theſe Free-boot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers go from Houſe to Houſe, and pillage the poor <hi>Tartars,</hi> of what they pleaſed. I thought, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, it was my Buſineſs to proceed warily, in Caſe of any Tumult. I had Reaſon to be appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive, that the enraged <hi>Tartars</hi> might attempt to maſſacre my Guard, together with their Priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. I therefore, concluded, that if any Diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance happened, the moſt prudent Meaſures I could take, would be to join with the ſtrongeſt Party. I never ſuffered my Sword, which was my only Defence, to be out of my Sight. To gain the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0653500404:267"/>
Affection of the <hi>Tartars,</hi> I never went into any Houſe, but I gave the Children Money; and as I had made a large Proviſion of white Bread, I was very free in diſtributing Pieces of it among them; for which I always had their Thanks. My Guard, tho very ſtupid, had Cunning enough to paſs by the larger Villages, that they might pillage with the leſs Danger.</p>
               <p>This Behaviour of theirs gave Occaſion to many Reflections, which I made during my Journey. I could not forbear lamenting my Fate, to be put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Hands of theſe Robbers. A thouſand Times I curſed the Governor for committing me to the Care of ſuch Wretches. When I obſerved what miſerable Diſcipline they were under, I ſaid to my ſelf:
<q>
                     <l>Quid Domini ſacient, audent cum talia Servi!</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>It was a melancholy State I was reduced to, and I could not reflect upon it, without extream Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern. I found my ſelf obliged to traverſe a Country almoſt unknown, drawn upon a Board in the midſt of the Snow, dreſſed like a Savage, and deſtitute, in this Deſart, of wherewithal to eat or drink. The three Soldiers, who were my Companions, were Men without Manners or Humanity, nor could I ever have any Converſation with them. I ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times however diſpelled theſe gloomy Ideas with a <hi>ſic erat in ſatis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I muſt not omit informing you, that, in this Journey, I once quarrelled with my Sled-driver.</p>
               <p>This ſmall Adventure will contribute not a little to give you a juſt Idea of the <hi>Muſcovites.</hi> The Raſcal, for he deſerves no better Name, took a Delight in giving every one of the poor <hi>Scheremiſſi</hi> he met, a good Laſh with his Whip. I thought, at firſt, it would ſuffice to let him know it diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0653500404:268"/>
me, and that he would then leave it: But my Admonitions were in vain, and my Patience being, at length, quite ſpent, I gave him a Blow with my Fiſt, that beat him off the Sled. In his Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, he pretended to convince me, that theſe People were no <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> Here had been a good Opportunity to read him a Leſſon of Morality: But then, on the one Hand, I muſt have known how to explain my ſelf to him, and, on the other, he muſt have been indued with ſome Principles of Religion; a Thing very rare among the <hi>Muſcovites.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But ſince I am ſpeaking of Religion, you muſt know, the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> think they alone have a Title to the Name of <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> They look upon all other People, the <hi>Europeans</hi> not excepted, to be I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolaters, who have no Knowledge of the true God. <hi>Qualibus in tenebris vitae.</hi> Wretches that they are! They are not ſenſible of the profound Ignorance, in which they themſelves are immerged. What a ſtrange Worſhip is theirs! How imperfect their Faith! How looſe their Manners! I ſpeak more eſpecially of thoſe, who are in the higheſt Poſts, and who ought to ſet an Example to others. But to conclude my Reflections on this Head, ſuffer me only to enquire what their Monks are. This Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of Men, who ſwarm in every Province, are generally Drunkards, who live in a criminal Sloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, giving themſelves up to all Manner of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Superſtition abounds no where more than in their Convents. Their Vows of Continence are a Crime, becauſe they never live up to them. They think of nothing but living at their Eaſe, without Labour or Care, and they immure themſelves with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Walls of their Convents only to eſcape Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, or going to the Army. When I have fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently aſked to what End this Number of Slug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards, the Anſwer has always been, their Buſineſs is to pray to <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:0653500404:269"/>
This is the Character of the Monks, and of the whole Body of the Clergy in <hi>Muſcovy.</hi> If theſe Hypocrites, who pretend to Sanctity, had any Zeal for Religion, would they ſuffer idolatrous Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as theſe <hi>Scheremiſſi</hi> are, who inhabit the very Center of the <hi>Ruſſian</hi> Empire, to live among them? It is true, the Clergy would be obliged to change their Manners, before they could pretend to preach the Goſpel, or they would run a great Hazard not to make a ſingle Convert. All theſe <hi>Pagans</hi> live in an honeſt Simplicity, and conformable to thoſe Laws which Nature has dictated to all Men. And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, they would be very little inclined to give Ear to Men, who lead a Life perfectly ſcandalous. I fear, Sir, you will think this Digreſſion tedious: But the Subject has carried me inſenſibly beyond the Bounds I had preſcribed my ſelf. I might ſay a great deal more on this Head,
<q>
                     <l>Verum animo ſatis haec veſtigia parva ſagaci.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Suppoſe me juſt arrived at a Village, called <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baczar,</hi> which was formerly the Capital of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, where having bought ſome Proviſions, with a Covering for my Sled, and a Sack to put my Feet in,<note n="*" place="bottom">It is a Cuſtom, in theſe, and other Northern Parts, to travel with a large Sack lined with Furr, into which they put their Legs, and drawing it up, tie it about their Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles. It is of excellent Service to keep out the Cold, and for thoſe who cannot pay for theſe, a Sack filled with Bran has the ſame, or a better Effect.</note> I travelled afterwards with a little more Eaſe. The Perſons I employed to buy theſe Things, did not forget themſelves. Not ſatisfied with the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent I made them, they kept Part of the Money I put into their Hands. I accuſed them of the Theft, but I might as well have ſpoken to deaf Men: And beſides, it is not cuſtomary, in <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> to return Change.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:0653500404:270"/>
It was ſome Comfort to me, under my Afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that theſe People did me the Office of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants; I was more their Superior and Maſter than their Priſoner. I had always the good Fortune, to keep up a Sort of Authority over my Guard, and all I had any Concern with, from the Beginning to the End of my Captivity. Upon ſome Occaſions I treated them harſhly, and at other Times, I was as gentle as a Lamb. Happy for me, that I began, in Time, to bring them under my Yoke; I might otherwiſe have been doubly their Slave. The <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covites</hi> are naturally very brutal, but at the ſame Time, timorous, and great Cowards, who, when they find any Reſiſtance, have not the Courage to go on. Cowards are generally treacherous: But to put it out of their Power, the beſt Way is to keep them under.<note n="*" place="bottom">In the laſt <hi>Northern</hi> War, after the Battle of <hi>Gadebuſch,</hi> when the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> were in <hi>Holſtein,</hi> the poor <hi>Boors,</hi> who had been harraſſed by the <hi>Swedes</hi> as Enemies, and by the <hi>Muſcovites, Saxons,</hi> and <hi>Danes</hi> as Friends, were wont to ſay, If they might have their Choice, they would deſire the <hi>Swedes</hi> as Enemies, rather than the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> as Friends.</note> But to return to my Journey.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Sabaczar,</hi> we went to <hi>Niſninovogorod,</hi>

juſt ſuch as you have ſeen them at <hi>Caſan,</hi> Imagine the Inhabitants of this great City, to be a new Colony of <hi>Laplanders, Samojedes,</hi> and <hi>Oſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acks,</hi> who are accounted the moſt ſtupid Nations of the North, and then you may form, at leaſt, ſome Idea of the Character of the People, who dwell in this Capital. Do not, however, ſuppoſe this Parallel juſt in every Part of it. The <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covites</hi> are infinitely beneath all theſe other Nations: They are more barbarous, more irrational and leſs human.

My laſt gave you an Account of my Arrival at <hi>Muſcow.</hi> I was firſt carried to the Houſe of a Baker, till the Serjeant and one of the Soliders went to give an Account of my being there. The Soldier who was left, inſtead of following his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, to have a watchful Eye over me, laid him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf down upon an Oven, and ſlept moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundly. You muſt know, in <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> the Houſes of the meaner Sort of People, conſiſt generally of one large Room only, which ſerves them for Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, Kitchen, and every other Occaſion. In this Room you find an Oven, in which they bake their Bread, Meat, and almoſt all their Eatables, ſo that it is kept very hot all the Year round. The Top of it is covered with a great Number of Boards, which form a Sort of ſquare Scaffold; upon which the whole Family almoſt continually lives, as well in Summer as Winter. I have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times happened to lay my Hand upon it, but found it ſo hot, that I was ſoon obliged to take it away. Some natural Philoſophers of your Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, who have made ſo many curious Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments concerning <hi>Salamanders,</hi> did not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps know, that ſo peculiar a Species of them was to be found in <hi>Muſcovy.</hi> It is to be ſuppoſed, that if they had made this Diſcovery, they would have allowed thoſe Animals the Property given them, by the moſt early of the Ancients, of liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Fire. Pray aſſure thoſe Gentlemen, that the <hi>Salamanders</hi> in <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> not only paſs almoſt all their Time, but eat, ſleep and perform eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Office of Life, in that Element.</p>
               <p>Nothing would have been more eaſy, than for me to have eſcaped, while my <hi>Salamander</hi> was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleep on the Oven; and could I have foreſeen what was to enſue, I aſſure you, I ſhould not have neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected the Opportunity. In a City ſo full of Strang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers as <hi>Muſcow</hi> is, I might eaſily have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0653500404:273"/>
in the Crowd, and have freed my ſelf from the Purſuit of my Enemies: But I was ſo far from having the leaſt Thought of it, that I looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all that had happened to me till then, as a Farce, which would end with my Arrival at <hi>Petersburg.</hi> The firſt Scene which was opened at <hi>Muſcow,</hi> was humorous enough, but that which followed was as tragical: But you ſhall be judge of them.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as the Serjeant returned, I was conveyed to <hi>Cremelin</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Kreml,</hi> or <hi>Cremmelin,</hi> is the innermoſt of the four Towns or Parts, into which the City of <hi>Muſcow</hi> is divided, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circle one another. It contains the Palace of the <hi>Czars</hi> of <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> an ancient Building, which is ſaid to contain 1687 Apartments, including Cellars and Magazines; as likewiſe the Cathedral, and five other Churches. It is not the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace of the <hi>Czars</hi> alone, which is called <hi>Cremmelin,</hi> as ſome Writers ſuppoſe, but this whole Town or Diviſion, of which the Palace is but Part.</note> the Reſidence of the <hi>Czars,</hi> I was not uneaſy that the firſt Scene was opened in a Place, where ſuch tragical Pieces have been repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented. This Building conſiſts of ſeveral enormous Piles, heaped upon one another, without any Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. I was carried into a large Hall, which they call the Palace or Civil Court, but is one of the moſt filthy Places in the World. I there found a great Number of Clerks, buſied in diſpatching a Crowd of People, who were round about them. My coming in put an immediate ſtop to their La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and the Eyes of every one were turned upon me. As the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> are ſworn Enemies to the reſt of Mankind, the Sight of a Foreign Priſoner was a Diverſion to them, and the Hall was ſoon frequented in a more than ordinary Manner.</p>
               <p>I was committed to the Care of an Officer, a Corporal and ſix old Soldiers. One of them ſtood always before me, with his Sword drawn, but he had not the moſt terrifying Countenance. At length, they brought ſome of my Goods, but I ſaw neither my Sword nor my Trunk. They ſhewed
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0653500404:274"/>
me one Corner of the Hall, which was deſtined for my Priſon: But I had no ſooner begun to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare my Lodging, than a Perſon appeared at the Gate, to inform my Guard that I had a Pair of Sciſſars about me. They immediately ſet about to viſit a little Bag, into which I had put ſuch Things as were moſt neceſſary on my Journey, and upon my oppoſing them, they called the Officer, who told me he had Orders to viſit every Thing I had. I then opened the Bag my ſelf, and in a Moment they ſeized the Sciſſars, which they found there. I endeavoured to convince them, that I could not do without them, that I ſhould make no ill Uſe of them, and that they need not fear my making my ſelf an Eunuch with them. None of theſe Arguments had any Effect, ſo I was obliged to give way to Force. By good Fortune, I had another Pair of Sciſſars which eſcaped their Notice. I had, likewiſe, a large Fork, which, upon Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, would have done the Service of a Dagger; for the leaſt terrifying Weapons are more than ſufficient to affright a <hi>Muſcovite.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So excellent a Beginning gave me Room to judge what I had to expect in the Sequel; I, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, endeavoured to make my ſelf eaſy under the State I was in. My greateſt Mortification was to ſee my ſelf expoſed as a Sight to Crowds of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who were continually flocking into the Hall. I ſhould have been very glad of an Interpreter; but all the Application I made for that End was in vain, nor could I, with all my Entreaties, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail upon them to let me have a Barber. Dinner-Time approaching, I made Signs for ſomething to eat, and was anſwered, in the ſame Manner, that I muſt open my Purſe. After long waiting, and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing appear, I was obliged to be content with a Morſel of Bread, and ſome Scraps which I had yet left in my Hamper. While I was at Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0653500404:275"/>
they aſked me for the Key of my Trunk, which they had not thought fit to entruſt to my Care. I thought it ſomething ſtrange, that they ſhould ranſack my Trunk out of my Sight; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, I gave them the Key, tho with Reluctance. At Supper-Time, I was obliged to have Recourſe to my Pocket, and upon this Occaſion I found, that Stewards at <hi>Muſcow,</hi> are greater Thieves than thoſe of <hi>Caſan.</hi> You will not need to ask me what Sort of a Bed I had, I believe, I have already told you, that they lye on Benches, in <hi>Muſcovy.</hi> I was ſo happy to have Sheets, and Coverlets, of my own, which did me good Service: But what a Surprize appeared in my Guard, when they ſaw me making my Bed! They could not conceive what I was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to do with thoſe Bed-Cloaths.</p>
               <p>You ſee, Sir, I keep my Word with you: It was your Command, that I ſhould inform you of the moſt minute Circumſtances, and you have no Cauſe to complain on that Score. Since then you have a Taſte that Way, you ſhall know ſome Particulars of what happened the next Day. I was diſturbed, very early, at my Toilet, by the ſame Troop of Clerks, I mentioned above, and a great Number of other People, whom Curioſity or Buſineſs had drawn together, in the Hall. I continued expoſed as a Sight to theſe Crowds, who could not forbear fixing their Eyes upon me. At Length, I began to think of making Advantage of this Concourſe of People. When I ſaw any one come in, who had a good Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, or who ſeemed to be an Officer or Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigner, I immediately accoſted him, ſpeaking in <hi>Italian, French</hi> or <hi>Latin:</hi> But it was all in vain, I did not find one who could underſtand me. My Guard, in the mean Time, offended at the Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom I took, pretended to impoſe Silence upon me; but I gave them to underſtand, by Signs, that they muſt cut out my Tongue, if they would debar me
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0653500404:276"/>
the Uſe of it. Two <hi>Poles</hi> coming in, I addreſſed my ſelf to them in <hi>Latin,</hi> and they began to anſwer me, but their Mouths were ſoon ſtopped. Their Silence did not, however, hinder me from asking them, if it was cuſtomary, in <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> to treat Priſoners as the moſt abject Slaves? If it was uſual to let them periſh for Hunger, by denying them an Interpreter? And, finally, if, ſince <hi>Peter</hi> the <hi>Great,</hi> had o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Peter</hi> I, obliged all his Subjects, by an Edict, to cut off their Beards, and to wear ſhort Cloathing, which Edict was the Occaſion of a Rebellion, in 1704 in the Kingdom of <hi>Aſtracan,</hi> and the adjacent Countries.</note> to cut off their Beards, there was no ſuch Thing as a Barber eſtabliſhed in that City?</p>
               <p>While I was diſcourſing with theſe <hi>Poles,</hi> the Man who had been ſo anctious about my Sciſſars, came in, and made me a Sign to follow him. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perſuaded that he was to carry me before the Governour, I readily obeyed; for I longed for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more, being in Hopes he might underſtand ſome of the Languages I knew. I was carried into an Apartment, not far from the Hall, where I found one ſingle Man only; but ſoon after came in another, with ſome Papers in his Hands. This latter paſſed by me without ſaluting, or ſo much as looking on me, and ſate down near a Table, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards which I likewiſe advanced. The Perſon I ſaw firſt did the ſame, and having asked me if I ſpoke <hi>Italian,</hi> I anſwered him, it was natural for me to ſpeak my Mother Tongue. He then, after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving received the Inſtructions of the Perſon who was ſitting, asked me, who I was? But before I anſwered him, I was inquiſitive, in my Turn, who it was that was examining me? I was told he was a Secretary, I was not a little ſurprized to ſee a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary examining me ſitting, while I was ſtanding; but being apprehenſive I might be ſent back from
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0653500404:277"/>
whence I came, I told him my Name, which he wrote down. He asked me ſeveral other frivolous Queſtions, by which I found my Examination was not like to be ſhort. I, therefore, took the Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to tell him, that if he expected any farther An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer from me, he muſt order me a Chair. He lifted up his Head, in a great Surprize, and looking me in the Face, continued his Interrogations. All the Anſwer I gave was, that I would not ſpeak ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. He ſeemed terribly perplexed, and I found he had not been accuſtomed to ſuch Replies; he was obliged, however, to give Way to them. Being ſeated, I was forced to give Anſwer to a Number of the moſt impertinent Queſtions in the World: And what was particular, there were, beſides the Soldier who guarded me, Sword in Hand, twenty other Perſons in the Room: A peculiar Manner of examining Priſoners of State. As ſoon as the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary let me know, I might retire, I bid the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter tell him, I deſired to ſpeak with the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, and that I expected to be treated as Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Quality are treated throughout all <hi>Europe.</hi> All the Anſwer he vouchſafed me was, that he did not know whether I was ſo or not. Enraged to the utmoſt at this Anſwer, I told him he had very little Skill in Phyſiognomy; and I would gladly have added, that having a better Knowledge of Men than he, I could foretel him that the Gallows would ſoon be his Fate. He had indeed a very hanging Look, and my Prophecy would hardly have been miſpla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. I leave you to judge, whether he did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, at leaſt, that Fate, by his Carriage to me.</p>
               <p>The next Day, I was again obliged to appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Mr. Secretary; who took Care to put it out of my Power, to inſiſt upon being ſeated, by ordering all the Chairs to be conveyed out of the Room. This was ſo far from exciting my Anger, that it put me into a good Humour; and I was very near
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0653500404:278"/>
imitating the Perſon, who for want of a Chair, ſate down upon his Cloak. I no ſooner came into the Room, than the Interpreter read a Paper to me, containing the Examination of the foregoing Day, and I was directed to ſign it. I anſwered I would never ſet my Hand to a Writing, in a Language I did not underſtand. The Reply was, it is the Cuſtom of the Country; if it be ſo, ſaid I, it is a very ſcandalous one; and, indeed, ſuppoſing I had been as criminal as they pretended, it would have been contrary to all Law, to condemn me on ſuch an Evidence. The Secretary inſiſted upon my ſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, I oppoſed it for ſome Time, alledging ſuch Reaſons as might have convinced him of his Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and how little I valued theſe Proceedings: However, at length, ſeeing no other Way to get out of his Clutches, I conſented. I asked him, if he had let the Governour know I deſired to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to his Preſence; he ſaid he had. I likewiſe deſired him, if I was to be detained any Time at <hi>Muſcow,</hi> that he would endeavour to procure me another Priſon, that in which I was, being very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſeeming a Priſoner of State; he ſaid he would ſpeak about it. To conclude, at leaving him, I let him know, I ſhould be very glad to have a Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; to which he replied, it was Time enough for that; an Anſwer worthy of a Secretary of <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> in Return for which, I ought to have ſpit in his Face. The <hi>Muſcovites</hi> are ſtill ſo enraged, that <hi>Peter</hi> the <hi>Great,</hi> obliged them to cut off their Beards, that not daring to have them themſelves, they will o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blige Strangers to let theirs grow. It is, likewiſe, a Cuſtom, that as ſoon as a Man is accuſed of any Crime, he does not touch his Beard afterwards, but affects a ſuppliant Air, to excite Compaſſion in his Judges. Perhaps theſe Gentlemen thought to make me conform to this Cuſtom, and in one Reſpect they had there Will, becauſe I never could get a
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0653500404:279"/>
Barber: But they did not gain ſo much over me, to make me appear before them as a Suppliant.</p>
               <p>I expected I ſhould have been ſent away, that Day, or the next, for <hi>Peterſburg;</hi> but they are rarely ſo expeditious, in <hi>Muſcovy.</hi> They let me paſs the Remainder of the Day, very peaceably, without offering me any Thing to eat. I was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged to provide at my own Expence, and to ſee my ſelf robbed, with Impunity, by thoſe whoſe Care it was to buy my Proviſions. I believe, I have told you already, Sir, that the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> are very great Thieves: But I had almoſt forgot to let you know, that, at my Meals, I was forced to be contented with two Spoons, inſtead of a Knife and Fork. This manner of treating Priſoners in <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> gave me often an Opportunity of jeſting with the Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and thoſe who were about me, tho I underſtood very little of their Language.</p>
               <p>The Governour did not deſire to ſee me till the 27th, and then more out of Curioſity, than any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Motive. When I was introduced to him, he was ſitting with two others, at a great Table, with his Back to the Door, I came in at: And, when I drew near him, he continued ſtill in the ſame Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, being contented with turning his Head, and looking at me over his Shoulder. He immediately or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the <hi>Italian</hi> Interpreter, who was preſent, to aſk me ſeveral Queſtions. As for his two Companions, I could not perceive they ſo much as moved, or once turned their Eyes towards me. Having an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the Governour's Queſtions, I bid the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter tell him, I could hardly believe it was with his Knowledge, I was treated in a Manner ſo little becoming my Quality; that I begged of him he would allot me another Priſon, for that I could have no Reſt where I was, and beſides, was expoſed to be the Scoff of the whole Town. Upon which he ſpoke to the Secretary, but I could not underſtand
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0653500404:280"/>
any thing he ſaid. To diſmiſs me, he at length gave me a gracious Nod; <note n="*" place="bottom">It is plain, our Author had not traveled much among the <hi>Northern</hi> Grandees, who are ſo uſed to treat their Vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals in this Manner, that they are very apt to forget them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and treat others, and ſometimes their Equals, with this familiar Nods. And that not in <hi>Muſcovy</hi> only.</note> But as I did not ſeem to underſtand theſe apiſh Tricks, he was conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, at length, to tell me, by the Mouth of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter, that I muſt retire. And thus ended this formal Appearance, which I was forced to make before the Governour of the Great City of <hi>Muſcow.</hi> I do not doubt but you have ſeen the Play called <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lichin finto Prencipe.</hi> Imagine, you ſee me received much with the ſame Grimaces, as <hi>Harlequin</hi> receives his People with, and that the Diſcourſe which paſſed was not much unlike that of the Illuſtrious Buffoon, I have juſt mentioned. The Farce which followed, did not in the leaſt deviate from the Abſurdity of that which preceeded it. But I muſt give you a Skitch of it.</p>
               <p>The ſame Evening, they carried me to another Priſon; which was a Piece of antient Ruins, that ſerved as a Shelter for thoſe People whoſe Buſineſs it was to break the Ice, and to cleanſe the Streets from Snow and Dirt. In this Priſon was a little Room, which was allotted for me, my Guard of 6 or 7 Soldiers, and 3 or 4 Duſt (or rather Dirt) men, who had already taken Poſſeſſion. This Change, which I was to take as a Favour too, ſurprized me ſtrangely; but my Wonder ſoon ceaſed, when I was informed, that Signor <hi>Harlequin</hi> himſelf had ordered it. I placed my ſelf as conveniently as I could, in a Corner, where, during the whole Time I was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to ſtay there, I was almoſt ſuffocated with Smoke and Heat. While I was in this Dungeon, a little Adventure happened to me, which may make you laugh. One Day, not knowing how to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy my Time, it came into my Head to clean my Teeth: But as I had neglected it a long while, I
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0653500404:281"/>
could not do it without making my Gums bleed. My Guard, the moſt ſtupid of Human Species, were very attentive to what I was doing, but, could not tell what to think of the Operation. After ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving frequently aſked one another what it meant, they, at length, ventured to draw nearer, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine the Inſtruments I made uſe of. As I had ſome Steel-Pens, which probably they took for Launcets, and they ſaw Blood, they endeavoured to hinder me. I laughed at their Stupidity, but I was forced to make a great many Signs, before I could prevail on them to let me go on. One Scene more, and then I ſhall ſhift the Decorations: But, unhappily for me, I ſhall be obliged <hi>induere Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thurnum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The 30th, which, if I miſtake not, is the Feaſt of St. <hi>Andrew;</hi> I had a Viſit again from my Sciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſars Merchant, in Company with another Perſon. They made a long Speech, in which I heard the Names of the Empreſs and the Governour menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned: But all that I could comprehend of it was, that they came to make me a Preſent; however, he who was Chief in the Commiſſion, held it ſo cloſe in his Hand, and kept at ſuch a Diſtance, that it was impoſſible for me to diſtinguiſh what it conſiſted of. At length drawing nearer towards him, I ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly ſeized his Hand, and found a ſingle Ruble in it. Far from vouchſafing to accept of ſuch a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, I only thanked them, and ſaid I never recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Money of any body. One of my Guards ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized to ſee me refuſe ſo conſiderable a Preſent, drew near, and puſhing me pretty roughly, cried, <hi>Take it, Take it, Fool that thou art.</hi> They preſſed me, to accept of it, but finding me obſtinate in my Refuſal, they walked off with their Preſent.</p>
               <p>Could you ever have imagined I ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to the Condition of having a Crown offered me? And do you think it poſſible ſuch a Preſent
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0653500404:282"/>
ſhould be made, to a Perſon of my Birth, in the Name of the Empreſs of <hi>Ruſſia.</hi> It would be ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous to believe this Offer was made me by Order from Her Majeſty, and if it came from the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, I leave you to judge of his Character.</p>
               <p>The 2d of <hi>December,</hi> two Hours before Day, they came to tell me, I muſt riſe, and depart immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. It was to no Purpoſe to conſider; they put me inſtantly into a Sled, without giving me Time to recollect, without any Regard to the Rigour of the Seaſon, and without allowing me to make neceſſary Proviſion for ſuch a Journey. I was guarded by three Raſcals, one of whom called himſelf a Sergeant, and the other two Soldiers, tho they had neither the Habit, nor Arms, nor any Thing elſe, to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh them as ſuch. Before I went out, I asked for my Sword, which had diſappeared, and was told, it was locked up in my Trunk. Do not forget, I beſeech you, this Circumſtance; Becauſe it has ſome Relation to that of the Key of this ſame Trunk, of which I ſhall have Occaſion to ſpeak hereafter.</p>
               <p>As we ſtopped in the <hi>Slaboda,</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">There are two large <hi>Slabodas</hi> or Suburbs without the Mud-Wall which encloſes all the four Towns or Diviſions, that together make the whole City of <hi>Muſcow.</hi> One of theſe is called the <hi>German,</hi> the other the <hi>Strelitz, Slaboda.</hi>
                  </note> I took Care to furniſh my ſelf there, with what was neceſſary, that I ſhould not have found elſewhere. While I was thus employed, one of my Soldiers, who was upon Duty, with a great Scimitar in his Hand, had the Aſſurance to inſult, and talk ſaucily to me. To pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh him for his Inſolence, I immediately wreſted a Stick out of the Hands of the Corporal, and offered to ſtrike him. This Shew of chaſtizing him was ſufficient to make him retreat ten Paces from me, and this Coward was afterwards the moſt humble, and the moſt ſubmiſſive of my Guard. The Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality of the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> ought always to be reproved
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0653500404:283"/>
in this Manner. Shew your Teeth to theſe Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardly Wretches, and you ſoon have them creeping at your Feet.</p>
               <p>When I left <hi>Muſcow,</hi> I was in perfect Health; But, two Days after, I was ſeized with a Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, which I thought would have laid me in the Grave. It was a Sort of a Cholick in the Stomach, attended with intolerable Pain, convulſive Motions, and a continual Propenſity to vomit. You may judge in what a melancholy State I was then in, obliged to travel in a Sled, in the Depth of Winter, and deſtitute of all Relief. The firſt Stage we came at, I had immediate Recourſe to ſome Remedies I carried with me. I had <hi>Venice-Treacle,</hi> ſome <hi>Eau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des Carmes,</hi> and a certain Balſam, which is account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an excellent Remedy, and is diſtributed by the Monks of St. <hi>Juſtin,</hi> to their Friends, All theſe Remedies I applied in a Moment, without the leaſt Succeſs: My Diſtemper continued, with an aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing Violence, and without the leaſt Intermiſſion. From my Stomach, the Pains deſcended into my Bowels, my Convulſions became more violent, and my Retchings to vomit increaſed every Moment. In this ſad Extremity, inſtead of being quite diſpirit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I thought it expedient to double the Doſe of my Medicines, but ſtill without receiving the leaſt Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit by them. After having ſuffered inexpreſſible Torments, for 6 or 7 Hours together, I was ſeized with the moſt burning Thirſt, which obliged me to drink a prodigious Quantity of Water. My Pain continued with the ſame Violence, I had only a ſmall Evacuation downwards.</p>
               <p>The miſerable Condition I was in, did not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der my Guard from propoſing to depart. I was ſorced to ſubmit to my Deſtiny, and throw my ſelf into the Arms of Providence. As I was devoured with Thirſt, I took ſeveral Bottles of Water before my Departure. I was often obliged to ſtop by the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0653500404:284"/>
Way to eaſe Nature, and I always obſerved that my Stools were of divers Colours, and that I voided Blood. To compleat the Misfortune, we had like all to have periſhed, in the moſt melancholy man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in the World. One Night, when we were croſſing the River <hi>Wolkowa,</hi> I ſuddenly heard a loud Voice repeating three Times, <hi>Keep back:</hi> Upon Enquiry what was the Matter, we found, that two Sleds, and 8 Horſes, laden with Money, were juſt fallen in, at the very Place where we were. The Sled, in which my Goods were, run a great Hazard, being the foremoſt of our Train; but fortunately we had all Time to retreat, and afterwards took another Way.</p>
               <p>But to return to my Illneſs; give me leave to make ſome Conjectures on that Head, which to me ſeem but too well grounded, of which, however, I leave you to be the ſole Judge. My intent is to mark out to you the real Cauſe of ſo fatal a Diſtemper; and I firmly believe it to have been the Effect of Poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon given me. I ſhall give you my Reaſons for it, in the Sequel, in the mean Time, I deſire you to give ſome Attention to the following Reflections. Before my Illneſs, I was of a hail robuſt Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and at my Departure from <hi>Muſcow,</hi> I was in a State of perfect Health. I did not know that I ever eat or drunk any Thing, that could be the Cauſe of ſuch Symptoms: Nor is there any more Probability, that any Species of Poiſon ſhould have accidentally been mixed with my Food. I cannot therefore, be perſuaded, but that my Guard, out of an execrable Deſign, themſelves endeavoured to take away my Life by Poiſon.</p>
               <p>In the Night between the 14th and 15th I arrived, in a very piteous Condition, at a large Suburb, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a Quarter of a League's Diſtance from <hi>Peterſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg.</hi> The Houſe where we took our Quarters had neither Eggs, nor any Thing elſe to eat, ſo I was
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0653500404:285"/>
obliged to put up with a Piece of brown Bread, which I found upon the Table. I paſſed the whole Night under great Uneaſineſs, and without any Reſt, my Diſtemper obliging me to get up every Moment.</p>
               <p>Thus ended my painful Journey from <hi>Muſcow</hi> to <hi>Peterſburg;</hi> where I hope to find all the Aſſiſtance I ſtand in need of, and, in a ſhort Time, to ſee all my Misfortunes at an End. Theſe Hopes are ſo powerful, that methinks I am already, in ſome Meaſure, eaſed of my Pain. What is your Opinion of it, Sir, do you believe I ſhall find my ſelf miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken? I muſt confeſs, I do not eſteem <hi>Peterſburg,</hi> as a City of <hi>Muſcovy:</hi> I look upon this Capital as the Reſidence of one of the moſt mighty Monarchs in the whole World, crouded with Foreigners, the greater Part of whom have the Direction of the moſt important Affairs. I expect ſpeedily to be lodged in a Palace, which is oppoſite to that of the Sovereign, and in which the wiſeſt Miniſters aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. I flatter my ſelf with the Hopes of being treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed there in ſuch a Manner, that I ſhall entirely loſe the Remembrance of what is paſt. Depend on it, Sir, I ſhall not delay giving you an Account of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Thing, being perſuaded that you will expect it with the utmoſt Impatience;

               <p>I ſhall begin my Account of this Country by tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling you, that we made our Entry into <hi>Peterſburg</hi> on the 15th of <hi>December,</hi> 1733. A Thaw had made the Roads, at that Time, very deep, and, when we reached the River, which we were to paſs, we were obliged to halt, no one being ſuffered to croſs it: Guards were even placed at all the moſt frequented Paſſes, to obſtruct the Paſſage of Drunkards, which Appellation is generally due to half, and ſometimes to the whole City. After a ſtay of two Hours, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out knowing what my Fate would be, I was ordered to paſs the River, and my Guard ſhewed me on the oppoſite Side a Houſe, called the Senate-Houſe, whither I was to go. I was really aſhamed of the Condition I found my ſelf in, when I ſtepped out of my Sled, and leave you to judge what a Figure I muſt have made after what I had undergone. My Paſſage over this River, ſeemed in Compariſon with the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al I had undergone in croſſing the <hi>Wolga,</hi> only a pleaſant Step, through the Gravel-Walks of a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, or on an Arched Roof. I was no ſooner land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the oppoſite Banks, than the Soldiers, who were poſted there, to ſtop up the Paſſes, preſented their Bayonets, and enjoined me to return from whence I came. But upon the preſſing Inſtances of the Sergeant, who had accompanied me, I was at laſt permitted to paſs.</p>
               <p>They conducted me immediately to the Hall of the Senate-Houſe, which was crowded with Perſons of all Ranks. After having waited ſome Time
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0653500404:288"/>
there, I was led to another little Apartment, where I could hardly ſtand upright, and informed by Signs that I muſt take up my Habitation there. At the Remonſtrance of the Soldiers, who were on Guard, I was however directed to a Chamber, where I found a Score of Clerks, five or ſix Soldiers, and Crowds of other People. No ſooner had I entered this Room, than an Officer pointed to a Corner, and ſaid to me, <hi>There's thy Lodging.</hi> The manner with which he uttered theſe Words, ſhewed he had a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Pleaſure in having an impriſoned Foreigner in his Cuſtody. He asked, whether I had any Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, for, if I had none, I ſhould be ſupplyed with Beer and Bread. If you was in my Caſe, thought I with my ſelf, you would fare very hard.</p>
               <p>Being left to the Cuſtody of a Soldier, who guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me, Sword in Hand, I lay down on my Mattreſs, to take a little Reſt. I was ſo overwhelmed with Grief, that I was hardly capable of reflecting on the Situ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation I was in. Some Slaves brought, at the ſame Time, my Goods, all but my Trunk, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever elſe they thought proper to rob me of. At noon, every one retired, and I was left only with my Guard, who were of the Regiment of <hi>Aſtracan.</hi> Soon after came in the Sergeant, who gave ſome Orders to my Guard, and I perceived I was to be under his Inſpection. I let him know I wanted ſomebody I could ſpeak to, having Occaſion to buy ſome Victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als. He promiſed to grant my Requeſt the next Morning. But as I found, that the People of this Country ſeemed unacquainted with the Proverb, <hi>Venter non patitur dilationem,</hi> I gave Money to one of the Soldiers to fetch me Bread and Wine, which he did. Having ſome Sugar, I made a Toaſt, and ſweetned the Wine, which had been my greateſt Relief during the whole Journey.</p>
               <p>At Day-Break, the next Morning, my Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was again, crowded with Clerks and other Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0653500404:289"/>
The little Corner, where I was ſtreightned for want of Room, was the Anti-Chamber of a Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, who came in, and, having fixed his Eyes on me, in an inſolent Manner, paſſed by without ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luting me. He went into his Office, and returned inſtantly, to order an Officer of the Guards, then preſent, not to ſuffer me to be at the Window, or to go into the Secretary's Office. He kept his Hat on whilſt he gave theſe Orders to the Officer, to whom he ſpoke with an Air of Superiority that ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized me. This Carriage occaſioned me to think, that the Gentlemen, who are at the Head of the <hi>Muſcovite</hi> Troops, are probably ignorant, how they expoſe the Honour of their Regiments by ſubjecting them to the Injunctions of ſuch Wretches.</p>
               <p>I waited, in the mean Time, with great Impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence for the Interpreter, they had promiſed me. I acquainted the Sergeant, who came to ſee me, with my Deſire, and he aſſured me, that he would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ſend me one. I met with the ſame An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to my Demand for a Barber. But, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding theſe repeated Aſſurances, I ſaw neither one nor t'other. The Door of an adjoining Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment being open, and no one there, my Curioſity induced me to go in, but I was ordered to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, and I was obliged to obey. I met with the ſame Order, when I approached a Window, but having little Regard to ſuch Impertinences, I gave them to underſtand, that, if they would hinder me from looking out at the Windows, they muſt wall them up. This Anſwer put a Stop to all further Uneaſineſs on that Head. I paſſed the Night quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enough, but, when I waked, found myſelf benum'd from Head to Foot, and not able to ſtir for ſome Time. This Accident revived the Suſpicion, I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained before, of being poiſoned: Which myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Scene of Iniquity, I ſhall explain to you more at large, in the Sequel: at preſent I muſt inform you of what paſſed at my Levee.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:0653500404:290"/>
I was hardly up, when the Sergeant came into my Chamber, and deſired me to prepare for going out. I was very ſoon ready, and met, at the Bottom of the Stairs, a Secretary, who made Signs to me, to follow him: This Officer was to conduct me to the Empreſs's Palace, ſituate on the other Side of the River. Notwithſtanding that the Ice appeared to me very ſtrong, yet few were willing to paſs over it: But a large Number of Planks were laid upon it which rendered the Paſſage entirely ſafe. When I came to the Palace, I was carried into an Anti-Chamber crowded with People. A Looking-Glaſs, which was in that Apartment, gave me an Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of ſeeing what a Figure I made: But I was highly mortified to find my ſelf ſo nearly reſembling a Savage. Another Object, which, at the ſame Time, offered itſelf to my View, ſoon diſpelled this little Uneaſineſs. I ſaw, the Sergeant, who had guarded me from <hi>Moſcow</hi> to <hi>Peterſburg,</hi> in a much worſe Condition than my ſelf. One would have thought this poor Wretch juſt come from the Rack. I beg, Sir, you would not forget this Circumſtance, which I ſhall have Occaſion to remind you of in the Sequel.</p>
               <p>Whilſt my Mind was employed in forming Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures about what might have happened to my Sergeant, I was ſent for to a ſmall Apartment, where I ſaw two Lords ſitting at a Table, and at ſome Diſtance another Perſon likewiſe ſitting, on a low Stool. The former were the two Prime-Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of her <hi>Czarian</hi> Majeſty; the one a Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigner, and the other a <hi>Muſcovite;</hi> and the third, who ſat at ſome Diſtance, was the Attorney-Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral. I drew near to the Table as well as my Legs would let me; for they were ſcarce in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to obey my Orders; <hi>Sed vires animus dabat.</hi> The Foreign Miniſter, who is a Man of a noble Appearance, broke Silence, and asked me in <hi>French,</hi>
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:0653500404:291"/>
who I was. I acquainted him with my Name, and told him, at the ſame Time, how much I was aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to appear before him in ſo mean a Condition. He then asked ſome other inſignificant Queſtions, to which I anſwered as well as I could. An Abſtract of theſe Interrogations, you will find in a Memorial, which I ſhall take Care to ſend you.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Muſcovite</hi> Miniſter kept a profound Silence during the Converſation, I had with the other, and did not ſo much as lift up his Eyes. He is a Man of an enormous Size, and wore a Peruke with a Bag, as remarkably ſmall. The comical Figure, this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minutive Peruke made on the Head of ſo big a Man, was ſuch, that on any other Occaſion I ſhould una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidibly have burſt out into Laughter, and might juſtly have applyed to him theſe Words, <hi>Atque ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>percilio brevior comoe.</hi> As for the Attorney-General, his Function ſeemed to be no other, than that of hearing what was ſaid. The Prime-Miniſter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, in the mean Time, to examine me, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired into the Motives, that induced me to leave <hi>France.</hi> I anſwered that it was to avoid a Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, which I ſhould have been obliged to contract, had I made any longer Stay in that Country. To this he anſwered, that I muſt ſurely be more ſcrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous than People generally are in <hi>France,</hi> adding, theſe very Words: <hi>Sir, you might have married the Perſon, you ſpeak of, and need not have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute of Means to rid your ſelf of her afterwards.</hi> Notwithſtanding my extream Weakneſs, at theſe Words, I retreated a Step or two backwards, &amp; <hi>hic vires indignatio dedit.</hi> He recollected himſelf, when he ſaw the Surprize I was in, and endeavoured to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain his Meaning. He told me, that I might have been divorced from this Wife in a legal Way, very common, eſpecially in <hi>France,</hi> and added ſeveral other Circumſtances, all tending to illuſtrate what he had before ſaid. I ſhould be glad to know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0653500404:292"/>
he would have adviſed me to hang my ſelf, in hopes of ſomebody's coming to cut me down?</p>
               <p>After he had made ſome farther Enquiry into my Affairs, to which I replyed in few Words, I was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to go out, and wait in the Anti-Chamber. As, in my Examination, I had mentioned the Son of Count <hi>de Munich,</hi> who I thought might know me, having ſeen me in foreign Countries, it was thought proper to ſend for him, and, when he came, he was placed behind a Door, through which he took a View of me. A very neceſſary Caution certainly! What Harm would it have been, if they had let him come nearer, that he might have ſeen and ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to me? It would have been much more eaſy to him to have known me, in the Condition I was then in, by my Voice, than by my doleful Aſpect. My Beard was, at that Time, of two Months Growth, I had a Peruke on, combed in the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Faſhion, and a very ragged Cloak. Count <hi>de Munich</hi>'s Son had to be ſure never ſeen me in ſuch an Equipage, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently could not be ſuppoſed to know me. After they had got what Information they thought neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, the ſame Miniſter, who had all along diſcourſed with me, drew nearer, and asked the Name of the Perſon, who had been the Cauſe of all my Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes. This Queſtion highly ſurprized me, and I wonder I had not anſwered, <hi>Et oſi di viltà tentare Argante?</hi> I was, however, contented with reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, with a diſdainful Smile, that I could not believe he expected I ſhould anſwer him. That he could not be ignorant of the Reſpect due to the Sex, though they often might not deſerve it. I thought proper, before I retired, to beg he would take Notice of my infirm State of Health, after ſo tedious a Sickneſs, and of the ſtrange Uſage I had met with from the firſt Day of my Impriſonment. He gave me no other Anſwer, than this: <hi>It is your own Fault, Sir, we ſhall proceed as favourably as we can.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:0653500404:293"/>
Reflect, I beſeech you, on this whole Procedure. But in order to inform you rightly of the State of Things, it will be neceſſary to acquaint you with what I could learn of the <hi>Muſcovite</hi> Miniſtry. It is certain, that all the grand Affairs tranſacted at preſent at the Court of <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> are under the Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Miniſters who are Foreigners, and though out of Decency, they are likewiſe communicated to two or three Natives of the Country, it is, nevertheleſs, beyond all Doubt, that the Power is only in the Hands of the Former. And they are ſo jealous of their Authority, and know ſo well how to ſupport one another, that the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> are only looked on as Subalterns, who dare not undertake any Thing, without their previous Advice and Conſent. In all Conſultations that Miniſter who examined me, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides: But tho he has a great Share in the Deciſion of important Matters, yet, I believe it does not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertain ſolely to him. The others are Lords of the Court, who aſſiſt at Councils, Conferences, Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of foreign Miniſters, and are conſulted in all Concerns which are of any Moment. As the <hi>Muſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites</hi> are naturally ſuſpicious, diffident, and imagine, that there is not a Perſon in the World whoſe Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity can be relied on, there is always ſome Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeer every where, which is the Reaſon that even thoſe Things, which require the utmoſt Secrecy, are treated of in the Preſence of ſeveral Perſons. How far this is advantageous or prejudicial to the State, is not my Province to determine. All I know is, that the wiſeſt Man in <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> tho never ſo well inclined to ſerve his Country, would find it difficult to ſucceed in any Attempt, becauſe the continual Suſpicions and Diffidence he would meet with, with Regard to himſelf, muſt diſcourage him, and make him loſe that Freedom of Mind and Sentiments, which is ſo neceſſary to terminate Affairs, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a ready Execution.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:0653500404:294"/>
Let me now inform you of what I have learned of the ſecond Claſs of Miniſters, who are the Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors. The Senate conſiſts of <hi>Muſcovite</hi> Noblemen of the firſt Rank, and ſuch, as paſs for Men of a great Genius, and thorough Knowledge of Buſineſs. Among theſe there are ſome, who have ſerved the State, in the Quality of Ambaſſadors to foreign Courts, others, who have been Generals in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and ſome, who have travelled through a great Part of <hi>Europe.</hi> I cannot inform you of the exact Number of the Senators, but am aſſured from good Hands, it is but ſmall. I know ſix or ſeven of them, with whom I have had ſome Concerns. They have a great Number of Secretaries, who are the moſt ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, the moſt inſolent, and at the ſame Time, the moſt preſumptuous Animals, the Earth ever bore. Theſe have under their Command a prodigious Troop of Clerks, who ſeem to be always employed. Add to this the Multitude of petty Officers, who go, indeed, by the Name of Soldiers, but may be pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced among the loweſt Dregs of the Vulgar, and are the very Scum of the People. Of all theſe conſiſts that Auguſt Aſſembly called the Senate. As for the reſpective Functions of each of theſe Officers, they themſelves are frequently ſo ignorant of them, that it is no Wonder if a Stranger is ſo. All I can ſay, on that Head, is, that they generally meet four or five Hours a Day, that they take a great deal of Pains themſelves, and give no leſs to others, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out advancing the Intereſts of the State. The Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom of this Nation, of deferring every Thing to the Morrow, is the Occaſion that moſt Affairs are not terminated, till after many Delays. This Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſneſs is a natural Conſequence of the mutual Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſts they entertain of each other; for as they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not venture to deliver their Opinions with an entire Freedom, they are often neceſſitated to defer the moſt urgent Affairs to another Time. The Door of
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0653500404:295"/>
this illuſtrious <hi>Areopagus</hi> might be properly adorned with the following Device:
<q>
                     <l>Hic operoſe nihil agitur.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>But this is not all. There is a third Order of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, if they may be allowed that Denomination, who compoſe what they call the Colleges; theſe Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges are divided into different Claſſes. There is the College of War, that of Foreign Affairs, thoſe of Finances and Commerce, and ſeveral others. As I have had nothing to do with theſe Gentlemen, I can hardly give you any Account of their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Functions. I am nevertheleſs pretty confidently aſſured, that all the Members of theſe Bodies, as well that of the Senate, as thoſe, who compoſe the Colleges, are only regarded as bare Commiſſioners or Deputies under the Influence of the Miniſters, who are Foreigners, and are eſteemed their Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. Nothing can be done without previouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting, or receiving the Orders of theſe, and all the others live in the moſt ſervile Fear and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection. The Governours of Provinces dare hardly ever undertake any Thing of their own Accord, and are even ignorant, how far their Authority and Juriſdiction extends. Their natural Timidity, and the entire Dependance, they are always kept in, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion even Trifles to paſs with them for Matters of the greateſt Importance.</p>
               <p>This in a few Words, is what I have been able to learn of the Form of Government eſtabliſhed in <hi>Muſcovy.</hi> I thought it neceſſary to give you this Abſtract,
<q>
                     <l>Per quae poſſis, cognoſcere caetera tuté.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The Fate of the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> would deſerve our Pity, had they any generous Paſſions, or any Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:0653500404:296"/>
at Heart. In proceſs of Time they may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ſhake off the Yoke, impoſed on them by Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners, and then, perhaps, we may ſee <hi>Muſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vian</hi> Veſpers, as we have formerly ſeen <hi>Sicilian</hi> Veſpers. Their Hatred of Foreigners is ſo great, that, in this Caſe, hardly one would eſcape with Life. It would be the more eaſy to execute an Enterprize of this Kind, as the Authority Foreign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers have aſſumed, is only founded on a ſlaviſh Fear, into which the whole Nation is immerged.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Peter</hi> I. who uſed his utmoſt Endeavours to draw his Subjects out of Barbarity, having, in his Travels in <hi>France,</hi> at the Time of the Regency, made Enquiries into the then Form of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, framed, and, in Part, executed the Project of regulating his own after that Model. He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, by eſtabliſhing ſo many Councils, to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy, in the Adminiſtration, all thoſe of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, who ſhould be moſt capable of it, that in Time, they might render themſelves uſeful to their Prince and Country. I know not what Idea to frame of ſuch a Form of Government, which ſeems not the moſt ſuitable to ſo deſpotick a State, as that of <hi>Muſcovy:</hi> It will, I fear, in Time, produce many Diſorders, and inſenſibly tinge the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monalty with <hi>Republican</hi> Principles.</p>
               <p>We have already ſeen the Seeds of ſuch Notions at the Death of <hi>Peter</hi> II; for a Motion was then made to form the Government into a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth. If this Project had taken Place, we ſhould have ſeen a Plan of Government very diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from that of <hi>Plato,</hi> A <hi>Muſcovian</hi> Republick! It would, without doubt, have been a Maſter-Piece! But was <hi>Peter.</hi> the <hi>Great,</hi> with all his fine Schemes and Eſtabliſhments, ſufficiently acquainted with the Genius of his Subjects? I have great Room to doubt it, and this is my Reaſon There is not to this Day a ſingle <hi>Muſcovite,</hi> who is not
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0653500404:297"/>
betrer pleaſed with his Village, and his Oven, than with the moſt eminent Poſt of Honour. They would have been better pleas'd, if <hi>Peter</hi> the Great, inſtead of attempting to change Beaſts, as they were, into Men, had, on the contrary, labour'd, to reduce them from a State of Humanity to that of Brutes. All the Pains that Prince took have hardly had any Effect on his Subjects, farther than the curtailing their Beards, and a Change of their Habits. Their favourite Idols are Fire and Lazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to which they are ready to ſacrifice their All. But I have ſaid enough on this Article, and ſhall now reſume the Account of my own Adventures.</p>
               <p>At my Return to my Priſon, the Sergeant, who accompany'd me thither, offer'd me half a Ruble, to furniſh my ſelf (as he ſaid) with ſome Proviſions. I told him, I had no Occaſion for his Money, and begg'd he would rather ſend me an Interpreter, and a Barber. He left me, but I could not obtain what I ask'd for. I wiſh'd for nothing ſo much, in the Condition I was then in, as to conſult ſome Phyſician, and to be lodg'd in a more commodious Priſon, where I might enjoy that Repoſe and Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility, I ſtood in ſo great need of. As my Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper continued, I begun to fear ſome fatal Event. Though I was eaſed of the moſt virulent Pains, and ſtrove to ſupport Nature with the beſt Diet I could; yet I was ſtill very weak. I had entirely loſt two of my Senſes, Taſte and Smell. A Thirſt, which nothing could allay, prey'd upon me inceſſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. All theſe Symptoms did not put me under any Apprehenſions of my Life; but I was afflicted with others ſtill more grievous. A general Numb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſeized all my Limbs after Sleep, and when I awaked I found my ſelf depriv'd of all Motion. My Head was then troubled with an uncommon Heavineſs. My Sight likewiſe underwent a great Change, for all Objects appeared to me double.
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0653500404:298"/>
Theſe Symptoms diſappeared inſenſibly after I had lain ſome Time in that deplorable Condition, but then a kind of Reſtleſſneſs enſued, for which I could not aſſign any Cauſe. I applied, from Time to Time, my own Medicines, but tho I am well aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, that 'tis to them I owe my Life, yet could I not perceive, that they produced any viſible Effect.</p>
               <p>As I conſtantly reiterated my Entreaties for an Interpreter, a young Man was at laſt brought to me, who ſpoke <hi>French,</hi> and was accompanied by the Sergeant, and an Overſeer, which they always think requiſite in the like Caſes. As it was my Deſign, that he ſhould give a faithful Account of what I had to ſay to him, I deſired him to take it down in Writing, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                  <q rend="inline margQuotes">"That no one might have Cauſe to cenſure my Conduct, I declared, that, when Money was offer'd me, of which I ſhould be aſhamed to ſpecify the Value I did not think fit to accept of it, not knowing from whoſe Hands it came, and being beſides aſſured, that Her Majeſty would never offer me a Preſent, ſo little agreable to Her great Generoſity. I doubted not, but that, if Her Majeſty would be pleaſed to iſſue Her Orders, to procure me the Suſtenance I ſtood in Need of, it would be in a Manner, ſuitable to her Dignity, and my Birth; but ſhould it be ſignified to me, that whatever was offered was by Her Order, I ſhould always receive it with the greateſt Deference. All the Aſſiſtance, which Her Majeſty might, in the mean Time, vouchſafe to lend me, would be of little Service to me, unleſs I was removed from the Priſon, where I was, as I could not enjoy any Reſt there, either by Day, or by Night, and unleſs I was, in the mean while, ſupplied with what was requiſite for the Recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of my Health, which at that time was in ſo dangerous a Situation, that I run the Hazard of
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0653500404:299"/>
ſinking very ſoon under the Weight of my Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries. Should theſe Precautions on my Behalf be neglected, Her Majeſty would loſe an Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of puniſhing me, if I were a Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal; or, on the other Hand, if my Innocence were proved, ſhe would have the Regret of ſeeing a Man periſh miſerably under her Eyes, who came into her Dominions with no other View, but of devoting the Reſt of his Days to her Service. To conclude, there was nothing I ſaid, but what I had Room to hope from Her Majeſty's Juſtice and Clemency."</q>
               </p>
               <p>In this Memorandum I likewiſe particulariſed all thoſe Things, which I ſtood abſolutely in Need of, <hi>viz.</hi> another Priſon, a Phyſician, my Trunk, and a Perſon, who might, on all Occaſions, ſerve me as an Interpreter. My Clerk promiſed to give a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Account of all, I had dictated to him. I aſked, why they would not ſuffer me to be ſhaved, to which he replied, that they feared, I might make an Attempt upon my own Life.</p>
               <p>My Memorandum had no farther Succeſs, but to procure the Change of my Priſon three Days afterwards, when I was removed into the Secreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry's Apartment, who was obliged to ſhift his Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, this new Lodging gave me a little more Eaſe, tho ſome Clerk or other was every Day running in and out for Papers, which had been left there. But, on the other Hand, I was tormented with a vaſt Number of every Kind of Inſects that commonly frequent the moſt odious and filthy Places. I had every Moment the Company of huge Rats, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed whatever I could procure for myſelf; and all the Furniture I had in this Secretary's Office, which I might juſtly call a Neſt of Rats, was two Chairs and a Table, without a Carpet.</p>
               <p>This Change of Priſon did not therefore, afford me the leaſt Relief. My Sickneſs encreaſed daily, and I
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:0653500404:300"/>
ſaw no Hopes of any Succour. I remember, the 24th, which was <hi>Chriſtmas-Eve,</hi> being extreamly ill in my Bed, the Sergeant brought me a very large Gooſe and a Fowl, and gave me to underſtand, that this Preſent was ſent me by Her Imperial Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty. I anſwered, that the Condition I was then in required other Succour, and deſired him to ſend me, with all Speed, a Phyſician, and take his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent back with him. But he left it, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all I could ſay, and retired. I gave them to my Guard, to diſpoſe of as they thought fit, and make themſelves merry but I found they durſt not touch them. The ſame Officer returned the next Morning, and made a great Buſtle, becauſe they had let thoſe Proviſions be ſpoiled, inſtead of carrying them away. I thought this a proper Time to make lively Expoſtulations with him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout my Trunk, where all my Linnen was, which I ſtood the more in Need of, as I was eat up with Vermin. He took little Notice of what I ſaid, but walk'd off with the Gooſe and Fowl.</p>
               <p>The Refuſal of my Trunk, which I had ſo long and ſo preſſingly deſired, was not without ſome Cauſe. Several Circumſtances made me ſuſpect, that they had robbed me of Part of what it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, and ſtrove now to conceal it. Theft is well known to be ſo common in <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> that no one is aſhamed of it. Great and Small, Men and Women, lay hold, without any Scruple, of the Property of another, wherever they meet with it. Hence it is, that People are always upon their Guard, and live in this Country in a continual Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of each other. <hi>Peter</hi> I. was wont to ſay, that if he was to hang all the Thieves in his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, he ſhould be deſtitute of Subjects. My Suſpicions were ſtill farther grounded, by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the Key of my Trunk at <hi>Muſcow,</hi> and by my ſeeing the Sergeant, who had conducted me
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0653500404:301"/>
into the <hi>Czarina</hi>'s Palace, where he appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed like a Criminal, on whom Sentence was juſt going to be pronounced. Theſe ſeveral Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations induced me to believe, that I had been robbed, and that, to conceal the Fact, and avoid the Hands of Juſtice, they had attempted to poiſon me. Their Proceedings, in Regard to me, in the Sequel, will give you very ſtrong Proofs of what I here advance.</p>
               <p>You will, without doubt, be ſhocked at the Peruſal of theſe Circumſtances of my Adventures. Had not my Courage ſupported me in the dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Condition I was in, I muſt have inevitably pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed. I ſhould a thouſand Times have ſunk un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Load of my Calamities, had I not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved a perfect Peace of Mind amidſt my great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Diſtreſſes. I perceived my ſelf often at the Point of Death, deſtitute of all Relief, and of all Hopes of receiving any. Nothing afflicted me more than the Reflection of being ſacrific'd, as I was, to the Fury and unjuſt Reſentments of a Savage Nation, which, having not the leaſt Senſe of Humanity, treated me as the moſt abject of Slaves. Nevertheleſs, in the midſt of theſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexities, <hi>Neque ullam vocem protuli indignam viro, neque cedentem calamitati.</hi> I leave you to judge, after having weighed theſe Circumſtances, what Idea the World ought to form of this Nation, which at preſent makes ſo much Noiſe in <hi>Europe,</hi> whoſe Alliance is ſo earneſtly ſought for, and which claims a Right to the Diſpoſal of Kiugdoms. <hi>Spes improbiſſimas complectuntur inſperata aſſecuti.</hi>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> muſt not omit begging your Excuſe for the abrupt Manner, with which I conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded my laſt. My Head was at that Time filled with ſuch melancholy Ideas, and my Heart perplexed with Motions ſo extraordinary, that I fancied my Hand was growing heavy, and my Ink appeared more black, than it really was. Theſe Symptoms made me reſolve upon taking ſome Repoſe; for, whatever I write to you, ſhall, as far as poſſible, be the Product of a Mind at Eaſe, and by no Means of an impetuous Imagination. Not that I am fearful of being too ſevere in my Cenſures of the <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> who certainly deſerve no Mercy; But as I engaged in this Correſpondence, with no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther View, than that of ſatisfying your Curioſity, I am not ſo much intent on ſeeking Revenge for the Injuries, done me by that Nation, as on informing you of what you deſire to know of my Adventures. To continue my Narrative of them, I muſt, therefore, tell you, that, after I had been left to ſtruggle with Death, for the Space of ten Days, a Phyſician, was, at laſt, brought me by the Sergeant and an Overſeer. This Phyſician happened unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately to ſpeak nothing but <hi>Latin;</hi> which gave me a great deal of Uneaſineſs; For, though I am pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty well verſed in that Language, yet I found it diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to expreſs my Thoughts, as I had never made made Uſe of it in familiar Diſcourſe. I therefore immediately told my Phyſician, that ſince I ſhould hardly be able to give him the true Grounds of my
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:0653500404:303"/>
Diſeaſe, I had Cauſe to fear he might not apply proper Medicines, nor give me that Aſſiſtance, I ſtood in Need of. He replyed by this Axiom, which he faid, was unqueſtionable: <hi>Omnes Captivi infirmitatibus laborant;</hi> this unpromiſing Beginning exaſperated me, &amp; <hi>indignatio dedit Linguam.</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered him in as Philoſophical Manner, <hi>Non doleo de captivitate, ſed de modo captivitatis.</hi> I continued my Harangue in the ſame Tone, but in a <hi>Latin</hi> Idi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>om, as barbarous as the Country I was in. The Doctor, however, not thinking me perhaps ſo tracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as blindly to ſubmit to his Preſcriptions, thought fit to retire: And this was all the Benefit I received from his Viſit!</p>
               <p>An Accident happened ſome Time after, which contributed not a little to confirm the Suſpicions I had of my having been poiſoned. But give me leave to put you in mind of the following Circumſtances, before I inform you of what paſſed. Firſt, the Key of my Trunk, which was demanded, and I was forced to ſurrender at <hi>Muſcow:</hi> In the ſecond Place, my Sword, which was likewiſe taken from me at <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cow,</hi> and locked up, in the Trunk; and laſtly, my Trunk itſelf, which had been detained from the 15th of <hi>December,</hi> the Day of my Arrival at <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terſburg,</hi> 'till the 11th of <hi>January</hi> 1734. My Trunk was that Day brought into my Priſon, guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſeveral petty Officers, a Secretary, ſome Clerks and an Overſeer. The Secretary having firſt ſaluted me with a ſmiling Countenance, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Key of the Trunk. I anſwered, that I had the ſame Demand upon him. Seemingly ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized at this Anſwer, he ſpoke to thoſe who were preſent, as if he was enquiring what was become of the Key.</p>
               <p>Several Queſtions and Anſwers enſued, which tended only to delude and blind me, till at laſt the Key appeared. They begun then, by unlocking
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:0653500404:304"/>
the Padlock, but as it was ſealed, one of the Clerks addreſſing himſelf to the Secretary, and, by his Looks, expreſſing his Surprize, ſaid: <hi>Sir, here are two Seals. Yes,</hi> replied the Secretary, the better to conceal his Villany, <hi>there are two, one of Caſan, and the other of Muſcow.</hi> The Trunk was at laſt opened, where I found every Thing in Diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. I took out my Piſtols and my Sword, which could not be there, but by a very great Miracle, as they muſt have been put in, without taking off the Seal of <hi>Caſan.</hi> I told the Secretary, that my Arms were uſeleſs to a Priſoner, and would have put them into his Hands: But he anſwered, they muſt be left in the Trunk, which he would ſhut himſelf. It ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to me ſomewhat extraordinary, that I ſhould be debarred the Uſe of my Cloaths; for all I could obtain was three or four Shirts, which I ſtood in great need of. They even refuſed me, with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Barbarity, ſome <hi>Eau des Carmes,</hi> and other Medicines. The Secretary having firſt locked the Trunk, aſſured me, that I ſhould be ſupplied with common Neceſſaries, by Orderm and at the Expence of her Majeſty, and then retired.</p>
               <p>Theſe Circumſtances duly weighed, it will be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy to determine, whether I was really poiſoned or not? I ſhould even be glad, if, on this Subject, you would conſult all the Phyſicians and natural Philoſophers of your Acquaintance, who will not, in a caſe ſo ſingular, refuſe to give you their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. For my Part, I ſhould be glad to have my Suſpicions removed, by a Demonſtration, that my Diſeaſe could be the Effect of any other Cauſe than Poiſon; but beg, you would firſt maturely and leiſurely conſider the following Circumſtances.</p>
               <p>In my laſt, you may remember, I obſerved, that the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> are very prone to Theft, and that it is a Vice common to the whole Nation. Hence I may infer the Probability of their embracing the firſt
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:0653500404:305"/>
Opportuni y that offered of robbing me. That this Conjecture comes nearly up to Truth, is but too e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident, by the Key of my Trunk, being taken from me at <hi>Muſcow.</hi> And I may reaſonably ask, what Occaſion there was to ſearch my Trunk at all? It had already been looked into at <hi>Caſan,</hi> and was, beſides, cloſely ſealed. Had Curioſity been their ſole Inducemen ſor viewing my Effects, they might have gratified it in my Preſence. But there are ſtill other Circumſtances. My Trunk was ſeized, on my Arrival at <hi>Peerſburg,</hi> without any apparent Cauſe, and the Sergeant, who had brought me thither, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared at the <hi>Czarina</hi>'s Palace, in the Poſture of a Criminal. In Order to account for this Perſon's Fate, you muſt know, that my Trunk was opened, as ſoon as it was brought to <hi>Peterſburg,</hi> and that, after having compared the Contents with the Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory ſent from <hi>Caſan,</hi> Part of the Things, ſpecified in the laſt, was ſound to be wanting. The Serge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant was immediately ſuppoſed to be the Thief, or at leaſt an Accomplice in the Robbery. The Trunk was, therefore, to be detained, till the Deficiency could be repaired, and ſome one be inſtantly diſpatched to Muſcow to recover what was ſtolen. It is certain, the Sergeant himſelf was directly ſent back thither: For when, ſome Days after my Arrival at <hi>Peterſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg,</hi> I asked, what was become of my Sled, they anſwered, the Sergeant had taken it to return to <hi>Muſcow.</hi> In ſhort, my Trunk was not returned to me, till the 11th of <hi>January,</hi> twenty-ſeven Days after my Arrival at <hi>Peterſburg;</hi> a Time, ſufficient to go to <hi>Muſcow,</hi> to diſcharge the Commiſſion, which the Sergeant was entruſted with, and to return to <hi>Peterſburg.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe are, beyond all Contradiction, Probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, which, on many Occaſions, might paſs for evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Proofs; but let us examine the Affair yet far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, The Secretary demanded the Key of my
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:0653500404:306"/>
Trunk, when it was brought to me, and endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to perſuade me, that it had been likewiſe ſealed at <hi>Caſan,</hi> in order to inſinuate, that it had not been opened ſince. Could any Thing be more ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, than to imagine, I had ſuch a Stock of Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity, as to be perſuaded, that they had neglected a thorough View of all my Effects? They were too deſirous of knowing, who I was, and of finding ſome Pretence, whereby to juſtify their Proceedings with Regard to me, to omit ſuch a Search. I ſhould likewiſe be glad to know, what they can al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in Reſpect to my Sword, which the Officer of the Guards at <hi>Caſan</hi> ſeemed ſo much pleaſed with, which I wore till I reached <hi>Muſcow,</hi> and which at length I found in my Trunk, though they pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it had not been opened either at <hi>Muſcow</hi> or at <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terſburg.</hi> I am certainly highly obliged to the <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covites,</hi> if they have found out the Secret of imparting to my Sword ſome of thoſe Qualities, attributed to the Thunder-Bolt, eſpecially that of penetrating the moſt ſolid Bodies, without leaving the leaſt Mark; for then I ſhall hereafter be armed as powerfully as <hi>Jove</hi> himſelf. What could, in fine, induce them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe me my Cloaths, and to ſhut the Trunk ſo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptly, without giving me Time to examine what was in it? I ſhould not, I believe, deviate very far from the Truth, were I to ſay that they proceeded in this unaccountable Manner, the better to conceal the Robbery, they had committed on the greateſt Part of my Equipage, the Want of which I was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to bear with during the whole Time of my Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity. As I have now averred the Theft, I ſhall find it more eaſy to prove, that I was poiſoned. You may perhaps ask, who were the Authors of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Villany? For your Satisfaction, let it ſuffice, that I put you in Mind of my having caſt the Nativity of the Secretary of <hi>Muſcow,</hi> when the Humour took me to tell him, that the Gallows would ſoon be his Fate.
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:0653500404:307"/>
And in Reality the whole Matter muſt fall upon that Secretary, and his Accomplices.</p>
               <p>My Sickneſs became in the mean while ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream, and I was reduced to ſo feeble a State, that my Guard were obliged to carry me, whenever I had occaſion to eaſe Nature. I was again afflicted with a Cholick, accompanied with Pains, ſo vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, that I almoſt begun to fear I had been poiſoned a ſecond Time. This new Paroxiſm was however, of a ſhort Duration, it left me inſenſibly, and I found my ſelf in better Health, than I had been before. The inceſſant Requeſts, I had long made, for a Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, were at laſt complied with. He was accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied by the ſame Clerk, who had played his Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger-de-main Tricks with the two Seals, at the opening of my Trunk. The Doctor, who ſpoke good <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian,</hi> immediately enquired into the Nature of my Diſtemper. I told him, that to give him a true Idea of it, I could not avoid entring into ſeveral Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, which would neceſſarily require his Attention. After having given him an Account of my Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, I acquainted him what befel me at my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture from <hi>Muſcow.</hi> My Phyſician was every Moment interrupted by the Clerk who was preſent, and, as he had Orders to write down this whole Conſultation, was teazing him to know what I ſaid; he even deſired us, in preſſing Terms, to haſten to a Concluſion. The Phyſician, who had his Inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſeemed to give Way to the Secretary's Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and before he had Time to inform himſelf of my Diſeaſe, adviſed me to take a Vomit, and to be blooded. To this I anſwered, that I could not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail upon my ſelf to follow the Advice which he gave me, without informing himſelf of my Diſeaſe: That as for the Emetick, I was reſolved not to take it; and, though I might hope for ſome Relief from Bleeding, yet I could not with any Probability ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect a Surgeon, ſince they had refuſed to ſend me a
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:0653500404:308"/>
Barber, leſt I ſhould make away with my ſelf. I then informed him of the Treatment I had met with, but all the Anſwer, he made me was, that I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to the Cuſtoms of the Country. The Clerk, likewiſe, thought fit to give me his Advice, and ſaid, that Grief being my Diſeaſe, I muſt wait my Remedy from Time and Circumſtances. This ſtung me to the quick, and put me in Mind of my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Phyſician's Axiom. To convince him of this Miſtake, I told him, in theſe very Terms: <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Sir, my Mind has no Share in the doleful Condition I am reduced to, and give me leave to tell you, that a Man, tho a Priſoner, may enjoy a perfect Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Mind. But the Caſe is this, you have neither Orders nor Leiſure to hear me ſpeak, and ſeem but little inclined to give me that Aſſiſtance, I ſtand ſo much in Need of; therefore, not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain you any longer, you are at Liberty to be gone. All the Favour I ask of you is, to tell thoſe Gentlemen, who ſent you, that a Patient is not relieved by the bare Sight of a Phyſician, and that no Remedy ought to be preſcribed to me, till I am allowed to tell my Caſe. Your Viſits will be always agreeable, and may prove highly beneficial to me, if you have ſo much Influence as to procure me that Permiſſion; but if it be thought improper to grant me that Favour, to give your ſelf any farther Trouble, ſeems to me entirely needleſs."</q> Whether my Phyſician was pleaſed with this Compliment I know not; but the contrary ſeems moſt probable, for he inſtantly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired, and gave himſelf no farther Trouble about me.</p>
               <p>I continued to fare very hard, notwithſtanding the repeated Promiſes made me, ſeveral Days together, that I ſhould be maintained by the Order, and at the Expence, of Her Imperial Majeſty, and I ſaw no ſigns of any thing being ſent me by that Princeſs.
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:0653500404:309"/>
The Matter was, I ſuppoſe, deemed ſo very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant, that it required a Reſpite, till the Morrow. This Rule is generally obſerved by the <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> when the Point in Debate relates to Disburſements: And they are certainly right; for Money is not ſo ſcarce, in any other Country in the World. An Interpreter, at laſt appeared, after I had long wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for him, accompanied by two or three Perſons, who came to tell me, he had Orders to provide for my Suſtenance. I expreſſed my Satisfaction at this News, and told him, the ſooner the better. But how replied he, do you expect to be ſerved? How ſaid I? Juſt as you think fit, provided it be not after the <hi>Muſcovian</hi> Manner, for their Ragoos I am not accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed to. He then conſulted with thoſe, who were preſent, and ſaid, that I might have Money allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me, and asked how much would do? This Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion made me laugh, and I deſired to know, in my turn, if he took me for a Perſon that would accept of Money. I ordered him to tell his Maſters, that I ſhould always, with the utmoſt Deference and Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, accept of whatever ſhould be offered me by Her Majeſty's Order. This Reply gave Occaſion to a freſh Conſultation, which being ended, this weighty Affair was put off to the Morrow.</p>
               <p>The Neceſſity I lay under of making my Caſe known to ſome able Phyſician, put me upon writing an exact Relation of all that had happened to me, to ſend it to Monſ. <hi>du Vernoi,</hi> Anatomy-Profeſſor. You may remember the Character I have already given you of him. He is a Man of Merit, and one to whom I am greatly obliged. At the ſame Time, I wrote a ſhort Memorial to the Empreſs, wherein I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of the Manner in which I was treated. I was told, they ſhould both be ſafely delivered; but as neither of them produced the Effect I hoped, they probably were both ſuppreſſed. I was even treated with more Severity than before; for after this, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:0653500404:310"/>
all my Remonſtrances, I never could obtain either Phyſician or Interpreter, either Pen and Ink, or my Cloaths.</p>
               <p>That theſe Gentlemen acted, with the utmoſt Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, with Regard to me, is moſt certain; and yet they may have had their Motives to palliate thoſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings. In order to unfold this Myſtery, I muſt put you in Mind of the Hatred, which the <hi>Muſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites</hi> bear to all Strangers who are any Expence to them. This undoubted Truth is one of the Motives, which induce me to believe, that the Gentlemen in the Adminiſtration at <hi>Muſcow,</hi> were reſolved upon my Perdition at any Rate. And indeed, what Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity could there be to detain me in that City eight or ten Days? Why was I, at my Arrival at <hi>Peterſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg,</hi> refuſed the immediate Benefit of a Phyſician, ſince there are ſo many of the Profeſſion in that Place? At laſt indeed they ſent me one, but he ſpoke <hi>Latin</hi> only, and the Converſation I had with him, was, beſides, ſo very ſhort, that he could not poſſibly be informed of my Caſe, nor apply proper Remedies. As they knew I was an <hi>Italian,</hi> and there are three or four Phyſicians of that Nation in the Town, why was I not permitted to ſpeak to one of them? They very well knew, I was converſant in the <hi>French</hi> Tongue, why was not ſome one of that Nation ſuffered to come to me? The ſecond Phyſician ſpoke, I confeſs, the <hi>Italian</hi> Tongue ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well; but the Orders, which were given to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt our Converſation every Moment, hindered me from making my Caſe known. They feared, and very juſtly too, that, had I given an exact Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of it, the Phyſician would have diſcovered the real Cauſe of my Diſtemper. What can be in-ferred from their Refuſal of letting me make Uſe of the Medicines, I had in my Trunk? They were probably afraid, that thoſe Remedies might reſtore my Health, which they did their utmoſt Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:0653500404:311"/>
to prevent. The Attempt, they had made on my Life, would, they hoped, be concealed from the World by my Death. The Expedient they made Uſe of to ſilence my Complaints, was very odd. They allowed me to write to a Phyſician, but, at the ſame Time, intercepted my Letter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Peruſal of it might diſcloſe a Secret, which it was too much their Intereſt to conceal. Therefore, to compaſs their iniquitous Scheme, they could uſe no better Means, than that of leaving me alone. It would perhaps be difficult, to diſcover, how the Poiſon was conveyed to me, and to name the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Authors of ſo execrable an Attempt, but that they did find Means to give it me, and that every <hi>Muſcovite</hi> is juſtly liable to be ſuſpected thereof, are moſt indiſputable Truths.
<q>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>I now leave you to judge, whether the Report, ſpread throughout all <hi>Europe,</hi> of the Death of the three laſt Sovereigns of <hi>Muſcovy</hi> being owing to Poiſon, was ſo very groundleſs. They will certainly find it very difficult, to clear themſelves from an Imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is but too well founded. They are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready known by too many iniquitous Paſſages, not to be thought capable of any Thing. In all their Proceedings, they are known to conſult their private Intereſt only, and the Project they have formed of extending their Dominions, has induced them to commit all kinds of Injuſtice, in Regard to their Neighbours. They have invaded the fineſt Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, to open their Way into <hi>Germany.</hi> They have long ſince aimed at the ſole Dominion of the <hi>Baltick.</hi> The whole World is ſenſible of the Tyranny they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe in <hi>Poland,</hi> after having ſowed Diſcord in that Kingdom. And <hi>Europe</hi> has Reaſon to fear their penetrating yet farther, and kindling a Flame in
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:0653500404:312"/>
other Countries, as they have done in <hi>Poland.</hi> It is the Intereſt of more Potentates, than one, to ſet Bounds to their Ambition, and to break their Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures; and it were to be wiſhed, that a Method might be ſpeedily found of driving them back into their Foreſts, and lurking Holes, where they lived whole Ages in Obſcurity. As they deſire nothing more earneſtly, than to revive their antient Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms, and to live unknown to the reſt of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, nothing could be of greater Service to them. They bear ſo great an Averſion to the Innovations, which have been attempted to be introduced among them, in the laſt forty Years, that, if they were left to themſelves, they would ſoon ſhake off the Yoke, which they think is impoſed on them. This Nation is fit for nothing but to be kept in Bondage and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity. Is it not ſurprizing, that notwithſtanding the abſolute Power of their Monarchs, they have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto been ſo unſucceſsful in their Endeavours, to render this Country flouriſhing in Commerce, and to eſtabliſh Religion and Sciences among them.</p>
               <p>Whoever ſhould undertake to enquire into the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigin of the <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> muſt be greatly perplexed by this their ſingular Character. If I could prevail up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my ſelf to believe, that there were <hi>Pre-adamites,</hi> I ſhould almoſt have ſworn, that the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> are their Deſcendants. And they muſt certainly be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to owe their Extraction to a Set of Men, very different, from any we now meet with. I have, after many Reflections, formed a Conjecture, which appears to me entirely well grounded, and will, I am aſſured, notwithſtanding its Novelty, meet with your Approbation. You cannot be ignorant of the unanimous Conſent of Hiſtorians, in the mention they make of this Nation, that no Traces can be found of its antient State, and that the profound Ignorance, in which it has been always involved, has rendered all Enquiries, into its Original, entirely
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:0653500404:313"/>
fruitleſs. This great Difficulty has kept all Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians in Suſpence, and deterred them from attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any Deciſion on this Article. But I will lead you into the Path they ſhould have followed, and which I my ſelf have taken, in making this ſignal Diſcovery.</p>
               <p>Whenever the Origin of a People is not diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verable by any Monuments of Antiquity, we muſt of Neceſſity examine their Manners and Cuſtoms, and compare them with thoſe of other Nations, and eſpecially of their Neighbours. This being premiſed, I need only put you in Mind of a Piece of Hiſtory, which you are not ignorant of, tho you may not know how ſo eaſily to fix it to any certain Period. You may remember to have read, that the <hi>Scythians,</hi> at their Return from their third Expedition in <hi>Aſia,</hi> met, on the Frontiers of their Country, a numerous Army, ready to oppoſe their Entrance. Their own Wives, being tired of ſo long a State of Viduity, had all agreed to throw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into the Arms of their Slaves, and had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired thoſe baſe Lover; with ſufficient Courage and Strength to take up Arms. The <hi>Scythians,</hi> informed of this Procedure, conſulted among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, what Courſe to take. They imagined, that to employ their Arms againſt their Slaves, would be to debaſe themſelves: They therefore, armed themſelves with Scourges only, and in that Manner marched againſt the Rebels, who, awed by the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of their Maſters, were immediately ſeized with a Panick, and endeavoured to ſave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by Flight. Theſe Wretches, fearful of a Purſuit, penetrated very far towards the <hi>North,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Country, then un inhabited, which their Deſcendants ſtill poſſeſs.</p>
               <p>If you caſt your Eyes upon a Map, it will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly appear to you, that the Country, into which theſe Slaves made their Retreat, muſt neceſſarily be
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:0653500404:314"/>
the ſame, which is now known by the Name of <hi>Muſcovy.</hi> It would be derogatory from the exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Knowledge you have in Hiſtory, ſhould I here attempt to prove this Fact, which is atteſted by all Authors, who have written of the <hi>Scythians</hi> and their Country. This great Event is likewiſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by an authentick Monument, which we to this Day meet with in <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> for the Place, to which they at firſt retired, is ſtill known by the Name of <hi>the City of Slaves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Such is the Original of the <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> which none, but themſelves, ought to regard as a Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. You need therefore no longer think it ſtrange, that a People, deſcended from ſuch Anceſtors, has ſtrove, to remain in Obſcurity, by neglecting to tranſmit to Poſterity theſe Titles, and all other Monuments, which could lead us to the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of them. The <hi>Muſcovites</hi> would thereby have diſcovered themſelves to be not only Slaves by Birth, but likewiſe Traitors, Cowards and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels. All theſe fine Qualities are ſtill diſcernable in that Nation, and it is well known, that Slave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry has been handed down among them from Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to Son, without any Interruption, till the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Age. The Aſſurance, wherewith they boaſt themſelves to be Deſcendants of the <hi>Scythians,</hi> may therefore be pardoned, provided they mean in the Manner I have here explained.</p>
               <p>To remove all Doubts, that may be raiſed on this Head, I beg leave to add a Word or two about thoſe <hi>Tartars,</hi> who are Neighbours of the <hi>Muſcovites.</hi> You know, without Doubt, that theſe People are the ſame <hi>Scythians,</hi> of whom ſeveral Authors make Mention, and whoſe Exploits were formerly famous throughout the whole World. Theſe are the People, who poſſeſs, to this Day, beſides great <hi>Tartary,</hi> the two fineſt Empires in the World, which are <hi>China</hi> and <hi>Mogul.</hi> Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:0653500404:315"/>
the vaſt Extent of the Countries this Nation is Maſter of, there is not a ſingle Tribe among them, but is thoroughly acquainted not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with their common Origin, but likewiſe in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular with their own Deſcent. They can inform you, with the utmoſt Accuracy, what Branch they are deſcended from. Whence proceeds then ſo great a Difference, as we here obſerve, between two Nations bordering on each other? It may be very eaſily explained. The <hi>Tartars</hi> are thoſe famous <hi>Scythians,</hi> who glory in their Origin; and the <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covites</hi> are thoſe cowardly Slaves, whoſe Deſcent and Extraction have rendered them infamous.</p>
               <p>Whatever Arguments the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> advance, with a View of perſuading us, that they are Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendants of the <hi>Scythians,</hi> this ſingle Obſervation may almoſt ſuffice to ſubvert. But I cannot really perceive, that they have any Thing in common with that Nation. The greateſt Part of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern <hi>Tartars,</hi> on the contrary, ſeem to have an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire Reſemblance with thoſe ancient <hi>Scythians. Juſtin, Herodotus,</hi> and ſome other Authors, deſcribe the Manners, and relate the brave Exploits of thoſe Conquerors, and, if you compare them with what we read of the <hi>Mungals</hi> and <hi>Kalmucs,</hi> you will find a very great Reſemblance between thoſe People. An intrepid Courage, and a ſurprizing Magnanimity, are Qualities, which we obſerve in the <hi>Tartars</hi> here mentioned; but the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> diſtinguiſh themſelves only by their Cowardice and Baſeneſs. You will not find it an eaſy Matter, Sir, to meet, in Hiſtory, with Conjectures better founded, than theſe, about the Original of the <hi>Muſcovites;</hi> therefore, <hi>ſi tibi vera videntur dede manus.</hi> And with this I ſhall conclude my Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, reſerving for the next a Subject more jocoſe and diverting. You judge very rightly, that, to entertain you with Matters of this Kind, which
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:0653500404:316"/>
ought always to be treated not only, <hi>corpore valido,</hi> but likewiſe, <hi>animo ſereno,</hi> I muſt needs put a great Conſtraint on my ſelf. In the mean Time,

The <hi>Muſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites,</hi> perceiving that my Sickneſs did not put an End to my Life, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured by all poſſible Means to effect it by Hunger. This would certainly have been the Event of their Barbarity, had I not received timely Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance from Mr <hi>de L'Iſle</hi> and his Wife. I ſhall, in the Sequel, have frequent Occaſion to mention them both, and, by what I ſhall ſay of them, you'll find, that Miniſters, Generals of Armies and War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours are not the only Perſons, who promote the Honour of the <hi>French</hi> Nation. In order to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize you fully of what I have to ſay, it will be proper to reſume the Thread of my Relation.</p>
               <p>Though my Diſeaſe was become Chronical, and in a Manner incurable, it was nevertheleſs not ſo violent as before, and I begun to be ſenſible of the Neceſſity I lay under of taking ſome ſolid, nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing Food, which might ſupport Nature, and inſenſibly increaſe my Strength. All the Proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which my Guard brought me, at my own Expence, were ſo dear, and, at the ſame Time, ſo very bad, that I reſolved at laſt, to ſeek for other Diet. The Gentleman and Lady before
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:0653500404:317"/>
mentioned were therefore to be applied to, and I found it neceſſary to beg of them, to ſend me ſome Wine, and other Proviſions, which I ſtood moſt in Need of. As I was neither permitted to ſpeak, nor to write to any one, my greateſt Difficulty was, how to acquaint them with my Deſires. I found Means at laſt, after having given my ſelf a great deal of Trouble, to put my Project in Execution, by prevailing upon a Clerk to write down whatever I ſhould dictate to him in the <hi>Ruſſian</hi> Tongue. You muſt not wonder to find me dictating a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in this Tongue, for Neceſſity is the beſt Maſter of Languages, <hi>Ingenîque largitor venter.</hi> I had begun ſome Time before to underſtand the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the Country pretty well, and knew enough to ask for what I ſtood in Need of.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>de L'Iſle</hi> no ſooner received my Letter, than he ſent me much more than I deſired. I had no Room to doubt of his being apprized of my Adventures, and of my Arrival at <hi>Peterſburg;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his Brother, without Doubt, had adviſed him of my Fate: And beſides, as I named him, in my Examination, it is highly probable, he was likewiſe interrogated. I have even been ſince in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, that he was placed behind a Door, to ſee whether he knew me. Having ſoon conſumed the Proviſions, ſent me by Mr. <hi>De L'Iſle,</hi> and what I had provided at my own Expence, as they had ſeveral Times promiſed, I ſhould be furniſhed with Neceſſaries by Order of the Court, and I ſaw no Effect of this Promiſe, I thought it my Duty to expoſtulate pretty warmly with the Officer on that Head. He anſwered, that, ſince I had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared my Averſion to <hi>Muſcovite</hi> Ragoos, they were extreamly at a Loſs, what to provide for me. Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſatisfied with ſo poor a Pretence, I ſpoke to him in ſuch haughty Terms, as terrified him from coming near me again in haſte. And ſo it is with
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:0653500404:318"/>
the <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> in general, not excepting their Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, when they meet with any Oppoſition.</p>
               <p>It is pretty extraordinary, that I could never learn what they call a Man of Courage in the <hi>Ruſſian</hi> Tongue. I am almoſt inclined to think, that, as there is not a Man among them, who has the leaſt Valour to boaſt of, ſuch a Term would be entirely uſeleſs to them. This Cowardice, and a certain brutiſh Diſpoſition, equally natural to them, are Qualities, which I cannot well reconcile.<note n="*" place="bottom">There does not ſeem to be much Difficulty in reconcil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them; for Bullies are always Cowards.</note> They have a Law, whereby all Subjects are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid to draw their Swords, and it has been ſo reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly obſerved throughout the whole Empire, that there has not been one Inſtance of its being violated. I know not whether they have any Laws to prevent Theft, but, if they have, they are not much enforced. What Inference may we draw from this Obſervation? May we not juſtly ſay, that they are naturally inclined to Pilfering, and that their Puſillanimity is the Occaſion that they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver draw their Swords? I leave you to decide this Queſtion, and doubt not, but you will be of my Opinion.</p>
               <p>In the mean Time, I gave my Guard to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that, as they continued to neglect bringing me any Proviſions, I ſhould find Means of being admitted to the <hi>Czarina's</hi> Preſence, and that I ſhould make my Complaints to Her Majeſty of thoſe, who refuſed to execute her Orders. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated theſe Menaces to the whole Body of Clerks, who were in my Anti-Chamber, and my Officer venturing at laſt to appear again, I aſſured him, I would break the Windows, and entreat Relief, of thoſe who paſſed by in the Street. Theſe Threats produced their Effect; for, the next Morning, the Corporal came with a Purſe in his Hand, and ſaid,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:0653500404:319"/>
that I might order what I pleaſed. I told him I wanted Bread, Wine, Sugar and Meat, all which he ſoon after brought me. I gave the ſame Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the next Day, but found it no longer com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with. One of my Guard refuſed to take the Money I offered him, to buy what I ſtood in Need of, pretending he had received Orders not to concern himſelf with any of my Commiſſions. I was not a little ſurprized to hear of ſuch an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, but was obliged to put up with it, and to make ſhift with the Remnants of the preceding Day. After this, I had but very little, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times nothing at all to eat for ſome Days. When it was my Fate to faſt, one of the Soldiers took up a <hi>Violin,</hi> and invited me to dance, ſaying, <hi>French</hi>-Men could forget Hunger for a Jigg. This Farce diverted me for a Time, but my Patience being, at length, tired, I was again ſo buſy with my Threats, that my Soldiers, brought me the ſame Evening a fine Piece of roaſted Meat, ſome Bread and Wine: And no leſs a Feaſt than this would have ſufficed to allay my voracious Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite. When my Repaſt was ended, folding up a Piece of Paper, in which ſome Salt had been wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, I accidentally ſaw ſome Writing upon it. Curioſity inducing me to read it, I perceived, it contained only ſome Aſtronomical Calculations. I immediately conceived, that I was obliged to Mr. <hi>De L'Iſle</hi> and his Wife for my Supper; and was ſo enraged at this Proceeding, that I made uſe of the moſt bitter Invectives to reproach the Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral. I even threatened him, Her Imperial Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty ſhould know how her Orders were executed, being aſſured, ſhe would reward them all with a Halter. He begun to excuſe himſelf by the Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, he pretended, there was in pleaſing me, but I was ſo loud with my Complaints, that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired in a Pannick.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:0653500404:320"/>
Were I to relate the many Scenes I paſſed thro on this Account, I ſhould never have done. It may ſuffice, to tell you, that all the Food I had, from the 11th of <hi>January</hi> to the 15th of <hi>February,</hi> were ſent me by Mr. <hi>De L'Iſle.</hi> This Gentleman even gave my Guard ſome other Neceſſaries, but thoſe Villains thought fit, as I afterwards found, to keep them for their own Uſe. I had been in great Danger of being ſtarved in my Priſon, had I not been ſo kindly aſſiſted by Mr. <hi>De L'Iſle.</hi> The Impoſſibility the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> lie under of main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining their Priſoners, whilſt they have ſo large a Number of Foreigners on their Hands, is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Pretence that can juſtify their Conduct with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to me. Could you ever have thought, that the whole Revenue of this vaſt Empire does not amount to above ten or twelve Millions of Crowns? Their Generoſity cannot be very extenſive out of ſo inconſiderable an Income. But after all, you may object, Why was I not ſatisfied with what they gave me? Was it not ſufficient, to be fed in the Manner they live themſelves? Black Bread, Salt, and often putrid Fiſh, are the Victuals, and Water the Drink, they generally put up with in <hi>Muſcovy.</hi> Could a Priſoner as I was, a Perſon unknown, expect to meet with a better Treatment? Had they vouchſafed me the Allowance, given in other Countries to Priſoners of State, I ſhould a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone have conſumed as much, as would have ſerved half a Dozen of <hi>Muſcovite</hi> Families. The Scarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Money in this Country, and the Miſery, the People are reduced to, can hardly be imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. In the whole Extent of <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> there does not ſo much Money circulate, during the Courſe of a Year, as at <hi>Paris, London,</hi> and <hi>Amſterdam</hi> in a ſingle Day. I believe I ſhould ſpeak within Compaſs, if I tell you, that the daily Expence of a ſingle Merchant at <hi>London</hi> far exceeds that of a
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:0653500404:321"/>
whole City in <hi>Muſcovy.</hi> This impoſſibility which they laboured under of maintaining me, in the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner I ought to have been treated, was the Reaſon that they gladly left that Care to Mr. <hi>de L'Iſle</hi> and his Wife, who were both as kind and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to me, as the People in <hi>France</hi> generally are to Strangers. Tho I forbid my Guard going to aſk for any Thing at Mr. <hi>de L'Iſle</hi>'s, yet they conſtantly went thither, and not a Day paſſed that I did not receive ſome Tokens of their Benevolence. I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure you, his Generoſity to me, exceeded whatever I could expect from the beſt of my Friends. I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to let you know more on this Article on an other Occaſion. Permit me now to entertain you with an Account how I employed my Time in my Priſon.</p>
               <p>I found Means to make a ſhift without Pen, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per or Ink, as I was deſtitute of thoſe Helps. A Nail, which by Chance I found in my Priſon, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied the Place of a Pen, and, inſtead of Paper, I made uſe of the Table, from whence they had taken away the Carpet. I had therefore no Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for Ink, to write with. I begun by engraving on the Edge of the Drawer theſe Words:
<q>
                     <l>Inter ſcribas et Phariſaeos innocens erat.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>After this I undertook to embroider all my Table, and my firſt Attempt was an Encomium on the <hi>Czarina,</hi> in the following Words:<q>
                     <l>Anna della tue glorie al ſcriver pronto</l>
                     <l>Dell' ala della fama</l>
                     <l>Piuma ſtringer vorrei;</l>
                     <l>Ma miſero ſol ſervo</l>
                     <l>Suelta dal Carcer mio penna di ferro.</l>
                  </q>

               <p>
                  <pb n="89" facs="tcp:0653500404:322"/>
Having thus begun to take delight in Poetry, I made theſe following Lines.<q>
                     <l>Anna delle tue Lodi</l>
                     <l>Pur dir vorrei, Ma alla materia vaſta</l>
                     <l>Un ſol foglio poſeggo ed ei non baſta.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>It would be difficult to account, <hi>ut ſic repente Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eta prodirem.</hi> But however it happened my Table, was, in a few Days, covered with wretched Verſes. The <hi>Muſcovites</hi> underſtood nothing of the Matter; nor, indeed, did I make them for their Uſe. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, after having filled my Table, to engrave on the Door of my Priſon an Account of my moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Adventures in <hi>Muſcovy.</hi> There you may read, that I was refuſed a Barber, leſt I ſhould make Uſe of his Razor to cut my own Throat; and that they would not allow me a Phyſician, becauſe he might have cured me, and ſaved my Life. Theſe two Incidents occaſioned me to propoſe the Riddle of a Man, who could neither live, nor dye. And I was in reality in the Caſe of that Perſon, to whom a <hi>Gaſcoon</hi> ſaid, If you draw near, I ſhall kill you; and if you go back, you are a dead Man. This unhappy Man could, in ſo great an Extremity, no Way avoid the imminent Danger, without becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inviſible, which was likewiſe the Advice the <hi>Gaſcoon</hi> gave him. As this Behaviour of the <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covites,</hi> in Regard to me, was a very evident Proof of their Barbarity, I reſolved, in order to perpetuate the Memory thereof, to addreſs the following Lines to their Secretaries:<q>
                     <l>Signori Secretari,</l>
                     <l>Che il Barbiero negate,</l>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>It is a Phenomenon, ſomewhat ſtrange, to be expoſed to periſh by Hunger, and as this was my Caſe in <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> I thought an Occurrence of that kind deſerved to be tranſmitted to Poſterity. Theſe are the Verſes I compoſed on that Subject:<q>
                     <l>Signori Secretari, dite un puoco</l>
                     <l>Per chi voi mi prendete?</l>
                     <l>Se per uomo: O per ſpirto: ſe ſon tale,</l>
                     <l>Guardate non vi faccia inſpiritare.</l>
                     <l>Ma ſe uomo ſon io, date a mangeare.</l>
                     <l>Forſi perche ſenza verun ſoccorſo</l>
                     <l>Non mori di gran male</l>
                     <l>Mi credete immortale?</l>
                  </q> Such was my Occupation in my Priſon. Any one beſides my ſelf, would have taken Pains to broach Invectives againſt the <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> but to tell you the Truth, I thought them unworthy of my Anger. An Affair happened, in the mean Time, at which, tho ludicrous enough, I could not forbear expreſſing ſome Indignation. The Matter was this:</p>
               <p>As my Confinement begun to be irkſome to me, not a Day paſſed that I did not make ſome ſerious Reflections on the Motives, that could induce the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> to keep me ſo long cloſed between four Walls. I thought, that they begun to forget me, and reſolved to ſeek ſome Method of making my ſelf the Subject of Publick Diſcourſe. My Beard appeared moſt proper to awaken their Minds, and to give the Alarm to my whole Guard. It had,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:0653500404:324"/>
for ſome Time, been of a frightful Length. I daily obſerved the Clerks who came into my Chamber, telling one another, that I was not unlike a <hi>Tartar.</hi> As I ſhould rather chooſe to reſemble a <hi>Tartar,</hi> than a <hi>Muſcovite,</hi> this Compariſon gave me no great Offence. In order to convince them of my entire Indifference as to all their Railleries, on my Beard, I ſometimes told them, that, if <hi>Peter</hi> I. had met me in his Dominions, I ſhould have met but with a bad Reception. I even made ſome Verſes, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graved them on my Table, by which I gave them to underſtand, that my Beard was ſo far from ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering me dejected, and giving me the Air of a Criminal, that it added to my Courage and Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution. I frequently talked in this Strain, and to confirm what I ſaid, the more, I added theſe Words:

I took, however, the Reſolution of cutting off my Beard, and I even intended to give them Notice of it, notwithſtanding the Indifference I expreſſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it. You know, I always wear on my Arm one of thoſe Stones, ſo famed in the Writings of the Learned, which ought, if I had been ſomewhat more credulous, to have been in greater Eſteem with me, during the Courſe of my Adventures. Having called my Corporal, I ſhewed him the Stone, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſting, that, if he did not inſtantly ſend me a Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, I would cauſe a Genius, whom I pretended to have at Command, and to keep incloſed there, to come immediately, and ſhave me. At hearing theſe Words, he ſeemed to be in a Maze, and, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving alternatively caſt his Eyes on me and my Stone, trembling, replied, that he would carry my Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage to his Officers, and return immediately with their Anſwer. At his return, he told me, I muſt
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:0653500404:325"/>
have a little more Patience, and that it was ſtill thought improper, to grant my Requeſt. Diſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with this repeated Refuſal, I directly reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to perform the Office of a Barber my ſelf. No ſooner were my Guard intent upon ſomething elſe, than I took my Sciſſars, which ſupplied the want of a Razor, and ſoon after ſhewed my ſelf again to the Corporal, without a Beard. His Aſtoniſhment was beyond Expreſſion; he was in a perfect Rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>I eaſily foreſaw, that I muſt arm my ſelf with Courage againſt the Conſequences, which this Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair might produce, and be prepared for all Events. As nobody appeared all that Day, I concluded it gave them little or no Concern. But was told by my Guard, the next Morning, that my Beard had cauſed a great Diſturbance, and that they themſelves expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be puniſhed, for not obſerving my Actions more narrowly. By their Diſcourſe I perceived, they had no thoughts of my having Sciſſars, and that I ſhould certainly be eſteemed an arrant Sorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer. The Reluctance I had of paſſing for a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian, and ſeeing my Guard undeſervedly laſhed, made me frankly own I had a Pair of Sciſſars, and had made Uſe of them, to cut off my Beard. An univerſal Alarm enſued, the Clerks in the Anti-Chamber made it the whole Subject of their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, and looked upon this Trifle, as a Matter of the utmoſt Importance. The Noiſe, this Affair made, gave me but little Uneaſineſs, but I was highly ſurprized, when the Sergeant of my Guard, the Corporal, and ſeven or eight Soldiers, came, with their Swords drawn, into my Chamber. The Sight of this effeminate Troop was nevertheleſs ſo far from terrifying me, that I prepared for a vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Reſiſtance, in Caſe of an Attack.</p>
               <p>The Sergeant broke Silence, and demanded my Sciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſars, but all the Anſwer I gave him, was, that I
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:0653500404:326"/>
did not underſtand him. I made the ſame Reply to the Corporal and Soldiers, who likewiſe made the ſame Demand. In vain they made various Signs, for me to apprehend their Meaning, and the Sergeant, in particular, put his Fingers to his Whiskers, to ſignify that they deſired to have the Sciſſars, with which I had cut off my Beard. They went out of my Room, when I ordered them to fetch me an Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter, but returned a quarter of an Hour after, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by a much larger Number of Soldiers. They found me ſitting, and, approaching me, repeated their former Demand. I deſired them, in plain Terms, to retire, and ſignified that I was not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently verſed in the <hi>Ruſſian</hi> Tongue, to make them any Anſwer. The Drawer of my Table being half open, one of theſe Men of War, more bold than the reſt, very inſolently put in his Hand. I was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the very Inſtant, to ſhut the Drawer, and pinch his Hand, but he deprived me of this Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, by withdrawing it very ſeaſonably. I got up, at the ſame Time, ſomewhat haſtily, and, having called my Guard, made Signs to them, immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to rid me of this raſcally Crew. Thus ended the Uproar, occaſioned by my Sciſſars. The <hi>Italian</hi> Comedians could, I believe, hardly preſent a Piece, which would afford the <hi>Czarina</hi> more Pleaſure, than this, and, had that Princeſs known, that there was a Theatre open ſo near her, where her own Subjects acted ſuch diverting Parts, I am pretty well aſſured, my Priſon would have been honoured with Her Majeſty's Preſence. You ſee, Sir, I am as good as my Word, I promiſed you ſomething ludi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crous, and you have no Reaſon to complain of any Want of it in this Letter. I leave it to your Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, after you have peruſed it. As I have already entertained you with ſome Verſes, which I made, when my Requeſt for a Barber met with a Refuſal, it is but juſt I ſend you ſome others, which I carved
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:0653500404:327"/>
on my Table, when I was rid of my Beard. They were conceived in theſe Words:<q>
                     <l>Signori Secretari</l>
                     <l>Perche alla voſtra Barba</l>
                     <l>Mi ſon fatta la Barba,</l>
                     <l>Voi fate del rumore?</l>

                     <l>E che! quivi tra voi non è permeſſe,</l>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>But it's Time to conclude, the Farce is already too long, I begin to be tired with it, and fear it will have the ſame Effect on you: I ought rather to have recollected the Proverb:

                  </q>

               </opener>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HIS is already my ſeventh Letter, tho I am but come to the fourth Month of my Impriſonment. If I go on thus, I very much fear, I ſhall be obliged <hi>centuriam tibi dare,</hi> which will not only prove te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious to you, but likewiſe far exceed my Reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. But tell me, dear Sir, what Courſe can I take? For I ſee no Poſſibility of being more conciſe. You, on the one Hand, make preſſing Demands for an exact and circumſtantial Account of what befals me; and the <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> on the other Side, furniſh me daily with freſh Adventures. The fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing is a very ſingular one.</p>
               <p>Towards the End of <hi>February,</hi> a Perſon came into my Priſon, who, having ſaluted me in <hi>French,</hi> with a Compliment from Mr. <hi>De L'Iſle</hi> and his Spouſe, laid a Parcel of Linnen, with ſome Wine, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral other Proviſions, upon my Table. The Joy I felt, at ſeeing a Perſon, with whom I could converſe, was of a ſhort Duration. I had hardly Time, to tell him, how much I was obliged to that Gentleman, and his Lady, for the Kindneſſes I received from them, and, that I was aſhamed to ſee their Generoſity ſo much treſpaſſed upon. The Caſe was this; having given ſome Linnen to the Soldiers, to get it waſhed and mended for me, they had thought proper to carry it to this Lady, who was ſo kind, as to add thereto ſeveral other Things, which ſhe thought I might ſtand in Need of. She had ordered one of her Servants to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Parcel himſelf, being ſenſible, that if it
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:0653500404:329"/>
had fallen into other Hands, I ſhould have been robbed of a good Part of her Benevolence. You will, Sir, undoubtedly be ſurprized, that the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, ſhould be ſuffered to ſpeak to me, and to give me that Parcel, which had not been viſited either by a Secretary, or by any of the Guard. Was I then no longer the ſame Priſoner of State, whoſe Steps were to be narrowly obſerved, and who was to be guarded with the utmoſt Rigour? Was I not the ſame Perſon, whoſe Requeſt for a Barber had been refuſed, and who could not obtain the Liberty of uſing a Knife, or Fork? Yes, I was the ſame, but the grand Motive, which induced the <hi>Muſco<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vites</hi> to act, on this Occaſion, otherwiſe, with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to me, was this. If theſe ſordid Wretches had furniſhed theſe Proviſions, and cauſed my Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen to be waſhed themſelves, it would have coſt them very near the Value of a Ruble; a Sum which to them appeared conſiderable enough, <hi>ut ſilerent leges,</hi> and they were willing to leave the Care of it to any one, who would be at the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence. The Truth of what I here affirm, is ſo very certain, that when, in the Sequel, I deſired any Thing, that they thought too dear, I was obliged to have Recourſe to Mrs. <hi>De L'Iſle,</hi> who never failed of ſending her Servant immediately.</p>
               <p>This Inſtance may ſerve to give you an Idea of the Sordidneſs of the <hi>Muſcovites;</hi> and at the ſame Time will ſhew you the Neceſſity, I lie un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, of deſcending to thoſe Particulars, to give you a perfect Inſight into the Character of the Nation. A different Inducement, or rather a Senſe of Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, prompts me to mention two ſmall Birds, which one of my Guard made me a Preſent of, and no ſooner had I them, than I ſet them at Liberty, to fly about my Room. They ſoon grew familiar, and convinced me, that Man is not the only Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, endued with Reaſon. With Submiſſion to
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:0653500404:330"/>
the Gentlemen of the <hi>Carteſian</hi> Sect, I could by no Means believe them to be meer Pieces of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinery. I diſcovered in them a Genius, the Faculty of Reaſon, and a certain engaging Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, which Men are not Maſters of. I may juſtly ſay, that I was charmed with their Company, and that they gave me many agreeable Hours. They were continually about me, and made me a Thouſand pretty Tenders of their Affection. I may venture to affirm, without being too profuſe in their Praiſe, that many <hi>Muſcovites</hi> are their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriours; I mean, with regard to their Reaſon, Manners, and certain Paſſions, which I may call hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, and which I never had the good Fortune to experience in any one of my Guard. This innocent Couple, no longer able to ſee the Brutality of my Attendants, quitted my Priſon at laſt, and left me alone in Captivity. I loved them too well, not to allow them a Place among my Poetical Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, or to neglect their due Encomium, but I omit it here, to go on to another Subject.</p>
               <p>I have already told you, that I carved my Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes on the Table and Door, and that both were ſoon filled with Fragments of Poetry. Weary of this Amuſement, I reſolved to ſpend my Time ſomewhat more uſefully. I had, as I obſerved above, a <hi>Muſcovite</hi> Almanack, which is a Book of a pretty large Size; and beſides this I had a Pocket Book, and a Silver Pencil. My Almanack lay open before me one Day, when by Chance I diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered a Leaf of blank Paper in it, which I reſolved to write upon with my Pencil. I directly made a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, and ſucceeded to my Wiſh. I held my Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to the Light, whenever I deſired to read what I had written, and every Character appeared as diſtinct, as if I had written them with Ink. Thus may a Priſon be ſometimes the Mother of Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. My miſtruſtful Guard, in the mean Time,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:0653500404:331"/>
being highly ſurprized, to ſee me thus employed, drew near, from Time to Time, to examine my Actions; but as they ſaw Nothing, but the Blank Paper, and I had neither Pen nor Ink, which were forbidden me, they ſuffered me to go on without Interruption, and I was ſo expeditious, that all the Paper was ſoon filled. There was a large Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity in my Room: But it was tied up and ſealed, according to the Cuſtom of the Country, and the Soldiers had Orders to take Care of it. I found Means, however, to get ſome of it, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſcovered, and laid up ſo good a Store, that I found I had ſufficient to finiſh what I had begun. A Shipwrack unfortunately deprived me of all theſe Memoirs, which would have been excellent Materials for the Hiſtory of my Adventures, and hence it is, that my Letters are ſo dull, and writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in ſo incorrect a Stile.</p>
               <p>But what will you think of my Temerity, in ſtealing Paper, and breaking open Seals, which, in <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> is looked upon as a capital Crime? As for the Paper, I thought my ſelf entitled to it, to repair the Loſs I had ſuſtained of my own, which I had been robbed of at <hi>Caſan,</hi> and Part of my Cloaths, which they had thought proper to deprive me of. I confeſs, that, had I been diſcovered in breaking open the Seals, it might have fared hard with me: For in <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> you muſt know, every Thing is ſealed, Houſes, Shops, Ware-Houſes, Chambers, Doors and Windows. There is but one Thing, which in this Country it is not cuſtomary to ſeal, tho they do it in <hi>Italy,</hi> where Jealouſy is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried too great a Length. I leave you to gueſs my Meaning. The Manner of ſealing up Papers in <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covy</hi> is very ſingular. They take a little Piece of yellow Wax between their Fingers, which they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to a twiſted Piece of Packthread, and then put a Seal to it, on which it would be pretty dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:0653500404:332"/>
to diſcern any Impreſſion. You find, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, People every where, who are entruſted with the Care of thoſe Papers, thus negligently ſealed, are very watchful of them. Nothing is more eaſy, in ſpite of all theſe Precautions, than to learn the Secrets of the State. Should ever a fatal Star lead you to an Ambaſſy in <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> you need only previouſly conſult me, and may rely on my pointing out to you the neceſſary Means of being ſoon apprized of them. I ſhall even inſtruct you how to get all the Writings out of the Secretary's Office, and re-place them, without any Danger of being detected. A Glaſs of Brandy, or half a Ruble, are Bribes ſufficient to gain any Clerk in the Office.</p>
               <p>The Soldiers on Guard are ſeldom over careful in the Diſcharge of their Duty: They are almoſt always ſnoring, never acquainted with their Orders, and ever ready to ſubmit to the firſt that are given them, by any one. But what is yet worſe, theſe Wretches are inceſſantly Drunk, which gives Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to continual Quarrels, and to that Diſorder, which reigns among them. I have frequently ſeen, at one Time, half a Dozen Clerks in Irons, for Neglect of Duty, which nevertheleſs could not put a ſtop to their indecent Mirth. Iron is very cheap in <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> and for the leaſt Neglect, the guilty Perſon is ſo loaded with it, that he cannot ſtir.</p>
               <p>In the mean Time, I was buried in Oblivion, and my Releaſement ſeemed to be no longer thought of. As I was determined to ſtrive, by all the Means I could invent, to effect my Deliverance from this unhappy State, I reſolved to write a Petition to the Miniſters. For this I made uſe of a little Pen, which I fixed at the End of my Pencil. This happily ſucceeded, without the Privity of my Guard; and I may ſay, that I often ſhewed them, <hi>Candida de nigris, &amp; de candentibus atra.</hi> One need not be a Conjurer, to impoſe on theſe People.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="100" facs="tcp:0653500404:333"/>
In my Petition to the Miniſters, I humbly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated them, as I had been ſo long impriſoned, without being able to conceive the Motives of ſo rigorous and tedious a Detention, to allow me, at leaſt, to draw up my Vindication in Writing. If I was found guilty, I willingly ſubmitted to the Forfeiture of my Life; but in Caſe I appeared in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, as I hoped to convince them I was, I beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged they would uſe their Intereſt with her Majeſty for my Releaſement. The next Difficulty, after I had drawn up this Petition, was, to convey it to the Hands of the Miniſters, which was no very eaſy Matter. I knew not, at that Time, whether thoſe Gentlemen muſt be directly applied to. I had indeed often heard of Secretaries and Senators; but I perſiſted ſtill, that my Affairs were only cogniſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble before Empreſs and her Miniſters. The Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain, I had, on ſeveral Occaſions, expreſſed for the Senate, did, perhaps, protract my Captivity. But I could never prevail upon my ſelf to change my Sentiments on that Head, and even, when my Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery drew towards a Criſis, I implored the Protection of the <hi>Czarina</hi> only, without making the leaſt mention of the Senate, or the Council.
<q>
                     <l>Tantum licentiae dabat innocentia.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>As I did not immediately meet with an Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of preſenting my Petition, I prepared, in the mean Time, for the Execution of a freſh Project. I had, for ſome Time, been troubled with a Rheum in my Head, and, as my <hi>Eau des Carmes</hi> was locked up in my Trunk, I reſolved to get it open, in order to come at ſome. The Matter at firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared not very eaſy, by reaſon of the Padlock and Seal, neither of which I durſt venture to touch. Having, in the mean Time, narrowly viewed the Trunk, it appeared to be made only of ſeveral
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:0653500404:334"/>
Planks, joined together without Nails, and that by the Help of a Piece of Iron I might eaſily take one of them off. This, therefore, or ſomething like it, was my next Want, which I ſupplied in the following Manner. Seeing my Guard very bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy one Day at making a Fire in the Stove, and taking great Pains to cut little Pieces of Wood with their Swords, I told them, that an Ax would be much more convenient for that Purpoſe; and that they ſhould endeavour to procure one. They had Senſe enough, on that Occaſion, to apprehend, that I was in the right, but replied, that I muſt demand that Utenſil of the Sergeant. As I was not the beſt ſatisfied with this Officer, who now never came near me, I anſwered, he was a Raſcal, and that I deſired to have nothing to do with him. I gave them, at the ſame Time, half a Ruble, and ordered them to go and buy an Ax. I was ſoon obeyed; for they ſtick at nothing, when Money is in the Caſe. Be pleaſed likewiſe here to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Folly of my Guard. I ſhould without fail have met with a Refuſal, had I demanded a Knife or Fork, and yet they buy an Ax and entruſt it in my Hands, without Difficulty. You will, perhaps, aſk, whence proceeds this Difference? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Ax was not ſpecified in their Bede-roll. It was not one of thoſe Things, I had been denied the Uſe of; and it was beſides to be of Service to themſelves. But as the Fear of my cutting my Throat induced them to refuſe me a Knife, had they not the ſame Room to apprehend I might ſplit my Scull with the Ax, or employ it againſt them, if an Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity offered? Hence you may judge of the Perverſeneſs of the <hi>Muſcovites.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhall now tell you, in what Manner I executed both the Projects I had formed. If I miſtake not, it was on the 18th of <hi>March.</hi> But ſince I mention the 18th Day, I muſt take Notice of an Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:0653500404:335"/>
I made, which appears to me pretty ſingular. Have you not, in the Peruſal of my Letters, found that all the remarkable Epochs of my Adventures happened preciſely on that Day? I was carried to the <hi>Czarina's</hi> Palace on the 18th of <hi>December:</hi> It was the 18th of <hi>January,</hi> when I was allowed to write, and, in the Sequel, you will find, that the moſt remarkable Adventures I met with, always happened on the 18th Day of the Month. I wiſh ſome one could account for this Phenomenon. The Number 9 has, I know, beeen formerly regarded by all Nations as a myſterious Number, for which they have always had a great Veneration: Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther our modern Cabaliſts are ſtill of the ſame Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, I know not; but, in Regard to the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber 18, I never heard, that it had any myſterious Meaning, and aſſure you, that to me the Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very is entirely new. Can you imagine this to be the bare Effect of Chance? It will not be fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign to my Subject, here to obſerve, that the <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covites,</hi> who are ſuperſtitious even to an Exceſs, have always endeavoured to improve the extravagant Fancies of the Ancients, and hence it is, that, of two nines, they have made one 18.</p>
               <p>The 18th of <hi>March</hi> was the Day, on which I was ordered to be carried to another Priſon. As I feared this Removal would deprive me of an Opportunity of preſenting my Petition, in the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner I had propoſed, the News of it gave me ſome Uneaſineſs. My Departure was ſo very abrupt, that they allowed me no Time to make many Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections, and I was obliged to take <hi>Conſilium in arena.</hi> I was eſcorted by a Troop of Soldiers, and by my Guard, headed by their Sergeant. No ſooner was I brought into a Chamber, crowded with People, than I pulled my Petition out of my Pocket, and cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out aloud, that every one might hear me, gave it to the Sergeant of my Guard, charging him to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:0653500404:336"/>
it immediately to the <hi>Czarina's</hi> Council. A ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior Officer, who was probably in ſome neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chamber, terrified at the Noiſe, inſtantly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, and being informed of the Occaſion, took it, and carried it into the Chamber, where the Senate was aſſembled. After my Petition was delivered, I was for retiring, but they forced was to wait a Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of an Hour longer; and the Officer, in the mean Time, returning, gave me my Papers back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and would force me to take them. Enraged at the Fellow's Obſtinacy, and having before had Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to be disſatisfied with him, I gave him a Blow on the Hand, which cauſed the Paper to fall on the Ground, and then leaving the Place abruptly, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him with Her Imperial Majeſty's Diſpleaſure, if he refuſed to convey the Petition to her Hands.</p>
               <p>On my Arrival in my new Priſon, I ſet about the Project I had formed, of opening my Trunk, and taking from thence what I moſt wanted. To ſucceed the better, I gave my Guard ſome Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and for my Part, I was buſied in making a Cage for my Birds. Thus was I working, Ax in Hand, to cut a Plank, which I had laid upon my Trunk. You may eaſiy ſuppoſe, that, at Times, I applied my Axe to my Trunk, to open it, and conſequently that all my Blows were not ſpent on that Plank. My Guard ſupplied me with what other Tools I ſtill ſtood in Need of, and, with their Help, I ſoon compaſſed my Ends. Having thrown my Cloak-Bag, and ſome other Things, on the Trunk, I ſlid off the Plank, which I had looſened, and immediately took out the <hi>Eau des Carmes,</hi> and whatever came firſt to Hand. It happened very luckily, that I could fix the Plank in the Manner it was in before, and afterwards, as eaſily, looſen it again, to take out of my Trunk whatever I want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Thus was I reſtored to the Poſſeſſion of my own; and could even, in Caſe of Neceſſity, have

armed my ſelf with a Sword and Piſtols, to procure my Liberty. The People, I had to do with, had not Courage enough, to defend themſelves againſt me, and my ſingle Fork ſeemed to me ſufficient, to put three or four <hi>Muſcovites</hi> to the Flight. The World would have an Opinion, very different, from that which <hi>Europe</hi> has for ſome Time entertained of this Nation, were they as well acquainted as I am of their Cowardice.</p>
               <p>Having thus delivered my Petition, I waited impatiently for the Reſult of it. No Anſwer was brought that Day, nor the next, but the Day after an Interpreter came into my Chamber, with my Paper in his Hand, and begged I would explain ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Lines, which they had not perfectly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood. I ſoon complied with his Requeſt, and he promiſed to give a faithful Account of the Paſſages I had cleared up. The ſame Man returned an Hour afterwards, to ask, what Means I us'd to write that Petition, and whether I had corrupted my Guard, either with Money or Brandy. I anſwered, that I had no Occaſion to have Recourſe to either of thoſe Expedients; that, as I was in a Room, where thirty or more Clerks were employed, I had not found it difficult to procure Ink, a Pen, and ſome Paper, without the Knowledge of my Guard, and that they were not at all privy to it. As the Account, I gave, met with but little Credit, and I was apprehenſive they might puniſh the innocent Soldiers, I reſolved to diſcover the whole Secret. I therefore deſired the Interpreter to let his Maſters know, that for a Fortnight together, I had written with white Characters, that I might be able to write black ones, for one Quarter of an Hour. The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter ſeemed ſatisfied with my Anſwer, and went away to make his Report. He returned once more, half an Hour afterwards, to ask me, how I had done to ſeal my Petition. I ſhewed him, for his
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:0653500404:338"/>
Satisfaction, ſome Wax I had in my Pocket, with the two Seals hanging at my Watch. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding my preſſing Entreaties to ſpeak to this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter again, I could never, from that Time, have the Pleaſure of ſeeing him.</p>
               <p>The Addition which was now made to the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of my Guard, and the freſh Orders that were given to interrupt all my Proceedings, occaſioned me to think, that, after a Conſultation was held on my Affairs, it was thought neceſſary that my Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſhould be more narrowly watched. My only Comfort, on this Occaſion, was, that I could en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy more Peace, and had a larger Room for my Priſon. I could not, however, account, for the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour of the Miniſters, with regard to me. I had now been confined four Months at <hi>Peterſburg,</hi> and my Enlargement was not yet thought of. After many Reflections on the State of my Affairs, I fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied, that the Intention I had declared, of ſerving in <hi>Perſia,</hi> under the Prince of <hi>Heſſe-Homburg,</hi> had perhaps given the Miniſters Room for ſome Suſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And as that Prince had no Thoughts himſelf of going into that Country, till ſome Uneaſineſs put him upon it, this Notion appeared to be the better grounded. As, on the other Hand, the fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Maxim of the <hi>Muſcovite</hi> Government conſiſts in truſting nobody, and in believing all Mankind to be capable of the moſt villainous Attempts, I had Reaſon to ſuppoſe, that they only detained me ſo long Priſoner, to inform themſelves of the real Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of my Voyage. Or perhaps, in the preſent Juncture of Affairs, in <hi>Europe,</hi> they took me for an Emiſſary of <hi>France,</hi> or of King <hi>Staniſlaus.</hi> I am however, not conſcious of having done or ſaid any thing, that could raiſe ſuch a Suſpicion, and my Behaviour in <hi>Muſcovy</hi> was very much unlike that of a Perſon entruſted with ſecret Commiſſions: I was, nevertheleſs, ſome Time after, informed, that
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:0653500404:339"/>
I was taken for a Spy of King <hi>Staniſlaus,</hi> though I never had the Honour of knowing that Prince, or being at all known to him. But let us leave theſe Conjectures, which may lead me too far: And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead thereof, let me inform you of what paſſed in my new Habitation.</p>
               <p>After having opened my Trunk, and taken out of it what I thought neceſſary, I reſolved to make no longer Uſe of a wooden Fork, which had been given me, nor to be obliged to borrow a Knife, to cut my Victuals; but made a Shew of my great Fork, and of a Knife, which I had taken out of my Trunk. My Guard ſeemed ſurprized at the Sight of theſe Things, and I wondered no leſs to ſee them profoundly ſilent. From thence I inferred, that they no longer feared my cutting my Throat, and that all their Care was, to hinder me from wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting again. They gave me the Pleaſure of ſeeing them, every Day, viſit the Seals of my Trunk, to know whether I had tried to open it. By my fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Repreſentations, how neceſſary it was to have a conſtant Eye on thoſe Seals, I even invited them to make that Viſit. Thus, after I had tricked them, they ſerved for Objects of my Ridicule. I was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up with this Amuſement one Part of the Day, and ſpent the Remainder of my Time in looking o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the <hi>Muſcovite</hi> Almanack, which was the only Book, I had left. I was one Day peruſing the Liſt of the Potentates of <hi>Europe,</hi> and read, with ſome Surprize, the Name of <hi>Auguſtus</hi> III. as King of <hi>Poland.</hi> This News occaſioned me to form vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Conjectures, and gave me a very eager Deſire of knowing what had paſſed. I no longer doubted but that the War was kindled in <hi>Poland,</hi> and found, at the ſame Time, that the Perſon, from whom I had received my chief Intelligence, ſince my Arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val at <hi>Peterſburg,</hi> muſt be perfectly well acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Deſigns and Projects of the Court of
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:0653500404:340"/>
                  <hi>Ruſſia.</hi> This Perſon, whom, I believe, I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned before, had not a little contributed to my ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Reſolution of going into <hi>Perſia.</hi> I had long before ſuſpected, that he reſided at <hi>Peterſburg</hi> on Account of ſome ſecret and important Affair, which Suſpicion was afterwards confirmed by freſh Proofs, and ſuch, as ſuffered me no longer to doubt of the Truth of my Conjecture. As he was well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with whatever paſſed at the Court of <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> he appeared to me the more proper to diſcharge his Commiſſion.</p>
               <p>Tho it was with Aſtoniſhment I heard, that King <hi>Auguſtus</hi> had acceeded to the Throne of <hi>Poland,</hi> yet I was not ignorant that the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> would uſe their utmoſt Efforts, to effect the Excluſion of King <hi>Staniſlaus;</hi> but I could hardly perſuade my ſelf, they would ever have ſucceeded. The great Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence the <hi>Ruſſian</hi> Court at preſent has, in the Affairs of <hi>Europe,</hi> does really ſurprize me, and is what I cannot ſufficiently repeat to you. The World has formed of this Monarchy a Notion of Power, which exiſts only in the Fancies of thoſe, who have no Knowledge of it. <hi>Ruſſia</hi> is, I muſt own, of a vaſt Extent, and I even believe, that neither <hi>Europe,</hi> nor the <hi>Indies,</hi> nor any other Part of the World, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains a Country in that Point equal to it. You may judge of this by its Length, if you conſider the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance between <hi>Riga,</hi> and the <hi>Eastern</hi> Extremity of the Continent of <hi>Kamtſchatki,</hi> lately diſcovered; and by the Latitude of it, which extends from the Province of <hi>Gilan,</hi> on the <hi>Southern</hi> Coaſts of the <hi>Caſpian</hi> Sea, to the Streights of <hi>Naſſau.</hi> The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious Extent of this Empire, muſt neceſſarily be a Burthen to it, and renders it (if I may be allowed the Expreſſion) heavy and unfit for Motion. If, on the other Hand, we enter into a particular Account of the Parts, of which it is compoſed, we meet with immenſe De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarts,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:0653500404:341"/>
Marſhes without End, and very large Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts. It will, therefore, upon an exact Calculation, be found, that <hi>Germany</hi> contains twice as many In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants as <hi>Muſcovy.</hi> To this add the Puſillani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of the <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> who are by no Means a People to be dreaded by other Nations.

               </p>
               <p>Were we to give Credit to what is inſerted in cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Gazettes, I know, we ſhould have Room to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> have actually formidable Armies on foot, conſiſting of regular Troops. But believe me, Sir, thoſe Reports are entirely ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, and only fit to ſeduce the unknowing Part of Mankind. I wiſh they would ſhew me, where all theſe Troops are. In the Year 1733, I ſaw the State of the <hi>Muſcovite</hi> Troops, and if they amount at preſent to 100,000 Men, they muſt have been conſiderably augmented. But, ſuppoſing, that there is actually at preſent that Number of regular Troops in <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> muſt they not neceſſarily be divided and diſtributed into ſeveral Places? You are not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the indiſpenſible Neceſſity they lye under, of keeping always a pretty large Body in <hi>Perſia,</hi> and that a Removal of them from that Country, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in Time of Peace, would be attended with ſome Danger. The <hi>Perſians</hi> have of late been pretty well experienced in War, and, ſhould they happen to make Peace with the <hi>Turks, Koulikan</hi> would, without doubt, undertake the Conqueſt of thoſe fine Provinces, which the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> have, by Uſurpati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, made themſelves Maſters of. What ought we to think of this Behaviour of the <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> with Regard to the <hi>Perſians?</hi> Under the ſpecious Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of lending their Aid to a King, oppreſſed by a rebellious Subject, they enter the Country, where they are received like generous Friends, and at the
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:0653500404:342"/>
ſame Time treacherouſly ſeize whatever they think moſt commodious for them.</p>
               <p>Beſides the Body of Troops, which the <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covites</hi> cannot avoid maintaining in <hi>Perſia,</hi> they are obliged to keep another on Foot in the Kingdom of <hi>Aſtracan,</hi> which is ſurrounded by <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars,</hi> who are Neighbours they have always Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to be apprehenſive of. The Troubles, that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom was ſo lately involved in, are ſtill freſh in every one's Memory. An handful of Men ſpread a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Confuſion, and made terrible Ravages there. Another Motive, that muſt induce the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> to keep Troops in the Kingdom of <hi>Aſtracan,</hi> is, becauſe the <hi>Tartars</hi> of <hi>Baſkir,</hi> and thoſe of <hi>Uffi,</hi> who were antient Poſſeſſors of this Country, might other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe riſe in Rebellion, ſome Time or other, and revenge themſelves on the <hi>Ruſſians.</hi> During my ſtay at <hi>Caſan,</hi> I had an Opportunity of ſeeing ſome of that Nation, and if we may judge by their Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiognomy, they do not ſeem deſtined to bow their Necks long to the <hi>Muſcovite</hi> Yoke. But let us go back, and ſtop at the River <hi>Don,</hi> where the <hi>Koban Tartars,</hi> who are not far diſtant from thence, make frequent Incurſions, and very much moleſt the <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covites.</hi> If thoſe People are not kept in awe, they may certainly penetrate as far as <hi>Weronezt,</hi> and ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture at laſt on ſome important Enterprize to ſuccour their Brethren, the <hi>Crim-Tartars.</hi> If we go on in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Ukraine,</hi> we ſhall find, that Country cannot remain long in the Hands of the <hi>Ruſſians,</hi> unleſs it be ſecured by a conſiderable Body of good Troops. In thoſe Parts the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> muſt have a watchful Eye over the Motions of the <hi>Turks,</hi> the <hi>Crim</hi> and <hi>Budziack-Tartars,</hi> and even of the <hi>Coſacks,</hi> who may, ſoon or late, riſe in Arms, and, as they have formerly done, withdraw their Allegiance.</p>
               <p>Thus you ſee, that, if the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> maintain, as they muſt do, a Body of regular Troops, in each
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:0653500404:343"/>
of thoſe Places, and eſpecially in <hi>Perſia,</hi> and the <hi>Ukraine,</hi> their Army of an hundred thouſand Men, will be reduced to a very ſmall Number. To theſe you may add the Troops, which are actually in <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> 30,000 Men, which they are to ſend to the <hi>Emperor</hi>'s Aid on the <hi>Rhine,</hi> and laſtly the nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Garriſons, which muſt neceſſarily be kept in moſt of thoſe Places, which have been taken from <hi>Sweden.</hi> But, ſuppoſing, that the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> had really as many Troops, as they are ſaid to have, where will they find Money to pay them? The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues of that vaſt Monarchy do not amount to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove ten or twelve thouſand Crowns. How is it poſſible, with a Sum ſo inconſiderable, to maintain 3, or 400,000 Men by Land, and, beſides this, a formidable Fleet at Sea?</p>
               <p>Theſe Particulars may ſerve to ſhew, that I am not miſtaken, in exclaiming againſt the Rumour ſpread in <hi>Europe,</hi> of the Power of this Nation. The Gazetteers are excuſable, as they publiſh thoſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports on a Miſ-Information; but what Judgement can we form of the <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> who, tho thorough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acquainted with the State of their Affairs, the Number and Quality of their Troops, and the Weakneſs of their Finances, dare to attempt the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of the Projects now on the Carpet? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve me, Sir, and give me leave to repeat it once more, that they will never obtain the Ends they have in View:<note n="*" place="bottom">They ſeem, however, to bid very fair for it, at this time.</note>
                  <q>
                     <l>Spes improbiſſimas complectuntur inſperata aſſecuti.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>What Projects the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> may have formed for this Campaign, I am wholly ignorant of; but this I know, that they were the laſt Year obliged, for the Reinforcement of their Troops, to draw all
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:0653500404:344"/>
had from their Inland-Countries; Inſomuch, that none but Invalids remained at <hi>Muſcow,</hi> tho a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Body always us'd to be kept on Footthere. At <hi>Peterſburg</hi> remained only the Guards and two Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talions of Peaſants, juſt taken from behind their O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens; hence it was, that the Number of the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Guards could not be compleated, and that even mine was leſſened, for I was left in the Hands of three Men, who were not relieved in near two Months.</p>
               <p>Their Manner of doing Duty in <hi>Muſcovy</hi> is pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſingular. Thoſe, who, like me, have been Eye-Witneſſes, may have an Idea of the Troops of this Country, and of the Officers, who command them. A Soldier on Duty never knows when he is to be relieved, and, as for the Officers, they are generally ignorant of the firſt Rudiments of War, which thoſe of other Countries are ſo well acquainted with. A Centinel very ſeldom executes the Orders, he receives from his Sergeant. They never heſitate at placing a drunken Soldier on Duty; and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently a whole Guard, Officers, as well as Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, are drunk, and incapable of attending their Duty. Nothing is more common, than to ſee a mutinous Soldier fall to Blows with his Sergeant, and the latter is often obliged to put up with them, without daring to complain. The Quarrels which happen every Day among the Officers or the Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, are never terminated otherways, than by Fiſty-Cuffs, or Cudgels; for there is a Law in <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> as I obſerved in a former Letter, whereby the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects are forbid to draw their Swords, which Law is always moſt religiouſly obſerved. The only Thing, which appears laudable, is, that theſe Troops are never ſuffered to be idle, and at <hi>Peterſburg</hi> I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member to have ſeen fifteen Battalions employed at a Time, and not a ſingle Man remaining at the Corps de Garde. Guards are placed every where,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:0653500404:345"/>
and there is not the leaſt thing done without ſuch a Security. Foreign Miniſters, of what Rank ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they be, never fail of being attended by ſome of them. You may judge, after this, how ſafely their Money muſt be guarded in <hi>Muſcovy.</hi> I aſſure you, that a Commiſſioner, who has only a dozen Bags of Copper-Money in his Cheſt, will at leaſt have a Guard of ſix Men. Such is the Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the greater Part of a large Garriſon, whilſt the reſt are continually occupied in cleaving and cutting Wood for their Fuel. This they call keeping their Troops in Exerciſe, and always rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy for Battle, and imagine they are performing Wonders!</p>
               <p>I could enlarge farther on this Subject, but fear this Letter is already too long. I muſt therefore conclude, Sir, tho I do it with Reluctance, aſſuring you, that I am, and ſhall always be, wholly Yours,

In my laſt I informed you, how I was apprized of the War being kindled in <hi>Poland,</hi> and that King <hi>Auguſtus</hi> had acceeded to the Throne. The ſame Perſon told me, that the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted <hi>Dantzick,</hi> and that King <hi>Staniſlaus</hi> was block'd up in that City. As I neglected no Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of learning the publick News, I heard, that Count <hi>Munich</hi> was departed for the Camp before <hi>Dantzick;</hi> that a large Body of Troops was ordered to march from <hi>Poland;</hi> and that all who were at <hi>Muſcow,</hi> were to come to <hi>Peterſburg.</hi> Orders were even ſent to my Guard, to prepare for a March, which I found they were not the beſt pleaſed with. They were continually obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that a bloody War would ſoon enſue, that a large Body of <hi>French</hi> Troops was already arrived in <hi>Poland,</hi> and preparing to march directly to <hi>Moſcow.</hi> In vain I repreſented to them the Impoſſibility of it, by Reaſon of the vaſt Diſtance the <hi>French</hi> are at, they perſiſted this News was but too true, and that I ought no longer to doubt it. By their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, I perceived, how much they were afraid of coming to blows with the <hi>French.</hi> You muſt know, the Warriors in <hi>Muſcovy</hi> all equally wiſh for Peace, and that no one here is a Soldier by Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. They ingenuouſly confeſs their Averſion to War, and that, were they not forced to enter into military Service, they would never do it volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily. If the Officers themſelves were allowed to do it, they would certainly reſign their Poſts. From hence you may judge, what Opinion we ought to have of theſe Troops.</p>
               <p>The Intelligence I received from my Guard ſerved only to encreaſe my Deſire of hearing more News; but nothing appeared ſo difficult, as to find the Means of ſatisfying my Curioſity. After many Reflections, it came into my Head to ſend for Mr. <hi>De L'Iſle</hi>'s Cook, not doubting, but that
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:0653500404:347"/>
he would give me a thorough Knowledge of every Thing. In order to this, I aſked for ſeveral Things, which I pretended to have urgent Occaſion for, and for which I knew my Guard would not diſburſe any Money. This ſucceeded to my Wiſh. They went immediately to Mr. <hi>De L'Iſle,</hi> who inſtantly ſent his Cook with all I aſked for. I acquainted this Man with my earneſt Deſire of ſeeing him, to be informed of the Poſture of Affairs in <hi>Europe,</hi> and begged he would viſit me frequently, to impart to me all he might learn. He promiſed faithfully to gratify my Deſire, and he was as good as his Word.</p>
               <p>By this Means, I was informed of many Things, ſome of which were agreeable, while others gave me Uneaſineſs. The Affection I always bore to Arms revived in me, when I found War declared on all Hands, and this, at the ſame Time, made me more ſenſibly feel the Weight of my Miſeries. But with Pleaſure I heard, that the <hi>French</hi> had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed themſelves from the Beginning of the War, and the Progreſs, they had made, did, I muſt own, far exceed my Hopes. I remember to have ſaid, in a former Converſation with you, that as the Enemies of <hi>France</hi> could not gain their Ends by a War, they were endeavouring to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due that Nation by a Peace. My Conjectures were groundleſs, and it is with Joy I find my ſelf miſtaken. Who would ever have thought, that what is the general Cauſe of the Decay, and total Subverſion, of the moſt powerful States, could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver produce either of thoſe fatal Effects in <hi>France?</hi> Were Luxury and Indolence ever carried to ſo great an Exceſs in any Country in the Univerſe, as in this very Kingdom? The <hi>French,</hi> in the mean Time, ſo immerged in Voluptuouſneſs, thoſe illuſtrious Youths ſo intent upon the Finery of their Attire, and ſo attached to the Purſuit of their Pleaſures, have given the moſt evident Proofs of
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:0653500404:348"/>
their Valour and Bravery, at the Battles of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ina</hi> and <hi>Guaſtalla,</hi> and at the Siege of <hi>Philipſburg.</hi> They may juſtly be ſaid to have ſhewn a Prodigy of Valour, and to have acted like Heroes. This Phenomenon is extraordinary, and perhaps without a Precedent. The Reflections I have made on this Subject would lead me too far from my main Deſign, ſhould I undertake to communicate them all to you.</p>
               <p>My Thoughts were not however ſo wholly taken up with the News I heard in my Priſon, to hinder me from conſidering ſeriouſly how to procure my Liberty.</p>
               <p>A Month was now paſs'd, ſince I preſented my Petition, and I had as yet received no Anſwer. I ſeemed to be buried in Oblivion, and the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters appeared reſolved to let me die in Slavery. They continued to treat me with unprecedented Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour, and I could neither obtain an Interpreter, nor Permiſſion to ſpeak to the Miniſters. Whatever Requeſt I made was ſure to meet with a Refuſal. I eſteemed it a great Piece of Injuſtice, that they ſo obſtinately denied to ſee the Reaſons I had to offer in my Juſtification.</p>
               <p>As I had ſome Room to think, that the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of the Senate had intercepted my Petition, I reſolved to draw up another. The Execution of this Project was attended with ſome Difficulty by Reaſon of the Orders, which had been given, narrowly to watch my Motions, and of the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of my Guard which had been augmented. This could not however diſcourage me from purſuing my Deſign. I entruſted my Petition, after I had ſealed it, to two Sergeants, whom I charged to carry it inſtantly to the <hi>Czarina</hi>'s Council. An of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficious young Fellow, who came almoſt every Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute into my Chamber, to ſee whether my Guards had a ſtrict Eye over me, was greatly ſurprized, when he ſaw, that I had found Means of writing without being perceived by any one. He ſwore and made a terrible Uproar, threatning my Guard
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:0653500404:349"/>
that they ſhould be puniſhed for their Negligence. They aſſured him, with horrid Imprecations, that they were not privy to it. After a long Conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation they took my Petition at laſt, and promiſed to execute the Commiſſion faithfully. The Serge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants returned, notwithſtanding this Promiſe, in half an Hour, and gave my Paper to the Soldier who was on Duty, with a reiterated Charge, not to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer me to write any more. This ill Succeſs did not diſhearten me. My Guard, on their Part, dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled their Attention, and even endeavoured to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize me by Stratagems. They pretended to be aſleep and watched me through their Cloaks, with which they cover'd their Heads.</p>
               <p>This Scene was comical enough, and afforded me much Diverſion. I was extreamly delighted to ſee them fall from a feigned Sleep into a real and profound one. I cannot conceive how they came to think of this Expedient. For the <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> of all People, are the moſt expert in the Art of Sleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. I may venture to ſay, that of all the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons I know, not one is ſo ſubject to Sleep, as the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> are. Not contented with the Night, which, in the Winter-Seaſon, is very long, in their Country, they take, throughout the whole Year, an Afternoon's Nap, of ſeveral Hours. This Cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom is common to every <hi>Muſcovite,</hi> and 'tis that probably, which makes them ſo ſtupid. The whole Life of a Soldier is ſpent in Eating and Sleeping. They even indulge themſelves in the latter, whilſt they are on Duty. The Time of their ſtanding Centry, which is for ſix Hours together, is indeed, too long. When an Officer ſurprizes a Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier aſleep, which I have frequently ſeen, he does not make a Crime of it; but only awakens him, by ſaying, How now, Centry? Are you aſleep? How the <hi>Muſcovite</hi> Soldiers behave in the Field, I know not; but moſt certain it is, that they can
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:0653500404:350"/>
never forbear ſlumbering, if they are ſeveral Hours on Duty. You need not, therefore, wonder, if I could impoſe upon my Guard, and find all the Time requiſite, to write a new Petition, without their Knowledge. After having drawn ſeveral Copies, I ſealed them, and threw them out of the Window, into a Place, where I ſaw a great Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row-fare. Theſe Papers were directed to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs herſelf, but I could never find, that any Thing came of them. This is common in <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covy,</hi> where it is difficult to obtain Juſtice. <hi>Hos ſcelerum ritus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I cannot, with any Certainty, impute this to any particular Perſon. Shall I accuſe the Cabinet-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil or the Members of the Senate? I have Room to believe them all equally guilty, and the Uſage I have met with at their Hands, but too plainly proves it. The Reaſons that induce me to attribute it to them, are theſe: The Petition, which I ſent my ſelf, as Priſoner of State, to Her Imperial Majeſty's Council, was either intercepted, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to the Miniſters. If you ſuppoſe it to have fallen into their Hands, may I not reaſonably accuſe them of the greateſt Injuſtice, as they would neither give Ear to my oral Remonſtrances, nor per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit me to write? But, if my Petition was inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, may I not conclude, that the Miniſtry is under no fixed Regulation? Since I was looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as a Perſon, entruſted with ſome Commiſſion, dangerous to the State, my Petition might be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed to contain ſome Affairs of the greateſt Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance. It being, on the other Hand, directed to the Empreſs herſelf, how durſt they preſume to open and intercept it? A Proceeding of this Kind can never be in any Nation, where all Laws, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and human, are not trod under Foot. In ſo unhappy a Situation, my Uneaſineſs was beyond Expreſſion. Thus confined in a Priſon, where
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:0653500404:351"/>
I was uſed like the moſt vile of Men, I knew not what Means to have Recourſe to, to procure my Releaſement. <hi>Quoe res in ſe neque conſilium, neque modum habet ullum, eam conſilio regere non potes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As I was not ſo rigid a Stoic, as to reſolve upon ſpending the Remainder of my Days in a Priſon, a Deſire after Liberty prompted me to think of new Expedients to free my ſelf from Slavery. I ſoon formed another Scheme, the Execution of which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to me very eaſy. This was, to kill one of my Guard, who always accompanied me alone to an Apartment, whither I went to eaſe Nature. I continued to think ſeriouſly of executing this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, as deſperate as it was. My Sword was, as I mentioned before, at my own Diſpoſal, and nothing ſeemed to me leſs difficult, than to make my Eſcape from my Priſon, after having given the Blow. The only Obſtacle, I ſaw, was, how to find a Place in the City to which I might ſafely retire. I might, in any other Country have relied on a Protection in the Houſe of a foreign Miniſter, in which I could ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely have taken Refuge; but I knew the <hi>Muſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites</hi> too well, not to be acquainted how light they make of the Law of Nations. I reſolved, however, as I was deſtitute of any other Means, to retire to the Houſe of the <hi>Pruſſian</hi> Envoy, where I propoſed more Safety to my ſelf, than any where elſe. All Matters were already diſpoſed for an Enterprize ſo dangerous, and ſo different from the many others, I had, in vain, attempted, when I begun ſeriouſly to reflect on the Action, and upon ſecond Thoughts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to delay it for ſome Time. I was ſhocked at the bare Thought of killing a Man in cold Blood, and proteſt, that, had not the Uneaſineſs cauſed in me by ſo long an Impriſonment, and by the bad Treatment, I met with, from the <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled me to it, I ſhould never have formed ſuch a Deſign. I therefore thought it my Duty, patiently
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:0653500404:352"/>
to bear the Weight of my Miſeries, and to ſtay for ſome other Opportunity of recovering my Liberty, without being obliged to commit a Crime, and without running the Hazard, I was going to expoſe my ſelf to.</p>
               <p>I received, in the mean Time, frequent Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences of what paſſed at the Siege of <hi>Dantzick.</hi> I was informed by my Guard, that their Countrymen ſtrove by all poſſible Means to make themſelves Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of that City, and that they hoped to put an End to the War, by ſeizing the Perſon of King <hi>Staniſlaus.</hi> I could not be prevailed on, as I knew the <hi>Muſcovite</hi> Troops, to believe, that they would ever bring about an Enterprize of that Kind. I imagined, beſides, that, if the City ſhould not be in a Condition of being defended, it would infallibly be relieved with formidable Succours, and thereby the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> be obliged to retreat. I was told, that <hi>Sweden</hi> was equipping a conſiderable Fleet, and that a large Body of Troops was forming in <hi>Finland.</hi> This Step, ſaid to have been taken by <hi>Sweden,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to me very reaſonable, and I had many In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducements to make me give Credit to theſe Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences. And the <hi>Swedes</hi> could in Reality not meet with a more favourable Opportunity, of retrieving the Loſſes they had ſuſtained, and revenging them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves on the <hi>Muſcovites.</hi> Nothing could, in my Opinion, at that Time, be attended with leſs diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty than the Execution of this Project. The <hi>Swedes,</hi> needed only to march directly to <hi>Wibourg,</hi> and I am well aſſured, that at the firſt Rumour of it at <hi>Peterſburg,</hi> that Capital would ſoon have been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned, and the whole Court have retired to <hi>Muſcovy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What I here advance is pretty well founded, and I even believe, Sir, it is the only and beſt Means that could be taken. My Reaſons are theſe: The <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covites</hi> had, at the Time I am ſpeaking of, only
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:0653500404:353"/>
eight or ten Battalions, and one Regiment of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valry, to oppoſe the <hi>Swedes;</hi> for herein conſiſted all that remained for the <hi>Czarina</hi>'s Guard. Had I not, therefore, Room to think, that a Step like this ought to be taken by <hi>Sweden?</hi> I had formed ſuch pleaſing Hopes of their ſucceeding therein, that I had even projected, to be one among them, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoon as they ſhould enter <hi>Peterſburg.</hi> The Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this Enterprize would not have been very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult. I might have cleared the Way for my ſelf with my Sword and Piſtols. My Guard were not to be greatly feared; and, had I met with any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance from them, I ſhould ſoon have found Means of ſubduing them. My Mind was, during ſome Time, wholly taken up with theſe pleaſing Expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations: I obſerved through the Windows of my Priſon, what paſſed in the City, and when any one came into my Priſon, I could not diſſemble my ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Deſire of hearing News. My Uneaſineſſes all vaniſhed in Hopes of ſeeing this Grand Event. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could have pleaſed me more, than to ſee the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> upon the Point of quitting their Capital, to avoid the Purſuits of an Enemy, juſtly enraged. With Pleaſure I view'd the approaching Moment, when they would be obliged to renounce all their great Enterprizes.</p>
               <p>My Conjectures, Sir, proved, however, ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, my Hopes were vain, and the Event has but too plainly demonſtrated, how groſly I was miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. You will undoubtedly ſay, that my Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations were at that Time, like thoſe of a Perſon, in the other World. I confeſs, I was deceived, but who would ever have believed, that the Affairs of <hi>Poland</hi> would have turned out to the Advantage of the <hi>Ruſſians?</hi> Am I the only one, who entertained the Notions, I then did? What were your Thoughts, Sir? Could you ever have imagined, that the City of <hi>Dantzick</hi> would ſurrender to the <hi>Muſcovites?</hi>
                  <pb n="121" facs="tcp:0653500404:354"/>
That the <hi>Swedes</hi> would continue inactive? And that all the other Potentates ſhould not make the leaſt Attempt to oppoſe the unjuſt Pretenſions of the <hi>Muſcovites?</hi> I cannot but continue in my Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize, when I conſider this general Inactivity of the Reſt of the <hi>Northern Princes.</hi> Are then the <hi>Swedes,</hi> who were formerly ſo warlike a People, now dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated? Could they ever have met with a more favourable Juncture to retrieve their Loſſes? The <hi>Muſcovites</hi> being ſtill the very ſame, as they were in the Times of <hi>Charles</hi> XII, their declared Enemy, they had nothing to fear from that Quarter. Let them but recollect the famous Battle of <hi>Narva,</hi> where a handful of valiant <hi>Swedes,</hi> routed an Army of one Hundred Thouſand <hi>Ruſſians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But you will perhaps aſk, is there no Difference between the preſent <hi>Muſcovite</hi> Troops, and thoſe, who fought the Battle of <hi>Narva?</hi> There is, I muſt own, ſome, but let us only examine, wherein it conſiſts. The preſent <hi>Ruſſian</hi> Soldiers are better cloathed, and provided with better Arms than in the laſt War; but they are, in every other Reſpect, ſtill the ſame Men, and have neither more Courage, nor more Experience to boaſt of. Believe me, had the <hi>Swedes</hi> put it to the Trial, the Perdition of the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> would have been inevitable. They were far from being in a Condition to oppoſe an Enemy, by whom they had ſo often been conquered, and, at the ſame Time, carry on a War with the <hi>Poles.</hi> You will, perhaps, object, that Part of the Troops employed at the Siege of <hi>Dantzick,</hi> and ſome of thoſe who were diſperſed in <hi>Poland,</hi> might have been recalled. But, Sir, that Objection can be of no weight with you. All the <hi>Muſcovite</hi> Troops, which are diſperſed in <hi>Poland,</hi> are highly neceſſary there, and, notwithſtanding their large Number, would have been few enough, had not there been Diviſions among the <hi>Poles</hi> themſelves. You may
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:0653500404:355"/>
again object, they had another Body of Troops in the <hi>Ukraine,</hi> which they might have recalled, and placed in the Heart of the Empire. But in this Caſe, how would they have been ſafe againſt the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Tartars,</hi> who threatned them with an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion? Let us even ſuppoſe, that they had reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to recall thoſe Troops, were they not too far di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant from the Capital, to arrive in Time, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent its ſurrender to the Enemy? All theſe Things induce me to believe, that the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> relied on the Faith of the Treaties, ſubſiſting between them and <hi>Sweden,</hi> and, that they had been aſſured, that no Attempt ſhould be made, contrary to their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts. They ſeem nevertheleſs to have carried their Confidence too far, and a ſtrong Body of Troops, ſent to <hi>Finland,</hi> would have contributed not a little to eſtabliſh their Alliance with <hi>Sweden,</hi> and to ſecure their Frontiers from any Inſult. But the <hi>Muſcovite</hi> Miniſtry probably eſteemed theſe Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cautions needleſs, and is undoubtedly ignorant, that <hi>Utcunque ſe res inclinat, ita ambulant foedera.</hi> They are ſo elate on their Proſperity, and their Vanity is ſo excited by a Succeſs, only owing to Chance, that they forget their Intereſts in Matters of the greateſt Importance. <hi>Melius, pejus, proſit, obſit, nil vident, niſi quod lubet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I need not expatiate on the Event of this Affair, but be that as it will, it muſt be allowed, that the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> have on this Occaſion expoſed their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign and the whole Nation, to too great a Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. Had <hi>Sweden</hi> more narrowly watched her In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts, <hi>Peterſburg</hi> muſt have yielded to her ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior Power, and none of the great Projects, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> would have taken Place. The Admiralty of <hi>Peterſburg,</hi> you know, takes Charge of whatever relates to the <hi>Ruſſian</hi> Maritime Aſſairs. If therefore this Capital had fallen into the Hands of the <hi>Swedes,</hi> of what Uſe would not <hi>Cron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtadt,</hi>
                  <pb n="123" facs="tcp:0653500404:356"/>
with all the Ships which lye there, have been to them? The taking of this City only, would, I am well aſſured, have been attended by the Loſs of all the Conqueſts the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> have made, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently have driven them back within thoſe Bounds, to which it is the Intereſt of ſeveral Princes, if not of all <hi>Europe,</hi> to confine them. Hence you may ſee, what Danger the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> have expoſed themſelves to by an unheard of Negligence, and by not foreſeeing a Storm, which might have fallen upon, and overwhelmed them. Had the Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of Affairs been in the Hands of the native <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> as it is of Foreigners, ſo notorious a Blunder would not have ſurprized me, and I could even have alledged the true Cauſe of ſuch a Proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure.</p>
               <p>I believe, I have already, in ſome of my former Letters, obſerved, that the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> could never approve of any of the Regulations made by <hi>Peter</hi> the Great, their Sovereign, and that the moſt honourable Employments are ſuch a Burthen to them, that they never accept of them but with the utmoſt Reluctance. Moſt of them very loudly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that the Obligation they are under, of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, be it by Sea, or Land, is only an Addition to their Slavery. In this Way of thinking, which ſhews their Cowardice and Indolence, they look on their Navy, and all the Conqueſts they have made, as the two principal Sources of all the Evils they labour under. They wiſh for nothing ſo earneſtly, as a conſiderable Change in the State, which may ſubvert all the Innovations, and enable them to lead a lazy, inactive Life. Believe me, what I here advance, is far from being a Paradox, for nothing would be eaſier to methan to evince the Truth of it. I remember, that, during the Siege of <hi>Dantzick,</hi> itwas a general Wiſh, with every one, that it might not be taken. The Hatred they bear to the Foreigners,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:0653500404:357"/>
who formed this Project, and eſpecially to him, who was entruſted with the Execution of it, contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted not a little to their being ſo ſingular in their Wiſhes; but the principal Object of their Deſires was, for ever to quit a Country, which they great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly abhor, and to return, into their ancient native Country, where they might offer themſelves a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to Fire and Lazineſs, their favourite Idols.</p>
               <p>You may conclude, Sir, from what I have ſaid, how reaſonably my Hopes were founded, of recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving from the <hi>Swedes</hi> an Opportunity of recovering my Liberty. My Diſappointment muſt, therefore, be imputed to my evil Stars, and to the Inactivity of the <hi>Swedes.</hi> Whilſt I was flattering my ſelf with theſe vain Hopes, I happened to think of an Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient of cauſing my ſelf to be taken Notice of, and preventing my being buried in eternal Oblivion, which you will think very odd. As I was one Day leaning on my Window, with my Mind employed on a thouſand various Thoughts, I ſaw the <hi>Czarina</hi> at a Diſtance, with a large Number of Attendants, paſſing through a Street, which muſt neceſſarily lead her cloſe by my Priſon. In order to ſhew my ſelf to that Princeſs, and to all her Court, I leaned out of the Window, as far as ever I could, and threw up my Morning Gown, which fell into Rags, and could not but excite the Curioſity, of thoſe, who ſaw it. I know not, whether the Empreſs perceived me, as ſhe was in her Coach, but all her Attendants caſt their Eyes on me, and viewed me very atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively.</p>
               <p>This was the only Advantage I reaped from an Attempt, of which I had formed great Hopes. My Time I ſpent, as uſual, in eating and drinking, tho always very moderately; in walking up and down my Chamber, and ſometimes in reflecting ſeriouſly on my Condition. I was, at the ſame Time, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:0653500404:358"/>
to freſh Trials, in which I ſtood in Need of all that Moderation which you have been frequently pleaſed to call Stupidity. As the Regiments of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracan</hi> and <hi>Ingria</hi> were on their March, and only her Majeſty's Body-Guards remained in the City, they were obliged to ſend ſome Peaſants to my Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, who were lately ſent for from their Villages, and whoſe ruſtick Deportment was highly diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to me. My Philoſophy was, on many Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, of little or no Service, and I was obliged ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to come to Blows, to keep them within Bounds. The Soldiers, who were my Guard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and who were obliged to follow their Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, were much more tractable, and civilized; but theſe Peaſants, were all barefaced Raſcals, ripe for any Villany. Hence you may form an Idea of a great Part of the Reſt of the Nation. I have, however, obſerved ſome Diſparity among the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of this vaſt Empire. The Inhabitants of <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cow,</hi> and thoſe who live within fifty Leagues of that City, are the moſt unſociable of Human Kind, and hardly deſerve the Name of Men. As I removed from that Part of the Country, I found by Degrees the People leſs Ruſtick, more Humane, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently more fit to be ranked among Men, than the Inhabitants of <hi>Muſcow,</hi> and the adjacent Places. The leaſt barbarous of the <hi>Ruſſians</hi> are thoſe who live in the moſt remote Foreſts, and are, in their Actions, guided by the mere Inſtinct of Nature.</p>
               <p>Beſides the Inconveniencies I laboured under on Account of my new Guard, I was, at the ſame Time, deprived of the kind Viſits of Mr. <hi>De L'Iſle</hi>'s Servant, who was taken with a fit of Sickneſs, which confined him at home. This Accident hindered me a long Time, from hearing any other News, but what my Guard and my Stewards were pleaſed to impart to me. Nothing afforded me greater Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, in ſo doleful a Situation, than the Liberty I
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:0653500404:359"/>
had of looking out at my Window, where I could view the fineſt Part of the City. On one Side of my Priſon, I had the Proſpect of a large Garden and Palace, which formerly belonged to the unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate Prince <hi>Menzikoff,</hi> and which, at preſent, ſerves as an Academy for the Cadets. I had every Day the Pleaſure of ſeeing thoſe young Perſons per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form their Exerciſes; but have been ſince informed, that the State entirely neglects to give them an Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation becoming them; and hence the Advantage, expected from that Eſtabliſhment, is fruſtrated. The <hi>Muſcovites</hi> are groſly miſtaken, when they imagine, that the only Qualification requiſite to make a good Soldier, and a Great Captain, is the Art of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming the Exerciſes, and knowing all the Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of military Diſcipline. All thoſe, who are ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived to any Perfection in the military Art, have had Recourſe to other Sources, and learned Rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, very different from thoſe taught in <hi>Muſcovy.</hi> The Prime Miniſters have never ſufficiently weighed one Point, which is, that they have always been too haſty, and endeavoured to run before they could creep, in all their new Eſtabliſhments, and hence it is, that they have frequently neglected the moſt eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential Matters. Inſtead of founding an Academy of Sciences, and educating a Body of Cadets, they ought to have eſtabliſhed Colleges and Schools, there to have taught the grand Principles of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Morality. There they ſhould have begun the Reform they propoſed; and, indeed, if due Care is not taken in the Education of Youth, how can the Nation poſſibly be extricated from that Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barity, in which it has been, for ſo many Ages, invol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved? But I ſhall wave theſe Reflections, which are a little too ſerious, and perhaps not very pertinent.</p>
               <p>Such were the Objects, that preſented themſelves to my View in one of the Chambers of my Priſon, I come now to the other, from which I deſcried the
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:0653500404:360"/>
Admiralty, and another very large Edifice, intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for Her Imperial Majeſty's Palace, not finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but carrying on with great Aſſiduity. I recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the more Pleaſure from the Proſpect of theſe Buildings, as I daily ſaw Crowds of People there, and continual Changes in the Decorations. Though ſo many different Objects diverted me for a Time, yet I could not but make ſerious Reflections on the Cauſes of what I every Day beheld, and was moſt ſtruck with. I was in the utmoſt Conſternation at ſeeing the Admiralty, when I begun to conſider, how a Nation, like the <hi>Ruſſian,</hi> could equip and maintain ſo numerous a Fleet. A ſingle Man, ſaid I, to my ſelf, may perform Wonders, when his Genius is ſuch, as to qualify him for every underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, and he enjoys, at the ſame Time, a ſovereign Authority. Such was <hi>Peter</hi> the Great, who, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the inſuperable Difficulties, which he could not but foreſee, and actually met with, was never diſcouraged, but continued to purſue his Aim, even to the laſt Moment of his Life. His Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors have endeavoured to Walk in his Steps, but with little Succeſs. The Averſion, all <hi>Muſcovites</hi> in general bear to the Sea, has always been, and ever will be, one of the greateſt Obſtacles to the Accompliſhment of ſo great a Work. Thoſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, who have Employments in the Navy, lament their Fate, and look upon themſelves as miſerable Slaves, condemned to the Gallies. I leave you to judge, whether the maritime Forces of this State can poſſibly ſubſiſt long? I may perhaps be miſtaken, but I am perſuaded their Navy will fall away to nothing. It was, ſome Time ſince, on a Footing very different from what it is now. All thoſe fine Edifices, which by that <hi>Czar</hi>'s Order, were built at <hi>Cronſtadt,</hi> have, by an unpardonable Neglect, already been ſuffered to dilapidate, and this I my ſelf have, with ſome Indignation, been an
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:0653500404:361"/>
Eye-Witneſs of. You will, moreover, upon an Examination of the Plan, that great Prince formed for the Building of <hi>Peterſburg,</hi> find only Part of it duly executed. He propoſed, in order to accuſtom his Subjects to Water, to open a large Number of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals through the City, and this very thing has, in ſeveral Places, been neglected. That glorious Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror would, during his Life, never permit any Bridge to be laid a-croſs the River, or his Subjects to make uſe of Oars in paſſing over. By this, they were laid under a Neceſſity of learning how to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage a Sail, if they wanted to go from one Part of the City to the other. Theſe Regulations are now entirely aboliſhed. The Admiralty I have not ſeen, but if I may give Credit to the Perſons employed there, every Thing is in a terrible Diſorder. A Report is however current in the Publick News, that they levied ſeveral thouſand Seamen for this Campaign. The <hi>Baltick</hi> is not very large, and we ſhall conſequently ſoon know, how they are to be employed. I ſhall, therefore, give Credit to all that is ſaid about them, till we are better informed.</p>
               <p>As for another Fleet, which is ſaid to be intended for the <hi>Caſpian</hi> Sea, I much doubt of the Truth of that Report, ſince there is not yet a ſingle Veſſel on that Sea. I know, that this Project was formed by <hi>Peter</hi> I. and have my ſelf ſeen five or ſix Ships at <hi>Caſan,</hi> of a particular Structure, deſigned for thoſe Seas, but they are left on the Stocks, and there pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably they will ſtill remain. Beſides, the Seamen which were to be employed on that Occaſion, were recalled to <hi>Peterſburg,</hi> towards the Concluſion of 1733, and ſet out on their Journey at the ſame Time I did. Be therefore aſſured, Sir, that if there are, at preſent, any Veſſels on the <hi>Caſpian</hi> Sea, they are at beſt, only ſome large Barks, built after the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the Country, and made uſe of for the Traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick of private Perſons. To this I may add, that
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:0653500404:362"/>
thoſe Barks are ſo far from being fit to keep the Sea, that I have ſtrong Reaſons to doubt, whether any one of them ever ſailed to <hi>Aſtracan.</hi> Their Structure is very uncommon, and I believe it will be ſomewhat new to you, if I tell you, that the Carriages in thoſe Parts have two Poles, and the Barks two Helms. But this does not facilitate their Motion, which I my ſelf have but too much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced.</p>
               <p>This may give you an Idea of the Fleet on the <hi>Caſpian</hi> Sea. A flouriſhing Commerce might, I grant, be eſtabliſhed there: But, to bring about an Enterprize like that, the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> muſt be leſs ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid, and the Miniſtry of that great Monarchy made up of abler Perſons. But nothing ſeems more ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing, than that, as they are themſelves incapable of carrying on ſuch a Commerce, they will not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit Foreigners to do it. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch,</hi> it is well known, have made ſeveral Attempts to eſtabliſh a Trade in this Country, but, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the conſiderable Advantages the <hi>Muſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites</hi> might have gained thereby, thoſe Endeavours have all been fruitleſs. Be not, therefore, deluded, the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> have no ſuch Fleet in <hi>Aſia,</hi> the Rumour is groundleſs, and only publiſhed with a View of impoſing upon the World. But if they actually had ſuch a Fleet, I know not the leaſt Benefit they could receive from it. It cannot be ſaid to be intended for Commerce, ſince their Trade conſiſts only in Salt Fiſh, which is vended at <hi>Aſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can.</hi> Nor have we more Reaſon to believe, that they propoſe to make Uſe of it, in defending, in Caſe of Neceſſity, the Conqueſts they have made in <hi>Perſia,</hi> as they can neither land on the Coaſts of the Province of <hi>Kilan,</hi> nor on a great Part of thoſe of <hi>Schirvan.</hi> The Water is too ſhallow on the former, and the Ground of the latter is by no Means fit for any Ship to Anchor in. It would be more
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:0653500404:363"/>
adviſable for the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> to keep a good Army on Foot, in thoſe Parts, than to have a Fleet there; for, unleſs they reſtore that Country voluntarily, it is to be preſumed, that the former Poſſeſſors will not fail to ſurprize them, and force them to return what they have made themſelves Maſters of, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Laws of Nations.</p>
               <p>I had almoſt forgot to tell you, that there is, on the <hi>Caſpian</hi> Sea, a Kind of ſmall Fleet mann'd by the Subjects of the <hi>Muſcovite</hi> Empire, I mean thoſe bold and reſolute Pirates, the <hi>Coſacks</hi> of <hi>Jaick,</hi> who, during the Summer Seaſon, cruize, with a large Number of Barks; on the Eaſtern Coaſts of that Sea. They pillage and ranſack whatever they meet with; and as the Spoils theſe People make are their only Support, they know neither Friend nor Ally, where their Interest is concerned; nay, it frequently happens, that they have no Regard for the <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> who fall into their Hands. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps it is to theſe Barks the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> have given the Appellation of a Fleet, and in that Caſe I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but agree with them, that they have one: I ſhould only deſire them to explain their Meaning more clearly, when they publiſh News of that Kind, and not endeavour to impoſe on the Publick.</p>
               <p>I did not intend, Sir, to detain you with ſo long Digreſſions, and ſhould be at a Loſs to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for my being thus tedious. Are not all theſe beautiful Objects, which my Chamber-Windows preſent to my View, the Occaſion of it? But the Enquiry is hardly worth the Labour, and beſides,

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Should be glad to know, what you think of my long Silence. You have undoubtedly ſuppoſed me once more loſt, or at leaſt, that I have met with ſome freſh Adventure. But be not uneaſy, Sir, neither of theſe is the Caſe. You need only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect the deplorable State I have been reduc'd to, and then you'll not find it difficult to gueſs at the Cauſe. Whoever, like me, has had the Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune to ſwallow a large Doſe of Poiſon, cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect but to lead afterwards a lingring Life. I ſtill continue weak, and am hardly able to apply my ſelf to any Thing. I was ſome Days ago ſeiz'd with ſo great a Heavineſs, that I thought I had loſt the Uſe of all my Limbs. My Mind ſeemed on that Occaſion to receive Impreſſions from my Body, and appeared as it were annihilated. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, I aſſure you, conceive the Cauſe of theſe Symptoms, and very much doubt, whether the moſt able Phyſicians can account for them. But moſt certain it is, that they muſt have been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by ſome ſubtle Poiſon, known only to the <hi>Muſcovites.</hi> But why do I tire you with this ſhock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Subject. Let us mention it no more. For I ought perhaps to think my ſelf happy in feeling the Effects of it.</p>
               <p>In my laſt, I informed you, how I diverted my ſelf in my Priſon. I ſpent my Time there, as I
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:0653500404:365"/>
told you before, ſometimes in making ſerious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections on the State of my Affairs, and ſometimes in conſidering on Means, whereby to deliver my ſelf from my Captivity. I was at a Loſs what Courſe to take, and knew not what to rely on, when I received Orders to prepare to appear before the Senate. This agreeable News I received on the 18th of <hi>June.</hi> Be pleaſed, Sir, to take No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of this Epoch, which, as I believe I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved before, is very remarkable. Having been conducted to the Senate-Chamber, I there ſaw an Aſſembly of ſeven or eight Lords, all ſitting round a Table, and ſeeming to expect me with ſome Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience. I was ſo far from being intimidated at the Sight of theſe Gentlemen, that it encouraged me to approach them without being dejected, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing the leaſt Submiſſion. They gave me a very cold Reception, in a Manner ſeemingly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed. They hardly dared to lift up their Eyes. After a Moment's Silence, one of them, who had formerly been condemn'd to the Scaffold, to leave his Head in the Hands of the Executioner, was the firſt, who ſpoke, and accoſting me, told me in <hi>Italian,</hi> that, as they were informed, that I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded a Hearing, they had ſent for me, to know what I had to alledge in my own Behalf. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that as I ſaw no End of my Impriſonment, nor could conceive the Motives of ſo tedious and inſupportable a Captivity, I had reſolved, three Months before, to preſent a Petition, whereby I deſired to be heard what I had to ſay in my Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification. That I now re-iterated the ſame De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and that the Juſtice of my Cauſe, and the Equity of the Aſſembly, removed all Doubts of not obtaining an immediate and entire Satisfaction. But replied he, what is your Deſign, what is it you intend to write? Nothing, anſwered I, but what is neceſſary to juſtify my Proceedings and
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:0653500404:366"/>
Conduct. Could you not, ſaid he, do this by Word of Mouth, and what induces you to deſire, to do it in Writing? I told him, I was at that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant ready to vindicate my ſelf, if they thought fit: But that I believed, I could repreſent Things to them in a clearer Light, in Writing, and that they might then make their Report of it to the <hi>Czarina,</hi> from whom I had Reaſon to expect im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Redreſs. This they were obliged to put to the Vote, and to conſult among themſelves, what would be moſt proper in this Caſe. After having made me wait a long Time, they told me at laſt, I ſhould have Neceſſaries for Writing, and that, the next Morning, they would receive my Plea. I returned them Thanks, and promiſed to begin it immediately, and be ready for the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Hour. Being aſked by one of thoſe Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, whether I underſtood no other Language but the <hi>Italian,</hi> I anſwered that I was likewiſe verſed in the <hi>French;</hi> whereupon he deſired, I would likewiſe draw up a Copy of my Repreſentation in that Tongue.</p>
               <p>No ſooner was I returned to my Priſon, than I was ſupplied with all Things requiſite for writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and inſtantly begun to draw up my two Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies. As I had not much Time to ſpare for the Completion of this Work, I was obliged to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peditious, and the Length, together with the Stile of it, may give you Room to judge how great a Hurry I was in. No one appeared the next Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to fetch my Paper, nor was it ſent for, till the Day following. Such are the Proceedings of the <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> they act in every Thing with an unheard of Slowneſs, and I thought my ſelf well off, to find, that it was not poſtponed for ſeveral Weeks.</p>
               <p>I beg leave here to tranſcribe this Writing entire, and to ſend it you very near the ſame, as it was
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:0653500404:367"/>
preſented to the Senate, though you have, in my preceding Letters, already ſeen a Part of what was contained therein. I ſhall be glad in the Sequel to know your Opinion of it, and whether the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons I there alledge were not ſufficient for my Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</p>

                     <p>"I ſet out from <hi>France,</hi> about the Beginning of the Year 1733, <hi>ſic jubente fata.</hi> All <hi>Europe</hi> was then in a profound Peace. The principal Motive of my Departure from that Country was, to avoid a Marriage, which I ſhould have been inevitably obliged to. I travelled through <hi>Germany,</hi> without being provided with any Paſs, or being ever aſked for one in any Place what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever. Being arrived at <hi>Dantzick,</hi> I was forced to make ſome Stay there, till I could meet with the Convenience of a Ship, to carry me to <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terſburg,</hi> whither I intended to go. I lodged at the Houſe of an <hi>Italian,</hi> named <hi>Brunati,</hi> who then lived at <hi>Dantzick,</hi> and continued there dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my Stay in that City. As I propoſed to be there <hi>incognito:</hi> I pretended to be an <hi>Italian</hi> Merchant, and went by the Name of <hi>Roccaforte.</hi> When I was juſt going to leave that Place, I was told, that I muſt provide my ſelf with a Paſs, and that it was abſolutely neceſſary, as I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for <hi>Ruſſia.</hi> I applied hereupon to the Magiſtracy of <hi>Dantzick,</hi> and to the Perſon who is entruſted with the Direction of the Affairs of <hi>Ruſſia</hi> in that City."</p>
                     <p>"Thus provided with two Paſſes, I departed from <hi>Dantzick,</hi> and arrived at <hi>Peterſburg</hi> about the Middle of <hi>June.</hi> My Landlord recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me, by Letter, to the Acquaintance of Mr.
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:0653500404:368"/>
                        <hi>Mariotti.</hi> To this Gentleman I freely opened my Mind, and acquainted him with my Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of entring into military Service. I told him, that I was not a Merchant, but a Soldier, and a Perſon of Diſtinction. As I was determined not to diſcover my real Name, I took Care to paſs by no other, but that of <hi>Roccaforte.</hi> Mr. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riotti</hi> apprized me of the great Difficulties I ſhould meet with in the Execution of my Deſign, but when I told him, that Mr. <hi>Avolio</hi> had offered me his Service, he promiſed to ſend for him to his Houſe, and to treat with him on that Head. We met all three at the appointed Hour, and thoſe Gentlemen being both of the ſame Opinion, I was obliged to think of ſome other Expedient."</p> 
                     <p>"I was ſoon fixed in my Choice, and determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to go in Queſt of Employment into <hi>Perſia.</hi> I had been informed, that the Prince of <hi>Heſſe-Hom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg,</hi> commanded there, and, as I was not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of his many excellent Qualities, I had Room to think, that he would grant me his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection. This Reſolution was confirmed by a ſingular Adventure, which at the ſame Time cauſed me to haſten my Departure. As her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty was one Day returning from a Review, which had been taken on the Meadow, on the ſide of her Summer-Palace, I was walking along the little Canal, which ſeparates the Meadow from the Garden, and there I ſat down, with a Book in my Hand, at the Root of a Tree. Whilſt my Mind was wholly intent on what I read, Her Majeſty, accompanied by only three or four Perſons, came into a Walk of the Garden, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly opoſite to the Place where I ſat, without my perceiving her. One of that Princeſs's Reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue came at the ſame Time to the Banks of the Canal, and made Signs to me to riſe, telling me, that Her Majeſty was there. I immediately
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:0653500404:369"/>
obeyed, and after having made a very low Bow, I retired ſome Steps backwards, with a Deſign to depart. The ſame Perſon, who had ſpoken to me, returned, in the very Inſtant, and aſked me, by her Majeſty's Command, whether I was an <hi>Italian?</hi> I anſwered, <hi>Son Italiano</hi> (I am an <hi>Italian</hi>) and inſtantly retired. I was greatly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed, not being able to comprehend, how the <hi>Czarina</hi> could take me for an <hi>Italian.</hi> Had not the Canal hindered me from approaching that Princeſs, I ſhould perhaps have taken Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of ſo lucky an Incident, and have thrown my ſelf at her Feet, to beg ſome Employment of her, ſince I was in ſo great an Uncertainty of obtaining any elſewhere."</p>
                     <p>"I went, after this Adventure, to Mr. <hi>Mariotti,</hi> and begged of him to procure me an Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of departing ſpeedily, I ſold, in the mean Time, Part of my Equipage, to have where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal to bear my Charges. As I had Occaſion for a freſh Paſs, I went my ſelf to the College of Commerce, to aſk for one, which they granted me by the ſame Name of <hi>Roccaforte.</hi> Whilſt I was employed in making Proviſions for my Journey, I was informed, that ſome Profeſſors of the Academy were preparing for an immediate Journey to <hi>Caſan,</hi> from whence they were to go to <hi>Kamtschatki.</hi> This Opportunity was too favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to be neglected; I therefore made Enquiry directly, to whom I muſt apply my ſelf, to be admitted into their Company. I was recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to Mr. <hi>De l'Iſle,</hi> whom I thereupon viſited. This learned Profeſſor gave me a very kind Reception. He told me, he was not to go the Journey himſelf, but that his Brother was. Having applied to him, he approved of my Reſolution, and promiſed me all the Service in his Power. The two other Profeſſors received
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:0653500404:370"/>
me with equal Civility. Having got every thing ready for my Journey, Mr. <hi>Dela Croyere</hi> ſent me a Meſſage, to come to his Houſe, with all my Baggage, in Order to depart the next Day. Our Journey was, nevertheleſs, delay'd, and Mr. <hi>De l'Iſle</hi> and his Wife took me, in the mean Time, in the moſt obliging Manner imaginable, into their Houſe. I diſcovered to Mr. <hi>De l'Iſle,</hi> in the Converſation I had with him, my earneſt Deſire of undertaking the Journey to <hi>Kamts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chatki,</hi> but being informed, that I muſt apply to the Senate for that Purpoſe, I thought no more of it. It would have been impoſſible to remain unknown, as I deſired to be, if I had applied to the Senate. Some other Difficulties occurring, with Regard to my Journey with the Profeſſors, I reſolved to ſet out before them, with only one Servant, whom <hi>Monſ. de la Croyere</hi> had been ſo kind as to give me."</p>
                     <p>"I met theſe Gentlemen at <hi>Bronnits,</hi> from whence I continued my Journey with them to <hi>Caſan.</hi> At my Arrival, I immediately made Enquiry whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any Ship was ready to fail for <hi>Aſtracan.</hi> The Seaſon being too far already advanced, my En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries were in vain. In this Juncture, I thought of another Expedient, and having met with a ſmall Veſſel, which ſeemed to be convenient, I had reſolved to embark in it. The imminent Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, I was going to expoſe my ſelf to, was ſo plainly repreſented to me, by thoſe, to whom I communicated my Deſign, that they, at laſt, prevailed upon me to alter my Mind. After having well weighed the Matter, I thought it more convenient to take the Journey by Land, and to wait ſome Time longer. As I had heard a very good Character of the Governour of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſan,</hi> I thought it my Duty to pay my Reſpects to him. When I accoſted him, I gave him my
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:0653500404:371"/>
Paſs, and, acquainting him with my real Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, I told him, that I was nothing leſs than a Merchant, and that I thought it a Matter of lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Importance to the Publick to know my real Name and Condition, that I was determined to repair to <hi>Perſia,</hi> and to offer my ſelf to the Prince of <hi>Heſſe Homburg,</hi> to ſerve under him, in Her Majeſty's Troops. He bemoaned my Fate, and, at the ſame Time, promiſed to procure me the firſt Opportunity for my Departure. He deſired to know my Name, and took it down in Writing. Having aſked his Leave to viſit him now and then, he replied, he ſhould look upon it as an Honour; and aſſured me I might rely on his Protection."</p>
                     <p>"Having taken this Step, I went to <hi>Monſ. de la Croyere,</hi> reſolved to acquaint him with what had paſſed. But, I was hardly got into his Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when the Major of the Place came to arreſt me, by the Governor's Order, and ſeized my Sword. Nothing was found about me, or in my Trunk, which could give any Grounds for Suſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion. In ſhort, after three Days, I was carried to <hi>Muſcow,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Peterſburg.</hi> All theſe Circumſtances being well averred, and there being none of them which can admit of the leaſt Doubt, the next Enquiry is, whether there was any Room to ſuppoſe me a Criminal, or that I had any other Intention, than that of being employed in Her Majeſty's Service. This En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry may be made in the following Manner, which will, at the ſame Time, give ſufficient Proofs for my Juſtification."</p>
                     <p>"I obſerved above, that I quitted <hi>France,</hi> at the Beginning of the Year 1733, at a Time, when all <hi>Europe</hi> was in Peace. This firſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark is an inconteſtable Proof, that I could not be charged with any ſecret Commiſſion from the
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:0653500404:372"/>
Court of <hi>France,</hi> to the Prejudice of that of <hi>Ruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia.</hi> But ſuppoſing even, that I had not left <hi>France,</hi> till after the Face of Affairs was changed in <hi>Poland,</hi> by the Death of King <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> can it be preſumed, that I ſhould be made Choice of, at ſo important a Juncture? Ought I, not, on the other Hand, to have taken other Meaſures, than thoſe, which it is evident I did take, and ſhould I not have been more cautious, and reſerved in all my Proceedings? My Behaviour was certainly not like that of a Perſon, who endeavoured to impoſe upon others. How can any one, more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, be ſuppoſed to be an Emiſſary, who is not in the leaſt acquainted with the Language of that Country, to which he is ſent, and neither provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with any Retinue, nor even with an Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter? Perſons, entruſted with the Management of State-Affairs, are, I believe, ſeldom ſent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a foreign Country, without being furniſhed with Money, or, at leaſt, Credit. But I came into <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> without either. This laſt is a moſt convincing Proof, and merits ſome Regard. But let us go yet farther, and examine all my Steps."</p>
                     <p>"The ſole Motive of my Departure from <hi>France,</hi> was to avoid a Marriage which I muſt otherwiſe have engaged in. That I quitted upon no other, but ſome ſuch Inducement, is ſufficiently proved by the Manner, wherein I retired from all the World, from my moſt intimate Friends, and from my Domeſticks, abandoning, at the ſame Time, all I poſſeſſed. I know not, whether a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Enquiries have been made after me, but if there has, there can have been no other Anſwer, but that I diſappeared at the Beginning of 1733, and that none had ſince been able to get Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, whither I was retired, It is well known, what Reply I made to the Queſtion, which was put to me at Her Majeſty's Palace, when I was
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:0653500404:373"/>
ordered to name the Perſon, who was the Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of my Flight. I told the Gentleman, who was ſo inquiſitive on that Head, that the Sex claimed a particular Reſpect, though it often merited not our leaſt Regard. I here beg leave to add, that if a Declaration of that kind could even procure my Liberty, or ſave my Life, I ſhould not conſent to make it; and were I to be guilty of ſo baſe an Action, I ſhould think my ſelf deſerving of the moſt rigorous Treatment from Her Majeſty. But what, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all, would a Confeſſion of that Kind avail? It would be needleſs for me to name the Perſon my ſelf, if the Affair is publickly known, as others may be applied to for that Intelligence. But if, on the contrary, this Adventure is not come to any one's Knowledge, if I am the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Perſon acquainted with it, I think my ſelf obliged in Honour and Conſcience to keep it ſecret. But ſuppoſing, I ſhould name the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, would my Confeſſion be credited, or would ſhe herſelf be applied to, to relate the Correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondence that had been between her and me? Should the Boldneſs or Inſolence be carried ſo far, I believe the Attempt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> would be fruitleſs, and turn to the Confuſion of him who ſhould make it."</p>
                     <p>"It ſeems needleſs to make any Mention here of my Journey through <hi>Germany,</hi> ſince moſt of the States, through which I paſſed, are her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's Allies and Confederates. I ſhall only take Notice of my Stay at <hi>Dantzick,</hi> where I was known to the Gentleman who there adminiſters the Affairs of <hi>Ruſſia.</hi> I led a very retired Life, in that City, and converſed, to the beſt of my Knowledge, with no other Perſon, there, but thoſe of the Houſe, where I lodged. I went a few Days after my Arrival, to pay a Viſit to
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:0653500404:374"/>
Her Majeſty's Reſident in that City, I even had frequent Opportunities of ſeeing him, afterwards, and from him I received a Paſs at my Depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. If all theſe Proceedings be conſidered, can it be inferred from hence, that I was, at that Time, charged with any ſecret or dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Commiſſion?"</p>
                     <p>"Let my Behaviour at <hi>Peterſburg</hi> be next ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined. I repaired, on my Arrival into that Capital, to Mr. <hi>Mariotti,</hi> to deliver a Letter, which had been given me, and begged at the ſame Time, he would procure me a Lodging near his Houſe; I then, according to the Cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the Country, carried my Paſs to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtracy, before I went to my Lodging; when I went from thence to the Cuſtom-Houſe to take out my Baggage, I met with <hi>Monſ. Avo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio,</hi> who oſſered me his Service. As that Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman was not acquainted with me, he imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately enquired, what Profeſſion I was of, and whether I was not come to <hi>Peterſburg</hi> with a View of following that of a Fencing-Maſter. I anſwered, ſmiling, that I knew how to uſe my Sword, in my own Defence, but was not a Perſon who would inſtruct others in that Art. He then, in very obliging Terms, repeated his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers of Service, but I told him, that I could not accept of them yet, but ſhould, in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quel, be glad of the Honour of a longer Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation with him. Let any one judge, by theſe Circumſtances, whether I endeavoured, at that Time, to be concealed, as was, without Grounds, intimated in the Examination I paſſed in Her Majeſty's Palace. But let us view what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed. I took Mr. <hi>Mariotti</hi> aſide, the next Morning, and fully entruſted him with the Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation of my Affairs. The only Secret I was unwilling to diſcloſe to him, was, my real Name.
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:0653500404:375"/>
As I was determined to enter into Her Majeſty's Service, I took his Advice, how to proceed in that Caſe. When he endeavoured to repreſent the great Difficulties I ſhould meet with in my Deſign; I told him, that <hi>Monſ. Avolio</hi> had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered me his Service, and that I doubted not, but he would act in my Behalf; in ſhort, in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference I had with theſe two Gentlemen, they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed in their Opinions, that my Project could not ſucceed. Hereupon I reſolved to go into <hi>Perſia,</hi> and deſire no other Favour of them, but that of recommending me to their Friends. Is any one of theſe Circumſtances capable of ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Suſpicion of my being an Emiſſary?"</p>
                     <p>"During my Stay at <hi>Peterſburg,</hi> I own that I paſſed by a fictitious Name, but did not, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, conceal my ſelf from any one, and every Body there might judge of every Step I took. I frequented the Houſe of Mr. <hi>Mariotti,</hi> with him I dieted, and converſed familiarly, with whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever I there met with. I never failed being at the Catholick Church, and viſiting the Fathers who officiated there, and this I did at Times when thoſe Places were frequented by a great Concourſe of People. I diſcourſed indiſcrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately with every one, owned my ſelf to be an <hi>Italian,</hi> and my being come from <hi>France</hi> was concealed from none. I walked through every Part of the City, was preſent at all Reviews, and a Spectator of all the Exerciſes performed by the Troops; I was, in fine, ſo far from endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to remain unknown, that I even expoſed my ſelf to the Eyes of the <hi>Czarina.</hi> All that can be inferred from theſe Things, is, that I concealed my Name, and, as I could not appear in a Manner ſuitable to my Birth, kept within the Bounds, to which the Situation of my Affairs had reduced me."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="143" facs="tcp:0653500404:376"/>
"When I ſought for an Opportunity of depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from thence, I was informed that the Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors were likewiſe preparing for a Journey; to theſe Gentlemen I made preſſing Inſtances, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit me into their Company, which they granted. I ſhould, without Doubt, have carefully avoided being one of that Party, had I intended to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main unknown. Satisfied with what I thought I had obtained, I retired to the Houſe of Mr. <hi>De l'Iſle,</hi> in Expectation of my Departure; here I ſaw every one who came thither, converſed with them, and, as our chief Diſcourſe generally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned <hi>France,</hi> they might eaſily gueſs, by what I ſaid on that Subject my ſelf, that I was tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly acquainted with the <hi>French</hi> Court, and had ſpent great Part of my Life in that Country. My Conſultation with Mr. <hi>De l'Iſle,</hi> about the Journey to <hi>Kamtſchatki</hi> was by no Means feigned, and I was fully reſolved to undertake it, my only Aim, at that Time, being to retire into a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try where I might live unknown to every one. Would a Perſon charged with any Commiſſion have acted a Part like this? I am plainly juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the bare Conſideration of theſe Facts."</p>
                     <p>"But to this it is objected, that taking Paſſes in a fictitious Name manifeſtly proves my Guilt. By a Regulation eſtabliſhed throughout the whole Kingdom, I could not obtain a freſh Paſs, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out producing, at the ſame Time, that which I had brought from <hi>Dantzick.</hi> Since therefore I was unwilling to be known by my real Name, I was obliged to continue to paſs for a Merchant, and to retain the Name of <hi>Rocceforte.</hi> This Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation is certainly without Foundation, and thus I reply to it."</p>
                     <p>"I could not, in the Situation I was in, and being ſo deſirous of executing the Reſolution I had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of entring into the Service, avoid a Diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:0653500404:377"/>
of my real Quality, and was obliged to profeſs my ſelf a Soldier, and to quit my Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of a Merchant. Privileges of this Kind have been always allowed to Travellers, the Law of Nations no ways oppoſe it, there is no Law that forbids it, it is authorized by the Cuſtom of all <hi>Europe,</hi> and in ſhort Princes ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times afford us Precedents of what I have done. Unleſs a Traveller applies his Paſs to a bad Purpoſe, he has never been thought criminal for making uſe of a fictitious Name. Can it be proved, that I have made any Attempt to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice the State? The publick Affairs are no ways concerned in the Change of my Name; that is my Affair only."</p>
                     <p>"But it may be again objected, what Occaſion had I to take a Paſs for <hi>Muſcow,</hi> when I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to go elſe where? This Accuſation is no better grounded, than the others; for, in the firſt Place, when I required a Paſs for <hi>Muſcow,</hi> I intended to take that Route, and ſhould actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally have done it, had not ſome new Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which I could not foreſee, induced me to change my Reſolution. In the ſecond Place, when I produced my Paſs, I was told, that it would be needleſs to take any other, and that with this I ſhould find an uninterrupted Paſſage throughout <hi>Ruſſia;</hi> and laſtly, as my firſt Paſs had coſt me five or ſix Rubles, and I was not very fluſh of Money, I thought I might diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe with purchaſing, at ſo dear a Rate, what I had no Occaſion for."</p>
                     <p>"I ſhall not enter into a Diſcuſſion of what paſs'd on my Journey from <hi>Peterſburg</hi> to <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſan.</hi> Whoever deſires to know that, need on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly peruſe my Journal on that Head, which may be found amongſt my Papers. There may be ſeen an Account of the moſt remarkable Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:0653500404:378"/>
I met with on that Journey, none of which can give any one Room to think me a ſuſpected Perſon."</p>
                     <p>"Before I conclude this State of my Caſe, it will be proper to make ſome Enquiry into my Conduct at <hi>Caſan,</hi> and this Article likewiſe merits ſome Conſideration. No ſooner was I ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived in this City, than my Friends repreſented to me a thouſand Difficulties, which attended the Voyage I was going to undertake; they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated the bad Seaſon of the Year, the Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers I was going to expoſe my ſelf to, the Want of convenient Boats, and at laſt prevailed upon me to make a much longer Stay in that City, than I had propoſed. Not thinking it, in the mean Time, proper to paſs for an unknown Perſon, I went to viſit the Governor, and opened my Mind to him. I frankly told him who I was, repreſented to him the Situation of my Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, acquainted him with my Deſigns, begged he would grant me ſome Perſons to ſerve for Guides, and, that he might have no Room to doubt of my Sincerity, offered him my Sword, and told him, that I was ready to be his Priſoner, till he could be better informed of my Quality."</p>
                     <p>"This would certainly have been the moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudent Step I ever made, had I intended to engage in any Undertaking contrary to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts of <hi>Ruſſia.</hi> I was beſides under no Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of going to pay my Reſpects to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor. I might even have been at <hi>Aſtracan</hi> before that Time, by only hiring a ſmall Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel in any of the Cities I paſſed through, which would have carried me thither much ſooner, than by the Way of <hi>Caſan;</hi> where I was oblig'd to make a long Stay. Nothing hinder'd me, moreover, from ſetting Sail immediately after my Arrival at <hi>Caſan,</hi> ſince I met with a
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:0653500404:379"/>
ſmall Veſſel, and many People offered me their Service to conduct me either by Land or Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. But inſtead of laying hold of theſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences, I unfortunately went to viſit the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor, who inſtantly cauſed me to be Arreſted, and afterwards to be caſt into Priſon. Such was my Adventure at <hi>Caſan,</hi> and it was that occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned my Detention."</p>
                     <p>"The laſt Thing I have to ſay in Vindication of my ſelf is, that had I known my ſelf guilty of any Crime, I could many ways have avoided being carried from <hi>Caſan</hi> to <hi>Peterſburg;</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could have been more eaſy. For I may venture to ſay, without injuring my Guard, that they were willing to allow me a reaſonable Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and placed an entire Confidence in the Promiſe I had given them, not to endeavour making my Eſcape. I regarded them rather as my Servants, than as my Guard. Their Arms and my Sword were always in my Sled, and in Caſe of Neceſſity, I could have made Uſe of them. I was entirely at Liberty in the Night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, which my Attendants always ſpent in a profound Sleep. I might eaſily have taken my Flight, whilſt I was among the <hi>Scheremiſs-Tartars,</hi> and have retired to a Place of Safety. Beſides, had I been willing to offer Violence, Courage would not have been wanting, I might have eaſily routed my three Soldiers. As for thoſe, who conducted me from <hi>Muſcow</hi> to <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terſburg,</hi> they hardly deſerve to be mentioned. Let it ſuffice for their Character, that they were Drunkards, and notorious Thieves, who robbed me of whatever they could. As they were nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cloathed nor armed, nor behaved, in any other Reſpect, like Soldiers, I know not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I may properly regard them as ſuch. If I was guarded by theſe Scoundrels on my Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:0653500404:380"/>
to <hi>Peterſburg,</hi> it muſt be imputed to my own Willingneſs, as they were undoubtedly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of keeping me Priſoner."</p>
                     <p>"The Juſtice of my Cauſe is ſo plainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated by theſe ſeveral Facts, that I doubt not of obtaining my Liberty ſo ſoon as they are ſubmitted to Her Majeſty's Judgment. The Piety, Juſtice and Clemency of that Princeſs is ſo well known to me, though a Stranger, that I am aſſured, ſhe will never ſuffer a rigorous Impriſonment to be inflicted on a Perſon, who came into her Dominions with no other Deſign, than that of devoting the remaining Part of his Life to her Service. Moſt certain it is, that ſince the firſt Minute of my Captivity, I have been treated with as much Severity as if I had acted openly to the Prejudice of the State."</p>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>This, Sir, is the Hiſtory of my Captivity; I leave you to judge, upon this Account, of the Juſtice of my Cauſe. Declare your Opinion ſincerely, and tell me without Ceremony, whether you think me guilty? Ought I, do you think, to be detained in Priſon, to be ſent into <hi>Siberia,</hi> or to be reſtor'd to my Liberty. I am ſo well aſſured of your Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Equity, and of the Evidence of the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons I here alledge, that I doubt not of your decid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Matter inſtantly in my Behalf. I ſhall tell you in the Sequel the Event of this Memorial.</p>
               <p>As I expected ſoon to know my Fate, after I had delivered this Writing, my Thoughts, in my Priſon, were wholly employed upon procuring ſome ſafe Retreat, where I might paſs my Time agreeably. Retirement and Eaſe were now the only Objects of my Wiſhes. I was in the mean Time greatly perplexed in making Choice of a Place for my future Abode. <hi>France,</hi> the fineſt Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try in the Univerſe, repreſented itſelf to me with moſt attracting Charms, but the Adventure, which
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:0653500404:381"/>
cauſed my Departure from that pleaſant Abode, ſuffered me not to ſatisfy my Inclination. All, I could hope for, was, to live there unknown in ſome retired Place, till ſome fortunate Event could give another Turn to the State of my Affairs. I ſhould have formed a Project very different, had I been in a better State of Health. As I was not far diſtant from <hi>Poland,</hi> I ſhould have taken the Reſolution to go thither in Queſt of Employment. O! with what Pleaſure ſhould I then have em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced an Opportunity of bearing Arms againſt the <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> my greateſt Enemies! They have giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en me Provocations more than ſufficient to prompt me to a Revenge of all the bad Uſage I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from their Hands. But unhappily for me, by reducing me to a Condition, which leaves me no Room to hope ever being able to bear the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigues of War, they have deprived me of that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction. My Strength could not but be ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated, and my Health entirely deſtroyed, by the Uneaſineſs oſ Mind, which they continually gave me, by the Hunger, which they obliged me to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour ſo long a Time under, and by the Poiſon they gave me.</p>
               <p>I diverted my ſelf with all theſe pleaſing Hopes, though I was not yet aſſured of obtaining my Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty. And I had really Reaſon to fear, that they would propoſe to me to remain in <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> and to ſerve in the Army. A Propoſal of this Kind would, I confeſs, have involved me in a freſh Perplexity. I ſhould, on the one Hand, have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver prevailed upon my ſelf to paſs my Time in <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> and a Refuſal of their Offer, might, on the other, have been very dangerous. But leſt I ſhould be put to a Non-plus, in Caſe they ſhould make that Propoſal, I reſolved to excuſe my ſelf on Account of the infirm State of my Health, which diſabled me from bearing Arms.</p>

                  <pb n="149" facs="tcp:0653500404:382"/>
This Reſolution being taken, I had nothing to do but to be eaſy, and wait with Patience for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever might befal me. I ſhall ſend you many more Particulars, by the firſt Courier, but you muſt not yet expect to hear an End of my Misfortunes.</p>

Which of us two is the moſt to be pitied? Which has moſt Cauſe to wiſh my Liberty? The Abſence of a Friend, who always had, and ſtill retains a moſt tender regard for you, is, I muſt own, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting. But, however doleful your Condition may
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:0653500404:383"/>
be, mine is much more ſo. You have, at leaſt, the Comfort of being able to eaſe your Mind a thouſand Ways; but my Fate is very different from yours. Confined in a narrow Priſon, I ſee no one, to alleviate my Grief, and am, at this very Time, uncertain whether I have more Grounds for Hope or Fear. You deſire to know the final Term of my Miſeries, as if it were in my Power to fix it. I pleaſed my ſelf indeed with the Hopes of ſeeing them ſpeedily ended, but an Accident, which has juſt happened, has in a Meaſure fruſtrated all my Deſigns. Give me Leave to relate this Cataſtrophe, and the Manner how it came to my Knowledge.</p>
               <p>The Deſire I had of being thoroughly acquainted with the Publick Affairs was one Day revived, when early in the Morning I ſeveral Times heard the Noiſe of Cannon. I would not however have you think it uncommon to be entertained in this Country with that Kind of Harmony. We are every Week diverted with ſeveral Diſcharges of the Artillery. The Revielle and Tap-tow are always expreſſed by firing Cannon, and the Time of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing to Court is made known in the ſame Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. A ſurprizing Quantity of Powder is conſumed in this City. It is made uſe of on all Days of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing, which are here very frequent, on all Feſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivals, and on innumerable other Occaſions. It may, perhaps, be intended to ſtifle the terrible Noiſe and Uproar made at thoſe Times by Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards. But let us leave this Conjecture, and enquire into the Reaſons of a Diſcharge of the Cannon ſo early. As this was neither the Reveille nor the Tap-tow, nor was it the Time of Reſorting to Court, I im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately concluded, that ſome extraordinary Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident muſt have been the Occaſion of it. The Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation of the Affairs of <hi>Poland,</hi> at that Time, gave me directly ſome Suſpicion, and as I was highly concerned for thoſe Matters, I could not be
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:0653500404:384"/>
at Eaſe till I was farther informed. Above all, I feared this Event, be what it would, might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice my Affairs, and, at the ſame Time, fruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate all my Hopes.</p>
               <p>The Sequel but too plainly proves how well my Fears were founded, but I was not apprized of the Matter ſo ſoon as I wiſhed to be. In vain I asked my Guard, and begged they would inform me of what had happened. I found it impoſſible to get any Intelligence. I prevailed upon one of them to go and enquire, what it was; but he ſoon returned as wiſe as he went. I was very uneaſy all that Day, and ſpent it with an Impatience I am not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to. My Corporal, who was my chief Steward, came the next Day and told me, with a ſmiling Countenance, that the City of <hi>Dantzick</hi> was ſurrendered to the <hi>Muſcovites.</hi> I was thunder-ſtruck at this News, which I could never have expected, it ſurprized me, and gave me very uncommon Emotions. Having, however, recovered my ſelf a little, and taken Time to conſider, I begun to doubt of the Truth of the Fact. I aſked my Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral, whether King <hi>Staniſlaus</hi> was taken, but of this he pretended to be intirely ignorant. His An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer ſerved only to encreaſe my Uneaſineſs. Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bious of the Condition, to which that Prince might be reduced, I begun to bemoan his Fate, I entreated the Corporal to go out immediately, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure an exact Account of all the Circumſtances of that great Event, and give me a Relation of what he could learn. In order to encourage him to a faithful Diſcharge of his Commiſſion, I gave him ſome Pieces of Silver, and promiſed him more on his Return. But neither this little Preſent, nor my Promiſes, were prevalent enough to make him more ſpeedy; he did not return till the next Day, when he informed me, that King <hi>Staniſlaus</hi> had been taken out of a Cellar, where he lay concealed. This
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:0653500404:385"/>
ridiculous Circumſtance made me not give Credit to his News. And how could I with any Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility imagine, that King <hi>Staniſlaus</hi> would ſuffer himſelf to be ſeized in that Manner? He added, that ſeveral <hi>French</hi>-Men had been taken Priſoners, and would ſoon be brought to <hi>Peterſburg.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Several other Circumſtances he related ſeeming as improbable, made me ſuſpend my Judgment upon the reſt. But nothing convinced me more than a ſecond Diſcharge of the Artillery, which I took for a clear Demonſtration. I then no longer doubted of what had been told me. I believed, that King <hi>Staniſlaus</hi> was really fallen into the Hands of the <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> and that the <hi>French</hi> were made Priſoners of War. All this put me into ſo great a Diſorder, that my Guard began to perceive it. You know how zealous I have been, and always ſhall be, for the Intereſt of <hi>France.</hi> I feared, on the other Hand, that this Diſaſter of the <hi>French</hi> would give ſome fatal Turn to my Affairs, and prove an Obſtacle to my wiſhed for Releaſement. I not only found, that the <hi>Swedes</hi> were out of the Queſtion, but likewiſe that the Project which I had before formed, of retiring to the Houſe of ſome Foreign Miniſter, could not be executed without great Danger, and running the Hazard of being impriſoned for the reſt of my Life. I was well enough acquainted with the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> to know, to what Exceſs of Inſolence one fortunate Event could carry them. Whilſt they are in Proſperity, they neither regard the Laws of Nations, nor pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Faith, nor, in ſhort,
<q>
                     <l>Quoecunque Altaria tangunt.</l>
                  </q>
As I had given my Corporal a freſh Commiſſion to enquire after all the publick News, he informed me, that the ſecond Diſcharge of Artillery was, as
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:0653500404:386"/>
well as the former, on Account of the taking of <hi>Dantzick,</hi> that the <hi>French</hi> Priſoners were arrived at <hi>Cronſtadt,</hi> that the Commander in chief, and a large Number of Officers, were already arrived at <hi>Peterſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg,</hi> and laſtly, that they were that Day to dine at Court. He added, that King <hi>Staniſlaus</hi> was not taken, but, as it was certain, that he was ſtill in <hi>Dantzick,</hi> he would not fail of being made Priſoner, as the <hi>French</hi> were, and that he could never find Means of eſcaping from the narrow Search that was made after him. I had now no longer Room, to doubt of the Truth of the greateſt Part of theſe Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, tho they all appeared very ſtrange to me. How, ſaid I, within my ſelf, could ſo ſtrong a City as <hi>Dantzick,</hi> a Place ſo well defended, fall into the Hands of the <hi>Ruſſians?</hi> Is it poſſible, that the <hi>French</hi> Troops could ſurrender themſelves Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners of War, and that King <hi>Staniſlaus</hi> could neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect repairing to ſome Place of Safety?</p>
               <p>The Advice, my Corporal had given me, of the Arrival of the <hi>French</hi> Officers at <hi>Peterſburg,</hi> raiſed in me an exceeding great Deſire of ſeeing them, and, to obtain this Satisfaction, I placed my ſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly at my Windows, in Hopes of ſeeing ſome one by Chance paſs by my Priſon. In this I hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to ſucceed, and ſaw the chief of them in Her Majeſty's Coach; I knew them even by their Aſpect, but could not poſſibly diſtinguiſh any one of my Acquaintance. I met ſoon after with an Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of ſatisfying my Curioſity. Mrs. <hi>De l'Iſle</hi>'s Cook being recovered from his Indiſpoſition, paid me a Viſit; I immediately aſked him a Thouſand Queſtions about the preſent State of Affairs, and tho he was not able to ſatisfy me in every Point I enquired after, yet he acquainted me thoroughly with many Things, which I was before ignorant of, and which I had not been able to learn either of my Guard, or their Corporal. He informed me that
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:0653500404:387"/>
King <hi>Staniſlaus</hi> had fortunately made his Eſcape from <hi>Dantzick,</hi> but that nobody yet knew what was become of him: That the <hi>French</hi> Troops, which were come to the Relief of <hi>Dantzick,</hi> had been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſed, and obliged, after ſeveral fruitleſs Attempts, to capitulate, they not being numerous enough to render their Enterprize ſucceſsful. I wiſhed earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to know what Steps the <hi>Swedes</hi> had taken, and what paſſed in other Parts of <hi>Poland,</hi> but my Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligencer could not ſatisfy my Curioſity on either of thoſe Heads.</p>
               <p>He confirmed, in a ſecond Viſit, his former Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, that King <hi>Staniſlaus</hi> was no longer at <hi>Dant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zick,</hi> and that he was thought to be in Safety in ſome Part of the King of <hi>Pruſſia</hi>'s Dominions. Tho the Situation of that Prince's Affairs appeared to me very melancholy, I could not but eſteem him happy in having delivered himſelf from ſo imminent a Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and eſcaped all the Purſuits of the <hi>Muſcovites.</hi> I could hear nothing of the <hi>Swedes,</hi> but that they continued very peaceable, without determining in Favour of either Party, or that any one could pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate their real Deſigns. He told me the Names of the <hi>French</hi> Officers, who had been taken Priſoners, and, among others, nam'd <hi>Monſ. de la Motthe,</hi> who was at the Head of them, and is an old Acquaintance of mine. I leave you to jndge, how much I lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Fate of thoſe Gentlemen, who are thus reduced to the Neceſſity of giving up their Swords into the Hands of the <hi>Muſcovites.</hi> Strange Fate! that Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers ſo brave, as they, ſhould be obliged to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to Slaves ſo vile! I cannot here omit the Recital of a Story, which I have heard, and appears to me very ſingular, if we may venture to give Credit thereto. In the firſt Interview the <hi>French</hi> Officers had with the <hi>Muſcovite</hi> Generals, the latter, addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing themſelves to <hi>Monſ. de la Motthe,</hi> expreſſed a very great Surprize, that the <hi>French</hi> ſhould attack
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:0653500404:388"/>
their Intrenchments without a ſingle Diſcharge of Cannon. To this, <hi>Monſ. de la Motthe</hi> is ſaid to have replied; that was a common Method with the <hi>French.</hi> The <hi>Muſcovite</hi> Generals, if this Story be true, muſt certainly know very little of the preſent Method of making an Attnck; and for their better Inſtruction on that Head, it might not be amiſs to ſend them, into <hi>Poland,</hi> ſome of thoſe <hi>Carabiniers,</hi> who were at the Battle of <hi>Guaſtalla.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Cook, from whom I received my Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences, informed me, moreover, that the Articles of Capitulation granted to the <hi>French</hi> Troops had been violated, and that the <hi>Marquis de Monti</hi> had, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the ſacred Character, wherewith he was inveſted, been put under Confinement. Had any other Nation, beſides the <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus'd of theſe Proceedings, I readily confeſs, I ſhould not have ſo eaſily given Credit to the Report of them: But I was thoroughly acquainted with the Conduct and Policy of thoſe Gentlemen, and not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant that nothing was to them either venerable or ſacred. Was not, therefore, my Cenſure juſt. When I obſerved before, that the <hi>Muſcovites, Quaecunque Altaria tangunt,</hi> whilſt fluſhed with Succeſs. This may be called a glorious Beginning of a War. To break through the principal Articles of a Capitulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to arreſt an Ambaſſador, and to detain him, ſo long, under a rigorous Impriſonment! Are not theſe Things without a Precedent, in a civilized Nation? Are they ſo very blind, that they cannot perceive the Irregularity of their Conduct? The Time may come when they will perhaps have Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to repent of it. Thoſe, in whoſe Hands the Adminiſtration of Affairs in that Country is, ought, in my Opinion, to proceed with more Circumſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. If they will have no Regard to the Honour of the Nation, or its Intereſts, they ought at leaſt to have the Glory of their Sovereign at Heart, and not
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:0653500404:389"/>
expoſe it in ſo flagrant a Manner. They have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed on Her Majeſty, by their evil Counſels, to commit an Act of Injuſtice, not only unparalleled, but wholly inconſiſtent with her natural Candour. And what can be more vile, than to treat a brave Officer, who is only guilty by having ſerved his Maſter with Fidelity, in ſo worthleſs a Manner? Have they any Thing to alledge againſt his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct? And with what Views do they thus detain him? If I may give Credit to what I have been told at <hi>Dantzick,</hi> the Impriſonment of that Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter crys for Vengeance, and this Action muſt be looked upon as the blackeſt and moſt unjuſt, that can be perpetrated. The Inhabitants of <hi>Dantzick</hi> inform me, that he kept within the Bounds of his Miniſtry, and ought he conſequently not to meet with the Treatment preſcribed, in that Caſe, by the Law of Nations. But let us, for a Moment, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe he actually had exceeded the Bounds of his Character, muſt he, for that, be deprived of all Liberty? He would, in any other Country, if he had required it, have been ſet free, on his Parole of Honour. But the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> do not act in this Manner, they obſtinately perſiſt in the Practice of their barbarous Cuſtoms, and little Regard what other Nations would do, in a parallel Caſe. It is accounted a Crime in the Marquis <hi>De Monti,</hi> that he ſhewed ſo great a Zeal for the Service of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and was ſo firmly attached to the Prince, to whom he was ſent. I ſhould expatiate too much on this Affair, were I to make all the Reflections it would admit of: I proceed, therefore, to what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates to my ſelf, which I intend for the Subject of this Letter.</p>
               <p>After having exhauſted my Intelligencer's whole Fund, I drew from him a Promiſe to viſit me oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and give me an exact Account of whatever he could learn. This honeſt Man did really exert himſelf,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:0653500404:390"/>
on this Occaſion, and was of great Service to me, during the whole Time of my Captivity. The Pleaſure I received from hearing the publick News, did not, however, abate the earneſt Deſire I had to recover my Liberty. To my Sorrow I found, that no Anſwer was made to my Repreſentation, tho it had been ſo long preſented. The firſt Mention I heard of it was by my Steward, who told me, a Report was current, that I ſhould ſoon be releaſed. This News I the more readily believed, as I thought, that after I had ſo clearly vindicated my ſelf, they had no farther Reaſon to detain me in Priſon. I was afterwards informed, that my Memorial had been referred to the <hi>Czarina</hi>'s Cabinet Council, and that from thence I was to expect a final Determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The Members of the Senate, as, I think, I obſerved before, are regarded only as mere Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derlings, entirely under the Influence of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, who are Foreigners. Theſe latter govern with an abſolute Power, all is under their Management, and their Diſpoſal; and this gave me Room to think, that from them I was to expect my Liberty.</p>
               <p>My Affairs were retarded by the <hi>Czarina</hi>'s De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture into the Country, for the Summer-Seaſon. Her Majeſty was accompanied by the whole Court, and the Miniſters of the firſt Rank. At this Time, I was once more obliged to remove to another Priſon. I was carried to the very Place, where the Senate aſſembles. This removal occaſioned me to remark in my Journal, that I had been led <hi>ab Herode ad Pilatum,</hi> I might have added, <hi>a Pilato ad Calvari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um:</hi> For, after all the Miſeries I had undergone, I had only this laſt Step to take. The Motive, that induced them to remove me from my former Priſon, very plainly demonſtrates, how little they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned for my Life. The Members of the Senate being apprized, that the Houſe, where they met, was in a ruinous State, thought proper to quit it, and
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:0653500404:391"/>
to aſſemble in that, wherein I was confined. What think you, Sir, of this Expedient, to rid themſelves of a Man, whom they had already obliged to paſs <hi>per ignem &amp; aquam,</hi> but both without Succeſs. They probably thought, that after I had withſtood Poiſon, endured the Fatigue of a long and toilſome Journey, laboured under Famine, and all the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries, I had been expoſed to, they had no other Means left of haſtning my Death, than by burying me alive under the Ruins of an old decayed Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Their black Deſign, happily for me, proved abortive; for Providence, which had hitherto, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt miraculouſly, preſerved my Life, continued ſtill favourable to me, and ſo diſpoſed Matters, that what was intended to be the Cauſe of my Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, turned to my Advantage, and ſerved only to render my Confinement more agreeable.</p>
               <p>I ſoon found my ſelf beſet, in my new Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by all kinds of Artificers, Architects, Joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, Carpenters, Maſons, and other ſorts of People, who were continually going in and out of my Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. With Pleaſure I ſaw ſo great a Concourſe of People, which, at any other Time, would have been troubleſome to me. I made frequent Enquiries, what Condition the Building was in, and whether I was not in Danger of being cruſhed under the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ins of it: Thus I continued in conſtant Fear, though I was told I might depend on my Safety. I enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained no great Opinion of the <hi>Muſcovite</hi> Architects, and the Perſon, to whoſe Direction this Work was entruſted, appeared to me not the beſt qualified, to judge of the Danger, I was expoſed to. As he ſpoke <hi>Italian,</hi> I was curious to know by what Means he learnt that Language. He told me, he had travelled into <hi>Italy,</hi> and, on his Return, entered into the Service of an <hi>Italian</hi> Architect, who had inſtructed him both in his Language and Art. His Skill in the latter was not ſo great, that I could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:0653500404:392"/>
on his Word; I therefore examined every Part of the Building my ſelf, and, with a Plummet in Hand, ſhewed my unexperienced Engineer thoſe Places which were in the moſt ruinous Condition. He complyed pretty readily with my Directions, and it happened fortunately for me, that he followed them, in Regard to the Arched Roof of a large Hall, which ſtood in Need of Shoring: For had he executed his firſt Plan, and neglected the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures I pointed out to him, that Roof would certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have fallen, and drawn after it the other Parts of the Building, which were all in a tottering Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Employments of this kind, on which I ſpent the beſt Part of my Time, afforded me a very great Pleaſure. I may truly ſay, that the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> are very ignorant of any Thing relating to Edifices of Stone, but muſt do them the Juſtice, to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that they are very expert in whatever relates to Carpentry. They know the Uſe of no other Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but the Axe, and this they handle with ſo much Dexterity, that not a ſingle Nail is made uſe of in the Structure of their largeſt Houſes. Theſe Buildings are made of large Pieces of Timber, join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together, in ſuch Manner, that, in Caſe of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, they may, without much Trouble, be looſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened, and afterwards replaced as they were before. Hence you may eaſily judge, that all theſe Buildings are portable. Whoever is minded to remove from one part of the City to the other, immediately lays his Houſe on Carts, and tranſports it, with little Expence, wherever he thinks fit. All Buildings in <hi>Muſcovy</hi> are erected in this Manner, excepting ſome Churches, and moſt of the Convents of the Monks, who always take Care to be the beſt accommodated every where. I have even ſeen ſome fortified Cities, the Walls of which are only made of Wood. Houſes of this Kind, in ſo rigid a Climate, as that of <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covy,</hi>
                  <pb n="160" facs="tcp:0653500404:393"/>
may be thought to be as cold, as Ice-Houſes; but I'm convinced, by Experience, of the direct con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, and can aſſure you, that they are all very warm, nay even hot to Exceſs. <hi>Muſcovy</hi> may, in this Regard be eſteemed not a cold Country, as it is generally ſuppoſed, but a Country abounding with Fire and Smoak. There is hardly a Houſe in <hi>Ruſſia</hi> where the Heat is not intolerable, in the Winter, as well as the Summer. We may therefore very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably conclude, that this contributes not a little to render the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> lazy and ſluggiſh.</p>
               <p>You ſee, Sir, how little my Troubles hindered me from making Obſervations in <hi>Muſcovy.</hi> I might extend them yet farther, on the Manners of the <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covites,</hi> as well as their Cuſtoms; but I fear, I ſhall engage in too many Subjects at once, and thereby neglect the principal Occurrences of my Captivity. Give me, therefore, leave to return to what more nearly concerns my ſelf.</p>
               <p>Whilſt I employed my ſelf in Architecture, my Steward informed me, that my Releaſement was now talked of in good Earneſt, and that I had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do, but to be of good Heart. <hi>Monſ. de L'Iſle</hi> and his Spouſe ſent me Word, at the ſame Time, that they thought my Affairs in a very good Situation, and that they did not doubt of ſeeing ſpeedily my Troubles at an End. But the Joy, I conceived, at hearing this agreeable News, was of a ſhort Duration. I was ſoon afterwards told, that I muſt not hope for any Anſwer to my Memorial, till her Majeſty's Return. I had enough to do, to appeaſe the firſt Tranſports into which this ſecond News threw me, but Reaſon at laſt got the better, and gave me Reſolution, patiently to expect what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever might befal me.</p>
               <p>I received, in the mean Time, numerous Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents from Mrs. <hi>De L'Iſle,</hi> who frequently ſent me her Cook. This generous Lady loaded me with
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:0653500404:394"/>
her Benefactions, and uſed her utmoſt Efforts to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leviate the Burden of my Captivity. Her Cook, for his Part, neglected nothing that might give me a clear Inſight into the moſt important Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions of <hi>Europe.</hi> By his Means, I learned, that two notable Battles had been fought, thoſe of <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonto,</hi> and <hi>Parma,</hi> and that the Surrender of <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lipſburg</hi> was hourly expected. Such Succeſſes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joiced me extreamly. I could not, however, but ſecretly envy the immortal Glory, acquired by ſo many brave Officers of my Acquaintance. He, likewiſe, told me, that King <hi>Staniſlaus</hi> was in Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty at <hi>Konigsberg,</hi> that the taking of <hi>Dantzick</hi> had neither weakened nor dejected his Party, and that this City would be reſtored for a Sum of Money. I never doubted, but the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> would exact exorbitant Sums from the Inhabitants of <hi>Dantzick,</hi> which I knew to be the principal Object of their Enterprize. I was informed, moreover, by the ſame Meſſenger, that all the <hi>French</hi> Officers were ſet out for <hi>Narva,</hi> where the Priſoners of War were guarded by two Battalions of <hi>Muſcovites.</hi> An ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental Thought came, on this Occaſion, into my Head, which you perhaps will regard as ſtrange and whimſical. I had been aſſured, that the <hi>French</hi> Troops made a Body of about two thouſand Men, a Number little inferior to that of the <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> by whom they were guarded: I was not unacquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the intrepid Courage of the former, and too well convinc'd of the Cowardice of the latter, and the bad Diſcipline they are under. Having conſidered theſe Things, I ſaid within my ſelf, might not the <hi>French</hi> Priſoners find Means to cut off their Guard, to diſarm and maſſacre them, and then to force themſelves a Paſſage, thro the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. I was not ignorant of the Difficulty which muſt needs attend the Execution of that Enterprize: But the Place occupied by the <hi>French,</hi> near <hi>Narva,</hi>
                  <pb n="162" facs="tcp:0653500404:395"/>
has always been fertile in extraordinary Events, and I was confirmed in my Opinion by recollecting the Retreat of ten thouſand <hi>Greeks,</hi> under <hi>Xenophon.</hi> The <hi>Greeks</hi> of thoſe Days were certainly not more valorous than the <hi>French</hi> now, and the Route theſe latter muſt take to arrive at a Place of Safety, is not by far ſo long as that, taken by the former. The <hi>French</hi> would thereby have acquired immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Glory, and the Retreat would have gained as univerſal an Applauſe, as the World to this Day gives to the ten thouſand <hi>Greeks</hi> commanded by <hi>Xenophon.</hi> Let me entreat you, before you cenſure this Scheme as impractible, to examine in the Maps, whether the Route, which the <hi>French</hi> muſt have taken to join the Troops of King <hi>Staniſlaus,</hi> would have rendered the Undertaking utterly impoſſible. Had they exerted their Valour, and undergone ſome Fatigues, I am well aſſured they would ſoon have executed this important Enterprize. As for the <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> by whom they were guarded, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could have been more eaſy, than to have got rid of them, and was you as well acquainted with that Nation, as I am, you would be entirely of my Opinion. But to convince you yet more of what I here advance, permit me to add a Word or two more, of the Military State of <hi>Muſcovy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As I ſuppoſe you to be already acquainted with their Battalions and Squadrons, I ſhall not take Notice of either of them. They conſiſt of a large Number of Soldiers, but of very few Officers. All theſe Soldiers have of late been very well cloath'd, and their Arms are pretty good, except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Swords. They retain, notwithſtanding this, a certain Air, which is by no Means to their Advantage, and which none of them have ever been able to ſhake off. They make a wretched Appearance, and are far from being dextrous. They are well enough made, very robuſt, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageouſly
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:0653500404:396"/>
ſhaped, but they are, if I may Uſe the Expreſſion, lifeleſs Bodies which are not put in Motion, without great Difficulty. As for their Diſcipline, they are conſtantly exerciſed, and handle their Arms pretty well: But when they come to give Fire, their Emulation only conſiſts, in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to make the moſt Noiſe, without ever concerning themſelves, whether they hit the Mark, or their Shot is loſt.</p>
               <p>They have always appeared to me very much embarraſſed, when they perform their Evolutions.</p>
               <p>Nothing ſurprizes me more, than to ſee what a Value they ſet upon their Grenadoes; for not a Day of Exerciſe paſſes, but they throw a prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Number of them, and they take a particular Care to chooſe the moſt able Men for Grenadiers. They have hardly any Regard for their Swords, and all that I have ſeen, in the Hands of my Guard, during the whole Courſe of my Captivity, are round-pointed. I could not forbear ſmiling at the Manner whereby they account for this: Thoſe pointed Swords, ſay they, are uſeleſs, as long as we have Bayonets. Poor, ignorant Wretches, not yet to know what Uſe may be made of a Sword! The <hi>Swedes</hi> have, nevertheleſs, formerly taught them the Benefit of this Weapon, which I wonder to find they have ſo ſoon forgot. It is not my Deſign here to cenſure this their Cuſtom, as 'tis not very material, how they Act, provided they know, how to make an Attack, and to defend themſelves.</p>
               <p>But this is not all. The <hi>Muſcovite</hi> Troops diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover neither Emulation, Valour, nor Conduct, Qualities, inſeparable from a good Soldier. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Officers, nor Soldiers, are ever ſeen to aim at diſtinguiſhing themſelves by any conſpicuous Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Neither one nor the other have any Motive for engaging in Military Service, but that of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:0653500404:397"/>
the Orders of their Sovereign. Thus have I ſhewn you, in few Words, what Idea we can have of the <hi>Muſcovite</hi> Troops. I have formerly told you their Number, let us now therefore exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine what regards their Maintenance.</p>
               <p>The Apparel of the <hi>Muſcovite</hi> Troops is pretty good, but their Pay is very bad. Thoſe, who are garriſoned at <hi>Peterſburg,</hi> have only an Allowance of Bread, and about fifteen <hi>French Deniers per diem.</hi> Thoſe, who are in the Inland Countries, are obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to be contented with only ſeven or eight <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niers,</hi> a very poor Pay indeed. The Allowance of the Officers is likewiſe, very moderate, and far from being ſufficient to enable them to keep a tolerable Table. However trifling this their Pay may ſeem, it ſuffices nevertheleſs for them, and a larger Salary would be needleſs. The <hi>Muſcovites</hi> are content with a very little. Their ordinary Food is only Bread, with a little Salt, and ſome Water. When they have no Bread, they eat Peaſe, Beans or Vegetables. They are out of Danger of being ſtarved with Hunger, for if they are deſtitute of Bread, Meat and Pulſe, they can browſe upon Graſs, and eat all kind of Roots, without the leaſt Inconvenience attending it. Bodies ſo robuſt might form excellent Troops, were it poſſible to inſpire them with other Souls, and other Minds. The Horſes in <hi>Muſcovy</hi> are endued with very near the ſame Qualities as the Men; for they feed upon whatever they meet with, and are not the leſs vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous.</p>
               <p>Hence you may judge, how eaſily a good Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, at the Head of the <hi>Muſcovite</hi> Troops, might ſupport his Army; he would neither ſtand in need of Bread, nor Cattle; a few Pulſe, ſome Herbs and Roots would be more than ſufficient, and theſe Proviſions may be had every where, with little Trouble and Expence. 'Tis happy for the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:0653500404:398"/>
Nations, that thoſe Troops will never be able to render themſelves formidable, and though their Fame in <hi>Europe</hi> is at preſent very great, yet the Time will come, when their Weakneſs and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potence will be univerſally known. There are not wanting thoſe, who for ſome Time paſt have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd too favourable an Opinion of this Nation. There was hardly a ſingle <hi>Muſcovite</hi> Soldier, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Siege of <hi>Dantzick,</hi> who had ever ſeen a Muſket fired, and the World has nevertheleſs load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them with Praiſes, which they by no Means de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve. People may entertain what Notion they pleaſe of theſe Soldiers, but I ſhould be glad to ſee their Performances in a Battle, and till then, I ſhall hardly be inclined to beſtow any Encomiums on them. I believe, they may ſtand their Ground, for a Time, for they are ſturdy enough; but, at the ſame Time, it is more than probable, they will not be for fighting. <hi>Peter</hi> I. after the Battle of <hi>Narva,</hi> where all his Army was routed, was thoughtful of an Expedient to hinder his Troops from taking to their Flight, but could find no better than that of forming a kind of ſecond Line, behind each Battalion and Squadron, whom he ſtrictly enjoined, to fire upon every one, that ſhould be ſo cowardly as to retreat. This Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caution will, in all Probability, be ſtill made Uſe of, to force their Soldiers to ſtand their Ground, and not be ſo eaſily broken. When they ſee themſelves between two Fires, they may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times perhaps be obliged, to make a Virtue of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity. But can you imagine, that Troops, who ſtand in Need of ſuch a Spur, can ever fight with Courage and Vigour. I much doubt, or believe rather, that theſe poor <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> ſeeing themſelves between two Fires, will rather ſubmit to be maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacred and cut to Pieces, without making any great Reſiſtance. But inſtead of detaining you with

theſe Conjectures, let us rather examine the great Exploits performed by theſe Troops, ſince their coming into <hi>Poland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In my Paſſage through <hi>Dantzick</hi> I was informed, as I believe I told you before, that the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> had not diſtinguiſhed themſelves by any one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous Action, during the Siege of that City. This is ſo true, that in the Courſe of ſix or ſeven Months, they could not even gain the Outworks of the Place, though they are at ſome Diſtance from the Town, and only fenced with Palliſedoes. What valiant Deed have they rendered themſelves famous by, ſince the Surrender of that City? They have purſued, and endeavoured, by Force, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the Troops, who followed the Party of King <hi>Staniſlaus;</hi> but hitherto their Efforts have been fruitleſs. The Troops of King <hi>Staniſlaus,</hi> which the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> attempted to overthrow, hardly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Name of regular Troops. The <hi>Muſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites,</hi> on the contrary, had, in diverſe Places, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral large Bodies of Troops, in the Field, which were more than ſufficient, for a greater Enterprize. The Troops of King <hi>Staniſlaus,</hi> notwithſtanding this, keep their Ground in <hi>Poland,</hi> traverſe the whole Country, in the very Sight of the <hi>Ruſſian</hi> and <hi>Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> Armies, intercept their Convoys, and have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted, and even beat their Enemies in ſeveral Skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhes. Hence you may judge, what the Event would have been, if a Body of about fifteen thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand <hi>French</hi> Foot, had joined the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Cavalry. The <hi>Muſcovites</hi> would, beyond all Doubt, have ſoon be enrouted, and the <hi>Poles</hi> might juſtly have ſaid,
<q>

What I here aſſert would infallibly have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, and we ſhould ſoon have ſeen the <hi>Muſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites</hi> under a Neceſſity of evacuating <hi>Poland.</hi> A General who is but never ſo little acquainted with the <hi>Ruſſian</hi> Troops, would meet with no great Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty in ſubduing them. He need only to attack and preſs upon them vigorouſly, without giving them Time to recollect themſelves, and then harraſs them by Marches, and Counter-Marches, which would infallibly draw them into ſeveral Blunders. Let them but be fatigued and tired out, with conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Motion, Day and Night, for ſome Time, and you may depend upon ſeeing theſe Graſs-Eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, at other Times ſo vigorous, lye ſprawling on the Ground, and giving way to all-powerful Sleep. There is not a Nation in the World, that require more frequent and longer Sleep than the <hi>Muſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites.</hi> I am ſure, that if after they have been thus kept in Motion, an Enemy ſhould fall upon and ſurprize them, he would find them all in a profound Sleep. As they know their Infirmity in this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, they commonly take Care, to fortify their Entrenchments ſufficiently, or to gain ſome advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous Poſt. The Conduct of a General conſiſts, therefore, in this Caſe, in diſlodging and decoying them into a Place, where they may be attacked; after which, nothing farther is requiſite, than to advance towards them briſkly, with Sword in Hand, to attack them vigorouſly, and to fall upon them, without regarding their firſt Fire. And, in this Manner, they are certainly routed, beyond a Poſſibility of rallying. But I have detained you long enough on this Subject; and I likewiſe, hear a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of Artillery, which probably proclaims the <hi>Czarina</hi>'s Arrival. Rejoice with me, who am on the Point of ſeeing my Miſeries, and my Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures at an End. My next Letter will bring you nothing but agreeable Tidings. What a Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs

                  <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>EFORE I begun to write this Letter, I intended only to adviſe you, that I was freed from my Captivity, and upon the Point of quitting <hi>Muſcovy.</hi> Upon ſecond Thoughts, I altered my Deſign, and believed it proper to continue the Hiſtory of my Captivity, and to inform you of the Iſſue of my Adventures. The Peruſal of this laſt Letter will, perhaps, give you Cauſe to be ſurprized at the Conſtancy, with which I have undergone ſo many different Trials, as would, perhaps, have thrown any one, but my ſelf, into Deſpair; I have many a Time earneſtly wiſhed you an Eye-Witneſs of the Evils I have ſtruggled with, and of the Heroick Courage with which I have born them. I am not induced to ſpeak in this Manner, either out of Preſumption, or with any Deſign of attracting your Praiſes: The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity, you Honour me with, is ſuch, that I may tell you my Mind without any Diſguiſe, and you know me ſo well, that you cannot think me capable of deceiving you. I am not ignorant, and I think it my Duty to acknowledge, that the Hand
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:0653500404:402"/>
of the Almighty, after having humbled me, has graciouſly vouchſafed me Relief, to prevent my total Fall. 'Tis the ſame Hand, that looſened my Chains, after having ſuffered me to be bound with them, and after a rigid Captivity has ſet me at Liberty, that, in fine, after having led me to the very Brinkof the Grave, has reſtored me, as it were by a Miracle, to my Health. Theſe Calamities, which I have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone, ſeem, by a providential Diſpoſition, to have been intended to recall me from my paſt Errors. <hi>Hinc omne Principium, huc refer exitum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to continue the Sequel of my Adventures, and leave theſe Reflexions. In my laſt I informed you, that it had been ſignified to me, I could not be releaſed from Priſon, and obtain my entire Liberty, till the <hi>Czarina</hi>'s Return, and that, with the utmoſt Impatience, I waited for the happy Moment. This gave me Room to hope, that my Liberty would then, in good Earneſt, be thought of. I found, nevertheleſs, maugre all theſe Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, no ſmall Difficulty, to bring my Affairs to an End. I could not conceive how they could be ſo long put off, after having been in the Hands of ſuch eminent Miniſters. The Matter was not of ſo great Importance, but they might have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in one Day. The only Points they had to examine, were, whether I was to be deemed a Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal in <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> for having had an Adventure in <hi>France,</hi> and whether I ought to be detained Priſoner, for having travelled by a fictitious Name? Theſe were, in Reality, all the Crimes I could be accuſed of, and for which I had been arreſted.</p>
               <p>Whilſt I was thus in Hopes every Minute of being ſet at Liberty, I was ſeized with a freſh Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper, which was the more fatal, as I had not then perfectly recovered my former Strength. A certain kind of Wine, which had been given me to drink, without my perceiving immediately that it was da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maged, cauſed this Indiſpoſition. I was ſoon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:0653500404:403"/>
to a very pitiful State. My Sickneſs was vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent, it increaſed daily, and I had no Proſpect of any Remedy. Since they were ſo cruel, as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe me a Phyſician, at a Time, when I ſtood yet more in Need of one, I could not expect they would grant me that Favour now. After having, for ſome Days, endured the moſt exquiſite Pains, I found my ſelf at laſt neceſſitated to demand an Interpreter.</p>
               <p>I obtained one at Length, after many Prayers and Intreaties, who came to me on the 18th of <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember.</hi> Take Notice, I beſeech you of this Epoch, and recollect, what I mentioned of it formerly. I thought proper to acquaint this Perſon with my Condition: I told him, that I had Occaſion for a Phyſician, and ſhould be glad, if Mr. <hi>Du Vernoi,</hi> Profeſſor of Anatomy, might be permitted to viſit me. I had the Pleaſure, the next Day, of ſeeing Mr. <hi>Du Vernoi</hi> come into my Priſon, accompanied by my Interpreter. I leave you to judge how much I rejoiced to ſee him. I thought my ſelf happy in being allowed to converſe with a reaſonable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, a Satisfaction, I had not enjoyed for a very long Time. His Preſence only was in Part my Cure: But I repreſented my Caſe to him, and he aſſured me, that I ſhould have all the Aſſiſtance I might ſtand in Need of. The Interpreter, who ſtayed with us, whilſt I diſcourſed with this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, acquitted himſelf of his Commiſſion, with a moſt ſurprizing Dexterity. He had doubtleſs been charged to hearken attentively to whatever was ſpoke, in Order to make his Report of it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards: For, when I chanced to drop a few <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi> Words, which were unintelligible to him, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to know what I ſaid. I ſatisfied his Curioſity, and even added, that I had no Secret to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate to any one, and that the only Thing I had long earneſtly wiſhed for, was, to inform the <hi>Czar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ina,</hi> and her Miniſters, of all my Affairs. Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:0653500404:404"/>
is really carried to too great a Height in <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> even in Matters of the leaſt Importance.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Du Vernoi</hi> retired, after a pretty long Viſit, with a Promiſe to return, and keep me Company all the next Day. This Favour, which I little ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, occaſioned me to think, that I ſhould now meet with different Treatment, and not fail of being ſoon ſet at Liberty. But theſe Hopes, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared ſo well grounded, were of a very ſhort Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. Mr. <hi>Du Vernoi,</hi> who had promiſed to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit me the next Day, never came, and in vain I expected him the Day following; in ſhort, I ſaw him no more during my Captivity. I could never be apprized by any one what could be the Cauſe of this Diſappointment. Mr. <hi>Du Vernoi</hi> was a Gentleman of too much Diſcretion to mention it to me, but I could eaſily conceive the Motive. As I was well aſſured, that this celebrated Anatomiſt, would have performed his Promiſe, I ſoon conjectured, that he had received an Order to the contrary, of which I am perſuaded for the following Reaſon: In the Converſation I had with him, I entered into a circumſtantial Account of the Diſeaſe I had laboured under, at my Departure from <hi>Muſcow,</hi> without, however, mentioning my Suſpicion of having been poiſoned. The Interpreter, who heard, all I ſaid, may be preſumed to have acquainted the Miniſters therewith, and they being apprehenſive this My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of Iniquity would be detected, enjoined Mr. <hi>Du Vernoi</hi> to pay me no farther Viſits. To ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the Want of a Phyſician, they ſent me ſome Medicines, by an unknown Perſon. I reſolved not to make Uſe of any of their Drugs, but to wait for my Cure from the Strength of my Conſtitution only. The Relief I every Day received from Mr. <hi>De L'Iſle</hi> and his Spouſe, and which ſufficed for the beſt Part of my Neceſſities, contributed not a little to the Recovery of my Health. I may juſtly
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:0653500404:405"/>
ſay, that to them I am indebted for my Life; for, had I not met with this Succour, from their Hands, I muſt infallibly have ſunk under the Weight of my Miſeries.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Muſcovites</hi> not only refuſed me what was requiſite for my Health, as well as my Food, but likewiſe ſuffered me to be almoſt naked. This cruel Treatment obliged me once more to aſk for an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter. My Requeſt was complied with, and I deſired him to remonſtrate to thoſe Gentlemen, that <q rend="inline margQuotes">"ſince the Proofs I had given of my Innocence ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to them not ſufficiently convincing, for my Releaſement, and ſince the Motive of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Charity was not ſtrong enough to induce them to grant me the Aſſiſtance, requiſite for my Health, I hoped at leaſt, that they would ſo far regard the Glory of her Majeſty's Name, as not to reduce me to ſo miſerable a Condition, to be even deſtitute of wherewithal to cover my Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs, and that, in ſhort, they would order the Cloaths, which were in my Trunk, to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to me, for my Uſe."</q> This Interpreter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned the next Morning, and, in Anſwer to my Deſire, ſaid, that a Preſent of ten Rubles had been ordered for cloathing me. Diſſatisfied with this Anſwer, I told him, that I did not want their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and that, if they would not grant me my Cloaths, I begged they would ſend me a Taylor, whom I might order to make me what I ſtood in Need of. The Interpreter retired, and I ſaw, after this, neither a Taylor, nor my Cloaths, inſomuch, that I was obliged to remain in my Priſon half naked, tho the cold Seaſon was already pretty far advanced.</p>
               <p>It may not be improper here to take Notice, that nothing could be done without the preciſe Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Senate, and that conſequently it is they who have been the Cauſe of all the bad Treatment
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:0653500404:406"/>
I have met with. Theſe Gentlemen were, at that ſame Time, once more pleaſed to oblige me to ſhift my Priſon, and as they begun to feel the Cold in the new Apartment they were in, removed to their former Houſe, which had been repaired, and ſent me to that, which they left. This laſt Change was no Inconvenience, for I was in a larger Place, where I enjoyed a greater Tranquility.</p>
               <p>I ſilently paſs by a large Number of Occurrences of little Importance, as I hope, that this Letter will be the laſt, which I ſhall write to you; for I ſhould never have done, were I to attempt an accurate Account of every Circumſtance of my Captivity. I ſhall rather now entertain you with an Account of my Releaſement, and the Means, that were made Uſe of to procure it. I ſhall with much greater Pleaſure relate theſe Circumſtances, and inform you of the happy Hour when I heard this good News, than of the Calamities I have undergone ſince the Reginning of my Impriſonment.</p>
               <p>It was the 16th of <hi>October,</hi> when Word was brought me, that I ſhould ſoon be ſet at Liberty. This News, which was certainly the moſt agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able I ever received in my Life, was communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to me, that Day, very early, by a <hi>German</hi> Secretary, who was accompanied by an Interpreter. He told me in the <hi>Czarina</hi>'s Name, that I was releaſed, and that a hundred Rubles had been grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for my Travelling Charges. I returned theſe Gentlemen Thanks for the Trouble they had taken, aſſuring them at the ſame Time, that I ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive whatever ſhould be offered me, by Her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's Order, with a moſt profound Deference. They aſked me then, whether I had any further Commands, to which I replied, that I deſired no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, but that they would prepare the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Paſſes for my ſpeedy Departure. This was all the Diſcourſe I had with thoſe Meſſengers. But
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:0653500404:407"/>
I repeated my Entreaty to the Interpreter, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure me the Key of my Trunk, in order to come at ſome Cloaths, that I might pay a Viſit to my Friends. He promiſed inſtantly to comply with my Deſire.</p>
               <p>Here I imagine I ſee you congratulating me, with a ſmiling and ſatisfied Countenance, on this happy Change, but moderate, I beſeech you, for ſome Time at leaſt, your Tranſports of Joy. This News was ſtill only an Amuſement. In vain I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, during the whole Day, to ſee them come and open my Trunk, and diſcharge my Guard. I eat nothing but a Morſel of dry Bread; for as I propoſed to Dine with Mr. <hi>De L'Iſle,</hi> I had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided nothing. The next Day I ſaw none but my Steward, who gave me ſome Victuals, without tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling me a Word of what had paſſed. At Length, on the 18th, that remarkable Epoch, I was hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oured with a kind of Ambaſſy, conſiſting of an Interpreter, three or four Clerks, and ſeveral other Perſons. The Interpreter broke Silence and ſaid, that he brought a hundred Rubles, to give me as a Preſent from her Majeſty. I anſwered, that I ſhould receive them with a profound Reſpect, and that he need only lay them on the Table. This he refuſed to do, under Pretence, that I muſt firſt count them. To this, I replied, that it would not become me to be ſo ſcrupulous in what I received as a free Gift: But he having renewed his Inſtances, and told me, that he muſt have a Receipt, I no longer heſitated at doing what he deſired. He then gave me the Key of my Trunk, which I opened in his Preſence, ſhewing him, that there were a Sword and two Piſtols. I would gladly have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed on him to diſcharge my Guard, but he gave me to underſtand, that he could not take ſo much upon himſelf, having received no Orders for that Purpoſe. He then aſked me, what Route I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:0653500404:408"/>
to take, when I departed, and whether I choſe to go to <hi>Dantzick,</hi> or <hi>Lubeck.</hi> I anſwered, that my Deſign was not to repair to either of thoſe Cities, and that I ſhould chuſe to travel by Land, not by Sea. He told me, that I would not be permitted to go by Land, and that Orders had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready been given for my imbarking.</p>
               <p>This Procedure appeared very ſingular, and even extravagant; upon which I told my Interpreter, that I would write two or three Words, to beg, that this Order might be countermanded. He told me, that he could not take any Writing from my Hands. I deſire then, ſaid I, you would tell thoſe who ſent you, that I little value my Liberty, if it cannot be granted me, but on Condition of my go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Sea, in the infirm State of Health I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to, and in ſo advanced a Seaſon, that my Life would be endangered by ſuch a Voyage, which I could never believe to be her Majeſty's Intention. Whilſt I was thus diſcourſing with him, he took Occaſion to aſk, what induced me to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe a Poſt in the <hi>Ruſſian</hi> Army. I perceived by the Manner, wherein he aſked this Queſtion, that it was only to pump me, I, therefore, gave him no other Reply, than that I did not deſire any Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, and that my Sickneſs had rendered me incapable of Service. This laſt Queſtion gave me very great Uneaſineſs, for I ſhould have been ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſorry, to be obliged to remain in <hi>Muſcovy.</hi> But thus our Converſation ended.</p>
               <p>In this Manner I was ſet at Liberty, as they called it, though I was ſtill accompanied by my Guard, of whom one had always his Sword drawn. My Steward came ſoon after the Interpreter was gone, and told me, that I muſt no longer expect to be dieted as I had been, but muſt provide my ſelf with all Neceſſaries. I was, at firſt, concerned at this News, but, when I conſidered, that Mr.
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:0653500404:409"/>
                  <hi>De L'Iſle</hi> and his Lady would not fail to continue their kind Aſſiſtances, I reſolved to acquaint them with all that had paſſed, and beg they would fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour me with a Viſit. My Steward, who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took to carry this Meſſage himſelf, apprized them of my Deſire, and they ſoon came to ſee me. <q>
                     <l>O qui complexus &amp; gaudia quanta fuere.</l>
                  </q>
This Interview made me forget all I had ſuffered in <hi>Muſcovy.</hi> I then recollected all the Tokens of Friendſhip I had received from thoſe generous Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, in order to expreſs my grateful Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments. I was ſo touched with a Senſe of their Benefactions, that I could not forbear ſhedding ſome Tears. They both anſwered the Proteſtations I made, in Terms, which ſtill augmented my Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs. After the firſt Tranſports of Joy, which Hearts ſuſceptible of a real Friendſhip always feel on the like Occaſions, Mrs. <hi>De L'Iſle</hi> was thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of giving me freſh Marks of her Benevolence. As ſhe knew, that I was on the Point of undertaking a long and fatiguing Journey, ſhe deſired to ſee the few Cloaths they had left me, and having found my Linnen in a frightful Condition, ſhe ſent the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Part of it to her Houſe to be mended, that it might ſerve me during my Journey. Could Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip be carried to a greater Height? But what far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Kindneſs did not ſhe ſhew me, even till the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Moment of my Departure! She paid me many charitable Viſits, provided me with Diet, and all other Neceſſaries, and in ſhort, omitted Nothing, wherein ſhe could be in the leaſt ſerviceable to me. Having been informed, that I eagerly wiſhed, to know what had paſſed in <hi>Europe</hi> during my Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage and Captivity, to ſatisfy my Curioſity on that Head, ſhe found Means of conveying to me all the News-Papers. The Service ſhe did me, on
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:0653500404:410"/>
that Occaſion, was one of thoſe, of which I was moſt truly ſenſible.</p>
               <p>This firſt Viſit was pretty long, and they came the very next Day again, accompanied by Mr. <hi>Du Vernoi.</hi> I told this Gentleman, that I did not, in the leaſt, doubt but he would have continued to viſit me, had he not been forbid, and that I thought my ſelf never the leſs oblig'd to him. They ſpent great Part of that Day in my Chamber, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could be a greater Satisfaction to me, than an Opportunity of converſing with ſo agreeable Company, after having been, during the Space of more than a Year, as it were deaf and dumb. I might then very juſtly ſay: <hi>Verba intermiſſa re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tento.</hi> Not a Day paſſed but they viſited me, and eſpecially Mrs. <hi>De L'Iſle,</hi> who gave me each Time ſome new Marks of her Benevolence.</p>
               <p>Nothing hindered the Completion of my Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, but the Reſolution that had been anew taken, to oblige me to go away by Sea. The Weather happened luckily for me to be very froſty at the Time of my intended Departure, inſomuch, that thoſe who had already laid out my Way, were obliged to change their firſt Deſign, and to grant what I had ſo earneſtly deſired. The River was in a few Days frozen up, and the Way to <hi>Croon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtad,</hi> which I was to have taken, was no longer practicable. Providence ſeemed deſignedly to fruſtrate all the wicked Deſigns of my Enemies, and to perform continual Miracles in my Behalf. <hi>Nemo tam pater quàm Deus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Pleaſed with the Change, which had happened, I thought of nothing more than making the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Preparations for my Departure. I only feared, the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> would find ſome Pretence or other for laying freſh Obſtacles in my Way. They had deceived me ſo often, that I could no longer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on their Word. And, indeed, though it
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:0653500404:411"/>
had already been declared to me, in her Majeſty's Name, that I was at Liberty, and that, to defray the Expence of my Journey, the Sum of 100 Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles had been given me, I was ſtill confined in my Priſon, and continued to be under the Inſpection of a Guard, who watched all my Steps. I could not, I confeſs, conceive the Cauſe of this Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: I was told, on the one Hand, that I was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely releaſed, and my Guard, on the other Side, received ſtrict Orders, not to let me go out of their Sight. I looked upon the Liberty they had given me to make uſe of my Sword and Piſtols, as a Snare, laid for me, to draw me into ſome Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, that they might have a freſh Pretence, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain me in Priſon. They ſent, beſides, many People into my Priſon, and eſpecially my late Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard, to perſuade me to enter into Service in the <hi>Czarina</hi>'s Troops. Theſe Perſons I looked upon as ſo many Spies, whom I had Reaſon to diſtruſt. However, not to provoke their Rage, I alledged the ſame Excuſes, which I had before made to the Interpreter, without expreſſing the leaſt Diſcontent at the Uſage I had received. They thought, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, that, ſince I came into <hi>Muſcovy</hi> with a View of procuring ſome Poſt in the Army, I ſhould not refuſe to accept of an advantageous Offer. But theſe Gentlemen were groſsly miſtaken, I ſhould rather have choſen to ſpend the Reſidue of my Days in a Deſart, than to live among them. This may perhaps be the Effect of Prejudice, but I look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Muſcovy</hi> as a Place of Baniſhment, where ſome few Foreigners are the only ſociable Creatures, that are to be met with.</p>
               <p>Such was the Situation of my Affairs, when Mr. <hi>De L'Iſle</hi> and his Wife, who ſtill continued to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit me, invited me to dine with them, and ſpend a Day at their Houſe. They probably knew, that Favour would not be denied me, and that I ſhould
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:0653500404:412"/>
obtain it without any Difficulty. I therefore made the Requeſt, and found it immediately complied with. My former Steward, with ſeveral others, were ordered, the firſt Day of my going abroad, narrowly to watch my Steps. Juſt before I went out of my Priſon, I told him, that I hoped I might now have a Barber, and not be at the Trouble of ſhaving my ſelf. To this he replied, that he knew not whether I could be allow'd one, but that he would go and enquire. At his Return, he told me, I might be ſhaved, but muſt leave my Sword in my Chamber. I obeyed, and went to Mr. <hi>De L'Iſle</hi>'s, where I had the Pleaſure of ſpending the reſt of the Day.</p>
               <p>I cannot expreſs the Joy, with which I was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in that Houſe, where even the Servants en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to outvie each other in rendring me their Services. I had, that Day, no Cauſe to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of the Behaviour of my Guard, but they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards carried their Inſolence to ſuch an Exceſs, that I reſolved to go out no more. At the ſame Time, I acquainted the Miniſters with all that had paſſed, declaring, that I choſe rather to continue in my Priſon, than to be thus expoſed to the abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Treatment of my Guard, who had not the leaſt Regard for me, and behaved as diſreſpectfully to the Perſons, to whoſe Houſes I was invited. As I received no Anſwer, I choſe to remain quietly in my Chamber, 'till I could obtain Leave to go abroad alone. Orders were a few Days after given to my Guard to ſheath their Swords, and to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw into my Anti-Chamber. This was the firſt Time, during a whole Year, that I had been alone, without any one to inſpect my Actions. It is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what uncommon, that a Perſon, confined to a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row Priſon, ſhould ſo ardently wiſh to be deprived of all Company: But this was, nevertheleſs, my Caſe; for an entire Solitude was to me much more agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:0653500404:413"/>
than to be always infeſted with the Company of thoſe Animals.</p>
               <p>All neceſſary Preparations were, in the mean Time, made for my Journey, and nothing farther was wanting for my Departure, but the Paſſes they had promiſed me. Some Papers, which I had been robbed of at <hi>Caſan,</hi> were ſtill in the Hands of the <hi>Muſcovites.</hi> But they were not ſo very momen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous, as to give me any Uneaſineſs. I had already, for ſeveral Days, made preſſing Inſtances for Leave to depart, but having met with no Anſwer, I wrote a ſhort Memorial, wherein <q rend="inline margQuotes">"I remonſtrated to thoſe Gentlemen, that a longer Stay would put me to greater Expences, and that I ſhould be thereby reduced to a Want of Money for my Journey. I likewiſe begged, that they would procure me Paſſes from the Miniſters of thoſe Princes, through whoſe Dominions I was to paſs, in Order to return to <hi>Italy.</hi> I deſired, in the laſt Place, that they would reſtore my Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, and, if they thought, that the ſhort Journal from <hi>Peterſburg</hi> to <hi>Caſan</hi> contained any Thing myſterious, they were welcome to keep it. I ſaid the ſame with Regard to another Paper, in which I had made ſeveral Obſervations on the <hi>Wolga,</hi> and told them, that they were extracted from <hi>Olearius.</hi>"</q> After I had finiſhed this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial, I would have given it to an Interpreter, who came for a freſh Receipt for the 100 Rubles, which the <hi>Czarina</hi> had preſented me with. But he refuſed to receive it, and I was obliged to tell him the Contents of it. I was too well acquainted with the <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> to be in the leaſt ſurprized at this Procedure, I eaſily gueſſed at the Inducements they had not to hear me. Give me Leave to acquaint you with this whole Affair, which is of no great Honour to theſe Gentlemen.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="181" facs="tcp:0653500404:414"/>
You may remember, I told you before, that I had been robbed of Part of thoſe Cloaths and Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, which were locked up in my Trunk. In or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der therefore, to prevent my coming to any Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtulation on that Head, they thought proper to forbid every Body to receive any Repreſentation or Writing from my Hands. They ſuppoſed, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Doubt, that the Sum given me, was more than ſufficient to make good the Loſs I had ſuſtained, by what had been taken from me. But they were ſtrangely miſtaken, for the Damage was very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable. This, Sir, was the only Motive, that induced them not to give Ear to me, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe the Acceptance of any Papers I might offer. Such is the Treatment, a Stranger is to expect in <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> where it is a very difficult Matter to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure Juſtice. But I was their Paſtime, on many other Occaſions, and I may truly ſay, that I was their Victim, from the firſt Hour of my Captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, till the Moment of my Departure. Beſides the many Inſtances I have given you of this, I beg leave to mention one more.</p>
               <p>More than a Month had paſſed ſince it had been ſignified to me, that I was at Liberty, and yet Icould not be permitted to quit the Country. This Slow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of proceeding made me very uneaſy, and gave me ſome Suſpicions. I feared a Propoſal of ſtaying in <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> and was not ignorant of the Danger that would attend a Refuſal of an Offer in their Troops.</p>
               <p>On the 22d of <hi>November,</hi> it was at laſt told me, I might ſet out directly. This Meſſage was brought me by my former Steward, who at the ſame Time aſked me how many Horſes I would have. I told him, that I ſhould have Occaſion for four, but was reſolved not to go, till I had received my Writings, and the neceſſary Paſſes. An Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter came, the next Day, to bring me 50 Rubles,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:0653500404:415"/>
which he had been ordered to give me, and aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red me, that the following Day was fixed upon for my Departure. I anſwered, that the Sum, which the <hi>Czarina</hi> had already been pleas'd to ſend me, was ſufficient to defray the Expence of my Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, but when he replied, that he offered me this farther Sum by Her Majeſty's Order, I could not but accept of it, with Deference, and give him a Receipt for it. I had too great a Veneration for the Name of the <hi>Czarina,</hi> not to receive moſt ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively whatever could be offered me by her Orders; otherwiſe, I aſſure you, I ſhould have flatly refus'd this Money, as I was not deſtitute of wherewithal to ſupply all my Wants.</p>
               <p>As I no longer doubted of going the next Day, after the Aſſurances I had juſt before received, I gave immediate Notice thereof to Mr. <hi>De L 'Iſle,</hi> and his Spouſe, who came directly with Mr. <hi>Du Vernoi,</hi> to ſpend the Day with me. Though I had now Reaſon to think my ſelf at the Height of my Wiſhes, yet my parting from them very much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected me. The Regret with which I left Mr. <hi>De L'Iſle</hi> and his Spouſe, was the greater, as I had no Hopes of ever ſeeing them again, nor of giving them any Tokens of my Friendſhip and Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement. Mrs. <hi>De L'Iſle,</hi> not ſatisfied with the Favours ſhe had till then beſtowed on me, would again furniſh me with a large Quantity of Proviſions.</p>
               <p>Every Thing was ready for my Departure, the next Day, which was the 24th, when a Meſſenger came and told me, that I muſt ſtill wait till the 26th, which was to be the Day of my entire Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance. My Papers were ſent me at Ten in the Morning, but they retained Part of them, with the Journal, I mentioned above. I was then aſked, when I intended to ſet out, and, having anſwered, the ſooner the better, they ſaid they would go and fetch the Horſes. As for the Paſſes which I had
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:0653500404:416"/>
ſo often demanded, they promiſed indeed, that I ſhould have them, but never performed their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe. Was not this an Inſtance of crying Injuſtice, thus to oblige a Man to travel without a Paſs, in the Situation which the Affairs of <hi>Europe</hi> were then in? Their being themſelves ſo ſcrupulous on that Head, makes me the more aſtoniſhed at it, for if a Stranger happens unfortunately to come into their Country, without being provided with one, he is ſure to be expoſed to Slavery for ſeveral Years. The only Paſs I could obtain was in the <hi>Muſcovite</hi> Language, and you ſhall ſoon ſee, what Terms it was conceived in. But I muſt leave this Subject, and proceed to an Account of my Journey.</p>
               <p>I ſet out from <hi>Peterſburg</hi> at four o' Clock, in a Sled, and took the Road for <hi>Narva,</hi> from whence having continued my Journey, with Speed and Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, I arrived at <hi>Riga,</hi> on the third of <hi>December,</hi> in the Afternoon. The Perſon who had been ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed my Guide, carried me to the Houſe of General <hi>Felkerſham.</hi> That Gentleman gave me a very kind Reception, and treated me in a Manner, that ſhewed the Difference between a <hi>German</hi> and a <hi>Muſcovite.</hi> After the firſt Compliment, he told me, that I need only appoint the Time, when I intended to continue my Journey, and he would give the neceſſary Orders. I replied, that I was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely dependant on his Pleaſure, but ſince he was ſo kind as to give me my Choice, I begged he would let me depart as ſoon as poſſible. He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered in the moſt obliging Terms, that I might go inſtantly, if I pleas'd, but that he hoped, I would, at leaſt, honour him with my Company that Night. I ſignified to him, that I was not in a Condition to accept ſo kind an Offer, and being very weary, begged he would permit me to look out for a Lodging, that I might immediately go to Reſt. After having renewed his Intreaties,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:0653500404:417"/>
he ſuffered me to go, and by his Order I was lodg'd in a Houſe near his, where he ſent me a very ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant Supper. Every Thing was prepared for my Departure the next Morning. As I had no Time to loſe, I repaired immediately to the General, to take my Leave of him, and to expreſs my moſt grateful Acknowledgments. He introduced me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Lady's Apartment, to drink a Diſh of Tea. I there found two very beautiful and accompliſhed Ladies, which made me not a little aſhamed, to appear in their Preſence, in a Dreſs little better than that of a Savage. After having breakfaſted, I I retired, very well ſatisfied with the Reception I had met with.</p>
               <p>I then ſet out with a Secretary, a well-bred Man, who had Orders to accompany me as far as the Confines of <hi>Livonia.</hi> So great a Thaw had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, that in croſſing the <hi>Dwina,</hi> I found the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a Foot deep above the Ice, inſomuch that I tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled that Day more by Water, than by Land. I lay by that Night, and when I was about to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, the next Morning, Mr. Secretary, in a very polite Manner, addreſſed himſelf to me, and paid me a <hi>Muſcovite</hi> Compliment, which he had proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly been charged with. He delivered to me a <hi>German</hi> Paſs, and told me, that, by Her Majeſty's Order, he gave me Notice, I was now entirely at Liberty, but that I was forbid ever to ſet Foot in the <hi>Muſcovite</hi> Dominions again. At firſt, this Compliment greatly enraged me, but I had a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Command over my Paſſion, to moderate it, and not to give him the Anſwer it deſerved. I only told him, that they had Room to think ſuch a Prohibition needleſs, but ſince it had been thought neceſſary, he might aſſure his Maſters, that the <hi>Czarina</hi>'s Orders ſhould be punctually obſerved.</p>
               <p>What think you, Sir, of this laſt Step? Was this a Compliment to make to a Man, whom they
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:0653500404:418"/>
had found as innocent as a Lamb? I ought to have informed thoſe Gentlemen, that, if it ſhould ever be my Fate to come into their Country again, it ſhould be in ſo good Company, that they would find it a little more difficult to ſeize my Sword, than at my Arrival at <hi>Caſan,</hi> and that I never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to appear again in <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> unleſs it was with Fire and Sword. But am I not to blame, to wiſh them Harm? Was it not a great Favour to permit me thus to go out of their Country, and did I not quit it at an eaſy Rate, after having been in Danger of being ſhut up and buried there for Life? For, by the <hi>Muſcovite</hi> Politicks, a Man is to be irretrieveably undone, after they have proceeded ſo far, as to abuſe him, as they had done me, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a juſt Pretence; unleſs they would endeavour to detain him by ſuch kind Treatment as might make him forget all that is paſt. They have therefore not uſed me with that Rigour, which is preſcribed by their Politicks, and I ought conſequently to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge my ſelf obliged to them. I am not leſs beholden to them for ſuffering me to depart: For the Life, I could have led in <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> I ſhould have eſteemed as a continual Death. They proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly thought, that an <hi>Italian</hi> could never pardon them for the bad Uſage he had received from their Hands, and, following the Maxims of a ſalutary Policy, they choſe rather to have an Enemy with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Doors, than in their own Country. They judged it perhaps likewiſe improper, to detain a Man, who would not be governed by their Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, though a Slave, and who might ſome Time or other find Acceſs to a Perſon, from whom they carefully conceal thoſe Things, which ſhe ought to be beſt acquainted with. To all theſe Motives may be added, that the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> are already burthened with many Strangers, whom they mortally hate, and that they are very unwilling to ſee any more ſettled
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:0653500404:419"/>
among them. But be that as it will, I am reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to forget them, and to abandon them to their own Remorſe; if they are capable of having any.</p>
               <p>Here I ſhould conclude my Letter, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cital of my Adventures; for, ſince the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> will not be farther mentioned, you muſt not expect to hear any Thing extraordinary, or that may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite your Curioſity. But, <hi>Reſtabat Fatis aliquid,</hi> of which I muſt give you an Account.</p>
               <p>After having left my Secretary, I proceeded to <hi>Mittau,</hi> the Capital of <hi>Courland,</hi> where I was oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſtop. As I found it impoſſible to travel any farther in a Sled, becauſe of the Thaw, I was neceſſitated there to hire a Wheel-carriage. I got one made after the Manner of the Country, to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry me as far as <hi>Memmel,</hi> the firſt City in <hi>Pruſſia.</hi> In this Journey I met with diverſe Adventures. The firſt of theſe appears ſomewhat Romantick, but is nevertheleſs very true. Being arrived, the firſt Day, towards the Evening, at an Inn, which was the only one, in a vaſt Foreſt, I was going in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly to Bed, without my Supper, the Houſe not affording any Thing. No ſooner was I gone into my Chamber, than I heard a great Noiſe at the Door of the Houſe, and fancied I heard ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body ſpeak <hi>French.</hi> I went out immediately, and having aſked whether I had not heard <hi>French</hi> ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, I was anſwered in the Affirmative. I then addreſſed my ſelf to theſe Strangers, ſaying, Come in, Gentlemen, this indeed is a very bad Inn, you will find nothing to eat here, but you will meet with a Perſon, who will be very glad of your Company. I ſaw, at the ſame Time, a Man of a graceful Aſpect entring, but as he had a large Cap on, I could not well diſtinguiſh his Face. When we paid each other our mutual Compliments of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility, I thought I heard a Voice, well known to me, and mine had the ſame Effect on him. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:0653500404:420"/>
having view'd each other attentively, we both recollected our ſelves, and embraced one another, not without being ſtruck with Surprize, at meeting in this Place. This Accident ſeemed to give him ſome Diſquiet, for he had ſtrong Reaſons, not to diſcover himſelf to any Body. He begged I would entirely forget his Name, after which we diſcourſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together, and had many Subjects to entertain each other upon.</p>
               <p>I aſked him ſeveral Queſtions very preſſingly, and he ſatisfied my Curioſity in many Points. He happened, fortunately for me, to have ſome good Proviſions, which furniſhed us a comfortable Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and then we went to Reſt. As he came from the ſame Country, which I had juſt before left, and intended to go the ſame Way, which I took, we ſet out together the next Morning, and put up at the ſame Inn at Night. When I, however, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, that he could not recover from his firſt Uneaſineſs, and found, beſides, I was a Burden to him, I reſolved to wiſh him a good Journey, and parted with him the more willingly, as my Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, being not ſo good as his, could hardly keep Pace with him.</p>
               <p>You expect perhaps ſome farther Account of this Adventure, but I am tied down to Silence, and will perform the Promiſe I made of inviolable Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecy; which, if I ſhould not, I muſt unavoidably inform you of certain Matters, which are ſtill of too great Importance. An Adventure very diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from this, will be better worth your Notice, by which you may ſee, what a Man muſt expect, who has once begun to be unfortunate.</p>
               <p>The tenth Day a general Thaw enſued, and the Roads were extreamly bad. Having met with Places, that appeared very dangerous, I ſent my Poſtilion to ſound them, and he found that they could not be paſſed with Safety. We went a great
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:0653500404:421"/>
way about in Search of another Paſſage. My Guide, who thought he had found a good one, led me into a kind of Pit, the only one, perhaps, in the whole Country, in which we were almoſt bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, with our Horſes and Carriage. It was not without great Difficulty we got out, and it was a ſingular good Fortune, that we did not loſe our Lives by this Accident. To ſuffer Shipwreck by Sea, to be caſt away in a Lake, or in a River, are Things common: Accidents of that Kind hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen daily: But to meet with that Misfortune by Land, in the midſt of arable Ground, this can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver happen to any one, but him, who <hi>Minxit in patrios cineres.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this Condition, I was obliged to travel, four or five Hours-Journey, before we came to an Inn. That we came to was tolerably good, and I was obliged to ſtay there three Days to cleanſe my ſelf. My Goods were all entirely ſpoiled, and eſpecially my Writings, which I regretted more than all the reſt. I arrived, however, the 15th at <hi>Memmel,</hi> where I was obliged to take a Sled to go to <hi>Konigſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg.</hi> There could not poſſibly be a worſe Way than this proved. The Ice was in many Places cracked, and ſometimes ſo covered with Water, that it was not poſſible to get forwards. I never, in my Life, had ſo painful and fatiguing a Journey; and I cannot better compare the Danger I was in, than to that of being obliged to ſtand one's Ground, againſt a Battery of well-placed Cannon. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, the ſame Supreme Being, who, for ſome Time, had only laid a heavy Burden upon me with one Hand, to relieve me with the other, conducted me ſafe to <hi>Konigſburg,</hi> the laſt Day of the Year 1734.</p>
               <p>When I came into the City, I found I was a Spectacle to every Body; for I pretty much reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled either the Prodigal Son, or ſome Fugitive Slave. I was carried before General <hi>Cat,</hi> who
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:0653500404:422"/>
doubtleſs perceived the Confuſion I was in, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear before him, in that Equipage, and, therefore, was ſo good to diſpatch me immediately. I took my Lodging in the firſt Inn I came at, and, at my Entrance into it, offered up my Prayers to Heaven, to vouchſafe me ſome Reſt from my La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.<q>
                     <l>Contenti noſtris, Di, precor, eſto, malis.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Being arrived at <hi>Konigſburg,</hi> I thought it was now out of the Power of the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> to give me any new Uneaſineſs: But I found my ſelf miſtaken, and met with a freſh Inſtance of their Malice and Baſeneſs. The Caſe was this. I have already told you, that at my Departure from <hi>Peterſburg,</hi> I required ſeveral Paſſes, which were refuſed me, and that they only gave me one in the <hi>Muſcovite</hi> Tongue. At <hi>Riga,</hi> they gave me another in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> of which I underſtood as little as of the former. When I came before General <hi>Cat,</hi> at <hi>Peterſburg,</hi> I ſhewed him theſe Paſſes; and notwithſtanding the powerful Reaſons which might have induced him to make me paſs a ſtrict Examination, he took no Notice of the Paſſes, but gave me Leave to go and repoſe my ſelf.</p>
               <p>The next Morning, I gave them to my Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord, who had Orders to demand them from me, and to examine them. What he did with them, I know not; but when he returned them, he aſked me if I knew their Contents; upon which, telling him, I was wholly ignorant thereof, he promiſed to get them tranſlated for me. He ſoon returned with the Tranſlations; but how great was my Surprize, when caſting an Eye upon them, I found, that the <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> not contented with having forbid me, by the Mouth of their Secretary, ever to ſet-Foot into their Dominions again, had even inſerted the ſame Compliment in their Paſſes. Tho' a long Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:0653500404:423"/>
and other ill Uſage I had already met with, in <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> had accuſtomed me to bear every Thing patiently, it was impoſſible for me to put up quietly with this. I had Reaſon to fear, that General <hi>Cat,</hi> after having ſeen the Contents of theſe Paſſes, might take me for a Perſon who had been guilty of ſome enormous Crime in <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> and had been ſhamefully baniſhed for it. This lay the heavier upon me, as I was very much tired, and withal, in Want of Money, and, therefore, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Neceſſity of making ſome Stay at <hi>Konigſburg.</hi> All my Thoughts were taken up with this prepoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous Event, which ſtruck at my Reputation. From this Moment I forgot all the other Evils I had ſuffered, the Dangers I had been expoſed to, the Captivity I had undergone, the Indignities which had been offered me; nay, the very Priſon it ſelf, which had brought me to the Brink of the Grave; all this, I ſay, was as nothing to me, in Compariſon with the melancholly State I was now reduced to. I want Terms to expreſs the Vileneſs of this Action.</p>
               <p>With this extraordinary <hi>Cataſtrophe,</hi> I ſhall fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the Narrative of my Adventures. The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance which is due to the great Intimacy and Friendſhip that is between us, has engaged me in it: But for a fuller Account of them, I muſt reſerve it till I have the Happineſs of embracing you. I am now, Dear Sir, juſt upon my Departure to be with you, ſince you invite, and ſo earneſtly preſs me to it. I ſhall once more give my ſelf up to the Mercy of an Element, which ſeems to threaten me with new Misfortunes. Heaven ſure is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked againſt me, and I fear that
