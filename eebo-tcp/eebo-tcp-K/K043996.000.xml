            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>MY LORD, AND GENTLEMEN,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>BEFORE the Legiſlature had entirely aſſented to the late Bill in favour of the Encroachments near Durham-Yard, the two following little Tracts, were drawn up with a view to prevent the Confirmation of that Injuſtice; but as they were not finiſhed time enough to be Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, with any hope of Succeſs, to thoſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0155301100:3"/>for whoſe peruſal they were at firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, I think it my Duty, in the next Place, to addreſs them to you, as they parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly relate to the Rights and Property of the City of London.—When <hi>Property</hi> is taken away from the Ancient and Legal <hi>Proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors</hi> WITHOUT THEIR CONSENT, and veſted in other Perſons, <hi>even private individuals,</hi> as their <hi>own Property,</hi> for their <hi>own private</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, by Parliamentary Authority, ſuch a Precedent will render the <hi>Property</hi> of all Men as precarious as their <hi>Party intereſt,</hi> and will enlarge the dangerous Syſtem of Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Corruption, by increaſing the means of its baneful influence.—But this is not mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, a Political evil; it is alſo <hi>immoral and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religious,</hi> in every point of view. To remove the Ancient Land Mark, or Boundary, is an <hi>accurſed Crime</hi> according to the Laws of God; (compare Deut. xix. 14. xxvii. 17. Job xxiv. 2. Proverbs xxii. 28.) ſo that <hi>every kind of wilful Encroachment</hi> upon <hi>the Property</hi> of others, is, in ſome degree, tainted with this heinous Guilt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="v" facs="tcp:0155301100:4"/>Times are bad enough, when ſuch inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions on Public or Private Property <hi>remain unpuniſhed;</hi> but the <hi>moral State</hi> of any Nation is even deplorable, and their meaſure of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity may be ſaid to be almoſt filled up, when ſuch notorious Acts of Injuſtice meet with <hi>Public Encouragement,</hi> inſtead of <hi>repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion;</hi> and when Treſpaſſers are <hi>rewarded</hi> and <hi>gratified</hi> (to the Excluſion of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured Proprietor) with a <hi>Parliamentary Right</hi> even in the very Object, which tempted them to break the Laws and <hi>wrong</hi> their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.</p>
            <p>Many well meaning People do not ſeem to be aware of the bad tendency of this exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and there is, therefore, the more neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity that it ſhould be pointed out and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed.</p>
            <p>The injuſtice appeared to me ſo notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, after I had carefully conſidered the caſe, that I ſhould have been <hi>inclined,</hi> as <hi>a Citizen of the World,</hi> to repreſent the mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous <hi>immorality</hi> of <hi>rewarding,</hi> inſtead <hi>of Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing, Treſpaſſers,</hi> (leſt the evil example
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0155301100:5"/>ſhould become epidemical and contagious in <hi>the World,</hi> which is already too corrupt) but <hi>as a Citizen of London</hi> it is even <hi>my Duty</hi> to do ſo in the preſent caſe: for when I took the Oath of Allegiance to the King, I was Sworn at the ſame time to <q>
                  <hi>maintain the Franchiſes and Cuſtoms,</hi>
               </q> of the City of London to the utmoſt of my power (ſee the Oath of every Freeman<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <q>You ſhall ſwear, that ye ſhall be good and true to our Sovereign Lord King George, obeyſant and obedient ye ſhall be to the Mayor and Miniſters of this City. <hi>The Franchiſes and Cuſtoms thereof ye ſhall maintain, and this City keep harmleſs in that that in you is, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
               </note>) and therefore, as I hope I ſhall ever be faithful to the City of London, as well as true to our moſt gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Sovereign, I eſteem it my indiſpenſible Duty <hi>to both,</hi> for the ſake of <hi>public Juſtice,</hi> to point out the <hi>illegality</hi> (as it appears to me) and dangerous tendency of <hi>Publicly reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Treſpaſſers on the Rights of this Great City</hi> with an <hi>excluſive</hi> Title to the very object of their temptation to Treſpaſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="vii" facs="tcp:0155301100:6"/>The <hi>manner</hi> of making theſe Encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments (viz. by throwing Rubbiſh into the Water without any Fence to retain it) has been as hurtful to the River as the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments themſelves, without affording the leaſt probability of any one good effect, ſaving, or convenience whatſoever, to recommend it: <hi>a method</hi> unfavourable to every purpoſe, except the clandeſtine Deſigns of Treſpaſſers, that the intended Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of their Encroachments may not ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize and alarm the Public before the Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief is carried into Execution: as for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance;—if the ſpace, which has lately been, thus gradually, ſtolen from the River near Durham Yard, had been previouſly marked off with Piles for the Boundaries of a Wharf, or with a Bank of large Chalk-Stones, or other hard Materials, not liable to be waſhed away, (as all Embankments on Navigable Rivers ought to be made) the Treſpaſs would have appeared much more enormous at firſt than by this method, which rendered the
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:0155301100:7"/>Progreſs of the growing Encroachments leſs notorious and alarming.</p>
            <p>Since theſe late Treſpaſſes began, the Bed of the River (as I have been informed by ſeveral Watermen and others, who have been well acquainted with the River for many Years) is conſiderably increaſed in Height, which is certainly occaſioned, in great meaſure, by the <hi>manner of Embanking</hi> above deſcribed.</p>
            <p>But, I am ſorry, my Lord and Gentlemen, to obſerve, that the City is as much to blame on this Account as the Encroachers; for my fellow Citizens, or ſome of them, have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered themſelves to be perſuaded, that this is the moſt eligible way of Embanking; and they have, therefore, <hi>adopted,</hi> or, at leaſt, <hi>do al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low</hi> the practice of this pernicious and <hi>ſlovenly</hi> Method, in thoſe Parts, where the Embank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is authorized; ſo that the City ſeems to betray her own Cauſe, as if ſhe really intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by ſetting this <hi>bad Example,</hi> to juſtify the like notorious Abuſe near Durham-Yard; and, thereby, render the Progreſs and Iniquity of that growing Encroachment leſs conſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:0155301100:8"/>and remarkable. It behoves the City to enquire how ſuch an inconſiſtency began: for this <hi>rude, ſlovenly</hi> and <hi>unmechanical Meaſure</hi> could not have been adopted for the ſake of ſaving <hi>either Time or Expence</hi> in the Work; becauſe it, certainly, requires a much greater Quantity of Rubbiſh than would have been really neceſſary to fill up the Space intended to be embanked! And this to the manifeſt Detriment of the River! for the lighter Particles of the Rubbiſh are conſtantly waſhed away from the Banks, every Tide, both up and down the Stream; and muſt inevitably lodge at the Bottom of the River; becauſe the Current runs, alternately, both Ways. And, for the ſame Reaſon, the boaſted Scheme of <hi>contracting the Avenue of the River</hi> will not (it is manifeſt) prevent the gradual filling up of the Bed, becauſe the Rubbiſh and Filth, that is waſhed away from the Banks at one Time of Tide, is liable to be brought back again at another; and ſo to be ſhifted, backwards and forwards, till the whole is gradually incorporated in a thick
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:0155301100:9"/>heavy Loam at the Bottom of the River; which, at length, becomes too firm to be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected or removed by the Current; and by this means the Bed will, probably, be ſo raiſed, in proceſs of time, as to render the River to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally unfit for Navigation.</p>
            <p>It is therefore, abſolutely neceſſary (my Lord and Gentlemen) to put a Stop, as ſoon as poſſible, to this ſcandalous Practice (viz. of throwing Rubbiſh into the River without a Fence to retain it) whether the Embank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are allowed to Proceed or not: but it is, certainly, more for the Intereſt of the City to <hi>cut new Docks</hi> and <hi>Receſſes</hi> from the River, and <hi>to clear</hi> and <hi>deepen</hi> the old ones, than to <hi>Embank.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are likewiſe ſome other Abuſes to which the alarming Increaſe of the River's Bed is, likewiſe, in ſome Degree, to be attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted: for beſides many other leſſer En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments that are continually making on both Sides the River, by enlarging the Banks with Rubbiſh, driving Piles, &amp;c. I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, that Rubbiſh from Buildings, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe
<pb n="xi" facs="tcp:0155301100:10"/>from the Dye-houſes, &amp;c. have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times been thrown out of Lighters into the River in the Night, in order to ſave the trouble and expence of carrying the load farther away.—I have been told this by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral perſons who have accidentally ſeen the like Treſpaſſes.—It is therefore become ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, for the future Preſervation of this Noble River, that the City ſhould offer a proper Reward to all Watermen and others, that ſhall give the firſt Information at Guild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall, or the Manſion-Houſe, of any ſuch En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments or Miſdemeanors in future. The Reward ſhould be paid when the Offender is convicted; and might, perhaps, be defrayed out of the Fine for the Offence. And the Water-Bailiffs ſhould, likewiſe, be rewarded in the ſame manner, whenever they ſhall have been vigilant enough to give the firſt Notice of any Miſdemeanor. A proper Inqueſt of Citizens ſhould be appointed out of each Ward by Rotation, or, elſe, be impanneled by the Sheriffs as a Jury (from time to time as there ſhould be occaſion) to examine the
<pb n="xii" facs="tcp:0155301100:11"/>Complaints, as ſoon as any Informations are received. And the Aſſent or Leave of ſuch an Inqueſt to any Encroachment, driving of Piles, &amp;c. ſhould not be allowed to autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rize the ſame, or put a ſtop to further En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, leſt they ſhould be in any Degree in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenced by private Solicitation, or be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe tampered with; (which has ſometimes been the Caſe on public Inquiries when Nuiſances have been preſented) but the final Determination ſhould reſt, as at preſent, with the Court of Common Council; and no Water-Bailiff, or other City Officer what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, ſhould have Power to excuſe, or tolerate, the driving any Piles, or the leaſt En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachment. For when ſuch a Power is veſted in any <hi>Officer,</hi> whoſe charge is of this nature, it is apt to deſtroy the intended utility of his <hi>Office;</hi> becauſe the more Offences and Encroachments are committed, the more Fees and Chriſtmas Compliments he will, probably, receive, and annually demand, as the Price of Toleration and Forbearance. The Office of Water Bailiff (though it affords an ample
<pb n="xiii" facs="tcp:0155301100:12"/>Proof of the ancient Juriſdiction and Right of the City of London to the River Thames, yet) has been hitherto, in general, (I fear,) rather a means of authorizing Encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, than of preventing them.</p>
            <p>I do not mean to blame the Conduct of your Water Bailiff, or of any other Officer in particular; for Cuſtom has ſo reconciled the giving of pecuniary Acknowledgments to the Water Bailiff for tolerating Encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments (as I have been informed), that the ſame are looked upon as the <hi>lawful</hi> and <hi>juſt Dues</hi> of his Office: and he does not clan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinely demand them, but openly, and, as it were, by the authority of the City; which receives of every ſuch Officer, at his appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, a very large ſum of Money, for the Purchaſe of his Office, <hi>in Conſideration of theſe Emoluments.</hi>—I ſay — <q>
                  <hi>in Conſideration of theſe Emoluments,</hi>
               </q> becauſe the ſame muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily <hi>be ſuppoſed</hi> to be known and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by <hi>the Sellers</hi> as well as <hi>the Buyers,</hi> at the Time of the Purchaſe, if the <hi>proper</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come and Value of the Office be compared

            <p>I ought not, however, to blame <hi>the City</hi> without endeavouring, at the ſame time, to obviate the Objection which ſome Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons have lately urged againſt her on the ſame Account, viz. <q>that by neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting to prevent Abuſes and Encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſhe has forfeited her <hi>Right</hi> of Conſervancy:</q> but as I have already ſhewn, in the two little Tracts, ſent herewith, that the City has <hi>a natural,</hi> as well as <hi>Legal Right</hi> to her Juriſdiction on the River, I need only add, further, that <hi>the like Plea</hi> of Forfeiture, if it were once admitted, would be equally effectual to deprive any Lord or Gentleman of his <hi>Family Eſtate and Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony;</hi> for there are but few Men, I fear who make ſo good a Uſe of their Poſſeſſions as they might, and ought; though there are very many, that would PRETEND <hi>to improve
<pb n="xv" facs="tcp:0155301100:16"/>and diſpoſe of the ſame more advantageouſly for the</hi> PUBLIC GOOD, if <hi>ſuch a Plea</hi> was ſufficient to juſtify an Attempt <hi>to diſpoſſeſs the right Owner.</hi> But to return—I do not mean to blame the City <hi>for ſelling</hi> the Office of Water Bailiff; but, rather, for not publiſhing (before it is offered to ſale) proper Conditions, Inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and Injunctions, to point out the Duties of the Office; and for not giving notice that the ſame is liable to the Penalty of Forfeiture for Mal-adminiſtration; in order that the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſer may, thereby, be enabled to regulate his Conduct agreeable to the <hi>real Duty</hi> of his Office; and may know, that he forfeits his Place, if he, wilfully, tolerates <hi>the leaſt En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachment.</hi> Were this Method obſerved, <hi>the ſelling</hi> of Places (I mean Places <hi>merely of Truſt,</hi> that don't require great Learning and Science) would be, by far, the moſt eligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble way of diſpoſal; becauſe Recommenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and great Intereſt are far from being <hi>certain Proofs</hi> of the moſt deſerving Candi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date; whereas the Purchaſe Money would be a <hi>certain</hi> and <hi>real Gain,</hi> as well as an
<pb n="xvi" facs="tcp:0155301100:17"/>excellent <hi>Security</hi> for good Behaviour. But without ſuch Inſtructions and Conditions the <hi>private Emolument</hi> of the <hi>Officer</hi> is too liable to interfere with the <hi>public Utility</hi> of the <hi>Office:</hi> whereas, by the Method which I have already ſubmitted to your Conſideration <hi>(viz. of offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Rewards for the firſt Diſcovery of Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,)</hi> every Waterman would find it his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt to take upon himſelf the Office of a <hi>diligent</hi> and <hi>inexorable Water-Bailiff,</hi> becauſe the propoſed Reward ariſes from the <hi>public Proof,</hi> inſtead of the <hi>Concealment</hi> and <hi>Tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of Offences; and there would be too many of theſe <hi>voluntary Officers</hi> to be bribed to ſecrecy.</p>

                  <hi>PART I.</hi> Some Remarks on the Caſe of the City of London with reſpect to the Encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on the River Thames near Durham-Yard, and the Bill now depending in Parliament <hi>to eſtabliſh the ſaid Treſpaſſes.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>IT cannot be denied, notwithſtanding all the deluſive Sophiſtry that hath been uſed upon this occaſion, that the City of London hath ever enjoyed and exerciſed on the River Thames a Right of <hi>Conſervancy,</hi> as well of the <hi>Width</hi> or <hi>Avenue,</hi> (by occaſionally inſpecting and regulating the Boundaries) <hi>as of the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0155301100:20"/>Fiſhery,</hi> with power and authority to remove all nuiſances; ſo that this Franchiſe, or Liberty, is abſolutely veſted in the City by <hi>Preſcription and Ancient Uſage,</hi> beſides many poſitive <hi>Grants and Confirmations;</hi>—And what Freeholder will be able to produce a more authentic Title to his Eſtate and Property! For a long proceſs of time, and a long Uſe, Poſſeſſion, or Cuſtom, which exceeds the Memory of Man, <hi>is ſufficient to conſtitute a Right,</hi> or juſt Title. <q>Longum Tempus et longus Uſus, qui excedit memoriam homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num, <hi>ſufficit pro jure.</hi>
                  </q> Principia Legis et AEquitatis, p. 55. See alſo Co. Lit. 115. There is, beſides, an expreſs Article in Magna Charta to ſecure to the City of London <hi>all her Ancient Liberties and Cuſtoms</hi> (<q>Civitas Londini habeat omnes libertates ſuas antiquas et
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0155301100:21"/>conſuetudines ſuas.</q> (Cap. 9.) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt which, undoubtedly, this Right and Cuſtom of <hi>Conſervancy</hi> is to be reckoned as one of the <hi>moſt material Franchiſes,</hi> becauſe the <hi>very exiſtence</hi> of this great Trading City depends upon it; ſo that the City's Title to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervancy is founded on <hi>a natural</hi> as well as <hi>legal Right.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The pretended conſent of the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiate Church of Weſtminſter cannot palliate the Treſpaſs, or leſſen the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury to the City of London. The Grant of King James, on which the Claim of that Church is ſaid to be founded, could not convey <hi>a power to embank and fill up the River,</hi> nor a Right <hi>to confirm ſuch a Treſpaſs</hi> when committed, becauſe the King himſelf had <hi>no ſuch power,</hi> and conſequently
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0155301100:22"/>had <hi>no right to Grant it;</hi> ſo that the Juriſdiction ſaid to extend <q>
                     <hi>infra finem aquoe to the middle of the Stream,</hi>
                  </q> muſt be conſtrued in ſome other ſenſe, or it will, otherwiſe, render the <hi>whole Grant null and void;</hi> becauſe the River Thames is <hi>a Public Avenue or Paſſage</hi> to the City; ſo that, in this reſpect, it is to be conſidered as the <hi>King's high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and it</hi> is eſteemed the King's high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way no otherwiſe than in Truſt for the Public: ſo that the King has no power to diſpenſe with an <hi>Encroachment on the highway;</hi> for though <q>
                     <hi>he may par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don Nuſances that are tranſient and not continuing,</hi>
                  </q>—Yet <q>
                     <hi>a Nuſance in the highway, which ſtill continues, and is not ended, until removed; can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be pardoned;</hi>
                  </q> (Judge Vaughan's Reports, 333.) becauſe <hi>the ſame is to be eſteemed evil and iniquitous, in its very
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0155301100:23"/>nature, a "Malum in ſe, Bad in itſelf,"</hi> which is further proved by the ſame Learned Author in P. 337. <q>I may conclude (ſays he) thoſe things to be <hi>mala in ſe, which can never be made lawful.</hi>
                  </q> He then cites the Year-Book of 11 Henry 7. viz. <q>But <hi>Malum in ſe,</hi> the King nor any other can diſpenſe.</q> And inſtanceth, <q>Si come, Si le Roy, voyloit pardon de occider un homme, <hi>ou de faire nuſance in le haut chemin, ceo eſt void,</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">To wit, if the King, ſhould be willing to pardon the Killing of a Man, (or rather, as the next ſentence explains it) <q>
                           <hi>will</hi> GIVE POWER to <hi>kill a Man,</hi>
                        </q> or to make <q>a Nuiſance in the High-Road, the ſame is void.</q>
                     </note> —and upon the ſame reaſon (ſays he) a licenſe to impriſon a Man, <hi>to take his Land,</hi> his Horſe, or any <hi>thing
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0155301100:24"/>that is his from him, is void.</hi> For in <hi>Life, Liberty, and Eſtate,</hi> every Man, <hi>who hath not forfeited them,</hi> hath a Property and Right which the Law allows him to defend; and if it is violated, it gives an Action to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs the Wrong, and to Puniſh the <hi>Wrong-doer</hi>—Therefore a <hi>Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation,</hi> that is, to make lawful the taking from a Man any thing which he may lawfully defend from being taken, or lawfully puniſh if it be, <hi>muſt be void.</hi> For it is a contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to make it <hi>lawful,</hi> to take what may be <hi>lawfully</hi> hindered from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken, <hi>or lawfully Puniſhed</hi> if it be. And that were to make <hi>two Men</hi> have ſeveral <hi>Plenary Rights in the ſame thing at the ſame time, which</hi> NO LAW CAN EFFECT: <hi>Therefore</hi> TO DO <hi>a thing which</hi> NO LAW <hi>can

               </p>
               <p>This Argument clearly proves the Impropriety of pretending a Right or Power in the Crown, or in the Church of Weſtminſter, to give their conſent for the eſtabliſhment of the Treſpaſs in the River at Durham-Yard.</p>
               <p>The Right of Conſervancy has been inveſted in the City of London from the moſt ancient Times, ſo that the King cannot reſume that Power if <hi>he would;</hi> for it is a maxim in Law, that a <hi>quiet and uninterrupted</hi> Poſſeſſion for 60 Years creates a juſt Title. <q>
                     <hi>Poſſeſſio pacifica pour Anns</hi> 60 <hi>facit Jus:</hi>
                  </q> (See Judge Jenkins to the ſame effect Cent. 26.) and, the Kings Order, Command, or Letters Patent have
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0155301100:26"/>no legal Weight, or Effect againſt ſuch a Right, for <q>
                     <hi>reſcriptum prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipis contra jus non valet.</hi>
                  </q> On the other hand, the Right of the Church of Weſtminſter to the River (even ſuppoſing that it had been law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for King James the firſt to grant ſuch <hi>a Right</hi>) is nevertheleſs forfeited for want of being claimed and put in uſe ſince that time; whereas the Right of the Citizens of London is ſufficiently eſtabliſhed (according to the Maxims before cited) by the exerciſe and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of a continual and undiſputed Juriſdiction upon the River, as being their undoubted Right and Property, <hi>ſurely</hi> for more than 60 Years laſt paſt. —<hi>And a Right or Property, thus acquired,</hi> is as valid, even againſt the <hi>Pretenſions of the Crown,</hi> as againſt thoſe of the Church of Weſtminſter, or, even, <hi>as
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0155301100:27"/>againſt thoſe of a Private Man,</hi>—for the <hi>Nullum Tempus</hi> Doctrine cannot juſtify the King's Claim to the <hi>Soil</hi> of the Thames, becauſe the Right of the Crown in Manors, Lands, Tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, &amp;c. is exactly upon the ſame footing <hi>with reſpect</hi> TO TIME <hi>as Private Freeholds;</hi> For Bracton informs us that in all ſuch things— <q>
                     <hi>currit tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus contra Regem, ſicut contra quam libet privatam perſonam.</hi>
                  </q> (Bracton de legibus et conſuetudinibus Angliae, 2d B. c. 5. P. 14.) I have thoroughly examined the Doctrine of <q>

                  </q> in a little Tract expreſsly upon that Subject, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore need not enlarge upon it here.</p>
               <p>Now as the City of London has ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired ſo firm a Title to her Juriſdiction by a quiet Poſſeſſion for 60 Years, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0155301100:28"/>to the Maxim before quoted, how unjuſt is it, at this time, to call her Right in Queſtion, when it <hi>is noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,</hi> that the ſame may as eaſily be traced back more than 10<note n="*" place="bottom">See the Charter of Richard 1ſt, C. 2d. cited in the Royal Charter of Confirmation by Charles the 2d, to the City of London, p. 9. <q>We have clearly quit claimed all that which the Keepers of the Tower of London were wont Yearly to receive of the ſaid Wares.</q>—Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Wares in the Thames to the Detriment of the City; and this Charter is expreſsly ſaid to have been given <q>for the Soul's Health of King Henry our Father, and all our Anceſtors Souls,</q> probably meaning his Anceſtors of the Norman Line, who had unjuſtly uſurped thoſe Rights.

               <p>There is, indeed, an Exception to theſe general Maxims, and that is, when the <hi>Public Benefit</hi> requires ſuch an Alienation, as for the making of Public Roads, Canals,<note n="*" place="bottom">In all the Caſes here mentioned it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary that the <hi>Alienated Private Property</hi> ſhould be veſted <hi>in the Public,</hi> or <hi>in the Crown for the Public,</hi> and not as the <hi>private Property of any Individuals whatſoever,</hi> notwithſtanding that <hi>the Public</hi> may ſeem to be benefited by their <hi>Private</hi> Undertak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.

But when the <hi>Public Property,</hi> veſted in a Body Corporate in Truſt for the <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Advantage,</hi> is clandeſtinely taken away BY ENCROACHMENT, and an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt

                  <hi>PART II.</hi> Some further Remarks concerning the Injury done to the City of London by the Encroachments on the River Thames near Durham-Yard.</head>
               <p>THE extraordinary Favour ſhewn in Parliament to the Treſpaſſes lately committed by ſeveral Perſons, in the enormous Encroachment on the River Thames near Durham-Yard, is liable to affect the Security of Property in general; becauſe an Encouragement to commit Treſpaſſes, and a Precedent to eſtabliſh and confirm the ſame, when committed, do certainly tend to the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0155301100:43"/>Total Subverſion of Juſtice; for in every point of view the ſame are repugnant to the fundamental Principles of Law and Equity.</p>
               <p>Actions were commenced in the Court of King's Bench againſt the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments, <hi>before</hi> the Treſpaſſers brought their Bill into Parliament; ſo that the Concurrence of Parliament with the Authors of the Injury, <hi>is a groſs inſult upon the Laws,</hi> by ſtopping the regular Courſe of Juſtice in <hi>a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Right,</hi> which came properly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the King's Courts; for, as it is eſteemed unjuſt to puniſh a Man by the force of an <hi>ex poſt facto</hi> Law, it, certainly, is equally unjuſt by an <hi>ex poſt facto</hi> Law to confirm, and eſtabliſh a <hi>manifeſt Treſpaſs,</hi> which was previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly referred to a proper Court for
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0155301100:44"/>Redreſs; and the Application to Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament is of itſelf a ſufficient Proof, that the Right and Claim of the City of London <hi>are juſt;</hi> and ſuch as muſt neceſſarily have found <hi>a Remedy in Law,</hi> according to the uſual Proceedings of the King's Courts, otherwiſe the <hi>ex poſt facto Law</hi> had been needleſs.</p>
               <p>It ought to be remembered, alſo, that the City of London, for the ſake of Peace, and to avoid a Conteſt in Parliament, was <hi>inclined</hi> to allow ſome of the Treſpaſſers, (who are eminent Builders) as much ground in the Front of their Buildings, as would be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to make a Wharf, wide enough for Carts to come down, and to turn, and load, &amp;c. as at other Quays in the City, ſo that the uſe and intention of the noble underground Paſſages might
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0155301100:45"/>not be loſt, or in the leaſt injured; and a private intimation of this Lenity and Favour, to which the City ſeemed diſpoſed, was given to a Friend of the Builders, that they might be adviſed to Petition the City for Room to make ſuch a Wharf; and they were told, that the ſame would <hi>probably</hi> be granted in conſideration of their great Expences, and the Grandeur of their Buildings.</p>
               <p>But inſtead of <hi>ſuch a Petition,</hi> the Builders preſented a <hi>Memorial</hi> (they did not deign to call it <hi>a Petition</hi>) deſiring more than 3 or 4 Times as much room as was neceſſary for the ſaid purpoſe; becauſe, it ſeems, a Wharf alone would not content them; but, <hi>as Builders,</hi> they muſt be indulged alſo with room enough, out of the Width of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, to make (likewiſe for <hi>a Public
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0155301100:46"/>Ornament,</hi> I ſuppoſe) <hi>even a Timber Yard beſides!</hi>—They did not, indeed, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>the Timber Yard</hi> in their Memorial, but the deſign plainly appears by a Clauſe in the Bill to regulate <hi>the Height of the Piles of Timber,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>They did not fail, however, <hi>to demand</hi> of the City, as much Space as they thought neceſſary for <hi>their intended Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber Yard;</hi> and they were pleaſed at the ſame time to deſire <hi>the Concurrence of the City (as Conſervators of the River) to their Petition in Parliament!</hi> An Inſult this to the Citizens of London, <hi>as groſs and enormous, as the Encroachment itſelf;</hi>—for, in effect, it was to deſire the Citizens to join in a Petition to Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>againſt themſelves;</hi> that is, in Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of, and to eſtabliſh and confirm a notorious Treſpaſs committed in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0155301100:47"/>of their own repeated Prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Preſentments.</p>
               <p>The Memorial, however, was rejected with a proper Diſdain. But this was no hindrance to the Adventurers; they were already <hi>ſufficiently aware,</hi> that they might affront the City with Impunity.—They knew their <hi>Party</hi> Intereſt in Parliament, and <hi>the Partiality</hi> has, hitherto, been <hi>proved by the Succeſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Two great Law Lords ſtrenuouſly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to palliate the Offence, and to ſet forth the Public Utility of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bankment: One of them admitted that, <q>the preſent Scheme was intended for the private Emolument of Meſſ. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams, but then, (ſaid he) that Emolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment could only increaſe in Proportion to the Convenience, and Public Uti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0155301100:48"/>of the Embankment; if it was found inconvenient; the intended uſe would be loſt; conſequently their Profit would go with it; it was, therefore, in every point, a great Public Good ariſing from a Private Advantage.</q> However plauſible this Argument may ſeem, yet I muſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that it ill becomes any Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man at the head of the Law, to view <hi>a Public Good</hi> through the medium <hi>of a Private Advantage,</hi> eſpecially as that <hi>private advantage</hi> had been ſought by <hi>a manifeſt Public Injury and Treſpaſs;</hi> for when the Encroachment firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, the Right of the City of London was ſo far from being diſputed, that the Treſpaſſers themſelves acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged it, by Petitioning for Leave; and though they could not obtain Leave from thoſe who had a Right to
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0155301100:49"/>give it, yet they continued to <hi>enlarge</hi> their enormous Treſpaſs, as confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as if the whole River was indiſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably their own. But even if the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary <hi>Public Good,</hi> (ſuppoſed by the learned Chief Juſtice) be admitted, yet his Lordſhip knows, that <q>That which is otherwiſe Good and Juſt in itſelf, becomes Wicked and Unjuſt, if it is ſought or obtained by Force or Fraud. <hi>Quod alias bonum &amp; juſtum eſt, ſi per vim vel fraudem petatur, malum et injuſtum efficitur.</hi>
                  </q> (3 C. 78.) and his Lordſhip will not (I appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend) deny, that <hi>an enormous Treſpaſs</hi> has been committed; and therefore, thoſe that are robbed and injured ought, <hi>before all things, to be reinſtated,</hi> and have their Rights reſtored. <q>Spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liatus debet <hi>ante omnia reſtitui.</hi>
                  </q> 2 Iuſt. 714. Law, Juſtice, and Equity,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0155301100:50"/>cannot ſhew the leaſt favour or conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration for the Delinquents in ſuch a Caſe, becauſe <hi>"Iniquity Bars Equity,"</hi> —and, <q>no Man can take advantage from his own Treſpaſs or Injury. <hi>Nullus commodum capere poteſt de in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juria ſua propria.</hi>
                  </q> Co. Lit. 148.</p>

                  </q> Jenk. Cent. p. 31.</p>
               <p>But if, on the contrary, the Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture will favour and confirm an appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Treſpaſs, no Man's Property can be ſafe from ſuch Adventurers. If I had <hi>as much Party Intereſt,</hi> and paid as little <hi>regard to the difference between</hi> MEUM <hi>and</hi> TUUM as they have done
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0155301100:51"/>in the preſent Caſe, <hi>or their Advocates,</hi> I would procure an elegant Plan for raiſing ſuch a Building, as ſhould not only be a Public Ornament in its ſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but a Public Convenience in its Accommodations within and without; in ſhort, I would build a noble Inn, open <hi>to all Men, (for</hi> MY OWN <hi>and the public advantage</hi>) upon the Inheritance of Lord A, Lord B, or of any other Noble Freeholder whatſoever, whoſe Property, in point of Situation, might ſeem to promiſe the moſt advantage to my undertaking.</p>
               <p>Or a good Plan for raiſing an Elegant <hi>and outwardly</hi> Ornamental Edifice, <hi>inwardly</hi> adapted to the purpoſes of <hi>Grinding Corn, Slitting Iron, making Gunpowder,</hi> or any other Articles neceſſary for the ſuſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0155301100:52"/>convenience, or protection of <hi>the Public,</hi> would equally anſwer my <hi>private Advantage:</hi> and <hi>a good Mill</hi> would be <hi>a good Inheritance,</hi> let me tell you, if I could make it <hi>my own Freehold</hi> wherever I pleaſed to Build one, <hi>with or without</hi> the Conſent of the Lord of the Manor, or the lawful Proprietor of the Ground.</p>
               <p>The ſame Doctrine may be extended even to the Building of <hi>whole Towns upon other Mens Ground, without Leave;</hi> becauſe the Towns would be for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation of Gentlemen, of Tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, of Manufacturers, Artificers, <hi>&amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</hi> whereby <hi>the Public</hi> would manifeſtly be benefited as well as <hi>the Builder, in proportion</hi> to the Succeſs of each Undertaking in the Increaſe of Inhabitants.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:0155301100:53"/>If the lawful Proprietor of the Ground, on which <hi>I treſpaſſed,</hi> would be pleaſed to give me his Conſent, it would be well; and if he refuſed it, <hi>my Pretenſions would ſtill be as good as the much favoured Cauſe of the Treſpaſſers at Durham-Yord;</hi> for, even though I ſhould be obliged to allow that my preſent Scheme <q>
                     <hi>was intended for the Private Emolument</hi> of,</q> myſelf—yet I could alledge the Opinion of a Chief Juſtice, that <q>
                     <hi>this Emolument could only increaſe in proportion to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience and Public Utility of,</hi>
                  </q> my Inn, my Mill, or my Town, <q>
                     <hi>If it was found inconvenient, the intended Uſe would be loſt, conſequently,</hi>" my <hi>Profit would go with it; it would therefore</hi>

                     <hi>be in

               </p>
               <p>I might alledge, alſo, that this <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Advantage</hi> of mine, ought to be much more favoured than that of the Encroachers on the River Thames, becauſe, if I ſhould raiſe my Prices for Proviſions, for Grinding, for Rent, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> upon the Public, there would ſtill be Room ſufficient in the Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, (<hi>as the Conſent of Proprietors</hi> is <hi>at preſent eſteemed unneceſſary</hi>) for other People, alſo, to <hi>Treſpaſs</hi> and Build more Inns, more Mills, or more Towns <hi>for</hi> THEIR OWN <hi>and the Public Advantage,</hi> as near to my advantageous Situation as they ſhould think proper; ſo that the Public, when <hi>impoſed upon by me,</hi> might be enabled to give the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerence to cheaper and leſs uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcionable Treſpaſſers.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:0155301100:55"/>But in the other Caſe, the local Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages are more limited and confined to a particular Situation; and the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments are already ſo great,</hi> that there is ſcarcely Room for more within any advantageous Diſtance; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Advantage of Situation <hi>for Wharfs</hi> is confined within the extent of the Trading Part of the Town, now fully occupied; <hi>and the Port or Baſon of the River,</hi> within theſe Bounds, is already too much contracted to admit of <hi>more Encroachments,</hi> without encum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bering or ſtopping up <hi>the Paſſage of the River</hi> with Craft and Veſſels, which even at preſent are greatly endangered for want of commodious and proper Mooring-Places out of the Stream and Tide-way.—During the Froſty Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this laſt Winter, 3 or 4 Ships were wrecked, and many others damaged,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0155301100:56"/>
                  <hi>even in the Port of London,</hi> for want of ſuch proper Accommodations; and a very conſiderable number of Barges, Lighters, &amp;c. were forced away from their Moorings by the Ice, and loſt, both above and below London Bridge; ſo that it is manifeſt, that <hi>Water-room</hi> is of much more conſequence to the Port of London than any Land gained from it can poſſibly be; and that there cannot, therefore, be any Room to ſpare, for making more Wharfs out of the Bed of the River, without <hi>an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent Injury to the Harbour;</hi> ſo that if the new Wharfs ſhould become ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary by an Increaſe of Trade, <hi>the Public Utility</hi> muſt ſubmit to the Exactions of the <hi>Private Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor,</hi> whoſe Tenure is founded in <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Injury and Injuſtice;</hi> and the Trade of this great City, on which its <hi>very
