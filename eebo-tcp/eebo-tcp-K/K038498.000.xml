            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>THE diſcontinuing the acting of a Play, that has been well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the Town in general, at a Time when it might have gone on, makes it neceſſary to give ſome Account of what has paſt ſince the firſt Night of its Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation, and of the Motives that made the Author put a Stop to its Run.</p>
            <p>A Report having been maliciouſly raiſed, and induſtriouſly ſpread all over the Town, that the Play was a Party Play, and ſupported by the Court, and therefore to be oppoſed, Numbers of Perſons came into the Houſe with an Intent, (as the Term is) to damn it at all Events.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:1182800900:6"/>
Thus determin'd, they took hold of every little Slip that,
<q>
                  <l>—Aut Incuria fudit</l>
                  <l>Aut humana parum cavit Natura—</l>
               </q>
and were very clamorous: However, the Play having had a fair Hearing, went off with infinitely more <hi>Applauſe</hi> than <hi>Blame.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Second Night the particular Things objected to, being taken out, the Play was acted from Beginning to End, without one ſingle Mark of Diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in the Audience.</p>
            <p>The Third Night it went off in the ſame Manner, to the moſt numerous and ſplendid Audience that could be ſeen.</p>
            <p>The Fourth Night a Set of about eight or ten young Fellows went to the <hi>Bedford</hi> Coffee-Houſe in the Piazza, and declared publickly that they came purpoſely to damn the Play, and would not leave the Play-houſe till they had compaſſed their Ends. The ſame De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration they repeated when in the Houſe to ſome Gentlemen that wero there,
<pb facs="tcp:1182800900:7"/>
Friends (but unknown to them) to the Author.</p>
            <p>Accordingly Mr. <hi>Ryan</hi> coming on to ſpeak the <hi>Prologue,</hi> they began their Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roar, but were ſoon ſilenced, and the <hi>Prologue</hi> was heard with Applauſe: The Play beginning, they began again, and were ſo loud that Mr. <hi>Ryan</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted them, that as he could not ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine there was any thing in the Play they could except againſt, he was appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive he had the Misfortune to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe them. Mr. <hi>Quin</hi> then came on, and told them he found the Houſe was divided, and as the Majority was for hearing the Play, he hop'd thoſe who were not, would go out. The Houſe on that were unanimous, and cry'd, <hi>Turn them out, Turn them out,</hi> but they ſaved the Audience the Trouble of doing it, and retired under the general Hiſs of every Perſon then preſent: After which the Play went on without the leaſt Diſturbance.</p>
            <p>The Author having reflected that Malice, tho' it could do the Play no Hurt, might affect Mr. <hi>Rich,</hi> by keeping Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
<pb facs="tcp:1182800900:8"/>
from the Houſe, who have no great Reliſh for Noiſe, choſe rather to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continue the further acting of the Play, and to refer himſelf to the Judgment of every impartial Reader, to whom he freely commits it, being determin'd as frankly to acknowledge any real Fault found with it, as to juſtify it, if cenſur'd without Reaſon.</p>
            <p>The Author cannot conclude, without declaring how much he thinks himſelf obliged to every Actor for the Care taken in the acting it, and more particularly to thoſe who having the principal Parts to perform, had an Opportunity to exert themſelves, as they did, in the moſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory Manner.</p>

So, take one Word of Council, in your Calling:</l>
                  <l>Tho' you're too brave, I know, to fear a Falling.</l>
                  <l>—From your old Yoke, ſet free, admit no new one,</l>
                  <l>Unleſs with ſome, poor, briſk, young, kind, and true one.—</l>
                  <l>The conſcious Youth, long, mindful of your Favour,</l>
                  <l>Will make up all Defects, with good Behaviour.—</l>
                  <l>Loth, that his Wants his Gratitude ſhou'd ſmother;</l>
                  <l>What he can't bring you, one Way—comes another.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>And, now, good People! what I've, more, to ſay t'ye,</l>
                  <l>Shou'd be, a doleful <hi>Tune,</hi> and <hi>ſigh,</hi> and <hi>pray</hi> t'ye.</l>
                  <l>—But, doleful Tunes, of late, are grown ſo common,</l>
                  <l>They move more Sorrow, than a dying Woman!</l>
                  <l>And, Sighs, and Prayers, are beſt, when made in private,</l>
                  <l>As you all know, who have good Ends to drive at.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>What ſhall I do, then?—ſhall I hang, and tarry?</l>
                  <l>Or, bold, in ſaving Faith, go on, and marry?</l>
                  <l>'Tis, both Ways, bad!—But, I've, at once, bethought me,</l>
                  <l>Of a ſweet Leſſon, dear Revenge has taught me!</l>
                  <l>—I'll ſtay, and ſee Sir <hi>Harry</hi> in his Fetters:</l>
                  <l>Nor be ſo rude, to ſwing, before my Betters.</l>
                  <l>Paſs but his Honey-moon of Sunſhine Weather,</l>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Har.</speaker>
               <p>Why faith, <hi>Ned,</hi> it wou'd be odd if you did. A beautiful Woman is like a well-wrote Book, every Leaf you turn over, at firſt affords new Pleaſure; but when you're forc'd to read it daily, from one End to the other, you'll find but little Inclination to begin again.</p>

               <p>You're witty, Sir. But is this Argument only to hold good for the Men? Have not Women the ſame Plea for Inconſtancy?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Har.</speaker>
               <p>Ah, Friend! That it was but ſo! How happy ſhould we be! But there's a Fatality in the Way of loving, of the two Sexes, that renders both miſerable. Enjoyment leſſens our Paſſion, and increaſes theirs.</p>

               <speaker>Sir Har.</speaker>
               <p>Succeſsful! Ay, that I was, to tell you a Secret, long before honeſt Sir <hi>Peregrine</hi> took a Bargain off my Hands, that began to puzzle me a little how to diſpoſe of.</p>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Har.</speaker>
               <p>In few Words then, thus: Lady <hi>Traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick,</hi>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:1182800900:21"/>
then <hi>Lucia Bellfaſt,</hi> old Colonel <hi>Bellfaſt</hi>'s Daughter, was very pretty, I very amorous. Our Neighbourhood gave me many Opportunities of ſeeing her, which I improv'd, till at laſt I found myſelf tenderly beloved. I caught the Infection too, and doated on her; promiſed Marriage; which I intended to execute. The Saints in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and her Maid, were Witneſſes to my Vows. <hi>Lucia</hi> thought the Security good, and delivered into my Arms the lovelieſt Perſon they had ever held. With Joy we often met, and with Reluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance parted, curſing the Day that came ſo ſoon, and oblig'd me to diſappear, before any of the Family was up, but the truſty Maid. Much about this Time Sir <hi>Peregrine</hi> came down to <hi>Lucia</hi>'s Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, fell in Love with the Daughter, aſk'd her of him, and obtain'd her. She wou'd have declar'd our Affair, to avoid a Match ſhe hated, and to have been mine, as I had promis'd; but having no great Stomach to the Match, and finding ſhe wou'd not ſuffer in her Reputation by the Affair, I advis'd her to accept the Gentleman's Offer, in ſuch a Manner, that ſhe ſaw ſhe muſt, or be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done. I own 'twas unkind.—She did not ſee me for a long Time after ſhe was married, and, I believe, never wou'd, had not her Huſband's Affairs call'd him abroad.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Hear.</speaker>
               <p>And ſo, not content with forcing this fond Creature to give her Vows to a Man ſhe hated, you forc'd her too, to violate thoſe very Vows, and—</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Har.</speaker>
               <p>Hold, <hi>Ned,</hi> not ſo faſt. I did all I cou'd, indeed, but ſhe was obſtinate, and never wou'd. It was in vain to alledge former Intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies; ſhe wept, and anſwer'd me with her Huſband, her Huſband, at ever Word. Is it not odd, <hi>Ned,</hi> a Woman ſhou'd be conſtant to a Man ſhe hates, and refuſe one ſhe loves?</p>

               <p>It may ſeem ſo to you. But People that think there is ſomething beſide Paſſion, that ought to be liſten'd to, may, perhaps, be of a different Opinion. But now you mention her Huſband, pray what's become of him?</p>

               <p>Ay, Sir.—And the generous, good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natur'd Creature, left his Widow all he had: If he had not, it would have been a heavy Tax on me.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

               <speaker>Sir Har.</speaker>
               <p>Why then, in few Words,—her Huſband, Sir <hi>Peregrine</hi>'s private Affairs, oblig'd him to go to <hi>Leghorn.</hi> Theſe very private Affairs oblig'd him to leave that Place ſoon after, and make a ſhort Voyage. Short, indeed, it was; for the Ship and Crew were all caſt away on the Coaſt of <hi>Barbary,</hi> near <hi>Sallee.</hi> Like a prudent Man, he had made his Will before he went, and thus my Lady <hi>Traffick</hi> became a young and rich Widow. Now, <hi>Ned,</hi> you know a Woman can't hold out for ever againſt a Man ſhe loves. Her Huſband's Death left her without any Excuſe, and her own Heart pleaded ſtrongly for me. Then ſhe hop'd too to make me more than ever fond, and like a fond Fool marry her. She took the wrong Method.—However our Commerce, which now I am very ſorry for, was renewed again; again ſhe truſted me, and was again deceiv'd.</p>

               <p>Why, faith, <hi>Ned,</hi> I am a little puzzled as to that, I have not Ill-nature enough to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake her, nor Complaiſance enough to forſake my Pleaſures for her. She knows my Love is at its loweſt Ebb; and that there is little left but Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to keep it alive. And ſince that Time, what have I not ſuffer'd? To give you a Sketch of my Life with her, Each Day I ſee her, and each Day am regularly entertain'd with the ſame Reproaches.—I hear myſelf accus'd as Author of her Ruin; my own Words, Words, which at certain Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in my firſt Paſſion's Heat, or when com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd by the fond Queſtion, <hi>Do you love, and will you ever love me?—</hi>Words, which, indeed, I may have ſaid, quoted back and retorted as ſo many Proofs of my Inconſtancy. In ſhort, my Temper's quite broke, quite wearied out with ſtruggling. Neither Company nor Friends divert me. Were I to conſult her Humour, I ſhould never be from her. When I but miſs a Day, there's no End of her upbraiding. A Recapitulation of all that has paſs'd, from the firſt Moment of our Acquaintance, as ſurely follows, as ſuch Recapitulation is follow'd by Tears, Threats, Paſſion, Hope, Deſpair, each in their Turn.</p>

Our Beauties fade in your Eyes, want Edge for your pall'd Appetites: Faintly you deny it; and, to excuſe yourſelves, you tell us, Love's a Paſſion that ought not to make the Buſineſs but the Amuſement of Life, and ſhou'd be never ſuffer'd to grow ſerious.</p>

                  <p>Our Minds affected by ſuch new and unknown Doctrine, we reproach you. Our Reproaches, arm'd with Truth, perplex and gaul you, and at laſt beget Averſion in you; which once born, never dies. Your Averſion draws new Reproaches from us, and our Reproaches ſtrengthen your Averſion; 'till at laſt, Love long ſince fled, Pity forſakes you too. You leave the miſerable Wretch, you made ſo, to Sorrow and Repentance; to dear-bought Experience, Guilt and Shame; unable to conquer her Paſſion, and condemn'd never to have it repaid.</p>

We live in a Garret, breed like tame Rabbits, wear out the Cloaths we got in Service, and having no Money to buy more, ſtink in coarſe Rags, and mutually curſe each other, to the melo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious Concert of half a Dozen ſqualing Brats about our Ears.</p>

And Money, Mr. <hi>Thomas,</hi> you know, hides a great many Faults. Then the Elegancies of Life wipe away a Spot in one's Character; or at leaſt make one bear with it. Good Cloaths, Meat, Drink, Diverſions! To riſe from a low State to an Affluence of Fortune and Pleaſure, at leaſt to her. Oh! the Joy's not to be deſcrib'd, one muſt feel it. After all, one can at laſt match with one's Equal. He'll be glad to have us, if we bring our Welcome with us.

we can't confine our Thoughts to what we ſuffer with you; that indeed might cure us. But we let 'em looſe, and they bring back to our charm'd Senſes former Scenes of Joy. There, there we fall. Our Paſſions catch the Alarm; we wake from preſent Miſery, by reflecting on paſt Happineſs. Our Paſſions prompt us to believe, that Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs may ſtill return. We credit what we wiſh; the fond Deluſion charms us, and we ſtill love on.</p>

Not to detain you longer, he makes honourable Love to her, and I believe 'twill be a Match. Now, Mem, if Sir <hi>Harry</hi> is engag'd to you, 'tis baſe in him to pretend Love to my Lady, and deceive you. As I hate falſe Men, and could not bear to be deceiv'd myſelf, I came to acquaint you how wicked a Man he is, and give you a Caution againſt his flattering Tongue.</p>

                  <p>Rather, as if I were flying from one. Sure nothing's ſo deteſtable as a Man of Senſe, that pretends to be a Lover. Love is a quite different Thing in him, than in other Men.</p>

                  <p>Ah, <hi>le Brutal!</hi> He's jealous; I'll plague him a little.—Sir <hi>Harry,</hi> Madam, is ſo taken up with his own Thoughts, that he has no Taſte for the Converſation of the Beau Monde. Your Men of Senſe are always the dulleſt Animals in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. Take 'em from their Books, and their high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpun Notions, which they do not underſtand them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and you may fall aſleep for want of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation.</p>

                  <p>And let me tell you, Sir, 'tis an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to ſleep in ſome Companies. Your Body's refreſh'd, and your Mind not tir'd.</p>

                  <p>Believe me, Sir <hi>Lively,</hi> there are Charms in a Man of Senſe, a Woman thinks can never be too dearly purchas'd. Your Siſter and I, Sir <hi>Harry,</hi> tho' very good Friends, differ a little in our Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions:

                  <p>Why really, Sir <hi>Lively,</hi> my Opinion is, a Man of Senſe can never make a bad Huſband, unleſs he has a bad or fooliſh Wife.

<stage>[Aſide.]</stage> 
A Man of Senſe, Madam, will expect ſo many Things in a Wife, that it will be impoſſible for her to ſatisfy him. Now, a pretty Fellow, Madam, is eaſier, and has always ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing light and gay to entertain her with.</p>

                  <p>I don't know what to make of this, tho'.—Nay, Madam, if you won't take what I ſay for granted, I have done. I never prove any thing; I only aſſert.

                  <p>Experience, Madam, is the Mother of true Judgment. Thoſe fine Gentlemen you mention, are either too young to judge right, or too much hurried by their Paſſions, which For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune enables 'em to indulge to Exceſs, to follow what is right.</p>

                  <speaker>Laet.</speaker>
                  <p>Why, Sir, that you are capable of being in Love.</p>

                  <speaker>Hear.</speaker>
                  <p>That's very hard, Madam. To be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied the Privilege of feeling what the meaneſt of my Sex feels, is ſomething tyrannical.</p>

                  <speaker>Hear.</speaker>
                  <p>Love, Madam, knows neither Birth nor Fortune. Where it finds a Soul capable of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving it, it lodges, and is as pleas'd to warm the meaneſt as the nobleſt Breaſt.</p>

                  <speaker>Hear.</speaker>
                  <p>The Love I talk of, Madam, is that Paſſion that fills us with generous Sentiments in Behalf of the Perſon we like; and if the meaneſt Artiſan, in Proportion to his Senſe and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, feels ſuch Sentiments, he feels Love in its greateſt Delicacy.</p>

                  <speaker>Laet.</speaker>
                  <p>Sir, you ſeem too intereſted in your Wiſh, to be capable of thoſe generous Sentiments you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire in a Lover.</p>

That Lady is now with <hi>Angelina;</hi> Revenge has puſh'd her to deſtroy my Hopes in her, whom I had juſt before brought to confeſs a Regard for me. I found a growing Paſſion in every Word and Look—but fear ſhall never ſee it more.

                  <p>I ſee too plain it does, I want no other Proof.—Madam, believe I feel your Wrongs, as if they were my own. Compaſſion is the Glory of our Sex, and well becomes its Softneſs.—'Tis now too late, Sir <hi>Harry,</hi> to deny I had har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour'd ſome favourable Sentiments of you.

                  <p>I can't indeed. Your Sentence, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, is juſt. The Wrongs I've done this Lady, whoſe only Fault was loving me too tenderly, merit the ſevereſt Puniſhment. You have it in your Power, and do inflict it. I've made one miſerable, (wou'd there were but one) 'tis juſt I ſhou'd be ſo myſelf. <hi>Lucia,</hi> you ſeem to be ſurpriz'd to ſee me with ſo calm a Look. Know, that I'm aſham'd of my inhuman Uſage of you, and will make any Amends within my Power. You ſought Revenge, you have it, and I blame you not. Cou'd Love once fled return, even that I'd give; for I have been a Savage to you, and wanted even Humanity to pity you.</p>

I long in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended him a Farm of forty Pounds a Year. But as he will want a neat and clean Houſekeeper, to ſhare the Management of it, I have fix'd my Eyes on Mrs. <hi>Betty,</hi> your Woman, who ſeems to be cut out for an excellent Houſewife.</p>

                  <speaker>Bet.</speaker>
                  <p>Are all my Hopes come to this!</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Har.</speaker>
                  <p>Here, <hi>Tom.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <stage>Enter <hi>Tom.</hi>
                  </stage>
                  <p>Sirrah, what ſay you to a Farm of 40<hi>l.</hi> a Year, and a pretty Wife?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Tom.</speaker>
                  <p>And a Child already got, I ſuppoſe.—Sir, for the Farm I return you my moſt grateful Acknowledgements, for that cannot but turn out a real Good and Advantage to me. How this other Freehold may prove, I can't tell.—But 'tis no
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:1182800900:85"/>
Matter.—I'll venture to take a Leaſe for Life. But hark'ee, my Dear, no Huſbandman but my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, d'you hear, no Labourer to help me to do my Work. I'll warrant thee, Girl, I'll keep thee in good Order myſelf.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Bet.</speaker>
                  <p>Well, <hi>Tom,</hi> if thou art but as good as thy Word, I promiſe thee thou ſhalt reap the Fruits of No-body's Labour but thy own. But take heed. If like a lazy Lubbard you grow idle, and lee good Land run into Common, for want of enrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Soil as it ought, it will fall to the Lord of the Manor again, and then, you know, he has a Right to turn his own Cattle a grazing there.</p>

                  <speaker>Sir Har.</speaker>
                  <p>Come, Madam, we are now engag'd in a Voyage for Life. 'Tis for both our Intereſts to make it agreeable and happy. I ſhall do my Endeavour to give you no Uneaſineſs. Let's for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get the paſt, and look forward.</p>
                  <l>When Paſſion governs with deſpotick Sway,</l>
                  <l>And its enchanting Dictates we obey,</l>
                  <l>Our Spirits, lifted up, a while we ſail,</l>
                  <l>And plough Love's Ocean with a proſperous Gale:</l>
                  <l>Till, like a Tempeſt, Vice, at laſt, appears,</l>
                  <l>And full on Rocks and dangerous Quickſands bears.</l>
                  <l>If then ſome Pilot, with unerring Hand,</l>
                  <l>Oe'r the loſt Barque deigns but to take Command,</l>
                  <l>The Rocks we dreaded moſt, with Eaſe, be ſhuns;</l>
                  <l>And ſafe to Port the ſinking Veſſel runs.</l>
