            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0031101600:4"/>
by ſmall Pins, in any ſituation whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. Six of the Circles toward the Center are ſo contriv'd, that they may be taken away, upon occaſion; and yet when they are put in, they are faſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected to the Frame, as well as the other, and revolve as freely as they do. There is alſo a Terreſtrial Globe, of nine Inches Diameter, plac'd under the inner Circles, with its Hour Circle, turning along with it in its Diurnal Motion: And when thoſe Circles are remov'd, the Globe may be ſo elevated and fix'd at any height, and ſo regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Screws, as to be ready for the Exhibition of thoſe Eclipſes, which the ſix outward Circles aſſiſt us to diſcover; to which laſt does alſo belong a Rule, with a Groove, containing an Angle of 5° 37′ for the Moon's Path in Eclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. There is alſo a round Plate of Glaſs, with 12 Concentrical Circles therein, for the 12 Digits in Solar Eclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; whoſe Diameter bears the ſame proportion to the Diameter of the Globe, that the apparent Semidiameters of the Sun and Moon put together, do really bear to the Disk of the Earth in thoſe Eclipſes. There is, beſides, a Map of the Moon, with 6 Concentrical Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, for the 12 Digits in Lunar Eclipſes;
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0031101600:5"/>
whoſe Diameter bears the ſame proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to that of the Globe, which the real Diameter of the Moon bears to the real Diameter of the Earth. There is alſo a dark Circle, repreſenting that Section of the Earth's Conical Shadow, along which the Moon paſſes in its own Eclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; and is ſo much leſs in proportion than the Diameter of the Globe, as is that of the real correſponding Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle to that of the Earth it ſelf. There are alſo two Threads, with their Plum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets, fix'd to the Center of the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; of frequent uſe in its Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>THE Nature of the ſeveral Parts of this Inſtrument is as follows:</p>
            <p>THE outmoſt, or largeſt Circle, which is immovable, is the <hi>Ecliptick,</hi> with its known Signs, <hi>Aries, Taurus, Gemini, &amp;c.</hi> This Circle is divided equally, from the beginning of <hi>Aries,</hi> or the <hi>Vernal Equinox,</hi> into 360 Degrees, or 12 Signs of 30 Degrees apiece; and is the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and Standard of the whole Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Every Planet, or Point, or Line being ſtill fix'd, by knowing its Place along this Circle, either by the Signs, with the particular Degrees and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0031101600:6"/>
or by the bare number of Degrees and Minutes from the <hi>Equinox.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE Second Circle is for the Months and Days of the Year; which Days being, in a manner, equal, this Circle is equally divided into 365 Parts; which is the number of Days in a <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> common Year. Nor will the <hi>Leap Year</hi> cauſe any great trouble, though it has one more Day in <hi>February;</hi> ſince it is already allow'd for in thoſe Aſtrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical Tables, whence all our Numbers have been transferr'd into this Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and any Day therein, after <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary,</hi> is counted one farther than in the common Year. But here ſeveral things are to be noted; <hi>viz.</hi> (1.) That I ſuppoſe every Body can readily tell, in any Month of any Year, how re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote every Day of it is from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of that Year; and this both in common, and in Leap Years; and ſo can readily change one way of Compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation for the other, as occaſion ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire: Thus we know by the old Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial Verſes, that,
<q>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:0031101600:7"/>
                  <l>Thirty Days hath September,</l>
                  <l>April, June, and November:</l>
                  <l>February eight and twenty alone,</l>
                  <l>And all the reſt have thirty and one.</l>
               </q>
Accordingly, we can tell, that <hi>April</hi> 22<hi>d,</hi> the Day of the next total Eclipſe of the Sun, in this common Year, is the 112<hi>th</hi> day of the Year: As alſo, that <hi>Sept.</hi> 29<hi>th,</hi> or <hi>Michaelmas</hi> day, next Year, which is <hi>Leap Year,</hi> will be the 273<hi>d</hi> Day of that Year; and ſo in all other Caſes whatſoever. (2.) That in caſe we fix any one Day of the Circle rightly to that Place in the <hi>Ecliptick</hi> whereto it belongs, every other Day of the ſame Circle will thereby be rightly plac'd alſo. (3.) That I have therefore ſet down upon this Circle, the true Place of the <hi>Vernal Equinox,</hi> for the paſt Ages, as well as for the preſent: So that 'tis but bringing either the particular Year of our Lord it ſelf <hi>ſince,</hi> or any one which proceeded it <hi>before Chriſt,</hi> to the beginning of <hi>Aries,</hi> or the <hi>Vernal Equinox,</hi> and the whole Circle of Months is right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly plac'd, with reſpect to the <hi>Ecliptick,</hi> for that time. (4.) That yet if we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to be exact, we muſt, in this caſe, conſider further, what Year it is from <hi>Leap Year</hi> that we are concern'd with;
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0031101600:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
for if it be the firſt after it (which the firſt of each Century and Score <hi>ſince,</hi> and the fourth of each Century and Score <hi>before Chriſt</hi> always are) the Poſition of the Numbers is right of it ſelf, without any more conſideration: But if it be the ſecond after it, the Circle is to be turn'd one third of a Century's Motion, or one quarter of a Day forward; if it be the third, two thirds of a Century's Motion, or one half of a Day forwards, in order to its right Poſition; while if it be it ſelf Leap Year, the Circle muſt be tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned one quarter of a Day backward, in order to ſuch a Poſition. (5.) Our Aſtronomical Centuries, Years, Months, and Days do ever commence from the Noon foregoing; ſo our 10<hi>th</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> in this Inſtrument begins at Noon <hi>March</hi> 9<hi>th,</hi> and ends at Noon <hi>March</hi> 1O<hi>th;</hi> and is indeed reckon'd by 24 Hours intire, from the one Noon to the other. Thus, becauſe this is the third after <hi>Leap Year,</hi> I turn this ſecond Circle onward half a day, and find, that the <hi>Vernal Equinox</hi> happens this Year, <hi>March</hi> 9. <hi>d.</hi> 18 <hi>h.</hi> 0 <hi>m.</hi> or as we commonly reckon, on <hi>March</hi> 10. about Six of the Clock in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and that, by conſequence, <hi>April</hi> 21. <hi>d.</hi> 9 <hi>h.</hi> 42 <hi>m.</hi> the time of the middle of the next great Eclipſe of the Sun, correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponds
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0031101600:9"/>
ponds to the 13° of <hi>Taurus,</hi> in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Circle of the <hi>Ecliptick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE Third Circle is the Annual Elliptick Orbit of the Earth, here right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repreſented by a Circle; with the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal Diviſions of the <hi>Ellipſis,</hi> correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the inequality of the Earth's Motion. This Circle is fix'd to the due place of the Ecliptick by a ſmall Arch, of the place of the <hi>Perihelion</hi>; as the Days of the Month were fix'd to the <hi>Equinox.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE Fourth Circle contains the Menſtrual Orbit of the Moon, with its Periodical Revolution about the Earth; both in 360 Parts, and in 27 Days, 7 Hours, and 43 Minutes. The actual Diviſions are here made for the mean State of the Orbit, which is variable; but Points are ſet at every five Degrees (to be thence ſupply'd at every De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, and proportionably in other Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes) according to its ſeveral Degrees of Eccentricity. Upon the inner large part of this Circle there is alſo a Spiral Line, with the progreſſive mean Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Moon's <hi>Apogee</hi> for a Century; with every one of the Months, and almoſt Days Motion alſo; That ſo
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0031101600:10"/>
when we have fix'd, by a proper Table, the mean Place of the <hi>Apogee,</hi> for the beginning of any Century, we may thereby find its mean Place to any time in the ſame Century alſo, without any other Aſſiſtance whatſoever.</p>
            <p>THE Fifth Circle contains, along its ſpiral, the mean Motion of the Moon's Nodes; and particularly, of the Aſcending Node whence the Numbers begin, for an intire Century, with its Months and Days; that ſo when we have, by a proper Table, once fix'd that Node right for the beginning of any Century, we may, as before, be hereby enabled to place it right at any time in the ſame Century, without any other aſſiſtance: Only we muſt here note, that the Motion of the Nodes being retrograde, the Numbers on this Circle are counted backward.</p>
            <p>THE Sixth Circle contains, in a ſpiral, the mean Motion of the Moon for the ſeveral Days in the Year, num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber'd at length: And the Moon's mean Motion for the diſtinct Years of the Century are put at the utmoſt edge of the Circle, for our future Benefit in this Caſe alſo.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:0031101600:11"/>THUS far I have deſcrib'd the largeſt and principal Circles, intended for the Diſcovery of the New and Full Moons; and eſpecially for the Calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Eclipſes, both Solar and Lunar.</p>
            <p>AS to thoſe ſix leſſer Circles that follow to the Center, they need little Explication, being all of a piece; and are indeed nothing but broad <hi>Annuli,</hi> or Rings, to contain the Orbits of ſuch of the Primary Planets as could be put upon them; with the Orbits of all the Secondary Planets, both thoſe about <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,</hi> and thoſe about <hi>Jupiter,</hi> in their due Proportions; that ſo, when the Sun is ſuppos'd in the Center, the Orbits of the Primary Planets may alone be made uſe of; when <hi>Saturn</hi> is there His; and when <hi>Jupiter</hi> is there His <hi>Satellites</hi> may alone be contemplated. Only we muſt here note ſeveral things, for the better underſtanding of this Part of our Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. (1.) Becauſe <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi>'s Orbits were too large for theſe inner Circles, they are repreſented by ſmall Spheres, on the ſecond and ſixth larger Circles before deſcrib'd; becauſe <hi>Saturn</hi>'s Motion is only about 12 Degrees in a Year, or one in a Month; as alſo <hi>Jupiter</hi>'s
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0031101600:12"/>
only about 30 Degrees in a Year, or 2½ in a Month; there is no great neceſſity for theſe diſtinct Orbits, with their Motions, to be engrav'd upon theſe Circles; eſpecially becauſe of the Confuſion it would introduce there. (2.) Theſe Orbits are here Circular, or accommodated to the Planets mean Diſtances from the Sun; but ſo, that the preſent Places of the <hi>Aphelia</hi> and <hi>Perihelia</hi> are noted on the utmoſt edge of the whole Inſtrument, and the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of their ſeveral conſtant Eccentrici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are alſo noted where their Orbits begin; that ſo the little Sphere repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting each Planet, may be ever plac'd nearer to or farther from the Center, as its real Diſtance ſhall require; only the Eccentricities of the <hi>Earth</hi>'s and <hi>Venus</hi>'s Orbits are too ſmall to be here ſenſible. (3.) Theſe Orbits are all repreſented in the Plain of the Ecliptick, as it was here neceſſary to do: But then the preſent Places of the Aſcending and Deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Nodes being ſet down at the utmoſt Edge, each Planet's Inclination to the Ecliptick, and Latitude on the Earth, may be nearly diſcover'd for this Age at the ſame time; I mean this, in caſe we obſerve the quantity of the ſeveral Angles of Inclination, which thoſe Orbits
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0031101600:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
make with the Ecliptick, which are as follows:

            <p>ALL the Circles firſt rectify'd, and the Time and Place of the True Conjunction or Oppoſition found, as already directed, Lay one of your Threads over that Place, and the other over the neareſt Node. If that Diſtance be leſs than 16 Degrees and an half, and it be a Conjunction, there will be an Eclipſe of the Sun ſomewhere: If it be greater, there will be no Eclipſe. If that Diſtance be leſs than 10 <hi>d.</hi> 38 <hi>m.</hi> and it be an Oppoſition, there will be an Eclipſe of the Moon: If it be more, there will be no Eclipſe.</p>

               <hi>Thus, it happening this Year</hi> 1715. <hi>that the Sun and Moon are in Conjunction, about a quarter before Ten o' Clock, on the next</hi> 22 d <hi>of</hi> April, <hi>and that at</hi> 8 d. <hi>diſtance from the Deſcending Node; it is evident there will at that time happen an Eclipſe of the Sun.

               <hi>Note here, that ſeveral other Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of Eclipſes, may be diſcover'd by the Solution of this Problem.

Becauſe it is in a ſort of a Mean Diſtance between that deſcending Node and the Limit, it will be a great and Total Eclipſe, and the greateſt in the Northern Temperate Zone. Becauſe it happens near the</hi> Aphelion <hi>of the Earth, and near the</hi> Perigee <hi>of the Moon, when the appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Diameters of the Sun is ſmaller, and of the Moon greater than uſual, it will not be Annular, but Total, and that for ſome few Minutes alſo; I mean along that Line, which the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the</hi> Penumbra <hi>deſcribes upon the Earth. And becauſe the Solar Eclipſe this Year happens here in the Day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, and the Lunar in the Night, they will both be viſible; I mean, in</hi>

place it in the Center or Axis of your Circles.

Turn your Globe, rectify'd as before, till the Index points to the time of the True Conjunction, already found; That is very nearly the time of the middle of the general E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipſe. Then turn your Globe, and draw your Glaſs backwards any num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Minutes equally; ſo that an Hour in the Hour Circle may ever cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpond to an Hour in the Path of the Moon; and till the Shadow of the edge of the Circular Glaſs begins to touch the neareſt Place of the Globe; for that is the Time, and that the Place, when and where the general Eclipſe begins.

            <p>
               <hi>Thus, in the next great Solar Eclipſe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd in general, you will find that it will begin in</hi> 17 d. <hi>of North Latitude, and about</hi> 90 d. <hi>weſtward from</hi> London; <hi>and this about</hi> 21 m. <hi>after</hi> 7, <hi>and will end in the Latitude of</hi> 40, <hi>about</hi> 98 d. <hi>to the Eaſt of</hi> London; <hi>and this at</hi> 3 m. <hi>after</hi> 12. <hi>That it will be a Total Eclipſe for about</hi> 150 <hi>Miles in breadth, and that the Center of the</hi> Penumbra <hi>will go near the</hi> Lizard <hi>Point,</hi> Briſtol, Stamford <hi>and</hi> Boſton; <hi>and ſo by</hi> Stockholm <hi>and</hi> Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angel, <hi>into</hi> Ruſſia, Siberia, <hi>and</hi> Eaſt Tartary.</p>

<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0031101600:41"/>
Circle before. By this means you will have all thoſe <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of Lunar E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipſes ſolv'd, with greater eaſe, and the like pleaſure, which were before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented in the Solar. Nor is there any new difficulty in the Application. Only Note, that this Map of the Moon being too ſmall to have the Names of its ſeveral Seas and Lands engraven on it, it will be convenient to have withal a larger Map of the Moon, with thoſe Names, as an Explication of the other; which accordingly is here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, and plac'd on one ſide of the dark Circle, which is us'd with it. And Note farther, that thoſe who have a mind to be here very particular and exact, may uſe the larger Map of the Moon inſtead of the other, in caſe they join with it a dark Circle of 16 Inches and a quarter in Diameter: For the ſame Proportion which the Diameter of our ſmaller Moon of two Inches and an half, bears to that of our dark Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of ſix Inches and two fifths, does the Diameter of that Circle, or of the larger Moon bear to that of a Circle of ſixteen Inches and two fifths Diameter. Whence its plain, the larger Moon, and that largeſt Circle, will more exactly exhibit
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0031101600:42"/>
ſuch Lunar Eclipſes than the other. Tho' I believe there will be but few, who will not be ſatisfy'd with the ſmaller dark Circle; ſo I have not provided the larger: Which yet Mr. <hi>Senex,</hi> or Mr. <hi>Hudſon,</hi> the exact Engraver and Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of this Inſtrument, will readily procure for any that deſire them But then the ſeveral Circles concern'd muſt be ever ſo adjuſted, that the perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicular of their Centers may ſtill be the ſame with the Latitude of the Moon at the middle of the Eclipſe; and that as meaſur'd by a Scale, which is ſo much larger than ours, as their Diameters are larger.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thus we ſhall find by this Inſtrument, that there will be an Eclipſe of the Moon this Year,</hi> Octob. 31. <hi>that it will not be a Total, but a Partial Eclipſe; that the Digits eclips'd will be</hi> 8, <hi>and this on the North ſide of the Moon's Body: That the Eclipſe will begin about</hi> 2 h. 58 m. <hi>and end about</hi> 4 h. 40 m. <hi>in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and that Mount</hi> Aetna <hi>will enter the Shadow about</hi> 3 h. 8 m. <hi>and emerge about</hi> 5 h. 17 m.</p>

               <hi>Note thoſe that would exactly imitate Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in theſe Lunar Eclipſes, muſt let the Globe ſtand, and have a Lamp or Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of Light, larger in Diameter than the Globe, through whoſe Shadow the Map of the Moon muſt paſs. They ought alſo to have different Maps of the Moon out of</hi> Hevelius, <hi>to fit the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Librations of the Moon, or the ſmall variety there is in that Face which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to us in different Eclipſes. But ſince this Method would be much more troubleſome, and but little more advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous or entertaining, I choſe the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer eaſie way of exhibiting theſe Lunar Eclipſes by this Inſtrument, leaving the other to thoſe among the Curious, who ſhall think fit to beſtow any extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry coſt and trouble about it.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>But Note, That the Diameters of the</hi> Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numbra, <hi>and of the Moon, are here ſtill fitted to their Mean Quantity, when the Earth and Moon are about the ſhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Axis of their Ellipſes: So that when they are near their Aphelion and Apogee, their Perihelion and Perigee; or the Earth its Aphelion, and the Moon its Perigee; the Earth its Perihelion, and the Moon its Apogee; ſome ſmall Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences will ariſe in the Buſineſs of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipſes; which yet may eaſily be allow'd for on a little conſideration. Thus the next viſible Eclipſe of the Sun happening ſomewhat near the Earth's Aphelion, and nearer the Moon's Perigee, as the Poſition of their Orbits at that time in this Inſtrument will ſhew; the Moon will appear a little larger, and the Sun</hi>

               <hi>a little ſmaller than ordinary; whereby the Sun will be about</hi> 3 <hi>Minutes and</hi> 3 <hi>quarters under a total Eclipſe, all along the Central Path of the Moon's Shadow, and the</hi> 12 <hi>Digits on your Glaſs will not include the whole. In this Caſe you are to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe all the Circles</hi> 2 <hi>thirds of a Digit inlarg'd, and the Central Digit ſo much broader. Thus the next inviſible Eclipſe of the Sun,</hi> Octob. 16. <hi>happening ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what near the Earth's Perihelion, and nearer the Moon's Apogee; the Moon will appear ſomewhat leſs, and the Sun ſomewhat greater than ordinary; ſo that this Eclipſe will be only Annular, and not Total, and the Digits Eclipſed will not be quite</hi> 12. <hi>In this caſe you are to ſuppoſe all the Circles diminiſh'd</hi> 2 <hi>thirds of a Digit, and the Central Digit ſo much narrower; and the like Allowances are to be made in the Numbers upon the Path of and perpendicular to the Moon's Shadow, in the Diameter of the Moon's Map, in the Duration of Eclipſes,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>which muſt be left to every curious Perſon's own eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation; only with this intimation, that theſe Differences from the Standards here given are ever ſo ſmall, and commonly ſo inſenſible, that they may be well look'd on as almoſt perfectly inconſiderable in the uſe of this or the like Inſtruments.</hi>

               <hi>Note, that the time of half Duration in</hi> Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter<hi>'s innermoſt, which is the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Satellit in this matter, is near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> 1 h. 6 m. <hi>and ſo the whole Duration about</hi> 2 h. 12. m. <hi>perpetually.</hi>

               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:0031101600:55"/>
               <hi>Note farther, that only one of theſe Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, the Immerſion or Emerſion of a Satellit, is generally viſible at the ſame time;</hi> viz. <hi>the Immerſion from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of the Primary Planet with the Sun till its Oppoſition; and the Emerſion from its Oppoſition till its Conjunction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note alſo, that till we have more exact and ſuitable Tables of the reſt of theſe Secon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary Planets, it will be proper, two Nights ſucceſſively, to obſerve the Poſition of as many as we can of them; and from thoſe Obſervations to fix their Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, with relation to their Primary ones, to thoſe times. For ſince their Orbits, on our Inſtrument, gives their ſeveral Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ods exactly enough; from thoſe Periods their future Places and Poſitions may be found by two ſuch Obſervations, for a great while; and ſuch Poſitions may be with pleaſure enough compar'd with a great number of other Obſervations af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards. Nor do we wholly want an Aſtronomical Method, as to the moſt uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of theſe Secondary Planets, which is the innermoſt about</hi> Jupiter; <hi>ſince the Tables neceſſary for placing the ſame right, and for the Eclipſes for ſome Years to come, tho' too large for this ſmall Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual, are publiſh'd in my Aſtrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, with full Directions for their uſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo; to which I muſt refer the curious Reader.</hi>

               <hi>Note farther, that we are generally to look for only one of</hi> Saturn<hi>'s Satellites; there being few Glaſſes that can ſhew us any more; and none but thoſe of the famous</hi> Caſſini <hi>that can diſcover the two inner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt.</hi>

               <hi>Note here, that</hi> Jupiter<hi>'s Planets are all in or near the Plain of his Equator, which is near the Plain of the Ecliptick it ſelf; and that they are hardly at all Eccentrical. That</hi> Saturn<hi>'s moſt viſible Planet, diſcover'd by</hi> Hugenius, <hi>is the fourth in order, or the outmoſt but one: as alſo that its Planets are in or near the Plain of its Ring, which is about</hi> 31 <hi>deg. inclin'd to the Ecliptick; and that they do not any of them appear to be very much Eccentrical neither.</hi>

               <hi>And note, that our Terreſtrial Globe may be ſo contriv'd, that it may be alſo us'd with an Horizon, as any other Terreſtrial Globe may; and by conſequence, thoſe who buy its Celeſtial Fellow, may at the ſame time have a</hi> Pair of Globes, <hi>as well as a</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernicus; <hi>which will at once ſave al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all the Charges of one Globe; and afford a Foundation for the underſtanding of both the principal parts of</hi> Aſtronomy <hi>alſo, I mean</hi> the Doctrine of the Sphere, <hi>to which the Globes; and</hi> the Theory of the Planets, <hi>to which our</hi> Copernicus <hi>does immediately belong.</hi>

            <p>IN this <hi>Appendix</hi> I have ſet down thoſe <hi>Aſtronomical Tables,</hi> which are chiefly neceſſary, in order to the ready Uſe of the preſent Inſtrument: And they are, 1. A Table of the <hi>Mean Place</hi> of the <hi>Apogee,</hi> and of the <hi>Aſcending Node</hi> of the <hi>Moon's Orbit,</hi> as well as of the <hi>Moon</hi> it ſelf, at the beginning of every Century for 1000 Years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and ever ſince the Chriſtian <hi>Aera.</hi> 2. A Table of the middle of the general <hi>Eclipſes</hi> of the <hi>Sun,</hi> within ſome Hours under or over, for above half this Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury. This is deriv'd from Dr. <hi>Halley</hi>'s SAROS, or very uſeful Table of the firſt 18 Years of the ſame Century; and will ſave ſome trouble in the uſe of this Inſtrument, and indeed in any other method of Calculation for the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; which muſt needs be ſhortened by knowing the Time ſo nearly as is here ſpecified. 3. A like Table of the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the <hi>Eclipſes</hi> of the <hi>Moon,</hi> for the ſame interval, and deriv'd from the ſame Original; as well as ſerving to the like purpoſe with the former. The reſt of the Aſtronomical Tables, any way ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in this Inſtrument, may be found at the end of my <hi>Aſtronomical Lectures,</hi> which are now publiſhed both in <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
