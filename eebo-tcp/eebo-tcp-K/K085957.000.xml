            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WERE it Poſſible for me to offer at your ROYAL FEET, a Tribute, ſo Important, as to MERIT your MAJESTY'S Acceptance, I had never paid my Debt of Duty, in ſo poor a Manner; But, ſince the
<pb facs="tcp:0607601700:5"/>
Smile of HEAVEN, upon the WIDOWS MITE, Inſtructs us, that the WILL, not POWER, muſt Enrich the Offering; I am al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt led to hope, YOUR MAJESTY will Stoop to the Reception of ſo Low a Preſent, when you ſhall be pleas'd to know, 'tis all, I have to give; For LIFE, and FORTUNE are ſo firmly Yours already, that I cannot hope to taſt the Length of one, or Worth of t'other, but by holding BOTH in Your MAJESTY'S Diſpoſal.</p>
            <p>THE Sacred Power of PIOUS MAJESTY, Commands not only Love, and Loyalty, from Subjects, and Dependants, but (as the Attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Virtue of the Wond'rous MAGNET draws the Sturdy IRON to its Sway,) may Challenge an Authority, to Rule the Salvage Minds of Independant Infidels. The Mighty Glories of your MAJESTY'S Succeſsful Reign have bent more Kingdoms than You Govern, to an Envy of the <hi>BRITONS,</hi> Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py in Your Influences; And Experience Taught me, that while <hi>BRITAINS NAME</hi>

            <p>TO whom then, MIGHTY QUEEN, ſhou'd I Addreſs my Self for a Protection of my Labours, but to the THRONE of MA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>JESTY, where CRITIC'S Malice, and the Sting of CENSURE cannot Reach me, and where HEAVEN has ſeem'd to Point our Marks of Duty, and Humility to lie, as by the Seat of MERCY, and the VICEROY of <hi>OMNI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>POTENCE.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BE therefore pleas'd, Great Ruler of the HEARTS, as well as PERSONS of Your People, to accept this humble Offering, which I lay, with Duty at Your GRACIOUS FEET; For, as the ſmall Improvement, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Years continued Travels, thro' the Rougher Corners of the World, have made me Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of, may ſo be Crown'd with the

            <head>CHAP. II. Of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Policy.</head>
            <p>THE Political Maxims of an Arbitrary Government, may not improperly be compar'd to the ſpreading Roots and twiſting Fibres of ſome Tall Oak, whoſe elevated Heigth expoſing it to double Danger, by the raging Force of Stormy Winds a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong its Branches, has no Security but the Rooted Depth, by which it is ſupported againſt the ſtrongeſt Efforts of contending Tempeſts; and certainly a Government ſo vaſtly Large, ſo inexpreſſibly Rich, and ſo ſtrangely different from all other, muſt be ſupported ſtrongly by ſome uncommon Policy; without which Guard, the daring Ambition of aſpiring Princes, and the formidable violences of inteſtine Diſcords, would like ſome ſurprizing Earthquake, break fiercely thro' the Bands of Duty, and by their factious Conſequences involve the Empire in moſt inevitable Ruin.</p>
            <p>THAT I may with greater eaſe Deſcribe the ſolid Foundations, upon which the <hi>Turks</hi> have built their Safety, 'twill be neceſſary to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide their Maxims into Two Parts. The Firſt, are thoſe by which the <hi>Sultan</hi> ſupports ſecurely his unrival'd Grandeur, and the ſure Dominion of his extenſive Empire. The Second, are ſuch Notions as are taught his Subjects with the earlieſt Rudiments of their common Knowledge, and diffuſe with eaſe a certain Awful Duty, or almoſt Idolatrous Veneration thro' the whole Country for the Perſon of their Emperour; and are the only cauſes of that mild Obedience and miſerable Servitude, with which they own themſelves his Slaves, and endeavour vigorouſly to exert an uncommon Induſtry, in hopes to gain ſome Mark of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour from the ineſtimable Bounty of their Common Maſter.</p>

Secondly, By the miſerable and barren Condition of a diſ-peopled Country, 'twould be found a matter of inconceivable difficulty, for an Invading Enemy to penetrate their Empire with a numerous Army; ſince their Troops without the chargeable Inconvenience of vaſt quantities of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, would never be able to ſubſiſt in a Country, whoſe flying hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of Inhabitants, would immediately convey what little Stores their Poverty afforded them, to Woods and Mountains, and Places inacceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to People unacquainted with the Paſſes of the Country: Another Reaſon is, the utter impoſſibility, which Diſcarded Favorites (by this Means) find to eſcape the Anger of their Offended <hi>Sultan</hi>; for knowing no Place capable of Aſſiſting or Concealing them, unleſs they Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire to ſome <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Country, they rather chooſe a voluntary Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation of their Lives and Fortunes to the undiſputed Will of their Great Maſter; and quietly ſubmit their Necks to the Sword of the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioner.</p>

               <note place="margin">Second Maxim.</note>HIS Second Maxim is, That the only way to preſerve a Domeſtick Quiet, is to employ the Heads and Hands of his Subjects in ſome Foreign War: <note place="margin">Its Reaſons.</note>The numerous Advantages which accrue from this Maxim are ſo Conſpicuous as ſcarce to need an Explanation; for by this means he is continually enlarging the Bounds of his Dominions, or at leaſt improving the vaſt Numbers of his Soldiers, in an Inſtructive Practice of all the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and neceſſary Points of Military Diſcipline: By theſe means he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves himſelf ſecure from the ſudden Violence of Domeſtick Rebellion; for the ſearch of Glory firing the Breaſts of Officers and Soldiers, they unanimouſly bend their utmoſt Endeavours to encreaſe the Power of their extended Empire, which a lazy Peace might rather prompt them to Deſtroy: For the working Brains of Men inur'd to War and Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, will abhor the Ruſt of idle Sloth, and ſtir up gradually an Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious Fire in the Breaſt of the Soldier, to lay a ſudden hold on ſome inviting Opportunity, and raiſe himſelf to Power and Honour, upon the bloody Ruin of his ſurpriz'd Commander.</p>

is altogether inconſiſtent with the rougher Genius of a Warlike Nation; and that Learning if encourag'd would lull their Faculties in a ſilent love of Study, till ſinking in the ſoft indulgence of a Philoſophical Solitude, they would neglect entirely the more noble Practice of thoſe Martial Exerciſes, whoſe ſucceſsful Application has bravely rais'd them to the glorious Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, which now diſtinguiſhes them from the leſs Powerful World.</p>

               <note place="margin">Fifth Maxim.</note>BUT above all theſe, there is One Maxim the conſtant Care and Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the <hi>Turkiſh Sultans,</hi> and that is to be ſerv'd by ſuch Men as they can Raiſe without Envy, and Deſtroy without Danger. This they put in Practice by admitting none to the Honour or Truſt of great Preferments, but ſuch as have been brought up under the ſtricteſt Diſcipline of a <hi>Seraglio</hi> Education: They are generally the Sons of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Parents, taken Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives by the wand'ring Incurſions of the Roving <hi>Tartar,</hi> and ſent by way of the <hi>Black Sea</hi> to <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> as to a Common Market: Out of great Numbers of theſe there are Yearly Choſen a certain Quantity for the <hi>Grand Signior</hi>'s <hi>Seraglio,</hi> where at their firſt Admiſſion they are carefully In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in the Rudiments of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Language and Religion. Thence proceeding gradually as qualified in Body or Mind, from the laborious Practices of the meaneſt Drudgeries, to the loftieſt Studies of their more Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite Accompliſhments, till their Knowledge and Experience encreaſing with their Years, they are Preferr'd at laſt to ſome Place of <hi>Honour</hi> about the Perſon of their <hi>Emperour,</hi> and thence advanc'd as Occaſion offers to the Government of ſome Principality, a Seat of Juſtice, or Command in the Army, whichſoever their Genius has chiefly ſeem'd to bend them to: <note place="margin">Its Reaſons.</note>And by theſe Means being Educated from their Infancy with a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile Awe upon their Spirits, their Endeavours are entirely bent to pleaſe their <hi>Sultan</hi>; and ſtarting from ſo ſevere a Diſcipline to the Seat of <hi>Power,</hi> without Friend or Parent to aſſiſt them in their Enterprizes, they have no poſſibility of attempting with the ſmalleſt likelihood of Succeſs the leaſt Deſign againſt the Intereſt of their <hi>Sovereign</hi>: But beſides this, The <hi>Grand Signior</hi> has another Method no leſs Politick, to prevent them from making an ill uſe of the Authority he truſts them with; and that is the frequent Change of Officers, often calling them from one <hi>Government</hi> to take <hi>Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion</hi> of <hi>another</hi> in ſome far diſtant Part of the <hi>Country</hi>; by which means having no time to fix an Intereſt with the People that are under them, they are abſolutely debarr'd from the ſmalleſt Hopes of Succeſs in an At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt againſt the <hi>Perſon</hi> or <hi>Power</hi> of their <hi>Sultan,</hi> who ſeldom continues them ſo long as Three Years in one Place; and as if in that time there was danger of a <hi>Revolt,</hi> takes care by other Methods to render it ſtill more impracticable, for giving them no Money, when he prefers them to a <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi> and themſelves Poſſeſſing nothing but what they receive from his Bounty, they are oblig'd to borrow great Sums on Credit to furniſh out their Equipage, for which the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Merchants exacting often <hi>Cent per Cent</hi> Intereſt; they have no other way to pay theſe Debts, than by a bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous Oppreſſion of the <hi>Provinces</hi> they are ſent to, and knowing their time to be but ſhort, they ſeldom fail by Arbitrary Methods to enrich them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for ever after, by a Three Years Plunder of the poor Inhabitants; by which means they become odious to the People, who would be ſo far from aſſiſting them againſt the <hi>Sultan,</hi> as readily to embrace the ſmalleſt Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity for revenging their Misfortunes in the Death or Ruin of their Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick Governour; By which the <hi>Grand Signior</hi>'s Power ſtands more unſhaken than that of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Princes, who have too often ſuffer'd by the Ambitious Inclinations of Rebellious Subjects.</p>
            <p>THESE are the moſt noted Maxims of the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Policy, whereby the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Emperours maintain an uncontroul'd Authority over their ſo vaſt Dominions: Others there are, which being taught the People as Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential

               <note place="margin">Sixth Maxim.</note>AND Firſt, Obedience to the <hi>Sultan</hi>'s Will is taught them as a Duty, the neglect whereof, will draw down the Curſes of God and <hi>Mahomet</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on themſelves and their Poſterity: His Word muſt ever be a ſettled Law, and Infallibility a peculiar Perfection of his Nature: None dare believe he errs, and tho' his Actions appear altogether inconſiſtent with Reaſon or Humanity, they muſt rather queſtion the perſpicuity of their Senſes, than preſume to think he ever can be guilty: Nay, ſo widely has this crafty Leſſon ſpread its Doctrine, that to die by the Hand or Mandate of their Emperour, is look'd upon by theſe deluded Wretches as a never failing Paſſport to the Gates of Paradiſe; and ſo Sacred a Veneration do they pay to the Perſon of this Idoliz'd <hi>Sultan,</hi> as if his People were deſtin'd as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior Species of Mortality, to ſerve the mighty End of his Creation: The better to ſupport this awful Senſe of Fear and Duty, the Expounders of their Law have fix'd a Notion in the Superſtitious Breaſts of the Common Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that they can never pay too deep a Veneration to the Perſon of their Emperour, ſince the good or evil Fate of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Empire depends entirely on the Preſervation or Extinction of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Family.</p>

            <p>TIS Perhaps the moſt difficult Undertaking a Man can put himſelf upon, to write of the numerous Intricacies of Foreign Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and particularly One like that of <hi>Turkey</hi>; the Native Haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſs of whoſe Inſulting People, and their coy Deportment to the Travelling Subjects of a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Country, are ſo many inacceſſible Barriers to the Curioſity of their Obſervations: But 'tis a Task yet more difficult to endeavour a ſatisfactory Deſcription of that Part of their Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution which compoſes this Chapter, ſince the Offices of their Religion are ſo cloſely interwoven with thoſe of their Law, that 'tis almoſt impoſſible to treat of either without involving both in a promiſcuous Confuſion.</p>

               <hi>Janiſary</hi> is nothing but a Corruption of the Word <hi>Yani-Cherr,</hi> which in the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Language, ſignifies a <hi>New-Order</hi>; they took their Original from the Death of one <hi>Hodgy Bectaſh,</hi> an Old Religious Man of an <hi>exemplary</hi> Life and Converſation, in the Reign of <hi>Sultan Amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rath,</hi> the third King of the <hi>Turks</hi>: This Man had long endeavour'd to diſſuade <hi>that</hi> Prince from dangerouſly expoſing his Perſon, by too near a Familiarity with the Subjects of <hi>Servia,</hi> often Propheſying the ſudden Death which afterwards befel the <hi>Sultan</hi> upon the Overthrow of <hi>Lazarus</hi> the Deſpot of that Country, when walking out to view the Heaps of Slain, one <hi>Miles Corbelitza,</hi> a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Soldier, riſing heavily from a Mount of Carkaſſes, made ſhift to ſtagger in the Pangs of Death, and by expreſſive Motions of his Head and Hands deſir'd admittance to the Perſon of the Emperour, who thinking he deſign'd to beg his Life permitted him to ſuch a near Approach, that the undaunted <hi>Servian,</hi> falling on his Knees as if he would have ſued for Mercy, ſnatch'd out a Dagger from his <hi>bleeding</hi> Boſome, and ſtriking it with violence to the <hi>Sultan</hi>'s Heart, reveng'd ſucceſsfully his Countries Wrongs, and liv'd and dy'd like <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s <hi>Sampſon</hi> a double Scourge to an Ambitious Enemy.</p>
            <p>THE Death of <hi>Bectaſh</hi> immediately ſucceeded that of <hi>Amurath,</hi> for having often propheſy'd the Blow and not preventing it, tho' near the <hi>Sultan</hi>'s Perſon, he was cut in pieces by the furious Guards, as a <hi>Party</hi> in the Treaſon; but foreſeeing eaſily, what Fate would ſoon befall him, he rent off a long Sleeve, which he wore continually on his Right Arm, and putting it upon the Head of one of the Soldiers, cried out prophetically in the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Language,
<q>

               <note place="margin">A Story how <hi>Mahomet</hi> came to forbid his Followers the Uſe of Wine.</note>THERE was a certain Shepherd in the Neighbourhood of <hi>Meccha,</hi> whoſe Poſſeſſions were ſo far Superior to the reſt of his Fraternity, that he was Choſen as a Ruler of their whole Society, and exercis'd a ſort of mild Authority, by the joint Permiſſion of the Shepherds of that Country.</p>
            <p>IT happen'd that this Man oppos'd with violence the Doctrine of the Impoſtor, then but newly vented in thoſe very Parts wherein he liv'd, and all the Brotherhood depending upon him as on their Lord and Oracle, The crafty <hi>Mahomet</hi> perceiv'd it difficult without his Friendſhip to accompliſh his Deſigns, and ſo reſolv'd to court his Favour by the moſt reſpectful Marks of Honour and Civility.</p>
            <p>ACCORDINGLY he came one Day to make a Viſit to this pow'rful Shepherd, attended pompouſly by a magnificent and numerous Retinue; it hapned that a Daughter of this honeſt Mans was that Day Marry'd, and a ſplendid Entertainment made, to feaſt thoſe many Gueſts who grac'd her Nuptials; when the Prophet enter'd, he ſaluted kindly all the Company with his moſt hearty Bleſſing, and ſat him freely down among the reſt, pretending great and wond'rous Satisfaction in their agreable and pleaſant Converſation.</p>

            <p>BUT Buſineſs leading him a little farther, he began to take his leave, and was detain'd againſt his Will by the uncommon Kindneſs of the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd and his Family, who wou'd by no means ſuffer him to go, till he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd himſelf by ſolemn Promiſe to return again as ſoon as he had ended what ſmall Buſineſs he was then to go about.

            <p>
               <note place="margin">The manner of Collecting it.</note>THE manner of Collecting this prodigious Sum, is by Aſſeſſing every Subject of his <hi>Empire,</hi> at an inconſiderable Yearly Tax, which he muſt pay as an Acknowledgment of his Dependance on, and Duty to the <hi>Sultan</hi>; and it is an admirable Method, they have got, of raiſing all this Money without any charge or trouble to the <hi>Emperor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE Petty Governors of every little <hi>Diſtrict,</hi> are oblig'd to gather the reſpective <hi>Quota</hi>'s of the <hi>Villagers</hi> about them, and ſet out with Guards ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to defend the Money towards the next great <hi>Town</hi> to their dependant Reſidences; here they muſt deliver it to the Poſſeſſion of the <hi>Aga,</hi> or the <hi>Governour</hi> of the Place, demanding his Diſcharge for their Acquittance of a Duty ſo incumbent on their Offices.</p>

THE Quarterly <hi>Collections</hi> never are behind hand, for on pain of Ruin no Man dares refuſe immediate Payment on the Day appointed, ſo that <hi>ten Days</hi> after every <hi>Quarter,</hi> the <hi>remoteſt Provinces</hi> begin to ſend away their Money towards the <hi>City</hi> I ſo lately nam'd.

            </p>
            <p>IT is obſervable, that as the Provinces, which lie the neareſt to their great <hi>Metropolis,</hi> muſt undertake the <hi>Convoy</hi> of far greater Sums than the <hi>remoter Places,</hi> ſo the number of their <hi>Soldiers</hi> is proportionably greater, as they are by far more populous, for reaſons mention'd in the Chapter, treating of the <hi>Maxims</hi> of their <hi>Policy.</hi>

            <p>I'LL tell you a pleaſant Story, and leave your-ſelf to gueſs, how ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirably <hi>Nature</hi> has endued the <hi>nimble-minded Graecian Ladies,</hi> with the fineſt qualifications in the World, for <hi>Cuckolding</hi> their Husbands.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">A pleaſant Story of a Graecian Lady.</note>THERE is a little Village, call'd <hi>Belgrade,</hi> about fifteen Miles from <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> wonderfully pleaſant for its <hi>airy Situation</hi>; here a <hi>Greek,</hi> who was grown rich by <hi>Merchandizing,</hi> kept a very pretty <hi>Country Houſe,</hi> and in it a young Wife, extreamly handſome, but, as ſomewhat brisker than he wiſh'd her, ſhe alarm'd his Jealouſy to watch her ſtrictly, nor wou'd he often let her walk alone in the adjoining Groves and Meadows.</p>
            <p>HOWEVER, I was <hi>one Day</hi> going by a Wood-ſide, at the bottom of a <hi>Hill</hi> to Angle in a <hi>River,</hi> that ran by it, and perceiv'd upon the <hi>Bank</hi> a charming youthful Lady buſy at her Needle, with a <hi>Pot of Water</hi> ſtanding by her, I immediately imagin'd right, and gueſs'd her the <hi>fine Wife</hi> of the <hi>rich Greek</hi> abovenam'd; I muſt own I was ſurpriz'd to find her, ſo, beyond my expectation, gay and beautiful; I ſaw ſhe was alone, and ventur'd to addreſs her in <hi>Italian,</hi> ſhe return'd my Salutation in that Language, and permitted me to ſit down by her, and converſe with all the Liberties of <hi>decent Familiarity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Her familiar Temper.</note>SHE preſently began to make Complaint of the Reſtriction ſhe was under, by her Husbands Jealouſie, and the Reſtraint, which Women in that Country were oblig'd to undergoe, and really thence proceeded to make ſuch kind advances, and ſo prettily encourage me to hope her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, e'er I ask'd it, that I only wanted <hi>vanity,</hi> to think I might have met ſucceſs in any kind of offer, <hi>Youth,</hi> or <hi>Inclination</hi> might have tempted me to make her.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">A wonderful Preſence of Mind.</note>BUT on a ſudden, in the Height of her Diſcourſe and <hi>Gayety,</hi> we heard a Voice among the Trees upon the other ſide of the River, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ſhe knew it was <hi>her Husband,</hi> and expecting every moment, when he wou'd appear in ſight, was ſure he muſt Diſcover me to have been talking with her, ſo the very minute, that he call'd her, ſhe fell
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:0607601700:230"/>
ſideways on the Ground, extended both her Arms with natural negligence, let drop the <hi>Silk</hi> ſhe was at Work upon, and ſeem'd as much Aſleep, as if ſhe really had been ſo.</p>
            <p>TWAS no hard Task to gueſs the meaning of this <hi>Counterfeited Slum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> ſo that, willing to prevent all cauſe of Jealouſy, inſtead of ſtriving to get out of Sight, I ſtarted up, and bending forward, look'd upon her Face, as if ſurpriz'd to find a <hi>Woman</hi> in that Place and Poſture.</p>
            <p>I had hardly time to regulate my <hi>Air of Wonder,</hi> when the <hi>Greek</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd upon the Bank directly oppoſite; he <hi>Started,</hi> when he ſaw the Poſture of his <hi>Wife,</hi> and me ſo near her. I pretended an <hi>Amazement</hi> equal to his own, at his appearance, and was juſt about to ask him, if he knew that <hi>Lady,</hi> when he Interrupted my deſign by <hi>Hallowing,</hi> as loud as he cou'd poſſibly, to wake his <hi>Conſort.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>SHE, <hi>Poor Creature,</hi> was ſo faſt aſleep, that all his <hi>Noiſes</hi> were in vain, ſhe Slumbred on, till I, as willing to give all the Countenance Imaginable to her <hi>Politic Contrivance,</hi> took her by the <hi>Arm</hi> and ſhook her pretty roughly; <note place="margin">An admirable Counterfeit.</note>at this ſhe Rous'd, and having rubb'd her Eyes with admirable Cunning, look'd about her, and was, <hi>doubtleſs,</hi> much ſurpriz'd to ſee me there, it having been ſo long, ſince we Diſcours'd together.</p>
            <p>HOWEVER, I was pleas'd to ſee, how excellently ſhe contriv'd to humour wonder, mix'd with an <hi>alloy</hi> of Modeſty, both which I fear, and ten to one, you'll think ſo by the Sequel, were alike Strangers to her <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>; ſhe ſtarted up upon her Feet, and fix'd her Eyes upon me with an Artful <hi>Wildneſs,</hi> running Backwards, as I offer'd to approach her, with a <hi>Shriek</hi> or two enough to Frighten all the <hi>Tygers</hi> in the <hi>Wilderneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE more to take all cauſe of Apprehenſion from the <hi>Staring Husband,</hi> I advanc'd, as ſhe retir'd, ſtill bowing, and aſſuring her I meant no harm, deſiring her to Apprehend no danger from my preſence, who was drawn by Accident to Walk that way, and by her <hi>Charms</hi> detain'd to gaze upon her <hi>Perſon</hi>; all this while the <hi>Subtle Female Devil</hi> kept a <hi>Side-long-glance</hi> upon her Husbands Countenance, who ſeem'd diverted at the Fright, my <hi>Compliments</hi> had put her in; ſhe ſaw him ſmile, and was reſolv'd to keep up the <hi>Conceit,</hi> wherefore, while I ſtill continued <hi>Bowing</hi> and Addreſt her with a Thouſand <hi>Congees,</hi> ſhe <hi>Inhumanely</hi> ſtoop'd down, and ſnatching up the <hi>Earthen Pot,</hi> which ſtood upon the Ground, threw full three <hi>Pints of Water</hi> in my <hi>Face</hi> and <hi>Boſom.</hi>

THE turn of this <hi>laſt</hi> part of the <hi>Intrigue</hi> ſurpris'd me ten times more than all the reſt; However, I ran back to fetch my Periwig, while ſhe was croſſing a <hi>ſmall Bridge</hi> a little higher to get over to her <hi>Husband,</hi> who as ſoon as his long fit of Mirth allow'd an <hi>Interval,</hi> cry'd out to me, <hi>Excuſe her Sir, the</hi> Graecian <hi>Wives are never us'd to Strangers Company, and only love their Husbands Converſation.</hi>

            <p>NOW, Reader, have I brought you to a ſort of People, who for every kind of Villany, and unexampled Practices of Guilt in its moſt elevated Inſolence, may juſtly boaſt themſelves without a Rival; <hi>Impunity</hi> encourages them all to <hi>Sin,</hi> and <hi>independent Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogance</hi> protects them in it; They are ſhun'd by all degrees of Men, and all Men equally by <hi>them</hi> deteſted; They are <hi>Nature's Outcaſt,</hi> and the black <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſters</hi> of Humanity and common Goodneſs, and of all the World may beſt lay claim to the Profeſſion of a <hi>Maxim,</hi> which the <hi>Roman Satyriſt</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes thus,

               </note>'TWAS in the Reign of <hi>Sultan Selym,</hi> the ſucceſsful <hi>Turkiſh Emperour,</hi> who overthrew the Government of the <hi>Circaſſian Mamalukes,</hi> and added <hi>Egypt</hi> to his own Dominions, that the few remaining <hi>Soldiers</hi> of that Name, who had eſcap'd the Slaughter, and retir'd in little Numbers to the <hi>Borders</hi> of the <hi>Deſart,</hi> were encourag'd by a <hi>certain daring Slave,</hi> nam'd <hi>Zinganeus,</hi> to aſſemble in one Body, and make uſe of thoſe <hi>offenſive Arms</hi> their haſty Flight had left them, to their beſt advantage; they conſented to the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and upon examination found themſelves a formidable Body, able to defend their Ground by reaſon of the difficulty of acceſs, againſt the Power of all Invaders.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">A Salvage kind of Life.</note>THUS they liv'd ſome time, made Nightly Inrodes to the fertil Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures on the Banks of <hi>Nilus, plunder'd Towns, destroy'd Inhabitants, drove off their Cattle,</hi> and committed all Outrages, void of fear, and free from Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, not only keeping ſo ſecure a Guard, that they defended their Poſſeſſions, but admitting daily Numbers of their <hi>old Companions,</hi> who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted to their Party in conſiderable Bodies, as often as they found conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Opportunities.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>Turks,</hi> who dreaded what might be the Conſequences of this threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning growth of Power, ſent Great Commanders with ſome regular Forces to <hi>reduce</hi> them to Obedience; who fell ſhort in their Deſigns, and were ſent back <hi>half ruin'd,</hi> to aſſure their Officers, they were to cope with greater Strength than they imagin'd.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="196" facs="tcp:0607601700:248"/>
IN ſhort, the <hi>Turks</hi> perceiv'd ſo great a Difficulty in the Method they muſt take to bring 'em to Subjection, that they rather choſe to offer Terms of Friendſhip, and Accommodation, which the <hi>Mamalukes</hi> as rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily accepted of, as growing weary of the <hi>Dangerous Alarums</hi> they were Hourly Subject to, ſo that a Peace was ſoon concluded, <note place="margin">Articles of Accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note>and the Articles thereof Obliging the <hi>Circaſſians</hi> to lay down their Arms, permitted them to exerciſe what other way of Living, their deſires wou'd lead 'em to make choice of.</p>
            <p>BUT <hi>Civil Diſcipline</hi> agreeing rarely with the <hi>Military Genius</hi> of licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Multitudes, they grew unruly, and became ſo prejudicial to the common Intereſt, that the offended <hi>Turks</hi> at laſt grew weary of forgiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Enacted a degree, that every <hi>ZINGANEE, for they were ſo diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh'd, from the Name of their Ringleader,</hi> ſhou'd in Fourteen Days depart the Kingdom: <note place="margin">They are Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd <hi>Egypt.</hi>
               </note>This was ſo ſeverely put in Execution, that in leſs than two Months ſpace, not one remain'd, who <hi>Publickly</hi> durſt own himſelf of <hi>that Denomination,</hi> for it was made Lawfull for what Man ſoever met them, when their Date expired, to <hi>Take, Kill, Enſtave,</hi> or <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> them as he thought convenient.</p>
            <p>NO Man from that time forward e'er knew certainly, what became of <hi>Zinganeus</hi> their Commander, tho 'tis commonly believ'd he ſtaid in <hi>Egypt,</hi> where at preſent <hi>his Poſterity</hi> and that of <hi>his Companions,</hi> openly dare own themſelves. A certain Prophecy is ſpread about, relating to ſome fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hopes, Predominant on the Opinion of the <hi>Zinganees,</hi> tho <hi>few</hi> among the <hi>Turks,</hi> regard or Value it.

               </note>THE <hi>Native Inſolence</hi> of theſe licentious Wretches may be gueſs'd at by a <hi>Story</hi> I will tell you. At a little <hi>Country Town</hi> in <hi>Turkey,</hi> where great Numbers of the <hi>Zinganees</hi> had pitch'd their <hi>Tents,</hi> a <hi>Friend</hi> of mine, who kept a Summer Houſe, retir'd to paſs a Month or two; and having been inform'd how Skillful they were fam'd to be in making <hi>Hatchets</hi> of an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable temper, had the Curioſity to purchaſe one, at the dear rate of <hi>three and twenty Shillings</hi> in the Money of that Country.</p>
            <p>HE <hi>try'd</hi> his <hi>Hatchet,</hi> which was neatly made, and had a fine <hi>turn'd Helve,</hi> and <hi>Leather Caſe</hi> to keep the Head from wet, and found it ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Good, that he commended it extreamly to the Man, who made it, and profeſs'd he wou'd not loſe it for its <hi>double Value.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">A Cheating Temper.</note>NOTHING cou'd have been more <hi>welcom News,</hi> or <hi>fairer Invitation</hi> to the <hi>Zinganee</hi> than this, he preſently reſolv'd to find ſome opportunity of ſtealing back the <hi>Hatchet,</hi> that he might oblige the <hi>Gentleman</hi> to buy ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or reward him well for the pretence of having found the <hi>old one.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IN ſhort, he <hi>watch'd</hi> a day or two, and having made his obſervation of the Place 'twas laid in, ſoon found means to get it, and was met one Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning by the Owner, as he haſten'd from the Chamber with the mark of <hi>Theft</hi> about him; The <hi>Gentleman,</hi> ſurpriz'd to ſee a <hi>Zinganee</hi> in his <hi>Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> took him by the Arm as he was paſſing by, and ask'd him ſomewhat

roughly, what his Buſineſs was, and whither he was carrying his Hatchet; The <hi>Gypſy, an experienc'd Artiſt,</hi> anſwer'd nothing, but with elevated Eyes, and ſhaking Head, endeavour'd ſilently to get away; <note place="margin">A wonderful Aſſurance.</note>but when the <hi>Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> encreas'd his anger, and began to call his Servants to ſecure him, with a bold, undaunted Look, and Tongue as nimble as his Fingers, he began to talk away his Guilt, in Speeches to the following purpoſe.

Now I know you think that I came hither with deſign to <hi>ſteal your Hatchet</hi>; O poor Frailty of your common Underſtanding! I have Skill, <hi>honeſt Infidel,</hi> and by that Skill knew certainly, that if this <hi>Hatchet</hi> was not taken from you, this Morning at <hi>Eleven a Clock,</hi> and juſt three Minutes after, you wou'd have been inclin'd to try its Metal on you Log of Wood, and ſo had ſurely cut your <hi>Right Leg</hi> half aſunder.

            <p>HE had no ſooner ſpoke theſe Words, but <hi>off he ran,</hi> as faſt as he was able, nor was overtaken, tho' the <hi>Servants</hi> follow'd him, till he had reach'd a <hi>Well</hi> of an <hi>unfathomable Depth,</hi> and there he ſtopp'd, but firſt threw in the <hi>Hatchet,</hi> which he knew cou'd never be recover'd from ſo deep a Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom.</p>

            <p>I ſhould have told you, that they always chuſe ſome <hi>even ſpot of Ground</hi> to pitch their Tents, where the Men and Women <hi>Sing</hi> and <hi>Dance,</hi> in auk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>Geſtures</hi> all Day long, <hi>run, hop,</hi> and toy away their Hours in various kinds of active Entertainments.</p>

            <p>THE Captain of the Ship, wherein I Sail'd, oblig'd me with his Boat, while adverſe Winds detain'd us on the Coaſt, and one <hi>Franciſco Condaliſo,</hi> an <hi>Italian Prieſt,</hi> who had been long a <hi>Miſſionary</hi> in the <hi>Eaſtern Countries,</hi> and at preſent, if alive, reſides at <hi>Padua,</hi> conſented to Accompany me; <note place="margin">The Author Lands at <hi>Troy.</hi>

COMING near it, we perceiv'd it was the ſame continued Piece of Building, we had lately loſt, and on a cloſe Examination found it of a black and ſolid Stone, appearing join'd by Mortar, which the length of time had notwithſtanding, hard'ned into Subſtance, of an equal firmneſs with the Stone it ſelf.</p>

            <p>A Dangerous Tempeſt forc'd <hi>our Ship</hi> to ſeek a <hi>Shelter</hi> in a certain <hi>Creek</hi> upon the <hi>Southward</hi> of this <hi>Iſland,</hi> where we Anchor'd pretty ſafely, and were drawn by the delightful Proſpect of the <hi>Shore</hi> to <hi>Land</hi> upon it, <hi>about Six in Company.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>WE Walk'd directly to it, and perceiv'd it was a <hi>Veſſel</hi> of a very ſmall and Incapacious Hollow, full of <hi>Oyl,</hi> in which were Swimming up and down near Twenty little <hi>Engines,</hi> which upon Examination, we diſcover'd to be <hi>Sponges,</hi> each containing upon either ſide, a little piece of <hi>Cork,</hi> which being

            <p>WE were Buſied a conſiderable time in looking on theſe things, and wondring what ſhou'd be their uſe in ſo remote a Place, from any <hi>Town,</hi> as that appear'd, whereon we found 'em, but at laſt reſolv'd to ſit us down upon the <hi>Sand,</hi> and wait the coming of an owner to the <hi>Veſſel,</hi> for we thought it Probable there was one, and believ'd he cou'd not long be abſent.</p>
            <p>BUT, while we Talk'd to one another of the Wondrous Smoothneſs of the Waters in the <hi>Bay,</hi> while thoſe without were Ruffled by the Storm, and caſt our Eyes upon their ſtillneſs, <note place="margin">A Strange ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize.</note>we were all ſurpriz'd to ſee a thing not much unlike a <hi>Basket,</hi> pop with force above the <hi>Surface,</hi> and continue Moving up and down a little Space; then up there ſtarted ſomething like a Man, who ſhook his Head, rub'd clear his Eyes, and Swam directly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to the Place we ſate on, puſhing in the <hi>Basket</hi> juſt before him.</p>
            <p>THIS Second Figure really ſtartled us beyond the Firſt, and brought to our remembrance an <hi>Idea</hi> of the <hi>Sea God Neptune,</hi> for we hardly cou'd believe him <hi>Mortal,</hi> who had riſen from the Water, by whoſe ſide we had been ſitting nigh ten Minutes.</p>
            <p>THE Man, for ſuch he prov'd to be, no ſooner ſaw us, but he ſeem'd a little Shy of Landing, till we beckon'd him, and call'd as kindly as we could, and ſo perſwaded him to come aſhore, and bring the <hi>Basket</hi> with him.

            <p>THIS Place is famous for the Character it has of being the Seat, St. <hi>John</hi> made Choice of, while he Pen'd his <hi>Revelations</hi>; <note place="margin">A Monaſtery on a Hill.</note>and upon a Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in the <hi>Northern</hi> Parts, there ſtands a Monaſtery of the <hi>Graecian Coloie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro's,</hi> who profeſs that Saint their Patron, and pretend to ſhew ſome Reliques to inquiring Travellers.</p>
            <p>THE Notice, which I had hereof, oblig'd me to the hopes of ſeeing <hi>Patmos,</hi> and a Tempeſt was ſo favourable to my Wiſhes, that we anchor'd in a Haven not far diſtant from the Monaſtery; and the Opportunity invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting me a Shore, I landed with deſign to Walk and Viſit it.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>Northern</hi> ſide of <hi>Patmos</hi> is but very thinly Peopled, and as I was deſtitute thereby, of any means to get a <hi>Guide,</hi> ſo, either want of Curioſity, or Indiſpoſition by the roughneſs of the Storm, diſſwaded thoſe on board our Veſſel from conſenting to go with me.</p>

            <p>THE Hill was overgrown with a large Wood, thro' which appear'd no other Paſſage than a ſmall Foot Path, and that not beaten, but a very unfrequented way, which led me thro' an hundred ſeveral turnings to Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents extreamly ſteep, and intricate as Labyrinths.</p>

            <p>I advanc'd with equal Doubt and Curioſity, till, having gain'd the ſummit of the Precipice, I found it was a Cell, the Door of which ſtood half way open, and contain'd upon its ſmooth outſide, a piece of courſe, and half-loſt Painting, with the following <hi>Latin</hi> Sentence in a homely Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter.

THE ſoftneſs of this firſt Diſcovery invited me to make a Step beyond it, ſo that with a gentle Force I puſh'd the Door quite open, and was all amaz'd, when I perceiv'd the inſide of the Cell as ſtill as Poſſible; no Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament appear'd to ſet it off, but juſt againſt the Entrance burnt a Lamp, on either ſide a little Altar, and the weak and broken Light, which they afforded, faintly ſtriking thro' the dullneſs of the Place, <note place="margin">Finds a Man in a black Coffin.</note>diſcover'd in the midſt, a large black Coffin, fill'd with ſomething not to be diſtinguiſh'd, but as black, and diſmal in its firſt appearance, as the Coffin it was laid in.</p>
            <p>NOTHING (I then thought) cou'd add to my ſurprize, which yet was doubled, when there roſe, with a deliberate Silence from within the Coffin, ſomething like a Man, or rather Spirit, who no ſooner ſate up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, than looking on me with a frightful Aſpect, he pronounc'd theſe Words in a low Voice,

            <p>BY the Language of his Salutation I perceiv'd him an <hi>Italian,</hi> and the trembling of his Limbs perſwaded me to think, that the appearance of my Scymetar and Piſtols had as much ſurpriz'd him, as he had me.

            <p>THE old Man ſeem'd tranſported with the News, made ſhift to riſe, and led me to a Seat, hewn roughly from the Rock within the Cell; he laid his Hands upon my Head, pronounc'd a grave and honeſt Bleſſing, and proceeded modeſtly to take the liberty of asking ſome few Queſtions, which I willingly oblig'd him with as ready Anſwers to.</p>

               <hi>FIRST,</hi> for many Days before the Inundation happens, all the Skies are ſeen in <hi>Egypt,</hi> full of Black and Treatning Clouds, inceſſantly produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>rumbling Noiſes,</hi> and by <hi>Northern Tempeſts</hi> driven fiercely towards the <hi>Southern Parts,</hi> where always follows <hi>Rain</hi> in great abundance, frequently near Threeſcore Days together.</p>
            <p>ANOTHER reaſon for this laſt opinion is, the <hi>Muddy thickneſs of the Waters, when they overflow the Country,</hi> for, Ruſhing violently thro' ſo many Tracts of Fertil Land, they tear up great and hourly quantities of fatning ſoil, which, mixing thickly with the ſwelling ſtreams, is left upon the ſcorch'd and barren Sands of <hi>Egypt,</hi> of a very deep and <hi>ſlimy</hi> ſubſtance.</p>
            <p>MANY other reaſons are by the Inhabitants produc'd, to prove the Juſtice and Solidity of this accepted Modern Notion; but as tedious Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations, and unneceſſary Repetitions grow <hi>Prolix</hi> and <hi>Heavy</hi> on a Reader, I will ſay no more upon the Preſent Subject, than that all the <hi>Naturaliſts,</hi> reputed Famous in the <hi>Eaſtern Countries,</hi> agree among themſelves in full belief of this Aſſertion.</p>

               </note>THE <hi>High-Street</hi> is of a conſiderable Breadth, extending from the Gate <hi>Naufrei</hi> to that, they call <hi>Zueelia,</hi> the Firſt admitting you from the great Road, which leads to the <hi>Red Sea,</hi> the laſt directly fronting <hi>Nilus,</hi> and <hi>Bow-lac,</hi> the Ancient Town I lately ſpoke of.

            <p>THE Streets are all unpav'd and full of Sand, and many <hi>Lakes</hi> of half a Mile, or ſometimes more, in Compaſs, ſcatter'd every here and there about the City, which with certain Wells of no ſmall depth or Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, ſerve the People with the Water, fit to be employ'd in common uſes, ſuch as <hi>Waſhing Houſes, Cooling Streets,</hi> or ſuch like purpoſes; <note place="margin">Water brought on Camels Backs.</note>but as for what they Drink, 'tis brought on <hi>Camels Backs</hi> from <hi>Nilus,</hi> that above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam'd being neither Clear, nor Sweet enough for that nice purpoſe.</p>

            <p>SO that, if I may be allow'd to have gueſs'd right, in the <hi>Interpretation</hi> of theſe <hi>Hieroglyphic Figures,</hi> they'll be found to ſignify as much, as if in <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Characters,</hi> we ſhould ſet down the following Sentences.

            <p>

               </note>THE River <hi>Nilus,</hi> not above four Miles below <hi>Grand Cairo,</hi> is divided into two diſtinct and navigable <hi>Streams,</hi> one running <hi>Eaſtward,</hi> and the other towards the <hi>Weſt</hi>; the firſt emits his Waters into the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> not far diſtant from the <hi>Old Peluſium,</hi> now call'd <hi>Damiata</hi>; and the ſecond loſes his ſwift Channel in the ſame <hi>Sea,</hi> juſt below <hi>Roſetta.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THESE two abovenam'd <hi>Channels</hi> form, by their triangular Courſe, a very rich and ſpacious <hi>Iſland,</hi> even the fatteſt Soil, and moſt delightful Part of Fruitful <hi>Egypt,</hi> and it is this Portion of the Country, which, as I have ſaid before, was once diſtinguiſh'd by the Name of <hi>Delta.</hi>

            <p>
               <note place="margin">The Land of <hi>Goſhen.</hi>
               </note>THIS, Tho' many contradict the Notion, I imagine to have been in former Times, the <hi>Land of Goſhen,</hi> and am much confirm'd in my Opinion, by the <hi>Holy Scriptures</hi> undeniable Authority. As, <hi>for Example,</hi> in the tenth Verſe of the forty fifth Chapter of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> where <hi>Joſeph</hi> tells his <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
               <q>

            </p>
            <p>BY the Words <hi>near unto me,</hi> in this Verſe, it's evidently <hi>certain,</hi> that we cannot gueſs with greater probability, than in believing <hi>Delta</hi> to have been the Place, ſince 'tis the neareſt fruitful Spot of Ground to <hi>Memphis,</hi> (then the Reſidence of <hi>Joſeph,</hi>) in the whole <hi>Egyptian</hi> Country.</p>

                  <hi>Goſhen</hi> prov'd a fruitful Country.</note>AND, that the <hi>Land of Goſhen</hi> was not only <hi>near</hi> the <hi>Capital,</hi> but <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable</hi> in a thouſand other Bleſſings to the reſt of <hi>Egypt,</hi> we may be aſſur'd by the Authority, I juſt now quoted, and ſome other Places.</p>
            <p>IN the fourth, fifth, and ſixth Verſes of the ſeven and fortieth Chapter of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> we find the Sons of <hi>Jacob</hi> pleading for, and <hi>Pharaoh</hi> granting them the <hi>Land of Goſhen</hi> in the following Sentences.

Famine is ſore in the Land of Canaan: Now therefore we pray thee, let thy Sevants dwell in the Land of Goſhen.</p>

            <p>AGAIN, in the ſix and fortieth Chapter, <hi>Pharaoh</hi> ſpeaks to <hi>Joſeph</hi> in the following manner,
<q>
                  <p>And take your Father, and your Houſhold, and come unto me: And I will give you the good of the Land of Egypt, and ye ſhall eat the fat of the Land.</p>

            <head>CHAP. XLVII. Of the <hi>Red-Sea.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THE <hi>Red-Sea</hi> is ſo fully known already, by the <hi>Geographical</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions of our own Country Writers, and the exquiſite Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances of the <hi>Mathematic</hi> Authors of moſt <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Nations, that I mean not <hi>here</hi> to Touch on thoſe <hi>notorious</hi> Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which have <hi>long ago</hi> been made by others, but inform my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of ſome <hi>new Diſcoveries</hi> of little matters, which I made my ſelf.</p>
            <p>BUT firſt, it will be Requiſite to ſay a Word or two, relating to the <hi>Etymology</hi> and <hi>Ports</hi> of the <hi>Red-Sea,</hi> which having done, I will proceed to mention the Remarks, I made, as they occur to my Remembrance.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Why the <hi>Red-Sea</hi> is ſo call'd.</note>
               <hi>RHYTHRA,</hi> in the <hi>old Egyptian Language,</hi> ſignifying <hi>Red,</hi> was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly the Name of a <hi>great Monarch</hi> of that Country, who gave the <hi>Sea</hi> his own <hi>Denomination,</hi> which has been ſince miſtaken, by affinity of Sound, and <hi>Miſ-interpreted</hi> the <hi>Red-Sea,</hi> by thoſe, who fix'd the Name upon it, which it bears at preſent.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">A Second O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion.</note>OTHERS think, eſpecially the <hi>Jews,</hi> Inhabiting the <hi>Eaſtern Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,</hi> that it was call'd the <hi>Red-Sea,</hi> from the prodigious ruin, and great overthrow of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Army, in their Paſſage over it, in the <hi>purſuit</hi> of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and his <hi>God-defended Iſraelites,</hi> but as the Blood, there Spilt, was very little, tho' ſuch <hi>Multitudes</hi> were Drown'd, I look upon this gueſs, as an Improbable Opinion.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">A Third, and the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable.</note>ANOTHER Notion, and perhaps the trueſt of the Three, is, that 'tis call'd the <hi>Red-Sea,</hi> from the <hi>Redneſs</hi> of the <hi>Sands,</hi> o'erſpreading all the Bottom, whence the Waves receive a kind of <hi>red Reflection,</hi> and the <hi>Water</hi> thence appears, as if 'twere ſtain'd with certain <hi>Juices,</hi> of a <hi>rediſh Colour</hi>; This is made more Reaſonable from the Etymology of the <hi>Euxine,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly call'd the <hi>Black-Sea,</hi> from the <hi>Blackneſs</hi> of the <hi>Sands,</hi> which lie at the Bottom.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>Sea Port Towns</hi> are very numerous, and very different from each other, in <hi>Magnificence,</hi> or the <hi>conventency</hi> of <hi>Harbour,</hi> ſome are much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to dangerous ſhelves, and Rocky Shallows, others both commodious, large, and ſtately, <note place="margin">Aden, <hi>the great</hi> Sea-Port Town.</note>but the only Place, deſerving a particular Deſcription, is the Port, call'd <hi>Aden,</hi> in Poſſeſſion of the <hi>Turks,</hi> and not alone the Largeſt. but the Richeſt, and moſt celebrated <hi>Sea Port Town</hi> of all <hi>Arabia.</hi>

            <p>ANOTHER Reaſon, they produce, as a Perſuaſive to their <hi>Notion,</hi> is, that, when the <hi>Spaniards</hi> Conquer'd <hi>Mexico, Peru,</hi> and all thoſe Parts of the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> they perceiv'd their <hi>Cuſtoms,</hi> as to <hi>Women, Altars, Jubilees, Divorces,</hi> and the Knowledge, they profeſs'd of the <hi>Creation of the World,</hi> and <hi>

               <note place="margin">Its Reaſons.</note>THAT <hi>God</hi> cou'd point them out with eaſe a Paſſage to <hi>America,</hi> from the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Parts of <hi>Aſia,</hi> and that, ſince they were Ordain'd to be remov'd to an <hi>
