            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. I.</hi> An Account of him from his Childhood, to the Seventeenth Year of his Age.</head>
               <p>MR. <hi>John Janeway</hi> was born in the Year 1633. <hi>October</hi> 27. of religious Parents, in <hi>Tylly</hi> in the County of <hi>Hertford.</hi> He ſoon gave his Parents the Hope of much Comfort, and the Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of ſomething more than ordinary quickly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in him, ſo that ſome who ſaw this <hi>Child,</hi> much feared that his Life would be but <hi>ſhort;</hi> others hoped that God had ſome Work to do by or for him; he ſhewed that neither of them were miſtaken in their Conjectures concerning him. He ſoon out-ran his Superiours for Age, in <hi>Learning.</hi> And it was thought by no incompetent Judges, that for Pregnancy of <hi>Wit,</hi> Solidity of <hi>Judgment,</hi> the Vaſtneſs of his <hi>Intellectuals,</hi> and the Greatneſs of his <hi>Memory,</hi> he had no <hi>Superiours,</hi> and few <hi>Equals,</hi> conſidering his Age and Education.</p>
               <p>He was initiated in the <hi>Latin</hi> Tongue by his <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;</hi> afterwards he was brought up in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s School in <hi>London,</hi> where he made a conſiderable Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency in <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> under the Care of Mr. <hi>Langley.</hi> When he was about eleven Years old he took a great Fancy to <hi>Arithmetick</hi> and the <hi>Hebrew Tongue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:0334001200:3"/>About this Time his Parents removing into a little Village called <hi>Aſpoden,</hi> had the Opportunity of hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their <hi>Son</hi> inſtructed by a learned Neighbour, who was pleaſed to count it a Diverſion, to read <hi>Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks</hi> to him, being then about twelve Years old; and he made ſuch Progreſs in thoſe Studies, that he read <hi>Oughtred</hi> with Underſtanding, before he was thirteen Years old. A Perſon of Quality, hearing of the admirable Proficiency of this Boy, ſent for him up to <hi>London,</hi> and kept him with him for ſome time, to read <hi>Mathematicks</hi> to him. That which made him the more to be admired was, That he did what he did with the greateſt Facility. He had no ſmall Skill in Muſick and other Concomitants of the Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks.</p>
               <p>In the Year 1646, he was choſen by Mr. <hi>Rous</hi> the Provoſt of <hi>Eaton</hi> College, one of the Foundation of that School. Where he gave no unſuitable Returns to the high Expectation that was conceived of him.</p>
               <p>After a little Continuance at <hi>Eaton</hi> he obtained Leave of his Maſter to go to <hi>Oxford,</hi> to perfect him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the Study of <hi>Mathematicks,</hi> where being with Dr. <hi>Ward,</hi> one of the Profeſſors of the Univerſity, he attained to a ſtrange Exactneſs in that Study, nothing being within the Reach of a <hi>Man</hi> but he would un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake and graſp. The Doctor looked upon him as one of the <hi>Wonders of his Age;</hi> loved him dearly, and could not for ſome time after his <hi>Death</hi> ſcarce men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion his Name without <hi>Tears.</hi> When he had ſpent about a Quarter of a Year with Dr. <hi>Ward</hi> at <hi>Oxford,</hi> he was commanded to return to <hi>Eaton,</hi> where he ſoon gave Proof of his Improvement of his Time while he was <hi>abſent,</hi> by calculating of the Eclipſes for many Years before hand; ſo that by this Time he had many <hi>Eyes</hi> upon him as the Glory of the School. Yet he did not diſcover the leaſt Affectation or Self-conceit, neither did any diſcernable Pride attend theſe Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies. So that every one took more Notice of his <hi>Parts</hi> than himſelf.</p>
               <p>At about ſeventeen Years old he was choſe to <hi>King's
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0334001200:4"/>
College</hi> in <hi>Cambridge;</hi> at which time the Electors did even contend for the Patronage of this <hi>Scholar.</hi> He was choſen firſt that Year, and an elder Brother of his in the ſixth Place; but he was very willing to change Places with his elder Brother, letting him have the firſt, and thankfully accepting of the ſixth Place.</p>
               <p>Beſides his great Learning, and many other Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Nature, his Deportment was ſo ſweet and lovely, his Demeanour ſo courteous and obliging, many of them who had little Kindneſs for Morality, much leſs for Grace, could not but ſpeak well of him. His great Wiſdom and Learning did even command Reſpect: He had an excellent Power over his Paſſions, and was in a great Meaſure free from the Vice, which uſually attends ſuch an Age and Place.</p>
               <p>But all this while he underſtood little of the Worth of Chriſt, and his own Soul; he ſtudied indeed the Heavens, and knew the Motion of the Sun, Moon, and Stars, but he thought little of God, who made theſe Things; or of his own Heart; he did not as yet much buſy himſelf in the ſerious Obſervation of the wandering of his Spirit; the Creature had not yet led him to the Creator; he was ſtill too ready to take up with mere Speculation; but God, when he was about eighteen Years old, ſhone in upon his Soul with Power; and convinced him what a poor Thing it was to know ſo much of the Heavens and never come there. And that the greateſt Knowledge in the World without Chriſt, was but an empty dry Buſineſs. He now thought Mr. <hi>Bolton</hi> had ſome Reaſons on his Side, when he ſaid, <hi>Give me the moſt magnificent glorious Worlding, that ever trod upon earthly Mould, richly crowned with all the Ornaments and Excellencies of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Art, Policy, Preferment, or what Heart can wiſh beſides; yet without the Life of Grace, to animate and enable them, he were to the Eye of heavenly Wiſdom but as a rotten Carcaſs, ſtuck over with Flowers, magnified Dung, guilded Rottenneſs, golden Damnation.</hi> He began now to be of <hi>Anaxagoras</hi>'s Mind, That his Work upon Earth, was to ſtudy Heaven and get thither,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0334001200:5"/>
and that except a Man might be admitted to greater Preferment than this World can beſtow, it was not worth the while to be born.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> Of his Converſion and Carriage when Fellow of the College</head>
               <p>THE great Work of <hi>Converſion,</hi> was not carried on upon his Soul, in that dreadful Manner, that it is upon ſome, but the Lord was pleaſed, ſweetly to unlock his Heart, by the exemplary Life, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Diſcourſe of a young Man in the College, whoſe Heart God had enflamed with Love to his Soul; he quickly made an Attempt upon this y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ung Man, and the Spirit of God ſet home his Counſels with ſuch Power, that they proved effectual, for his awakening; being accompanied with the preaching of Dr. <hi>Hill,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Arrowſmith,</hi> together with the reading of Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s Saint's Everlaſting Reſt.</p>
               <p>Now a mighty Alteration might eaſily be diſcerned in him. He began not to taſte ſo much Sweetneſs in thoſe Kind of Studies, which he ſo greedily imploy'd himſelf in formerly. He began to pity them who were curious in their Enquiries after every thing, but that which is moſt needful to be known, <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>themſelves;</hi> and that which ſometimes was his Gain, he now counted Loſs for <hi>Chriſt,</hi> yea doubtleſs he eſteemed all Things but as Dung and Droſs in Compariſon of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and deſired to know nothing but <hi>Chriſt</hi> and him <hi>crucified.</hi> Not that he looked upon human Learning as uſeleſs: But when fixed below Chriſt and not improved for Chriſt; he looked upon Wiſdom as Folly, and Learning as Madneſs, and that which would make one more like the Devil, and more fit for his Service.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Janeway</hi> now conſidered how he might beſt improve what he did already know, and turn all his
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0334001200:6"/>
Studies into the right Channel: Grace did not take him off from, but made him more diligent and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual in his Study. And now Chriſt was at the End and Bottom of every thing: How did he plot and contrive how he might moſt expreſs his Love and Thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to him who had brought him out of Darkneſs into his marvellous Light! To this End he ſent up and down Packets of divine Letters, in which, he did diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe ſo ſubſtantially and experimentally of the great Things of God, that it would not at all have unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſome grey Head to have owned what he wrote.</p>
               <p>He was not a little like young <hi>Elihu,</hi> in whoſe Words he uſed to excuſe his Freedom with Perſons of Years, whoſe Souls he dearly pitied. He ſaid, <hi>Days ſhould ſpeak, and Multitude of Years ſhould teach Wiſdom, but there is a Spirit in a Man, and the Inſpiration of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty giveth them Underſtanding; I am full of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the Spirit within me conſtraineth me: Behold my Belly is as Wine which hath no Vent, it is ready to burſt like new Bottles, I will ſpeak that I may be refreſhed.</hi> O then how ſweet was the Savour of his Graces! He could not but ſpeak the Things which he had ſeen and heard; and even invite all the World to taſte and ſee how good the Lord was.</p>
               <p>He began firſt with his Relations, begging and wooing of them to think of their immortal Souls, and to lay in ſpeedy Proviſions for a Death-bed and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. Oh! with what Compaſſion did he plead the Cauſe of Chriſt with their Souls! What pathetick Expreſſions did he uſe, what vehement Expoſtulations, how frequent, how particular in his Applications to them! O with what Gravity and Majeſty would he ſpeak of the Myſteries of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>Read what his Language was (when he was between <hi>eighteen</hi> and <hi>nineteen</hi> Years old) in a Letter to a Friend that had the Care of many Children.</p>

               <p>When he was about twenty Years old, he was made Fellow of the College, which did not a little advance thoſe noble Projects which he had for the promoting of the Intereſt of the <hi>Lord Chriſt.</hi> Then how ſweetly would he inſinuate into the young ones, deſiring to carry as many of them as poſſible he could along with him to Heaven: Many Attempts he made upon ſome of the ſame Houſe, that he might ſeaſon them with Grace, and animate, and encourage thoſe who were <hi>looking towards Heaven.</hi> And as for his own Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, never was there a more compaſſionate and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-hearted Brother.

               <p>Read what his Heart was, in the following Lines.</p>
               <q>Diſtance of Place cannot at all leſſen that natural Bond whereby we are conjoined in Blood, neither ought to leſſen that of Love. Nay, where true Love is, it cannot; for Love towards you I can on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſay this. That I feel it better than I can expreſs it: But Love felt and not expreſſed is little worth. I therefore deſire to make my Love manifeſt in the beſt Way I can. Let us look upon one another not as Brethren only, but as Members of the ſame Body whereof Chriſt is the Head. Let us therefore breath and hunger after Him, ſo that our cloſe Knot
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0334001200:8"/>
may meet in Chriſt: If we are in Chriſt and Chriſt in us, then we ſhall be one with one another. This I know, you cannot complain for want of Inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, God hath not been to us a dry Wilderneſs; you have had Line upon Line, and Precept upon Precept; he hath planted you by the Rivers of Water: It is the Lord alone indeed who maketh fruitful, but yet we are not to ſtand ſtill and do nothing. There is a Crown worth looking for; ſeek therefore, and that earneſtly. Oh! ſeek by continual Prayer, keep your Soul in a praying Frame, this is a great and neceſſary Duty; nay, a high and precious Privilege. If thou canſt ſay nothing, come and lay thyſelf in an humble Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner before the Lord. You may believe me, for I have experienced what I ſay. There is more Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in one Glimpſe of God's Love, than in all that the World can afford. Oh! do but try; Oh! taſte and ſee how good the Lord is. Get into a Corner and throw yourſelf down before the Lord, and beg of God to make you ſenſible of your loſt State by Nature, and of the Excellency and Neceſſity of Chriſt. Say, Lord give me a broken Heart, ſoften and melt me. Any thing in the World, ſo I may be but enabled to value Chriſt, and be perſwaded to accept of him, as he is tendered in the Goſpel. O that I may be delivered from the Wrath to come! Oh! a Bleſſing for me, even for me! And reſolve not to be content till the Lord have in ſome Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure anſwered you. Oh! my Bowels yearn towards you. Oh! that you did but know with what Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection I write now unto you, and what Prayers and Tears are mingled with theſe Lines! The Lord ſet theſe Things home, and give you an Heart to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply them to yourſelf; the Lord bleſs all the Means that you enjoy, for his Bleſſing is all in all. Give me leave to deal plainly, and to come yet a little cloſe to you, for I love your Soul ſo well, that I cannot bear the Thoughts of the Loſs of it. Know this, that except a Man be born again, he cannot
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0334001200:9"/>
enter into the Kingdom of Heaven: God's Favour is not to be recovered without it. This new Birth hath its Foundation laid in a Senſe of Sin and a godly Sorrow for it, and a Heart ſet againſt it; without this there can be no Salvation. Look well about you, and ſee into yourſelf, and thou wilt ſee that thou art at Hell's Mouth without this firſt Step, and nothing but free Grace and pure Mercy is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween you and the State of the Devils. The Lord deliver us from a ſecure careleſs Heart! Here you ſee a natural Man's Condition. How dareſt thou then lie down in Security. Oh! look about for your Soul's Sake. What ſhall I ſay, what ſhall I do to awaken your poor Soul! I ſay again, wthout Repentance there is no Remiſſion; and Repentance itſelf may loſe its Labour, if it be not in the right Manner. Tears and Groans, and Prayers will not do without Chriſt. Moſt when they are convinced of Sin, and are under Fears of Hell, reform ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and thus the Wound is healed, and by this Thouſands fall ſhort of Heaven. For if we be not brought off from ourſelves, and our Righteouſneſs as well as our Sins, we are never like to be ſaved. We muſt ſee an abſolute Need of a Chriſt, and give ourſelves up to him, and count all but Dung and Droſs in compariſon of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs. Look therefore for Mercy only in Chriſt, for his Sake rely upon God's Mercy. The Terms of the Goſpel are, Repent and Believe; gracious Terms! Mercy for fetching, nay, Mercy for deſiring, nay, for no-nothing but receiving. Doſt thou deſire Mercy and Grace? I know thou doſt. Even this is the Gift of God to deſire, hunger after Chriſt; let Deſires put you upon Endeavours, the Work itſelf is ſweet; yea, Repentance and Mourning itſelf hath more Sweetneſs in it, than all the World's Comforts. Upon Repentance and Believing comes Juſtification. After this Sanctification, by the Spirit dwelling in us. By this we come to be the Children of God, to be made Partaker of the Divine Nature, to lead new

Lives, to have a Suitableneſs to God. It is unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy a Chriſtian to have ſuch a narrow Spirit as not to act for Chriſt with all one's Heart, and Soul, and Strength. Be not aſhamed of Chriſt, be not afraid of the Frowns and Scoffs of the Wicked. Be ſure to keep a Conſcience void of Offence, and by no means yield to any known Sin; be much in Prayer, and in ſecret Prayer, and in reading the Scriptures. Therein are laid up the glorious Myſteries which are hid from many Eyes. My greateſt Deſire is, that God would work his own great Work in you. I deſire to ſee you not as formerly, but that the Lord would make me an Inſtrument of your Soul's Good, for which I grealy long.</q>

                  <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> His great Love to Prayer.</head>
               <p>HE was mighty in Prayer, and his Spirit was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes ſo tranſported in it, that he forgot the Weakneſs of his own Body and of other Spirits: In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Acquaintance that he had with God was ſo ſweet, and his Converſe with him ſo frequent, that when he was engaged in Duty, he ſcarce knew how to leave that which was ſo delightful to his Spirit. His conſtant Courſe for ſome Years was this. He prayed at leaſt three times a Day in ſecret ſometimes ſeven times, twice a Day in the Family or College. And he found the Sweetneſs of it beyond Imagination, and enjoyed wonderful Communion with God. He could ſay by Experience, That the Ways of Wiſdom were Ways of Pleaſantneſs, and all her Paths Peace. He knew what it was to wreſtle with God, and he could ſcarce come off his Knees without his Father's Bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. He was uſed to converſe with God, with a <hi>holy Familiarity</hi> as a <hi>Friend,</hi> and would upon all Occaſions run to him for Advice, and had many ſtrange and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate <hi>Anſwers</hi> of Prayer. One of which I think it not impertinent to give an Account of.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:0334001200:11"/>His Honoured Father, Mr. <hi>William Janeway,</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of <hi>Kelſhall</hi> in <hi>Hartfordſhire,</hi> being ſick, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under ſomewhat dark Apprehenſions as to the State of his Soul, he would often ſay to his Son <hi>John:</hi> "Oh Son! this paſſing into Eternity is a great Thing, this Dying is a ſolemn Buſineſs, and enough to make one's Heart ake, that hath not his Pardon ſealed, and his Evidences for Heaven clear. And truly Son, I am under no ſmall Fears as to my own Eſtate for another World. Oh! that God would clear his Love! Oh! that I could ſay chearfully, I can die, and upon good Grounds be able to look Death in the Face, and ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture upon Eternity with well-grounded Peace and Comfort."</p>
               <p>Seeing his Father continuing under Deſpondings of Spirit (though no Chriſtians that knew him but had a high Eſteem of him for his Uprightneſs) he got by himſelf, and ſpent ſome time in wreſtling with God upon his Account, earneſtly begging of God that he would fill him with Joy unſpeakable in believing, and that he would ſpeedily give him ſome Token for Good, that he might joyfully and honourably leave this World. After he was riſen from his Knees, he came down to his Father, and aſked him, how he felt himſelf. His Father made no Anſwer for ſome time, but wept exceedingly, (a Paſſion that he was not ſubject to) and continued for ſome conſiderable time weeping, ſo that he was not able to ſpeak. But at laſt having recovered himſelf, with unſpeakably Joy he burſt out: "Oh! Son! now it is come, it is come, it is come; I bleſs God I can die; the Spirit of God hath wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed with my Spirit that I am his Child. Now I can look up to God as my dear Father, and Chriſt as my Redeemer; I can now ſay, this is my Friend, and this is my Beloved. My Heart is full, it is brim full, I can hold no more. I know now what that Sentence means, The Peace of God which paſſeth all Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; I know now what that white Stone is where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a new Name was written, which none know but they who have it. And that Fit of Weeping which
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0334001200:12"/>
you ſaw in me, was a Fit of overpowered Love and Joy, ſo great that I could not contain myſelf: Neither can I expreſs what glorious Diſcoveries God had made of himſelf unto me. And had that Joy been greater, I queſtion whether I could have born it, and whether it would not have ſeparated Soul and Body. Bleſs the Lord O my Soul, and all that is within me bleſs his holy Name, that hath pardoned all my Sins and ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Pardon. He hath healed my Wounds, and cauſed the Bones which he had broken to rejoice. Oh! help me to bleſs the Lord, he hath put a new Song into my Mouth: Oh! bleſs the Lord for his infinite Goodneſs! Oh! now I can die! It is nothing, I bleſs God I can die. I deſire to be diſſolved and to be with Chriſt." You may well think that his Son's Heart was not a little refreſh'd to hear ſuch Words, and ſee ſuch a Sight, and to meet the Meſſenger that he had ſent to Heaven returned back again ſo ſpeedily. It was ſo immediate and clear an Anſwer of his own Prayers, as if God had ſaid unto him, Thy Tears and Prayers are heard for thy Father: Thou haſt like a Prince prevailed with God; thou haſt God the Bleſſing: Go down and ſee.</p>
               <p>Upon this, the young Man too broke forth into Praiſes, and even into an Extaſy of Joy, that God ſhould deal ſo familiarly with him; and the Father and Son together were ſo full of Joy, Light, Life, Love and Praiſe, that there was a little Heaven in the Place. He could not then but expreſs himſelf in this Manner. "Oh bleſſed, for ever bleſſed be God for his infinite Grace! Oh who would not pray unto God! Verily he is a God that heareth Prayers, and that my Soul knows right well." And then he told his joyful Father, how much he was affected with his former Deſpondings, and what he had been praying for juſt before with all the Earneſtneſs he could. His Father hearing this, and perceiving that his former Comforts came by Prayer, and his own Child's Prayer too, was the more refreſhed, and the more confirmed, that it was from the Spirit of God, and no Deluſion. And
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0334001200:13"/>
immediately, his Son ſtanding by, he fell into another Fit of triumphing Joy, his weak Body being almoſt ready to ſink under that great Weight of Glory that ſhone in ſo powerfully upon his Soul. He could then ſay, "Now let thy Servant depart in Peace; for my Eyes have ſeen thy Salvation." He could now walk through the Valley of the Shadow of Death and fear no Evil. Oh! how ſweet a thing is it to have one's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in Chriſt cleared, how comfortable to have our Calling and Election made ſure! How lovely is the Sight of a ſmiling Jeſus when one is dying! how re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing is it, when Heart and Fleſh and all are failing, to have God for the Strength of our Heart and our Portion for ever! Oh! did the fooliſh unexperienced World but know what theſe Things mean, did they but underſtand what it is to have their Senſes ſpiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exerciſed, could they but taſte and ſee how good the Lord is, it would ſoon cauſe them to diſreliſh their low and brutiſh Pleaſures, and look upon all worldly Joys as infinitely ſhort of one <hi>Glimpſe of God's Love!</hi> After this, his <hi>Father</hi> had a ſweet Calm upon his Spirits, and went in the Strength of that Proviſion, 'till he came within the Gates of the <hi>New Jeruſalem:</hi> Having all his Graces greatly improved, and ſhewed ſo much Humility, Love of God, Contempt of the World, ſuch prizing of Chriſt, ſuch Patience as few Chriſtians ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive to; eſpecially his Faith, by which with extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Confidence he caſt his <hi>Widow</hi> and <hi>eleven fatherleſs Children</hi> upon the Care of that God who had fed him with this <hi>Manna</hi> in his <hi>Wilderneſs-ſtate.</hi> The Benefit of which <hi>Faith</hi> all his Children (none of which were in his Life-time provided for) have ſince experienced. And it is ſcarce to be imagined, how helpful this his Son was to his Father by his heavenly Diſcourſe, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Advice, and Prayers. After four Months Conflict with a Conſumption, he ſweetly ſlept in Jeſus.</p>
               <p>After the Death of his Father, he did what he could to ſupply his Abſence, doing the Part of a Huſband, Son, and Brother: So that he was no ſmall Comfort to his poor Mother in her diſconſolate State, and all
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0334001200:14"/>
the reſt of his Relations, that had any Senſe of God upon their Spirits. To one of which he thus addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth himſelf, upon the Death of a ſweet Child.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>He that in Afflictions would find Comfort, muſt ſtrive to ſee ſpiritual Comforts to be the greateſt, even that Comfort which is from God, in the Face of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt; this, this will be a Cordial; this will be as Marrow and Fatneſs to the Soul. They who have an Intereſt in Chriſt, what need they be moved with any worldly Trouble: Is not Chriſt better than ten Children? Is not his loving Kindneſs better than Life? Is not all the World a Shadow compared with one Hour's Enjoyment of him, even on this Side of Glory. O therefore ſtrive to get your Intereſt in this Comfort ſecured, and then all's well. He that hath Chriſt hath all things. If God be reconciled to you through him, then he will with-hold no good Thing from you.</p>
                  <p>We poor fooliſh Creatures do ſcarce know what is good for ourſelves, but it's no ſmall Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the People of God, that Wiſdom itſelf takes Care of them, and one who loves them better than they love themſelves <hi>looks after them; and he hath given his Promiſe for it,</hi> that all ſhall work together for their Good. And what better Foundation of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort can there be in the whole World than this?</p>
               </q>
               <p>Let this ſerve as a Remedy againſt exceſſive Grief. Get your Love to God increaſed, which if you do, the Love of all other Things will wax cold. And if you have given God your Heart, you will give him Leave to take what he will that is yours, and what he hath you will judge rather well kept than loſt.</p>
               <p>Remember that Scripture, and let it have its due Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion upon your Spirit; <hi>He that loves Father or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Brother or Siſter, yea, or Children more than me, is not worthy of me.</hi> O labour to have your Affections therefore more raiſed up to him who is moſt worthy of them, let him have the uppermoſt Room in your Heart, and let your Love to all other Things be placed in Subjection to your Love of God, be ruled by it, and directed to it.</p>

               <p>WHEN his Father was dead he returned again to <hi>King's-College,</hi> and was a Member of a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Society, which began to plot how they might beſt improve their Gifts and Graces ſo as to be ſerviceable to God and their Generations. Their Cuſtom was frequently to meet together; to pray and to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate <hi>Studies</hi> and <hi>Experiences.</hi> Some of this Company did degenerate, but others lived to let the World un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that what they did was from a <hi>vital Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:</hi> Amongſt whom, this young Man was none of the <hi>leaſt.</hi> One of their Deſigns was to engage the <hi>Juni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors,</hi> if poſſible, before they were enſnared by wicked Company, when they came freſh from <hi>School.</hi> After ſome time, moſt of his dear Companions were <hi>tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted</hi> either into Gentlemens Families or Livings, and Mr. <hi>Janeway,</hi> being one of the youngeſt, was, for a while, left alone in the <hi>College.</hi> But he wanting the comfortable Diverſion of ſuitable Society, fixed ſo intenſely upon his Studies, that he ſoon gave ſuch a Wound to his bodily Conſtitution, as could never be throughly healed.</p>
               <p>Thus you have a Taſte of his Spirit, and may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive what it was that he had his Heart ſet upon, what kept his Graces in ſuch Vigour and Activity, and how deſirous he was that others ſhould be Sharers with him in this Mercy: Yet, for all this, he had his gloomy Days, and the Sun was ſometimes over-caſt, his Sweets were ſometimes imbittered with dreadful and horrid Temptations. The Devil ſhot his poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonous Arrows at him; yet through the Captain of his Salvation, he came more than a Conqueror out of the Field. He was with <hi>Paul,</hi> many times <hi>lifted up into the third Heavens, and ſaw and heard Things unutterable:
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0334001200:16"/>
But leſt he ſhould be exalted above Meaſure, there was a Meſſenger of Satan ſent to buffet him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It would make a Chriſtian's Heart even ake to hear what ſtrange Temptations he was exerciſed with. But he was well armed for ſuch a Conflict, having on the Shield of Faith, whereby he quenched the fiery Darts of that wicked One: Yet, this Fight coſt him the Sweating of his very Body for Agonies of Spirit; and Tears and ſtrong Cries to Heaven for freſh Help<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> As for himſelf he was wont to take an Arrow out of God's Quiver, and diſcharge it by Faith and Prayer, for the Diſcomfiture of his violent Enemy, who at laſt was fain to fly.</p>
               <p>Theſe Temptations and Conflicts with Satan, did not a little help him in his Dealing with one that was ſorely afflicted with the like Temptations. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I judge it may be of Uſe to ſuch, I inſert a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of his to one in the like Caſe.</p>

Thoſe that he hath faſt in his own Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, he leads on as ſoftly and quietly as he can; fearing leſt ſuch Diſturbance ſhould make them look about them, and ſo they ſhould awake, and ſee their Danger: But as for thoſe that have in ſome Meaſure eſcaped his Snares, he follows them hard, with all the Diſcouragements he can. Theſe Things

And you will aſk, How ſhall I get free from them? <hi>Firſt,</hi> See that you poſſeſs your Soul in Patience: And know this, that God hath an over-ruling Hand in all this: And wait upon him, for he can and will bring forth Good out of all this Evil. At preſent you ſee no Light: Yet, <hi>Truſt in the Lord, and ſtay yourſelf upon your God.</hi> Can Chriſt forget the Purchaſe of his own Blood? <hi>Can a Mother forget her ſuckling Child?</hi> Yet, <hi>God cannot forget his.</hi> God hath gracious Intents in all this, and his Bowels yearn towards you. Yea, our Saviour ſuffers with us, through his ardent Love by Sympathy, as well as he hath ſuffered for us. And you know he hath all Power in his Hand, who doth imploy this Power in a Way of Love towards his. This Power is made yours through the Prayer of Faith: But for your own Work, do this.</p>

               <p>His Love to Chriſt and Souls, made him very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous <hi>to ſpend, and be ſpent in the Work of the Miniſtry;</hi> accordingly he did comply with the firſt loud and clear Call to preach the everlaſting Goſpel; and tho' he was but two and twenty Years old, yet he came to that Work like one that underſtood what Kind of Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment Preaching was. He was a Workman that needed not to be aſhamed, that was throughly fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed for every good Word and Work; one that was able to anſwer Gainſayers, one in whom the <hi>Word of God dwelt richly;</hi> one full of the Spirit and Power, one that hated Sin with a perfect Hatred, and loved Holineſs with all his Soul; in whom Religion in its Beauty did ſhine; one that knew <hi>the Terrors of the Lord,</hi> and knew how to beſeech Sinners <hi>in Chriſt's Stead to be reconciled unto God:</hi> One that was <hi>a Son of Thunder,</hi> and <hi>a Son of Conſolation.</hi> In a Word, I may ſpeak that of him which <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of <hi>Timothy,</hi> that <hi>I knew none like minded, that did naturally care for Souls</hi> And had he lived to have preached often, Oh what Uſe might ſuch a Man have been of in his Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration: One, in whom Learning and Holineſs did as it were ſtrive which ſhould excell. He never preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed publickly but twice, and then he came to it, as if he had been uſed to that Work forty Years; deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Word of God with that Power and Majeſty,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0334001200:19"/>
with that Tenderneſs and Compaſſion, with what Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs and Freedom, that it made his Hearers amazed. He was lead into the Myſtery of the Goſpel, and he ſpoke nothing to others but what was the Language of his Heart, and the Fruit of great Experience, and which one might eaſily perceive had no ſmall Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion firſt upon his own Spirits.</p>
               <p>His <hi>firſt</hi> and <hi>laſt</hi> Sermons were upon Communion and intimate Converſe with God, out of <hi>Job</hi> xxii. 21. A Subject that few Chriſtians under Heaven were better able to manage than himſelf, and that ſcarce any could handle ſo feelingly as he: For he did for ſome conſiderable time maintain ſuch an intimate Familiarity with God, that he ſeemed to converſe with Him as one Friend doth converſe with another. This Text he made ſome Entrance into, whilſt he was here: But the perfecting of his Acquaintance with God was a Work fitter for another World.</p>
               <p>He was one that kept an exact Watch over his Thoughts, Words and Actions, and made a Review of all that paſſed him, at leaſt once a Day, in a ſolemn Manner. He kept a <hi>Diary,</hi> in which he did write down every Evening what the Frame of his Spirit had been all the Day long, eſpecially in every Duty. He took Notice what Profit he received in his ſpiritual Traffick; what Returns from that far Country; what Anſwers of Prayer, what Deadneſs and Flatneſs, and what obſervable Providences did preſent themſelves, and the Subſtance of what he had been doing; and any Wandrings of Thoughts, Inordinancy in any Paſſion; which, though the World could not diſcern, he could. It cannot be conceived by them which do not practiſe the ſame, to what a good Account this turn'd. This made him retain a grateful Remembrance of Mercy, and live in a conſtant adoring of Divine Goodneſs; this brought him to a very intimate Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with his own Heart; this kept his Spirit low, and fitted him for free Communications with God; this made him more lively and active; this helped him to walk humbly with God; this made him
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0334001200:20"/>
ſpeak more affectionately and experimentally to others of the Things of God. And in a Word, this left a ſweet Calm upon his Spirits, becauſe he every Night made even his Accounts; and if his Sheets ſhould prove his Winding-ſheet, it had been all one; for he could ſay, his Work was done; ſo that Death could not ſurprize him.</p>

               <p>FOR the latter Part of his Life, he lived like a Man that was quite weary of the World, and that looked upon himſelf as a Stranger here, and liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the conſtant Sight of a better. He plainly declared himſelf but a Pilgrim that looked for a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Country, a City that had Foundations, whoſe Builder and Maker was God. His Habit, his Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, his Deportment, all ſpoke him one of another World. His Meditations were ſo intenſe, long, and frequent, that they ripened him apace for Heaven, but ſomewhat weakened his Body. Few Chriſtians attain to ſuch a holy Contempt of the World, and to ſuch clear, joyful, conſtant Apprehenſions of the tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Glories of the unſeen World.</p>
               <p>He made it his whole Buſineſs to keep up ſenſible Communion with God, and to grow into an humble Familiarity with God, and to maintain it. And if by reaſon of Company, or any neceſſary Buſineſs, this was in any Meaſure interrupted, he would complain like one out of his Element, till his Spirit was recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into a delightful, unmixed, free Intercourſe with God. He was never ſo well ſatisfied, as when he was more immediately engaged in what brought him nearer to God; and by this he conſtantly enjoyed thoſe Comforts, which others rarely meet with. His Graces and Experiences toward his End grew to Aſtoniſhment. His Faith got up to a full Aſſurance; his Deſires into
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0334001200:21"/>
a kind of Enjoyment. He was oft brought into the Banquetting-houſe, and there Chriſt's Banner over him was Love; and he ſate down under his Shadow with great Delight, and his Fruit was pleaſant unto his Taſte. His Eyes beheld the King in his Beauty, and while he ſate at his Table, his Spikenard did ſend forth its pleaſant Smell: He had frequent Viſions of Glory, lay in the Boſom of his Maſter, and was ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a very beloved Diſciple, and highly favoured. His Lord oft call'd him up to the Mount to him, and let him ſee his excellent Glory. O the ſweet Fore-taſte that he had of thoſe Pleaſures that are at the right Hand of God! How oft was he feaſted with the Feaſt of fat Things, thoſe Wines on the Lees well refined; and ſometimes he was like a Giant refreſh'd with new Wine, rejoicing to run the Race that was ſet before him, whether of doing or of ſuffering. He was even ſick of Love, and he could ſay to the poor unexperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced World, <hi>O taſte and ſee!</hi> and to Chriſtians, <hi>Come and I will tell you what God hath done for my Soul.</hi> O what do Chriſtians mean that they do no more to get their Senſes ſpiritually exerciſed? O why do they not make Religion the very Buſineſs of their Lives? O why is the Soul, Chriſt and Glory thus deſpiſed? Is there nothing in Communion with God? Are all thoſe Comforts of Chriſtians, that follow hard after him worth Nothing? Is it not worth the while to make one's Calling and Election ſure? O why do Men and Women jeſt and dally in the great Matter of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity? Little do People think what they ſlight, when they are ſeldom and formal in ſecret Duties, and when they neglect the great Duty of <hi>Meditation,</hi> which I have through rich Mercy found ſo ſweet and refreſhing: O what do Chriſtians mean, that they keep at ſuch a Diſtance from a Chriſt? Did they but know the thouſandth Part of that Sweetneſs which is in him, they could not chooſe but follow him hard; they would run, and not be weary; and walk, and not be faint.</p>
               <p>He could ſenſibly and experimentally commend the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0334001200:22"/>
Ways of God to the poor unexperienced World, and ſay, <hi>his Ways are Pleaſantneſs;</hi> and juſtify Wiſdom, and ſay, <hi>her Paths were Peace.</hi> He could take off thoſe Aſperſions, which the Devil and the World caſt upon Godlineſs in the Power of it. Here is one that could challenge all the Atheiſts in the World to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute; here is one that could bring ſenſible Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations to prove a Deity, and the Reality and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies of Inviſibles; which theſe Fools and Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men make the Subject of their Scorn: Here is one that would not change Delights with the greateſt E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picures living, and vie Pleaſure with all the Senſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts of the World. Which of them all could in the Midſt of their Jollity ſay, <hi>This is the Pleaſure that ſhall laſt for ever?</hi> Which of them can ſay among their Cups, <hi>I can now look Death in the Face,</hi> and, <hi>this very Moment I can be content,</hi> yea glad, <hi>to leave theſe Delights, as knowing I ſhall enjoy better.</hi> And this he could do, when he fared deliciouſly in ſpiritual Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quets every Day: He could upon better Reaſon than he did, ſay, <hi>Soul, thou haſt Goods laid up for many Years:</hi> He knew full well, that what he did here en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy, was but a little to what he ſhould have ſhortly. <hi>In his Preſence there is Fulneſs of Joy; at his right Hand there are Pleaſures for evermore.</hi> Where is the <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhazzar</hi> that would not quake in the midſt of his Cups, whilſt he is quaffing the richeſt Wine, if he ſhould ſee a Hand upon the Wall writing bitter things againſt him, telling him, that this Night his Soul muſt be required of him, that now he muſt come away, and give an Account of all his ungodly Pleaſures, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the mighty God? Where is the Sinner that could be contented to hear the Lord roaring out of <hi>Zion,</hi> whilſt he is roaring in the Tavern? Which of them would be glad to hear the Trumpet ſound, and to hear that Voice, <hi>Ariſe ye Dead and come to Judgment?</hi> Which of them would rejoice to ſee the Mountains quake, the Elements melting with fervent Heat, and the Earth conſumed with Flames; and the Lord Chriſt whom they deſpiſed, coming in the Clouds with Millions of
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0334001200:23"/>
his Saints and Angels, to be avenged upon thoſe that knew not God, and obeyed not his Goſpel? Is not that a bleſſed State, when a Man can lift up his Head with Joy, when others tremble with Fear, and ſink with Sorrow! And this was the Condition of this holy young Man. In the midſt of all worldly Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts he longed for Death; and the Thoughts of the Day of Judgment made all his Enjoyments ſweeter. O, how did he long for the Coming of Chriſt! Whilſt ſome have been diſcourſing by him of that great and terrible Day of the Lord, he would ſmile, and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly expreſs his Delight in the Fore-thought of that approaching Hour.</p>
               <p>I remember once there was a great Talk, that one had foretold the <hi>Dooms-day</hi> ſhould be upon ſuch a Day: Although he blamed their daring Folly, that would pretend to know that which was hid from the Angels themſelves; yet granting their Suſpicion to be true, what then, ſaid he? What if the Day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were come, as it will moſt cerrainly come ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly? If I were ſure the Day of Judgment were to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin within an Hour, I ſhould be glad with all my Heart. If at this very inſtant I ſhould hear ſuch Thunderings, and ſee ſuch Lightnings, as <hi>Iſrael</hi> did at Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> I am perſuaded my very Heart would leap for Joy. Through infinite Mercy, the very Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation of that Day hath even raviſhed my Soul, and the Thought of the Certainty and Nearneſs of it is more refreſhing to me than the Comforts of the whole World. Surely nothing can more revive my Spirits than to behold the bleſſed Jeſus, the Joy, Life, and Beauty of my Soul. Would it not more rejoice me than <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s Waggons did old <hi>Jacob?</hi> I lately dreamed that the Day of Judgment was come. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought I heard terrible Cracks of Thunder, and ſaw dreadful Lightnings; the Foundations of the Earth did ſhake, and the Heavens were rolled together as a Garment; yea, all Things viſible were in a Flame; methought I ſaw the Graves opened, and the Earth and Sea giving up their Dead; methought I ſaw Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0334001200:24"/>
of Angels, and Chriſt coming in the Clouds: Methought I beheld the Ancient of Days ſitting upon his Throne, and all other Thrones caſt down. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought I beheld him whoſe Garments were white as Snow, and the Hair of his Head like pure Wool: His Throne was like the fiery Flame, and his Wheels as burning Fire; a fiery Stream iſſued and came forth from him; thouſands of ten thouſands miniſtred unto him; and ten thouſand times ten thouſand ſtood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him; and the Judgment was ſet, and the Books were opened. O with what an Extaſy of Joy was I ſurprized! Methought it was the moſt heart-raiſing Sight that ever my Eyes beheld: And then I cried out, <hi>I have waited for thy Salvation, O God;</hi> and ſo I mounted into the Air, to meet my Lord in the Clouds.</p>
               <p>This I record, only to ſhew, how far he was from being daunted at the Thoughts of Death or Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: And to let other Chriſtians know what is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable in this Life; and what Folly it is, for us to take up with ſo little, when our Lord is pleaſed to make ſuch noble Proviſions for us, and by wiſe and diligent Improvement of thoſe Means which God hath offered us, we may have an Entrance adminiſtred to us abundantly into the everlaſting Kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Oh how comfortable, how honourable, and how profitable is this State! Theſe are your Men that quit themſelves like Chriſtians. This is true Gallantry, noble Manhood, real Valour! This was the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Mr. <hi>Janeway</hi> for about three Years before he died. I will not deny but that he had ſome Clouds; but he uſually walked in a ſweet, even, humble Sere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Spirit; and though he daily queſtioned many Actions, yet did he not queſtion his State, but had his Heart fixed upon that Rock that neither Waves nor Winds could ſhake. His Senſes were ſtill ſo ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally exerciſed, as that he could look up to Heaven as his Country and Inheritance, and to God as his Father, and to Chriſt as his Redeemer; and (that which is ſcarce to be heard of) he counted it the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0334001200:25"/>
Act of Patience to be willing to live, and a very great Self-denial to be contented to be in this World, and to dwell in this Side a full and eternal Enjoyment of that royal glorious One whom his Soul was ſo much in love with.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. VI.</hi> His laſt Sickneſs, and Death.</head>
               <p>HIS Body is now ſhaken again, and he falls into a deep Conſumption; but, this Meſſenger of God did not in the leaſt damp him. Spitting of Blood was no ghaſtly thing to one that had his Eye upon the Blood of Jeſus; faint Sweats did not daunt him that had always ſuch revival Cordials at hand. It's mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Joy to him, that he was now in ſome Hopes of having his earneſt Deſires ſatisfied.</p>
               <p>After he had been a while ſick, a ſudden Dimneſs ſeized upon his Eyes: By and by his Sight quite failed; and there was ſuch a viſible Alteration in him, that he and others judged theſe things to be the Symptoms of Death approaching. But when he was thus taken, he was not in the leaſt ſurprized; but was lifted up with Joy to think what a Life he was going to, looking upon Death itſelf as one of his Father's Servants, and his Friends, that was ſent as a Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to conduct him ſafely to his glorious Palace.</p>
               <p>When he felt his Body ready to faint, he called to his Mother, and ſaid, <q>Dear Mother, I am dying, but I beſeech you be not troubled; for I am, through Mercy, quite above the Fears of Death; It's no great Matter, I have nothing troubles me but the Apprehenſions of your Grief. I am going to him whom I love above Life.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But it pleaſed the Lord to raiſe him again a little out of his fainting Fit, for his Maſter had yet more Work for him to do before he muſt receive his Wages. Although his outward Man decayed apace, yet he is
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0334001200:26"/>
renew'd in the inward Man Day by Day: His Graces were never more active, and his Experiences never greater. When one would have thought, he ſhould have been taken up with his Diſtemper, and that it had been enough for him to grapple with his Pains, he quite forgets his Weakneſs; and is ſo ſwallowed up of the Life to come, that he had ſcarce Leiſure to think of his Sickneſs.</p>
               <p>For ſeveral Weeks together, I never heard the leaſt Word that favoured with any Complaint or Wearineſs under the Hand of God, except his eager Deſire to be with Chriſt be counted Complaining, and his Haſte to be in Heaven, Impatience. Now was the time when one might have ſeen Heaven and the Glory of another World realized to Senſe. His Faith grew exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and his Life was proportionable, and his Joys were equal to both.</p>
               <p>O the rare Attainments! The high and divine Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions that dropped from his Mouth! I have not Words to expreſs what a ſtrange, triumphant, angelical Frame, he was in, for ſome conſiderable Time toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. It was a very Heaven upon Earth, to hear and ſee a Man admiring God at ſuch a rate. Thoſe that did not ſee, cannot well conceive, what a ſweet Frame he was in, for at leaſt ſix Weeks before he died. His Soul was almoſt always filled with thoſe Joys unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and full of Glory. How oft would he cry out, <hi>Oh that I could let you know what I now feel! Oh, that I could ſhew you what I ſee! Oh, that I could expreſs the thouſandth Part of that Sweetneſs that I now find in Chriſt! You would all think it then well worth the while to make it your Buſineſs to be religious.</hi> Oh my dear Friends, we little think what Chriſt is worth upon a Death-bed. I would not for a World, nay for Milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Worlds, be now without Chriſt and a Pardon. I would not for a World be to live any longer: The very Thoughts of a Poſſibility of Recovery, makes me tremble.</p>
               <p>When one came to viſit him, and told him, that he hoped it might pleaſe God to raiſe him again, and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0334001200:27"/>
that he had ſeen many a weaker Man reſtored to Health, and that lived many a good Year after: <hi>And do you think to pleaſe me</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>by ſuch Diſcourſe as this?</hi> No, Friend, you are much miſtaken in me, if you think that the Thoughts of Life, and Health, and the World, are pleaſing to me. The World hath quite loſt its Excellency in my Judgment. O how poor and contemptible a thing it is in all its Glory, compared with the Glory of that inviſible World which I now live in the Sight of! And as for Life, Chriſt is my Life, Health, and Strength; and I know, I ſhall have another kind of Life, when I leave this. I tell you it would incomparably more pleaſe me, if you ſhould ſay to me, [You are no Man of this World; you cannot poſſibly hold out long; before To-morrow you will be in Eternity] I tell you I do ſo long to be with Chriſt, that I could be contented to be cut in Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and to be put to the moſt exquiſite Torments, ſo I might but die, and be with Chriſt. Oh, how ſweet is Jeſus! <hi>Come Lord Jeſus, come quickly.</hi> Death do thy worſt! Death hath loſt its terribleneſs. Death, it is nothing. I ſay, Death is nothing (through Grace) to me. I can as eaſily die as ſhut my Eyes, to turn my Head and ſleep: <hi>I long to be with Chriſt; I long to die.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His Mother and Brethren ſtanding by him, he ſaid, <q>
                     <hi>Dear Mother,</hi> I beſeech you earneſtly as ever I deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any thing of you in my Life, that you would chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully give me up to Chriſt; do not hinder me, now I am going to Reſt and Glory. I am afraid of your Prayers, leſt they pull one way, and mine another.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And then turning to his Brethren, he ſpeak thus to them; <q>I charge you all, do not pray for my Life any more: you do me wrong, if you do. Oh that Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, the unſpeakable Glory that I behold. My Heart is full, my Heart is full. Chriſt ſmiles and I cannot chuſe but ſmile: Can you find in your Heart to ſtop me, who am now going to the compleat and eternal Enjoyment of Chriſt? Would you keep me from my Crown? The Arms of my bleſſed Saviour are open to embrace me; the Angels ſtand ready to
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0334001200:28"/>
carry my Soul into his Boſom. Oh, did you but ſee what I ſee, you would all cry out with me, how long, dear Lord; come Lord Jeſus, come quickly!</q> Oh, why are his Chariot-wheels ſo long a coming.</p>
               <p>And all this while he lay like a triumphing Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror, ſmiling and rejoicing in Spirit.</p>
               <p>There was never a Day towards his End but (as weak as he was) he did ſome ſpecial Piece of Service, for his great Maſter. Yea, almoſt every Hour did produce freſh Wonders.</p>
               <p>A judicious and holy Miniſter came often to viſit him, and diſcourſed with him of the Excellency of Chriſt, and the Glory of the inviſible World. <hi>Sir,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>I feel ſomething of it; my Heart is as full as it can hold in this lower State; I can hold no more here. Oh that I could let you know what I feel!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This holy Miniſter praying with him, his Soul was raviſhed with the abundant Incomes of Light, Life, and Love; ſo that he could ſcarce bear it, nor the Thoughts of ſtaying any longer in the World, but longed to be in ſuch a Condition, wherein he ſhould have yet more Grace, and more Comfort, and be better able to bear that Weight of Glory; ſome Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtations whereof did even almoſt ſink his we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>k Body, and had he not been ſuſtained by a great Power, his very Joys would have overwhelmed him; and whilſt he was in theſe Extaſies of Joy and Love, he was wont to cry out:</p>
               <p>'Who am I Lord, who am I, that thou ſhouldſt be mindful of me! Why me, Lord, why me? Oh, what ſhall I ſay unto thee, O thou Preſerver of Men? O why me, Lord, why me? If thou wilt look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch a poor Worm, who can hinder! Who would not love thee! Oh bleſſed Father! Oh how ſweet and gracious haſt thou been unto me!'</p>
               <p>And thus he went on, admiring and adoring of God, in a more high and heavenly Manner than I can cloath with Words. Suppoſe what you can on this ſide Heaven; and I am perſuaded you might have ſeen it in him. He was wonderfully taken with the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0334001200:29"/>
Goodneſs of God to him, in ſending that aged expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced Miniſter to help him in his laſt great Work upon Earth. <q>Who am I, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> that God ſhould ſend to me a Meſſenger one among a Thouſand.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Though he was towards his End, moſt commonly in a triumphant joyful Frame; yet ſometimes, even then, he had ſome ſmall Intermiſſions in which he would cry out, <hi>Hold out, Faith and Patience; yet a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle while and your Work is done.</hi> And when he found not his Heart wound up to the higheſt Pitch of Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, Admiration and Love, he would with great Sorrow bemoan himſelf, and cry out in this Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage:</p>
               <q>And what's the Matter now, Oh my Soul, what wilt thou? canſt thou thus unworthily ſlight this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable and aſtoniſhing Condeſcenſion of God to thee? Seems it a ſmall Matter that the great <hi>Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah</hi> ſhould deal thus familiarly with this Worm; and wilt thou paſs this over, as a common Mercy? What meaneſt thou, Oh my Soul, that thou doſt not conſtantly adore and praiſe this rare, ſtrong, and unſpeakable Love! Is it true, Oh my Soul? Doth God deal familiarly with Man? And are his humble, zealous, and conſtant Love, Praiſe, and Service too good for God? Why are not thou, Oh my Soul, ſwallowed up every Moment with this free unparallel'd everlaſting Love?</q>
               <p>And then he breaks out again into another trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant Extaſy of Praiſe and Joy; and expreſſed a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of that which was unexpreſſibly in ſome ſuch Words as theſe:</p>
               <q>Stand aſtoniſhed ye Heavens, and wonder O ye Angels, at this infinite Grace! Was ever any under Heaven more beholding to free Grace than I? Doth God uſe to do thus with his Creatures? Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire him for ever and ever, Oh ye redeemed ones! Oh thoſe Joys, the Taſte of which I have! The everlaſting Joys, which are at his right Hand for evermore! Eternity, Eternity itſelf is too ſhort to praiſe this God in. O bleſs the Lord with me,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0334001200:30"/>
come let us ſhort for Joy, and boaſt in the God of our Salvation. Oh, help me to praiſe the Lord, for his Mercy endureth for ever.</q>
               <p>One of his Brethren (that had formerly been wrought upon by his holy Exhortations and Example) praying with him, and ſeeing of him (as he apprehended) near his Diſſolution, deſired that the Lord would be pleaſed to continue thoſe aſtoniſhing Comforts to the laſt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his Breath, and that he might go from one Heaven to another, from Grace and Joy imperfect, to perfect Grace and Glory; and when his Work was done here, give him, if it were his Will, the moſt eaſy and triumphant Paſſage to Reſt.</p>
               <p>At the End of the Duty, he burſt out into a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Paſſion of Joy. (Sure that was Joy unſpeaka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and full of Glory!) Oh, what an <hi>Amen</hi> did he ſpeak, <hi>Amen, Amen, Amen, Hallelujah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It would have made any Chriſtian's Heart to leap, to have ſeen and heard what ſome ſaw and heard at that time; and I queſtion not, but that it would ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what affect them to hear and read it; though it be ſcarce poſſible to ſpeak the half of what was admirable in him: For, it being ſo much beyond Precedent, it did even aſtoniſh and amaze thoſe of us that were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him, that our Relation muſt fall hugely ſhort of what was real.</p>
               <p>I verily believe that it exceeds the higheſt Rhetorick, to ſet out to the Life, what this heavenly Creature did then deliver. I want Words to ſpeak, and ſo did he, for he ſaw Things unutterable: But yet, ſo much he ſpeak, as juſtly drew the Admiration of all that ſaw him. He talked as if he had been in the third Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and broke out in ſuch Words as theſe:</p>
               <q>
                  <p>Oh, He is come! He is come! Oh how ſweet! How glorious is the bleſſed Jeſus! How ſhall I do to ſpeak the thouſandth Part of his Praiſes! Oh for Words, to ſet out a little of that Excellency! But it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expreſſible! Oh how excellent, glorious and lovely is the precious Jeſus! He is ſweet, he is altogether lovely! And now I am ſick of Love, he hath ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhed

                  <p>Oh my Friends, ſtand by and wonder, come look upon a dying Man, and wonder; I cannot myſelf but ſtand and wonder! Was there ever a greater Kindneſs, was there ever ſenſibler Manifeſtations of rich Grace! Oh, why me Lord! why me! Sure this is akin to Heaven, and if I were never to enjoy any more than this, it were well worth all the Torments that Men and Devils could invent, to come through even a Hell to ſuch tranſcendent Joys as theſe. If this be dying, dying is ſweet: Let no true Chriſtians ever be afraid of dying. Oh Death is ſweet to me. This Bed is ſoft.

               </q>
               <p>About eight and forty Hours before his Death, his Eyes were dim, and his Sight much failed; his Jaws ſhook and trembled, and his Feet were cold, and all the Symptoms of Death were upon him, and his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream Parts were already almoſt dead and ſenſeleſs, and yet, even then, his Joys were (if poſſible) greater <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p>Every particular Perſon had a faithful affectionate Warning. And that good Miniſter, that was ſo much with him, uſed this as an Argument to perſwade him to be willing to live a little longer, and to be patient to tarry God's Leiſure; ſure God have ſomething for thee to do that is yet undone; ſome Word of Exhortation to ſome poor Soul, that you have forgot.</p>
               <p>The Truth of it is, he was filled with the Love of Chriſt, that he could ſcarce bear Abſence from him a Moment. He knew that he ſhould be capable of bearing greater Glory above, than he could here. It was the Judgment of ſome that were with him, that his Heart was not only habitually, but actually ſet on God all the Day long; and nothing of human Frailty appear'd, except it were his paſſionate Deſire to die, and difficult to bring himſelf to be willing to ſtay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Heaven.</p>
               <p>He was wont every Evening to take his Leave of his Friends, hoping not to ſee them till the Morning of the Reſurrection; and he deſired that they would make ſure of a comfortable Meeting at our Father's Houſe in that other World.</p>
               <p>One Paſſage I cannot omit, which was this, That when Miniſters or Chriſtians came to him, he would beg of them to ſpend all the Time that they had with him in Praiſe. <q>O help me to praiſe God, I have now nothing elſe to do from this Time to Eternity, but to praiſe and love God. I have what my Soul
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0334001200:33"/>
deſires upon Earth; I cannot tell what to pray for, but what I have graciouſly given.</q> The Wants that are capable of ſupplying in this World, are ſupplied. I want but one Thing, and that is, <hi>A ſpeedy Lift to Heaven.</hi> I expect no more here, I can't deſire more. I can't hear more. Oh praiſe, praiſe, praiſe that infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite boundleſs Love that hath, to a Wonder, looked upon my Soul. <q>Help me, O my Friends, to praiſe and admire him that hath done ſuch aſtoniſhing Wonders for my Soul; he hath pardoned all my Sins, he hath filled me with his Goodneſs, he hath given me Grace and Glory, and no good Thing hath he with-held from me.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Come, help me with Praiſes, all's too little: Come, help me, Oh ye glorious and mighty Angels, who are ſo well ſkill'd in this heavenly Work of Praiſe. Praiſe him, all ye Creatures upon the Earth, let every thing that hath Being, help me to praiſe him. Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah: Praiſe is now my Work, and I ſhall be engaged in that ſweet Employment for ever. Bring the Bible, turn to <hi>David's Pſalms,</hi> and let us ſing a <hi>Pſalm</hi> of Praiſe: Come let's lift up our Voice in the Praiſe of the moſt High; I will ſing with you as long as my Breath doth laſt, and when I have none, I ſhall do it better.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And then turning to ſome of his Friends that were weeping, he deſired them rather to rejoice than weep upon his Account. It may juſtly ſeem a Wonder, how he could ſpeak ſo much as he did when he was ſo weak; but the Joy of the Lord did ſtrengthen him.</p>
               <p>In his Sickneſs, the Scriptures that he took much Delight in, were the fourteenth, fifteenth, ſixteenth and ſeventeenth of <hi>John.</hi> The fifty fourth of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> was very refreſhing alſo to him; he would repeat that Word <hi>[with everlaſting Mercies will I gather]</hi> with A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of Joy.</p>
               <p>He commended the Study of the Promiſes to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, and deſired that they would be ſure to make good their Claim to them and then they might come to the Wells of Conſolation and drink thereof their Fill.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:0334001200:34"/>According to his Deſire moſt of the Time that was ſpent with him, was ſpent in Praiſe; and he would ſtill be calling out, <hi>More Praiſe ſtill.</hi> 
                  <q>O help me to praiſe him: I have now nothing elſe to do; I have done with Prayer and all other Ordinances; I have almoſt done converſing with Mortals. I ſhall preſently be beholding Chriſt himſelf, that died for me, and loved me, and waſhed me in his Blood.</q>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <p>I ſhall, before a few Hours are over, be in Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, ſinging the Song of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the Song of the <hi>Lamb.</hi> I ſhall preſently ſtand upon <hi>Mount Zion,</hi> with an innumerable Company of Angels, and the Spirits of the Juſt made perfect, and Jeſus the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator of the New Covenant. I ſhall hear the Voice of much People, and be one amongſt them, which ſhall ſay, Hallelujah, Salvation, Glory, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and Power unto the Lord our God; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain we ſhall ſay Hallelujah. And yet a very little while, and I ſhall ſing unto the <hi>Lamb,</hi> a Song of Praiſe, ſaying, Worthy art thou to receive Praiſe who wert ſlain, and haſt redeemed us to God by thy Blood, out of every Kindred, and Tongue, and People, and Nation, and haſt made us unto our God, Kings and Prieſts, and we ſhall reign with thee for ever and ever.</p>
                  <p>Methinks I ſtand, as it were, with one Foot in Heaven, and the other upon Earth; methinks I hear the Melody of Heaven, and by Faith I ſee the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels waiting to carry my Soul to the Boſom of Jeſus, and I ſhall be for ever with the Lord in Glory. And who can chooſe but rejoice in all this?</p>
               </q>
               <p>Several times he ſpeak in this Language, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated many of theſe Words often, over and over again, with far greater Affection than can be well worded. And I ſolemnly profeſs, that what is here written is no Hyperbole, and that the twentieth Part of what was obſervable in him, is not recorded; we cannot word it exactly as he did, yet you have the Subſtance, and many Things in his own Words, with little or no Variation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:0334001200:35"/>The Day before his Death, he looked ſomewhat earneſtly upon his Brother <hi>James,</hi> who ſtood by him very ſad; of whom he judged, that he was putting up ſome Ejaculations to God upon his Account: <hi>I thank thee, dear Brother, for thy Love,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>thou art now praying for me, and I know thou loveſt me dearly: But Chriſt loveth me ten thouſand times more than thou doſt: Come, and kiſs me, dear Brother, before I die:</hi> And ſo with his cold dying Lips, he kiſſed him, and ſaid, <hi>I ſhall go before, and I hope thou ſhalt follow after to Glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Though he was almoſt always praiſing God, and exhorting them that were about him to mind their ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Concerns, and ſecure an Intereſt in Chriſt; and though he ſlept but very little for ſome Nights, yet he was not in the leaſt impaired in his Intellectuals, but his Actions were all decent, and becoming a Man, and his Diſcourſe to a ſpiritual Underſtanding, highly rational, ſolid, divine. And ſo he continued to the laſt Minute of his Breath.</p>
               <p>A few Hours before his Death, he called all his Relations and Brethren together, that he might give them one ſolemn Warning more; and bleſs them, and pray for them, as his Breath and Strength would give him Leave: Which he did with abundance of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, Affection, and Spirituallity: Which take briefly as it follows.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> He thanked his dear Mother for her tender Love to him, and deſired that ſhe might be in Travel to ſee Chriſt formed in the Souls of the reſt of her Children, and ſee of the Travel of her Soul, and meet them with Joy in that great Day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then</hi> he charged all his Brethren and Siſters in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, as they would anſwer it before God, that they ſhould carry it dutiful to their dear Mother. And for his eldeſt Brother <hi>William,</hi> (at whoſe Houſe he lay ſick) his Prayer was, that he might be ſwallowed up of Chriſt, and Love to Souls; and be more and more exemplary in his Life, and ſucceſsful in his Miniſtry, and finiſh his Courſe with Joy.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:0334001200:36"/>His next Brother's Name was <hi>Andrew,</hi> a Citizen of <hi>London,</hi> who was with him, and ſaw him in his tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphing State; but (his neceſſary Buſineſs calling him away) he could not then be by; yet he was not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got, but he was thus bleſſed, <hi>The God of Heaven re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member my poor Brother at</hi> London: <hi>The Lord make him truly rich in giving him the Pearl of great Price, and make him a Fellow Citizen with the Saints, and of the Houſhold of God; the Lord deliver him from the Sins of that City; may the World be kept out of his Heart, and Chriſt dwell there. Oh that he may be as his Name is, a ſtrong Man, and that I may meet him with you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then</hi> he called his next Brother, whoſe Name was <hi>James</hi> (whom he hoped God had made him a ſpiritual Father to) to whom he thus addreſſed himſelf; <hi>Brother</hi> James, <hi>I hope the Lord hath given thee a goodly Heritage, the Lines are fallen to thee in pleaſant Places; the Lord is thy Portion. I hope the Lord hath ſhewed thee the Worth of Chriſt.</hi> Hold on, dear Brother; Chriſt, Heaven and Glory are worth ſtriving for; the Lord give thee more Abundance of his Grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then</hi> his next Brother <hi>Abraham</hi> was called, to whom he ſpeak to this Purpoſe, <hi>the Bleſſing of the God of</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham <hi>reſt upon thee, the Lord make thee a Father of many ſpiritual Children.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His <hi>fifth</hi> Brother was <hi>Joſeph,</hi> whom he bleſſed in this Manner: <hi>Let him bleſs thee, Oh</hi> Joſeph, <hi>that bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him that was ſeparated from his Brethren. O that his everlaſting Arms may take hold on thee! It is enough, if yet thou mayſt live in his Sight. My Heart hath been working towards thee, poor</hi> Joſeph; <hi>and I am not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Hopes, that the Arms of the Almighty will embrace thee. The God of thy Father bleſs the with the Bleſſing of Heaven above.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The next</hi> was his Siſter <hi>Mary,</hi> to whom he ſpoke thus, <hi>Poor Siſter</hi> Mary, <hi>thy Body is weak and thy Days will be filled with Bitterneſs; thy Name is</hi> Marah; <hi>the Lord ſweeten all with his Grace and Peace, and give thee Health in thy Soul. Be patient, make ſure of Chriſt, and all is well.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:0334001200:37"/>
                  <hi>Then</hi> his other Siſter, whoſe Name was <hi>Sarah,</hi> was called; whom he thus bleſſed, <hi>Siſter</hi> Sarah, <hi>thy Body is ſtrong and healthful; Oh that thy Soul may be ſo too! The Lord make thee firſt a wiſe Virgin, and then a Mother in</hi> Iſrael; <hi>a Pattern of Modeſty, Humility, and Holineſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then another Brother, <hi>Jacob</hi> was called, whom he bleſſed after this Manner; <hi>The Lord make thee an Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elite indeed, in whom there is no Guile! Oh that thou mayeſt learn to wreſtle with God, and like a Prince may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt prevail, and not goe without the Bleſſing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then he prayed for his youngeſt Brother <hi>Benjamin,</hi> who was then but an Infant; <hi>Poor little</hi> Benjamin, <hi>O that the Father of the Fatherleſs, would take Care of thee, poor Child, that thou which never ſaweſt thy Father upon Earth, mayſt ſee him with Joy in Heaven; The Lord be thy Father, and Portion; mayeſt thou prove the Son of thy Mother's right Hand, and the Joy of her Age.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>O that none of us all may be found amongſt the unconverted in the Day of Judgment! O that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of us may appear (with our honoured Father and dear Mother) before Chriſt with Joy, that they may ſay, Lord, here are we, and the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren which thou haſt given us. Oh that we may live to God here, and live with him hereafter.</q>
               <p>And now, my dear Mother, Brethren and Siſters, Farewell; I leave you for a while, and I commend you to God, and to the Word of his Grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an Inheritance among all them that are ſanctified.</p>
               <p>And now, dear Lord, my Work is done. I have finiſhed my Courſe, I have fought the good Fight, and henceforth there remaineth for me a Crown of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs! Now come dear Lord Jeſus, come quickly.</p>
               <p>Then the Miniſter came to give him his laſt Viſit, and to do the Office of an inferiour Angel, to help to convey his bleſſed Soul to Glory, who was now even upon <hi>Mount Piſgah,</hi> and had a full Sight of that goodly Land at a little Diſtance. When this Miniſter ſpake to him, his Heart was in a mighty Flame of Love, and Joy, which drew Fears of Joy from him,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0334001200:38"/>
being almoſt amazed to hear a Man juſt a dying, talk as if he had been with <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and came from the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Preſence of God; O the Smiles that were then in his Face, and the unſpeakable Joy that was in his Heart! one might have read <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Glory</hi> in his Countenance. Oh the Praiſe, the triumphant Praiſes, that he put up! And every one muſt ſpeak Praiſe about him, or elſe they made a Jar in his Harmony.</p>
               <p>And indeed moſt did, as well as they could, help him in Praiſe. So that I never heard, nor knew more Praiſe given to God in one Room, than in his Chamber.</p>
               <p>A little before he died, in the Prayer or rather Praiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, he was ſo wrapped up with Admiration and Joy, that he could ſcarce forbear ſhouting for Joy. In the Concluſion of the Duty, with Abundance of Faith and Fervency, he ſaid aloud, <hi>Amen, Amen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now his Deſires will ſoon be ſatisfied; Death comes apace to do his Office; his Jaws are looſened more and more, and quiver greatly; his Hands and Feet are as cold as Clay, and a cold Sweat is upon him: But, Oh how glad was he when he felt his Spirit juſt a going! Never was Death more welcome to any Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal I think. Though the Pangs of Death were ſtrong, yet that far more exceeding and eternal Weight of Glory, made him indure thoſe bitter Pains with much Patience and Courage. In the Extremity of his Pains, he deſired his eldeſt Brother to lay him a little lower, and to take away one Pillow from him, that he might die with the more Eaſe: His Brother replied, that he durſt not for a World, do any thing that might haſten his Death a Moment. Then he was well ſatisfied, and did ſweetly reſign himſelf up wholly to God's Diſpoſal; And after a few Minutes, with a ſudden Motion gathering up all his Strength, he gave himſelf a little Turn on one Side, and in the Twinkling of an Eye, departed to the Lord.</p>
               <p>And now bleſſed Soul, thy Longings are ſatisfied, and thou ſeeſt and feeleſt a thouſand Times more than thou didſt upon Earth, and yet thou canſt bear it with Delight, thou art now welcomed to thy Father's Houſe by Chriſt, the Beloved of thy Soul: Now thou

haſt heard him ſay, Come thou bleſſed of my Father; and, Well done, good and faithful Servant, enter thou into the Joy of thy Lord, and wear that Crown which was prepared for thee, before the Foundation of the World.</p>
               <p>Oh that all the Relations which thou haſt left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind thee, may live thy Life, and die thy Death, and live with Chriſt and thee, for ever and ever, <hi>Amen, Amen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He died</hi> June 1657, <hi>Aged</hi> 23-24, <hi>and was buried in</hi> Kel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhall <hi>Church, in</hi> Hartfordſhire.</p>
