            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE <hi>Stone</hi> in the Bladder is a Diſtemper, which, for ought we know to the contrary, is as ancient as any other to which the humane Body has ever been ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject: And <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> to whom we owe the firſt Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts of that, as well as of all the other Diſeaſes he has mention'd, informs us, that in his Time the Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of extracting the <hi>Stone</hi> by Cutting was already in Uſe; and that there were Men who made it their chief Buſineſs, without intermedling with any other Part of Phyſick or Surgery, which then, and for a great while afterwards, made up but one and the ſame Profeſſion. All this is evident from that Clauſe of <hi>Hippocrates</hi>'s Oath, in which he makes his Diſciples ſwear not to cut any Perſon for the <hi>Stone,</hi> but to leave that Operation to ſuch who exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed themſelves in that Art, and made a particular Profeſſion of it. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. And from theſe Words there may be ſome ground to think, that <hi>Hippocrates</hi> never practis'd this Operation himſelf.</p>
            <p>What was the Method of Cutting then us'd, we know not. Thus far however we may be ſure, that the Inciſion was not propoſed to be made in the Body of the Bladder; becauſe <hi>Hippocrates</hi> every where de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares it to be his Opinion, that Wounds there are mortal. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, ſays he, <hi>Aphor.</hi> 6, 18. and in his Book <hi>de Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis</hi> 3. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. The only further Conjecture that can with any Probability be formed is, that as <hi>Celſus</hi> is univerſally allowed to have borrowed his whole Syſtem, both of Phyſick and Surgery, from the <hi>Greeks,</hi> the Method of Cutting for the <hi>Stone</hi> which he has deſcribed,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0153200400:9"/>may likewiſe have been taken from them; and perhaps they knew no other but that. <hi>Ammonius,</hi> ſirnamed <hi>Lithotomus</hi> from the Inſtrument he invented to break the <hi>Stone</hi> in the Bladder, when it happen'd to be too large to paſs through the Wound entire, practis'd this Method at <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria,</hi> in the Time of <hi>Herophilus</hi> and <hi>Eraſiſtratus;</hi> that is, perhaps about 150 Years after <hi>Hippocrates;</hi> and <hi>Meges</hi> practis'd it at <hi>Rome</hi> in the Reign of <hi>Auguſtus.</hi> It is <hi>Celſus,</hi> who has preſerved us the Names of theſe two famous Lithotomiſts; and it is evident from what he ſays of them, that he believed their Method of Cutting to be the ſame with his. And as they lived at a great Diſtance, both of Time and Place, from one another; and the firſt of them ſo near the Age of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> it becomes from thence further probable, that the Operation for the <hi>Stone</hi> deſcrib'd by <hi>Celſus</hi> was the moſt ancient, and perhaps the only one that had ever been practis'd before his Time.</p>
            <p>Whatever Solidity may be in theſe Conjectures, for I give them only as ſuch, <hi>Celſus</hi> is undoubtedly the firſt Author now remaining, who has taught us any thing like a Method of Cutting; and the ſame, without any conſiderable Variation, is deſcrib'd by the later <hi>Greek</hi> Writers, particularly <hi>Paulus Aegineta;</hi> by the <hi>Arabians, Avicenna</hi> and <hi>Albucaſis;</hi> and, in general, by all Chirurgical Authors down to the Beginning of the Sixteenth Century, <hi>Rogerius, Rolan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus, Brunus, Theodoricus, Gulielmus de Saliceto, Lanfrancus, Mundinus, Guido,</hi> and others. Theſe Authors do little more than copy one another; and what is worth remarking about them is, that it does not appear that any of them ever ſaw this Operation perform'd, <hi>Guido</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone excepted; but even he does not ſeem ever to have cut himſelf.</p>
            <p>During all this long Interval, no other Method but this being known, we are not to imagine that it went by any other Name than that of Cutting for the <hi>Stone,</hi> or Operation of <hi>Lithotomy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But when <hi>Johannes de Romanis</hi> had invented his New Method of Cutting, which happen'd ſome Time near the Year 1500, at leaſt in all probability nearer that than 1520, as is ſaid by <hi>Gourmelenus,</hi> and the generality of Writers ſince his Time; it then became neceſſary that Names ſhould be appropriated to theſe two Methods, by which they might be diſtinguiſhed from one another.</p>
            <pb n="3" facs="tcp:0153200400:10"/>
            <p>The principal Difference between them conſiſts in the Inſtruments uſed, and in the Manner of uſing them; and therefore it was natural that the Names apply'd to them ſhould be taken from thence. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly we find that <hi>De Franco</hi> calls <hi>Marianus</hi>'s Operation, <hi>La Cure de la Pierre avec gros ferrement;</hi> and from thence undoubtedly came the Appellations of <hi>Major</hi> and <hi>Minor Apparatus,</hi> by which theſe two Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations have ſince been moſt commonly expreſſed; firſt uſed, as far as I can find, by <hi>Paraeus</hi> and <hi>Gourmelenus,</hi> as well as the <hi>French</hi> Names which anſwer to them, <hi>Le haut &amp; le petit Appareil.</hi> The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Names of Cutting upon the <hi>Staff,</hi> and Cutting upon the <hi>Gripe,</hi> are of a much later Date. We probably borrowed them from the <hi>Dutch,</hi> in which Language theſe two ways of Cutting are expreſs'd by Terms analogous to them; and perhaps they came to be taken into the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Language, by being uſed by Lithomiſts whom we have had oftener than once from <hi>Holland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Second of theſe Methods, the <hi>Apparatus Major,</hi> was, as I have ſaid, invented by <hi>Johannes de Romanis,</hi> and practis'd by him at <hi>Rome;</hi> but it was firſt publiſhed there by his Scholar <hi>Marianus Sanctus Barolita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> in the Year 1522, not at <hi>Venice</hi> in 1535, as ſome have ſaid. And it is upon this Account, that Authors who do not ſo much attend to Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverers, as to the Publiſhers of Diſcoveries, have given it the Name of <hi>Methodus Mariana</hi> or <hi>Mariniana.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Operation being ſuited to Perſons of all Ages, whereas that of <hi>Celſus</hi> was formerly thought practicable only upon Children, ſoon gain'd a general Vogue, and brought Lithotomy much more in Faſhion than it had been for many Ages before. <hi>Celſus</hi>'s Method, however, was not quite laid aſide, but continued to be practiſed; and perhaps even more frequently than it had ever been ſince <hi>Aegineta</hi>'s Days; with this Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage alſo, that the Succeſs of the other Method being experienced in full grown Perſons as well as Children, encouraged Lithotomiſts to break through the narrow Limits of Time fixed by the Ancients, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the Uſe of <hi>Celſus</hi>'s Method much further than <hi>Celſus</hi> himſelf had preſcribed.</p>
            <p>From this Time downwards, the Practice of Lithotomy becoming ſtill more common, a great many Improvements were made in both Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods, eſpecially in that of <hi>Marianus;</hi> and other Varieties introduced
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0153200400:11"/>in them, as beſt ſuited the Genius of particular Operators, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Patients, or the Humour of the Times; and in all theſe the <hi>Pariſian</hi> Lithotomiſts muſt be allowed to have had the principal Hand.</p>
            <p>In the Year 1561, <hi>De Franco</hi>'s Treatiſe of <hi>Hernia</hi>'s, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> was firſt pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, and in that he gives an Account of a new Method he once made uſe of in order to extract a <hi>Stone,</hi> all the others proving ineffectual, and that was by making an Inciſion above the <hi>Os Pubis.</hi> Tho' the Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſucceeded, yet he thinks fit to diſſwade all Perſons from ever fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing his Example; and indeed his Advice was ſo far comply'd with, that for above Twenty Years after his Book appeared, Authors are as entirely ſilent about this extraordinary Operation, as if it had never been known; and in all Probability would have continued ſo much longer, had not a lucky Chance engaged a Perſon of <hi>Roſſetus</hi>'s Learning and Sagacity, to undertake the introducing of the <hi>Caeſarean</hi> Operation: For, in order to recommend this unheard-of and dangerous Practice, one Method this great Man thought it for his Purpoſe to take, was to compare it with ſome others then in Uſe; and, amongſt the reſt, with the common ways of Cutting for the <hi>Stone.</hi> This led him to ſo clear and terrifying a View of the Cruelty and Barbarity of both of them, that a Perſon of his Talent for Invention needed no more to put him upon the Search of a New one; and the Pains he had been at to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Nature and Conſequences of Wounds in the <hi>Abdomen,</hi> was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly what gave him the firſt Hint of that which he invented. <hi>De Franco</hi> muſt indeed be own'd to have publiſhed an Inſtance of this Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration before <hi>Roſſetus</hi> endeavoured to introduce it: But <hi>Roſſetus</hi> is not for that Reaſon to be denied the Glory of having invented it; for, to ſay nothing of the Circumſtances of <hi>De Franco</hi>'s Story, which every body is now ſufficiently acquainted with, <hi>Roſſetus</hi> was led to the Theory he eſtabliſhed by the meer Force of his own Judgment, his Knowledge of the Structure of the Parts concerned, in which he exceeded all that went before him, <hi>Veſalius</hi> himſelf not excepted, and Conſequences drawn from Facts, among which that mention'd by <hi>Franco</hi> appears to have no Place, <hi>Roſſetus</hi> having diſcover'd his Method before ever he had ſeen that Author's Book, as he affirms himſelf, and in a manner that gives not the leaſt ground to ſuſpect him of a Falſhood.</p>
            <p>But if it ſhould be granted that he took the firſt Hint of his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod from <hi>Franco,</hi> be muſt ſtill be allowed by all who have read and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0153200400:12"/>underſtand his Book, to deſerve a greater ſhare of Praiſe as an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prover, than the other can claim as an Inventer: And I believe it will be found upon a ſtrict Examination, that the Honour of many Diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries which we now enjoy, is given to Perſons who had no better Title to them than he has to this, even ſuppoſing he had borrowed from <hi>De Franco</hi> all that he could poſſibly borrow from him. He muſt be very little acquainted with the Hiſtory of Inventers, who does not know that many of their Inventions are owing to more favourable Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents, than reading <hi>De Franco</hi>'s Book can have been to <hi>Roſſetus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Tho' this great Author lived to publiſh a compleat Account of his new Method of Cutting for the <hi>Stone,</hi> (which has by Writers in <hi>Latin</hi> been generally called <hi>Sectio Hypogaſtrica;</hi> by the <hi>French, Le haut Appareil;</hi> and in <hi>Engliſh, The High Operation</hi>) yet he never had an Opportunity of performing it upon a living Body; and for above 130 Years after him, none ſeem'd ever ſo much as inclinable to make Tryal of it. The Writers of Lithotomy, during that Time, have moſt of them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed mention'd this Operation; but in ſuch a manner, as ſhews very plainly that few of them had ever read <hi>Roſſetus</hi>'s Book, and that not one of them underſtood it. The Authority of <hi>De Franco,</hi> who forbids the attempting of this Method, and of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> who thought all Wounds in the Bladder mortal, are the common Topicks they make uſe of to cry it down; and all this moſt commonly in the Compaſs of half a Page, from which an intelligent Reader can gather no more, than barely that it had been once propos'd in <hi>France</hi> to cut for the <hi>Stone</hi> above the <hi>Os Pubis. Dionis,</hi> it is true, has been at a little more Pains about it than the reſt, and had probably heard ſomething of <hi>Roſſetus</hi>'s Method; but then he is ſo ſupinely negligent in all the Parts of his Account, that one would be ready to think he mentions it at all, not ſo much with a deſign to recommend it to Practice, as to have ſomething to ſay, and to make way for a new Figure in his Book, which ſhould not be found in the other Treatiſes of Chirurgical Operations.</p>
            <p>From theſe lame and imperfect Scraps, my Brother took the firſt Hints of this Method, having, as I am very well ſatisfied, never ſeen <hi>Roſſetus</hi>'s <hi>Latin</hi> Treatiſe till he had compoſed the whole Theory of his Operation, and perform'd it ſucceſsfully on living Bodies. To him therefore may be applied what I have ſaid about <hi>Roſſetus,</hi> ſuppoſing that Author to have read <hi>De Franco</hi>'s Story before he invented his Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0153200400:13"/>But even <hi>Roſſetus</hi> himſelf muſt yield to him the Honour of having introduced the Practice of it; and for this, conſidering the Diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he met with, the Difficulties he had to overcome, and on the other hand, how highly this Method has already conduced to the Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Mankind, no Praiſe nor no Reward can be too great.</p>
            <p>From this ſhort View that I have given of the Hiſtory of <hi>Lithotomy,</hi> it will appear, that properly ſpeaking there are but two Ways poſſible of extracting the <hi>Stone</hi> out of the Bladder by Inciſion; and theſe are, making the Wound either above or below the <hi>Os Pubis.</hi> The firſt of theſe, if rightly practis'd, admits of no conſiderable Variety; in the ſecond, there is a greater Latitude, not only in reſpect of the Inſtruments uſed, and the ſeveral Steps of the Operation, but alſo in the Place of the Inciſion. All theſe may be, and actually have been, compounded and combined together by Lithotomiſts in a great many different manners, and it would be hard to prove that any two of them ever cut exactly the ſame Way; but to avoid as much as can be done all unneceſſary Subdiviſions, I think the different Methods of extracting a <hi>Stone</hi> by Cutting below the <hi>Os Pubis,</hi> may be reduced to three kinds; that of <hi>Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> that of <hi>Marianus,</hi> and what I have choſen to call the <hi>Lateral Way</hi> firſt practis'd by <hi>Frere Jacques.</hi> The two firſt, as has been already ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, differ from one another chiefly in the Inſtruments and Steps of the Operation, and the laſt differs from both theſe in the Place of the Inciſion.</p>
            <p>To this Method I ſhall confine myſelf at preſent, referring the compleat Hiſtory of the other two, together with the High Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to another Opportunity; and in treating it, I intend to obſerve this Order,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> I ſhall ſet down, from all the Authors I have met with, the Hiſtory of <hi>Frere Jaques,</hi> his two Methods of Cutting Males, and the Succeſs with which they were attended.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> I ſhall compare the different Accounts which have been given of the ſeveral Parts of his Operations with one another, that thereby it may clearly appear wherein they really conſiſted.</p>
            <pb n="7" facs="tcp:0153200400:14"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I ſhall relate the Opinions of Authors concerning his Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, and the Grounds upon which their Opinions have been found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Theſe, as is eaſy to conceive, are chiefly the Obſervations made on the dead Bodies of ſuch as he had cut.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> I ſhall ſet down his Method of Cutting Females, and the Judgments that have been made thereof.</p>
            <p>Under theſe four general Heads will be contained the whole Hiſtory of the <hi>Lateral Operation for the Stone,</hi> as it was perform'd by this Monk; and from thence we are naturally led to conſider the Improvements that have been made of it; firſt thoſe propoſed by Monſieur <hi>Mery,</hi> and then ſuch as were contrived and put in Practice by Profeſſor <hi>Rau.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the Matter of all this Hiſtory, I muſt be obliged to Books; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be called mine, except the Order in which I have digeſted it. What Authors I have chiefly conſulted, the Reader will ſee in the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the firſt Chapter.</p>
            <p>Before I cloſe this Introduction, I muſt further acquaint the Reader, that I intend that the Hiſtory of this <hi>Lateral Operation</hi> ſhall be followed in a very ſhort time, by that of the other three general Methods of Cutting for the <hi>Stone,</hi> in three ſeparate Treatiſes. To theſe I ſhall add a fifth, containing the Anatomy, and Figures of the Parts concerned in them all; the Figures of all the Inſtruments that have been uſed; and laſtly, my own Obſervations concerning the Advantages and Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies with which each of them are attended; and in what Caſes I judge any of them, taken all together, to be preferable to the reſt.</p>

               <hi>CHAP. I.</hi> The Hiſtory of <hi>Frere Jaques</hi> Methods of Cutting Males.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE firſt Account that I find to have been ever publiſhed of <hi>Frere Jacques</hi> Operations for the <hi>Stone,</hi> is contained in a Letter written by Mr. <hi>Buſſiere,</hi> a skilful and experienced Surgeon in <hi>London,</hi> and F. R. S. to Sir <hi>Hans Sloane,</hi> and inſerted in the <hi>Philoſophical Tranſactions</hi> for the Month of <hi>March</hi> 1699. The Author begins by deſcribing the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments uſed in theſe Operations, and the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of performing them, according to the Informations he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from <hi>Paris;</hi> then he ſets down the Opinion of his <hi>French</hi> Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondent about them; and laſtly, ſubjoins his own, founded on ſeveral Experiments he had made on dead Bodies.</p>
            <p>Much about the ſame time Dr. <hi>Liſter</hi> publiſhed his Journey to <hi>Paris,</hi> and amongſt other Curioſities, he has given us ſome Account of <hi>Frere Jacques.</hi> The Doctor went Phyſician to the Earl of <hi>Portland,</hi> who was ſent Ambaſſador to <hi>France</hi> by King <hi>William</hi> after the Peace of <hi>Reſwick;</hi> and during his Abode at <hi>Paris,</hi> he had the good Fortune to ſee <hi>Frere Jacques</hi> ſeveral times cut for the <hi>Stone.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Soon after that, appeared a <hi>French</hi> Treatiſe with this Title, <hi>Obſervations ſur la Maniere de Tailler dans les deux Sexes pour l'Extraction de la Pierre, pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquée par Frere Jacques, par Jean Mery, Chirurgien de la feüe Reine, &amp; Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomiſte de l'Academie Royale de Sciences;</hi> printed at <hi>Paris,</hi> and preſently afterwards at <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> both in the Year 1700. This excellent Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor has left almoſt nothing unſaid that relates either to the Hiſtory of <hi>Frere Jacques</hi> Operations, or the various Succeſs with which they were attended in <hi>France;</hi> and he has likewiſe ſhown, at very great length, the Reaſons of the Inconveniencies that follow upon them, and the Way by which he thinks theſe may be remedied: But, as it is to him that
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0153200400:16"/>we muſt be chiefly obliged for all that can with certainty be affirm'd about them, it is unneceſſary to make any more particular Abſtract of his Book in this Place.</p>
            <p>The ſame Year that Monſieur <hi>Mery</hi>'s Obſervations were publiſh'd, the <hi>Leipſick</hi> Journaliſts gave an Extract of it; but, as I ſhall have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to remark as I go along, they do not ſeem always to have hit the true Senſe of the Author.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Saviard,</hi> in a Collection of Chirurgical Operations publiſhed at <hi>Paris</hi> in 1702, has likewiſe mention'd thoſe of <hi>Frere Jacques</hi> for the <hi>Stone,</hi> but refers entirely to <hi>Mery</hi> for an Account of them; and indeed, by the few Things he has ſaid about them, he appears to have been very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit for that Task himſelf.</p>
            <p>Monſieur <hi>Dionis</hi> is the next who affords us any thing further re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable upon this Head. In his Book of Chirurgical Operations publiſhed at <hi>Paris</hi> in 1707, he has given a very diſtinct and methodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Hiſtory of <hi>Frere Jacques</hi> Operations. The principal Facts he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are, or might have been taken from <hi>Mery;</hi> and to theſe he has added ſome others, which, as he lived and practis'd in <hi>Paris</hi> while <hi>Frere Jacques</hi> was there, and ſaw him ſeveral times cut, it could be no hard matter for him to collect.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Goelick,</hi> in his Hiſtory of Surgery 1713, has tranſcribed the Extract of <hi>Mery</hi>'s Book from the <hi>Leipſick</hi> Acts; and Mr. <hi>Cheſelden,</hi> in his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe on the High Operation for the <hi>Stone</hi> 1723, has abridged the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of <hi>Frere Jacques</hi> given us by <hi>Dionis;</hi> but yet differs from him in ſome Things.</p>
            <p>The learned Profeſſor <hi>Albinus</hi> has made a few Obſervations on the ſame Subject, introductory to the accurate Account he has lately publiſhed of Mr. <hi>Rau</hi>'s Method: And it is from theſe Nine Authors that I have extracted the following Hiſtory of <hi>Frere Jacques</hi> Operations for the <hi>Stone;</hi> tho' in reality they may all be reduced to Three; the other Six having told us nothing worth minding, but what they have borrowed from <hi>Baſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ere, Mery</hi> and <hi>Dionis.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="11" facs="tcp:0153200400:17"/>
            <p>We know but very little concerning this Man's Original, Education, Life or Character, in any other reſpect than as a Lithotomiſt. The Name he gave himſelf was <hi>Jacques Beaulieu,</hi> and he ſaid he was born in <hi>Beaufort,</hi> a Town or Village of the Diſtrict of <hi>Long ſaunier,</hi> in what is call'd the County of <hi>Burgundy.</hi> (1)</p>
            <p>All our Authors agree that he was a Monk of ſome one kind or other; but of what Order or Inſtitution is not ſo certain. Mr. <hi>Buſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiere</hi> calls him an Hermit; (2) and this ſeems to be confirm'd by what we are told by <hi>Dionis,</hi> that he had framed to himſelf a Rule of Religion back'd with Vows, which he left it to his Biſhop for the Time being to diſpenſe him from at Pleaſure. (3) For at this time, as I have been inform'd, an Hermit in <hi>France</hi> is commonly a Perſon, who, being with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Education, and having either ſpent his Subſtance, or been born to none, aſſociates himſelf with one or two (never more) of the ſame Stamp, and finding means to get a Gift of ſome few Acres of Ground in a ſolitary Place near a great Town, and Liberty from the Biſhop of the Dioceſe to erect a Hermitage, together with what they call a Rule to be obſerved in it, firſt build themſelves little Cells, and then by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuring the reſt of the Land, ſelling little Trinkets which they make, and the Charity of well-diſpoſed Perſons, ſupply themſelves with all the Neceſſaries, and moſt commonly even the Conveniencies of Life. What makes it further probable that our Monk was of this kind is, the Ignorance and want of Education, which both <hi>Mery</hi> and <hi>Dionis</hi> have obſerved in him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mery</hi> tells us he was a Brother of the Third Order of St. <hi>Francis;</hi> a Sett of <hi>Mendicant</hi> Monks, who differ indeed very much from Hermits, becauſe they live in great Communities, and are tied up to a ſtricter Rule of Life; but amongſt thoſe they call Brothers of that Order, there are many ſo perfectly void of all ſorts of Education, that they cannot ſo much as read their own Mother Tongue. (4)</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dionis</hi> ſays he wore the Habit of a <hi>Recolet,</hi> except that he had Shoes inſtead of Sandals, and a Hat inſtead of a Cowl. The <hi>Recolets</hi> are ſuch Monks of the firſt or great Order of <hi>Franciſcans,</hi> call'd in <hi>France, Corde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers</hi> or <hi>Freres Mineurs,</hi> who embraced the Reformation that was ſome time ago made amongſt them; and if what <hi>Dionis</hi> here ſays be ſtrictly true, our Monk might ſtill be a Hermit, but could not be of the Third Order as <hi>Mery</hi> pretends he was. (5)</p>
            <pb n="12" facs="tcp:0153200400:18"/>
            <p>But of whatever Order he was, or whether of any Order or not, none of theſe Authors give us the leaſt ground to think he was ever admitted to Holy Orders; and the Appellation of <hi>Frere Jacques</hi> which <hi>Dionis</hi> ſays he took to himſelf, is Proof enough to any body who has had Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to inform himſelf of the Cuſtoms of theſe Monks in <hi>France,</hi> that he never was. (6) And therefore it is, I believe, pretty much without ground, that Mr. <hi>Cheſelden</hi> terms him an Eccleſiaſtick, (7) a Name ſeldom given to any but the Secular Clergy, and never to a Friar who is not a Prieſt. Dr. <hi>Liſter</hi> indeed, and his Correſpondent Mr. <hi>Probie,</hi> both call him <hi>Pere Jacques;</hi> but he is never ſo termed by the <hi>French</hi> Authors, who underſtand the Propriety of ſuch Deſignations better than Strangers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Albinus</hi> contents himſelf to call him in general a Monk, and ſuch in ſome Senſe or other he undoubtedly was; and this is all that can with any certainty be affirmed about his Profeſſion. (9)</p>
            <p>His ordinary Reſidence he pretended was in an Hoſpital called <hi>La Charité</hi> at <hi>Beſançon,</hi> the Capital of the Province of <hi>Franche Comté,</hi> erected for the Maintainance of poor aged People and Children. (10) His outward Behaviour had all the Appearances of Probity and Simplicity; he lived on nothing but Bread and ordinary Soupes, deſpiſed Money, and never asked for any but only a few Pence to ſet his Inſtruments and mend his Shoes. (11)</p>
            <p>But to come nearer our preſent Deſign, the Hiſtory of his Operations for the <hi>Stone, Mery</hi> informs us, that his natural Character was very much ſuited to them; he was of an intrepid and undaunted Courage and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, had a ſure and ſteddy Hand, and went about whatever he undertook without the leaſt Heſitation, Faultering or ſign of Fear. Theſe natural Talents were, however, the only ones he poſſeſs'd; Art he was a perfect Stranger to, being altogether ignorant of Anatomy, and the regular Operations of Surgery. (12) Neither is it without ground that <hi>Dionis</hi> obſerves, that the Intrepidity and Quickneſs with which he perform'd his Operations, were owing to nothing ſo much as his being inſenſible of the Danger that attended his Miſcarriages.</p>
            <pb n="13" facs="tcp:0153200400:19"/>
            <p>This being the caſe, it may be juſtly wonder'd how he came ever to attempt Cutting for the <hi>Stone</hi> at all. This is a Myſtery which no Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor but <hi>Mery</hi> has endeavoured to explain, and he has done it but very imperfectly. By comparing his natural Character with that of <hi>Raoux,</hi> a famous Impoſtor, their Curing of <hi>Hernia's,</hi> and likewiſe their Method of Operating for the <hi>Stone,</hi> he imagines that <hi>Frere Jacques</hi> might have been <hi>Raoux</hi>'s Diſciple, and learnt ſome Part of his Operations from him; and from thence, and what he had taken from the Method com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly practis'd when he began to cut, have invented the reſt. (13) But this will be better underſtood when we have explained wherein his Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations conſiſted; and that, together with the Series of his Practice, as far as our Authors have handed it down to us, is what we now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to.</p>
            <p>That he had cut for the <hi>Stone</hi> many times before he went to <hi>Paris,</hi> is evident from the great Number of Atteſtations which he brought along with him from <hi>Beſançon,</hi> and ſeveral Towns and Villages in <hi>Burgundy,</hi> and other Provinces of <hi>France.</hi> He boaſted extremely of the Succeſs he had had, and his Credentials ſeem'd to confirm all he ſaid; however, it appear'd ſoon after, by Letters from theſe Provinces, that theſe Atteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were given upon too ſlight grounds, and before any other Effect of his Operations, beſides bare extracting the <hi>Stone,</hi> could be perceiv'd: his Way being to run from Place to Place, where there was any Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for him; and as ſoon as he had perform'd an Operation, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage the moſt conſiderable of the Spectators to ſign a Certificate in his Favour, without ever allowing them Time to ſee whether the Patient re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered or not; and when he had cut all that came in his way in one Place, he immediately left it and haſtened to another, being ſollicitous about nothing but to make his Dexterity appear in taking out the <hi>Stone,</hi> and not at all about what ſhould become of the Patient after the Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. (14)</p>
            <p>This is all we know of him before he arrived in <hi>Paris,</hi> which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in the Month of <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1697. The Occaſion of that Journey he gave out to be no other than to teach the Surgeons of the Hoſpitals there a new Way of Cutting for the <hi>Stone:</hi> And having found means to get an Acquaintance with Monſieur <hi>Mareſchal,</hi> afterwards Firſt Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon to the <hi>French</hi> King, he endeavoured by his Intereſt to obtain leave to Cut in the Hoſpital of <hi>La Charité;</hi> but the Surgeons there, as well as thoſe of the <hi>Hotel Dieu,</hi> being unwilling to truſt the Lives of their
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0153200400:20"/>Patients in the Hands of a Stranger, of whoſe Abilities they were alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ignorant, deſired him firſt to make ſome Experiments in their Preſence upon dead Bodies, which he readily conſented to; and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, as Monſieur <hi>Dionis</hi> relates, he perform'd his Operation on a Body, into the Bladder of which a <hi>Stone</hi> had been convey'd before by the Surgeons of the <hi>Charité,</hi> but not at all to their Satisfaction. (15)</p>
            <p>Monſieur <hi>Mery,</hi> who was appointed by the Firſt Preſident of <hi>Paris</hi> (whom the <hi>Leipſick Journaliſts</hi> have miſtaken for the Preſident of the Royal Academy,) 16 to inſpect theſe Experiments of <hi>Frere Jaques</hi> Operation, ſays nothing of any that were perform'd at the <hi>Charité;</hi> and concerning thoſe which he was Witneſs to at the <hi>Hotel Dieu,</hi> he makes quite a different Judgment from what <hi>Dionis</hi> ſays was made by all the Surgeons who were preſent at that which he mentions.</p>
            <p>On the 7th Day of <hi>December,</hi> ſays Monſieur <hi>Mery,</hi> I received Orders from the Firſt Preſident to go to the <hi>Hotel Dieu,</hi> and be preſent at the Extraction of a <hi>Stone</hi> out of the Bladder of a dead Body by <hi>Frere Jacques.</hi> He perform'd the Operation in this manner.</p>
            <p>Having introduced into the Bladder a ſolid round <hi>Staff</hi> without a <hi>Groove,</hi> and of a different Figure from thoſe uſed in the old Way of Cutting, he took a <hi>Biſtoury</hi> like the common ones, only longer; and with that made an Inciſion on the Left and Inſide of the Protuberance of the <hi>Iſchium,</hi> and cutting obliquely from below upwards, he divided whatever came in his way between that Protuberance and his <hi>Staff,</hi> which he kept ſtill in the Bladder. His Inciſion being finiſhed, he thruſt his Finger through the Wound into the Bladder, to find out the <hi>Stone;</hi> and having obſerved where it lay, he introduced an Inſtrument into the Bladder, of the Figure hereafter repreſented, to dilate the Wound, that the <hi>Stone</hi> might have more room to come out, Upon this <hi>Dilator,</hi> which he calls his <hi>Conductor,</hi> he thruſt in a Pair of <hi>Forceps,</hi> and then drew out the <hi>Conductor;</hi> having felt for and laid hold of the <hi>Stone,</hi> he pulled the <hi>Staff</hi> out of the <hi>Urethra,</hi> then his <hi>Forceps</hi> and the <hi>Stone</hi> along with it. All this he did with a wonderful Facility, notwithſtanding the <hi>Stone</hi> was as big as an Hen's Egg.</p>
            <pb n="15" facs="tcp:0153200400:21"/>
            <p>The Operation being finiſhed, I diſſected the Parts which had been cut in Preſence of the Phyſicians and Surgeons of the <hi>Hotel Dieu;</hi> by that means, and by comparing at the ſame time theſe Parts with thoſe of the other Side, we obſerv'd that <hi>Frere Jacques</hi> had cut firſt about an Inch and an half deep in Fat, that from thence he had carried his Knife between the <hi>Muſculus Erector</hi> and the <hi>Left Accelerator,</hi> but without wounding either of them; and laſtly, that he cut through the whole Length of the Neck of the Bladder on one Side, and about half an Inch of the Body of it.</p>
            <p>Two Days after this Experiment I waited on the Firſt Preſident, to give him an Account of my Obſervations, and at the ſame time my Opinion concerning <hi>Frere Jacques</hi> Operation: My Report was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd in theſe Terms.</p>

                     <p>"<hi>FRere Jacques</hi> Method of Cutting appears to me to be much preferable to that commonly practis'd, becauſe the Inciſion being made both in the Neck and Body of the Bladder, and the <hi>Stone</hi> extracted at the broadeſt part of the Angle made by the <hi>Oſſa Pubis,</hi> comes out with great Eaſe, and without the leaſt Force: But in the common Operation, as the Inciſion is only made in the <hi>Ure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thra,</hi> and the <hi>Stone</hi> drawn through the Neck of the Bladder, which remains entire, and at the narroweſt part of the Angle of the <hi>Oſſa Pubis,</hi> it is evident that the Extraction of the <hi>Stone</hi> through ſuch ſtrait Paſſages muſt be very difficult, and require a great deal of Force when of any conſiderable Bigneſs; from whence it is eaſy to conclude, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>"1. Becauſe in his Way of Operating he cuts none of the Muſcles of the <hi>Penis;</hi> whereas in the common Way the two <hi>Accelerators</hi> are entirely ſeparated from one another, by the Inciſion which is made of the Place of their Union, that is, at their Origin; by which means theſe Muſcies happen very frequently to loſe their Action."</p>
                     <pb n="16" facs="tcp:0153200400:22"/>
                     <p>"2. In making his Operation it muſt be owned, indeed, that he cuts the Body of the <hi>Proſtates,</hi> the whole Neck of the Bladder on one Side, and a little of the Body; but theſe Parts having no conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Blood Veſſels belonging to them, an <hi>Haemorage</hi> is not ſo much to be feared as in the common Operation, in which the Inciſion is made in the ſpungy and thick part of the <hi>Urethra,</hi> which receive a great Quantity of Blood from the two Arteries of the <hi>Penis.</hi>"</p>
                     <p>"3. His Operation can neither be followed by an <hi>Echymoſis,</hi> Fluxion nor Suppuration in the Membranes of the <hi>Scrotum,</hi> which happen ſo frequently after the other; becauſe the Place by which he gets into the Bladder has not the ſame Communication with the <hi>Scrotum</hi> as the <hi>Perinaeum,</hi> in which the other Lithotomiſts begin their Inciſion."</p>
                     <p>"4. By making a large Wound in the Neck and Body of the Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, through which he eaſily draws out the <hi>Stone,</hi> he evites the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuſion and Tearing, which in the common Operation almoſt conſtantly happens, both to the Neck of the Bladder and <hi>Proſtates</hi> which are joined to it, and even to the <hi>Urethra</hi> itſelf when the <hi>Stone</hi> is large, or its Surface rugged. And from hence it comes to paſs, that the Parts which he divides being only ſimply cut, will very eaſily reunite after the Operation, and by this means Fiſtulas be in a great meaſure prevented; whereas in the common Method, the Parts ſuffering moſt commonly cauſe a violent Contuſion, and a conſiderable Loſs of Subſtance by Suppuration, their Re-union is retarded, and thus Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtulas are occaſioned: But, however, I am inclin'd to believe, that if <hi>Frere Jacques</hi> made his Inciſion two Inches higher up than the Place where he now begins it, he might get into the Bladder in the ſame manner, and yet the Wound not be ſo deep, and conſequently ſooner healed; ſuppoſing always that Wounds in the Neck and Body of the Bladder are not mortal, as has been hitherto believed, and that the <hi>Sphincter Muſcle</hi> may be reunited as exactly as it was before, which Experience alone muſt determine."</p>
                     <p>"As for the Inſtruments he uſes, I cannot find that they are any ways preferable to ours. On the contrary, his <hi>Staff</hi> ſeems to be much more inconvenient, both becauſe it forces the lower Part of the <hi>Urethra</hi> too far outwards, and becauſe not being <hi>Grooved</hi> it cannot be ſo ſurely cut upon; for let <hi>Frere Jacques</hi> have never ſo ſteddy a Hand,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0153200400:23"/>the Point of his <hi>Biſtoury</hi> muſt be apt to ſlide either to one Side or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, upon a <hi>Staff</hi> which is exactly round."</p>
                     <p>"The <hi>Conductor</hi> which he thruſts into the Bladder after the Wound is made, is not at all proper to direct his <hi>Forceps</hi> thither, and can be of no manner of Service to dilate the Inciſion made in the Neck and and Body of the Bladder, becauſe that Inciſion is longer than the <hi>Conductor</hi> is broad; and beſides the Wound may be dilated by the <hi>Forceps</hi> with this Advantage, that the Dilatation will never be more than is neceſſary, which is what no other Dilator can do.</p>

            <p>The Account I have here given of Monſieur <hi>Mary</hi>'s Obſervations made on diſſecting the Parts cut by <hi>Frere Jacques</hi> in this firſt Tryal of his Operation, did not properly belong to this Part of my Hiſtory; in which my Deſign is not to conſider either the Structure of the Parts concerned in this Method of Cutting, nor the Judgment that has or may be formed from thence concerning the Advantages and Inconveniencies thereof. This I reſerve for a diſtinct Head: But as Monſieur <hi>Mery</hi> did afterwards re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract the greateſt part of the favourable Opinion he had here conceiv'd of <hi>Frere Jacques,</hi> upon a more full Inſight into his Operation; and as this is the firſt Tryal that we have any certain Account ever to have been made of it; I judged it neceſſary in entering upon the Hiſtory of this Method of Cutting, to make the Reader thus far acquainted with the Nature of it, that the Sequel of this Relation might be the more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily underſtood.</p>
            <p>What Effect this Report had upon the Firſt Preſident, and the other Perſons to whom it was communicated, Monſieur <hi>Mery</hi> has not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd us; nor of any thing elſe that happen'd before the ſecond Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment was made, which was juſt a Week after the firſt.</p>
            <p>On the 14th Day of the ſame Month of <hi>December,</hi> continues our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, I went to the <hi>Hotel Dieu,</hi> by a ſecond Order of the Firſt Preſident, to ſee <hi>Frere Jacques</hi> perform his Operation a ſecond time. He cut the dead Body of a Child between Twelve and Fourteen Years of Age, and likewiſe of a Woman; into the Bladders of which <hi>Stones</hi> had been put as before. He cut the Boy exactly in the ſame manner as he did the Man, and I diſſected the Parts cut in Preſence of the Phyſicians and Surgeons of the <hi>Hotel Dieu.</hi> (17)</p>
            <pb n="18" facs="tcp:0153200400:24"/>
            <p>What was the Reſult of our Author's Obſervations we ſhall ſee elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where; as likewiſe the Account he here gives of <hi>Frere Jaques</hi> Method of Cutting Women. It is ſufficient to remark in this Place, that the Judgment he makes of both theſe Operations was not near ſo favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Monk as the former had been; and it may very well be, that this was the Reaſon of his leaving <hi>Paris</hi> ſo abruptly, as Monſieur <hi>Dionis</hi> informs us, tho' he has by Miſtake placed the Time of his Journey two Months too early.</p>
            <p>The Court was then at <hi>Fontainbleau,</hi> and thither our Operator re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to ſteer his Courſe. Upon his Arrival, he addreſs'd himſelf to Monſieur <hi>du Cheſne,</hi> firſt Phyſician to the Princes of the Blood, having found means to procure ſome Letters of Recommendation to him, and we may be ſure he did not forget to ſhow him his whole Bundle of Certificates. Monſieur <hi>du Cheſne</hi> was charm'd with the Account the Monk gave him of his Deſign in going to <hi>Paris,</hi> his Method of Cutting, and the great Number of Operations which he had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd: And out of a Zeal for the Welfare of his Fellow-Creatures, which can never be enough commended, he mentioned him to Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>Fagon,</hi> firſt Phyſician to the King; to M. <hi>Bourdelot,</hi> firſt Phyſician to the Dutcheſs of <hi>Burgundy;</hi> and to ſeveral others beſides; who all concluded that it would be worth while to ſee him cut: And for this purpoſe a Shoe-maker's Boy of <hi>Verſailles,</hi> then at <hi>Fontainbleau,</hi> and who was troubled with the <hi>Stone,</hi> luckily offered himſelf. Monſieur <hi>du Cheſne</hi> immediately ſent him to a Nurſe, and ordered him all manner of Neceſſaries. <hi>Frere Jacques</hi> perform'd the Operation in Preſence of the Phyſicians, and of Monſieur <hi>Felix,</hi> then firſt Surgeon to the King. The Succeſs anſwer'd their Expectation, and they were all perfectly ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with what they had ſeen, eſpecially Monſieur <hi>Felix;</hi> who from that Moment took <hi>Frere Jacques</hi> home to his Houſe, and kept him there all the time he ſtaid at <hi>Fontainbleau.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Operation we may eaſily conceive made a great Noiſe, and was publiſhed all over the Court. The Princes of the Blood were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd of it by Monſieur <hi>du Cheſne,</hi> and he gave them an Account every Day of the Progreſs of the Cure. As for his own part, he look'd upon the Monk as a Man ſent by God for the Relief of thoſe who were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted with the <hi>Stone,</hi> by a more eaſy and leſs dangerous Method than any that had till then been known; and, indeed the firſt Effects of his Operation on the Shoemaker were extremely happy. It was perform'd
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0153200400:25"/>very quickly, the Urine came out through the ordinary Paſſage a very ſhort time after; no bad Accident ſuperveen'd, and the Patient was able to go abroad in three Weeks Time. (18)</p>
            <p>This was the firſt Operation that ever we hear <hi>Frere Jacques</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd, after his Arrival at <hi>Paris,</hi> on a living Body. It happen'd at Court, to which he went of his own Accord, not by Invitation, as we are told by Mr. <hi>Cheſelden;</hi> and by the Succeſs of that, not by the Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation he had acquired by thoſe he had cut before, he recommended himſelf to the Court.</p>
            <p>Monſieur <hi>Dionis</hi> goes on to <hi>Frere Jacques</hi> Manner of Cutting; but the Account thereof ſent to Mr. <hi>Buſſiere</hi> from <hi>Paris,</hi> being prior to his in order of Time, it muſt for that reaſon be inſerted before it. Here is the Deſcription, ſays Mr. <hi>Buſſiere</hi> to Sir <hi>Hans Sloane,</hi> of the Way of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming the Operation for the Extraction of the <hi>Stone</hi> out of the Bladder by Brother <hi>James,</hi> an Hermit in <hi>France,</hi> as I received it from <hi>Paris.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He maketh uſe of a Steel <hi>Staff,</hi> much bigger and ſhorter than thoſe which are commonly made uſe of. It is ſhorter from the Top to the Bending of it, it bends more than ours; he hath but two, one for Men and another for Children.</p>
            <p>His <hi>Conductor</hi> is ſlender and longer than ours; the Point whereof, which goes into the Bladder, being of the Figure of a Lozenge, is wide and open in the Extremity.</p>
            <p>His <hi>Forceps</hi> have longer Branches than ours; but the Holds of them are ſhorter and wider, with many large Teeth within.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Eurethra</hi> with which he draweth the Sand or Gravel, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main ſometimes in the Bladder after the <hi>Stone</hi> is out, is ſhorter than ours.</p>
            <p>His Knife is much longer and ſlenderer than ours.</p>
            <pb n="20" facs="tcp:0153200400:26"/>
            <p>He cauſeth the Patient to lie flat upon his Back, either upon his Bed or upon a Table, whereupon is a ſoft Quilt, in ſuch a manner, that the Fundament is three or four Fingers over the Table, ſome Servants ſupporting his Legs and Thighs. He uſeth no Ligature to faſten the Patient, giving him more Liberty than we do; he cauſeth his Legs to be bent againſt the Thighs, but not the Thighs againſt the Belly, except the Left, which in his Operation he uſeth more or leſs, as he thinks fit.</p>
            <p>Then he introduceth the <hi>Catheter</hi> or <hi>Staff</hi> into the Bladder; which, tho' bigger and ſhorter than ours, yet ſeemeth to run in eaſier. Very often he holdeth it himſelf with his Left Hand, preſſing it cloſe towards the Fundament, in order to dilate and extend the Membranes of the Bladder; then he feeleth with the Fingers of his Right Hand, to find cut the <hi>Staff</hi> through the Skin; ſo having felt it, he runneth his Inciſion Knife, at the Bent of the Left Thigh, upon the fat Protuberance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the <hi>Iſchium</hi> Bone, directly upwards by the <hi>Rectum</hi> to the Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, which he pierceth by its Neck, and ſometimes a little above it. When he cutteth, the cutting Parts of his Knife are turned upwards and downwards. Having thus pierced the Bladder, which he knoweth by the Urine running out, then he turneth his Knife, and thruſteth it a little further, in order to open the Bladder wide enough that his Finger may go in eaſily; then he withdraweth his Knife, and enlargeth the Wound in the outward Parts, of the Length of two or three Inches; after which he thruſteth his Finger into the Bladder, in order to know more preciſely the Bigneſs and Situation of the <hi>Stone,</hi> and make it looſe, but chiefly to dilate the Overture of the Bladder, by tearing its Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes.</p>
            <p>Then he introduceth his <hi>Conductor</hi> into the Bladder, along this Finger which is in it.</p>
            <p>When the <hi>Conductor</hi> is in the Bladder he taketh the <hi>Staff</hi> out, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduceth the <hi>Forceps</hi> by the <hi>Conductor</hi> into it, with which he gets hold of the <hi>Stone</hi> and draweth it out.</p>
            <p>If he finds any Difficulty, either in getting hold of the <hi>Stone,</hi> or in drawing it out, he uſeth all the Ways commonly uſed, raiſing the Left Thigh more or leſs, putting his Finger in the Fundament, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0153200400:27"/>times the Bladder, in order to examine the Situation of the <hi>Stone,</hi> and looſen it in caſe there might be any Adheſion with the Membranes of the Bladder. Having found out, and removed the Cauſe of the Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, he thruſteth the <hi>Forceps</hi> again into the Bladder, and gets hold of the <hi>Stone,</hi> and pulls it out.</p>
            <p>It is to be obſerv'd, that this ſecond Time, nor any other, he uſeth no <hi>Conductor,</hi> the <hi>Forceps</hi> running in very eaſily. He never thruſteth his Finger or any Inſtrument into the Bladder, without ſteeping them in Oil of Roſes. He never uſes any <hi>Dilatatorium</hi> or <hi>Canula,</hi> or Tents in the Wound, except ſome ſmall Doſſils in the Lips of the outward Wound, to keep them open for a little while. He uſeth no Ointments at all for the Wound, applying only a Pledget ſteeped in Oil of Roſes upon it; for he underſtands nothing at all of the Way of dreſſing Wounds, nor in the Diet which the Patient is to obſerve; which Things he doth not value. In this Way he operates as dexterouſly as any of our beſt Operators. (19)</p>
            <p>Wherein this Account of <hi>Frere Jacques</hi> Operation differs from the reſt; and alſo wherein they all differ from one another, we ſhall be better able to ſhow, when we have gone through all that belongs to the Hiſtory of it.</p>
            <p>The next Author, in order of Time, who has ſaid any thing further about the Method of performing it, is <hi>Saviard;</hi> and he has only told us, that <hi>Frere Jacques,</hi> who cut ſeveral Patients in the <hi>Hotel Dieu</hi> in the Year 1698, uſed to leave a large ill-contriv'd <hi>Catheter</hi> in the Bladder ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>l he had extracted the <hi>Stone.</hi> (20)</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dionis,</hi> to whom we now return, begins his Account of <hi>Frere Jacques</hi> Method, by obſerving, that he took no Pains to prepare his Patients for the Operation, and cared not whether they had been blooded and purged before-hand or not. He places the Patient upon the Edge of a Table ſet in a good Light, and then lays him upon his Back, with only a Pillow under his Head. He raiſes his Thighs, ſeparates them wide from one another, bends his Legs ſo that his Heels and Buttocks almoſt meet, and ſets two ſtrong Men to keep him in that Poſture, without
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0153200400:28"/>binding him at all, but truſting entirely to the Strength and Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of theſe Aſſiſtants.</p>
            <p>The Patient being thus in a proper Situation, he introduces a greas'd <hi>Staff</hi> not groov'd, into the <hi>Penis,</hi> and holding it in his Left-hand, he thruſts out that part of the Bladder where he deſigns to make his Inciſion: Then taking in his Right a long <hi>Biſtoury</hi> ſhaped like a Dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, he plunges it near the Point of the Left Buttock, two Fingers breadth from the <hi>Perinaeum,</hi> and puſhing it ſtreight towards the Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, he cuts into the Body thereof as near the Neck as he can, making an Inciſion as wide as the Size of the <hi>Stone</hi> requires it, before ever he takes out his <hi>Biſtoury.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He makes uſe of a <hi>Conductor</hi> in order to direct the <hi>Forceps,</hi> which is made pretty much of the ſame Shape with ours; but very often before he introduces this Inſtrument, he thruſts his Finger into the Wound to diſcover the Situation of the <hi>Stone.</hi> As ſoon as he lays hold of it with the <hi>Forceps,</hi> he pulls it out ſuddenly and roughly, never reflecting on the bad Conſequences that ſuch Violence may be attended with. If there be more <hi>Stones</hi> than one, he extracts all of them after the ſame manner; and when he finds there are none left, he believes his whole Work to be done, for he never thinks of getting any <hi>Apparatus</hi> ready before-hand, nor of dreſſing his Patients after the Operation. He uſes no Aſtringents nor Defenſives; all he does is to apply a little Oil and Wine to the Wound; and when he is put in mind of the Neceſſity there is of the Patient's being well looked after, his Anſwer is, I have extracted the <hi>Stone,</hi> I leave God to cure the Patient. (21)</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Cheſelden,</hi> in order to explain <hi>Frere Jacques</hi> new-invented Way of Cutting for the <hi>Stone,</hi> thinks it ſufficient to tell us, that it was by the Direction of a <hi>Staff</hi> into the Bladder near the <hi>Rectum;</hi> and as he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes this to be the ſame with that practis'd afterwards in <hi>Holland</hi> by Mr. <hi>Rau,</hi> we may gather this further, that he thought the Inciſion was made in the Bladder exactly betwixt the <hi>Ureters.</hi> (22)</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Albinus</hi> informs us, that the Parts propoſed to be cut in <hi>Frere Jacques</hi> Operation, were not the Neck of the Bladder, as had been anciently practis'd, nor the <hi>Urethra</hi> as was commonly done at that time; but the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0153200400:29"/>Bladder itſelf on one Side, near the Neck, and a little towards the lower and back Part. In order to this the Patient was laid upon his Back, with his Knees erect, his Thighs bent, and kept at a ſmall Diſtance from one another. The Inciſion was begun on the Side of the <hi>Anus,</hi> and afterwards the Knife was thruſt obliquely inwards, and a little up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards all the way to that Part of the Bladder already deſcribed; and laſtly, a Pair of <hi>Forceps</hi> introduced through the Wound to lay hold of and extract the <hi>Stone.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe are all the Accounts that I can find ever to have been publiſh'd concerning <hi>Frere Jacques</hi> Method of Cutting upon the <hi>Staff;</hi> and I have placed them all together, <hi>Mery</hi>'s alone excepted, which came in more naturally before, that it may be eaſier for the Reader to compare them with one another, or at leaſt to perceive the Truth and Exactneſs of the Compariſon I ſhall lay before him in its proper Place.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Frere Jacques</hi> was ſufficiently careſs'd at <hi>Fontainbleau,</hi> not to think of leaving it while the Court remained there; but I hear of no other Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations he perform'd during his Stay. It had one good Effect however: By giving the News of his extraordinary Succeſs, and the kind Recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception he met with at Court, time to ſpread over <hi>Paris;</hi> he found his Reputation as a Lithotomiſt much better eſtabliſhed upon his Return, than it could otherwiſe have been, tho' he had made a Thouſand Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments before the Phyſicians and Surgeons of the Hoſpitals. The Approach of the Court to <hi>Paris</hi> contributed further to this; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no ſooner had the King left <hi>Fontainbleau</hi> to go to <hi>Verſailles,</hi> but <hi>Frere Jacques</hi> reſolved to try his Fortune once more at <hi>Paris;</hi> if that can be called a Tryal, in which he knew the Genius of his Nation too well, not to be ſure to ſucceed.</p>
            <p>He arrived there about the Beginning of <hi>April</hi> 1698, having been between Three and Four Months abſent. A very few Days after his Return, he cut a Woman nam'd <hi>de Lorrain,</hi> a Boy between Sixteen and Seventeen Years of Age, two Men and another Boy, and three more, at which Monſieur <hi>Mery</hi> was not preſent, The Days of the Month in which all theſe Operations were perform'd are not ſet down; but they muſt all have follow'd very cloſe upon one another, for before the End of <hi>April</hi> he had made a Journey to <hi>Verſailles,</hi> cut four People in an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpital there, was return'd to <hi>Paris,</hi> and had cut in the Hoſpitals of that
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0153200400:30"/>City, having obtained what he ſo much deſired, Leave ſo to do, in the manner we ſhall preſently relate.</p>
            <p>Concerning the Fate of theſe Twelve Patients, for I do not find that he cut any more, tho' it is very probable he did, Monſieur <hi>Mery</hi> informs us, that one of the <hi>Pariſians</hi> died two Days after the Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, another in three Days, another in the Month of <hi>September</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, having never been cured; the reſt lived, but in ſuch a manner as did this new Method no great Honour, as we ſhall hear in the proper Place. <hi>Mery</hi> ſays nothing of his Journey to <hi>Verſailles;</hi> but <hi>Dionis</hi> who mentions it owns, that all the Patients he cut there recovered in ſome ſort or other. (23)</p>
            <p>One of the Three laſt of the <hi>Paris</hi> Patients he cut upon the <hi>Gripe.</hi> This is the firſt time we hear of his Cutting for the <hi>Stone</hi> in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; and Monſieur <hi>Mery</hi> has given us the following Account of his Method. He introduces the Fore and Middle Fingers of his Left Hand through the <hi>Anus</hi> into the <hi>Inteſtinum Rectum;</hi> and preſſing upon the Bladder behind with his two Fingers, and before with his Right Hand upon the Belly, he thruſts the <hi>Stone</hi> towards the <hi>Perinaeum,</hi> and keeps it there by means of the two Fingers which he holds firmly behind it. In his Right Hand he takes his <hi>Biſtoury,</hi> and beginning at the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuberance of the <hi>Iſchium,</hi> he cuts all the Parts that lie between that and the <hi>Stone.</hi> So that his two Ways of Operating differ, not in the Courſe of the Inciſion, but only in the Inſtruments he uſes, and the Manner of extracting the <hi>Stone;</hi> for whereas in the great <hi>Apparatus</hi> he cuts upon a <hi>Staff,</hi> and uſes <hi>Forceps</hi> to draw out the <hi>Stone,</hi> in this he cuts upon the <hi>Stone</hi> itſelf, and takes it out by means of a <hi>Curete</hi> of about an Inch in breadth. Firſt of all he dilates the Bottom of the Wound, by thruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his <hi>Conductor</hi> into the Bladder; then forces in his <hi>Curete</hi> between the <hi>Stone</hi> and the upper internal Surface of the Bladder; and having got it behind the <hi>Stone,</hi> he raiſes the Handle of it with his Right Hand, the two Fingers of his Left remaining ſtill in their former Place; and thus, in the ſame manner as a Weight is raiſed, or any other Obſtacle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved by a Lever, he forces out the <hi>Stone.</hi> (24)</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Buſſiere</hi>'s Correſpondent has likewiſe taken Notice of this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of Operating. Brother <hi>James,</hi> he ſays, very often cutteth the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient upon the <hi>Gripe,</hi> almoſt in the ſame manner as was uſed formerly,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0153200400:31"/>except that he maketh the Inciſion in the ſame Place as for the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; this Way he liketh better than the other, and it ſeemeth, to be more favoured by him, and indeed it is ſurer, tho' the preſſing upon the Belly which he doth, is a very bad Method. (25)</p>
            <p>Neither <hi>Dionis,</hi> nor any of the reſt of our Authors, have ſo much as mention'd this ſecond Way of Cutting. The Succeſs that attended it we ſhall ſee as we go along.</p>
            <p>We are now come to that Period of <hi>Frere Jacques</hi> Tranſactions at <hi>Paris;</hi> in which, as his Wiſhes ſeem'd to be entirely crown'd, ſo a ſpeedy Foundation was laid for the Ruin of that Reputation which he had ſo unaccountably acquired. The Operations which he had perform'd immediately upon his Return from <hi>Fontainbleau,</hi> had ſo far ſucceeded, as that but Two Patients died out of Twelve that we know he cut. This, joined to the favourable Character that ſome Phyſicians from the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces gave of him at Court, and the great Merit that was made there of what had already happen'd to him at <hi>Fontainbleau,</hi> made the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates of <hi>Paris</hi> (not the King, as far as we can learn either from <hi>Mery</hi> or <hi>Dionis,</hi> 26) begin to think ſeriouſly of allowing him to Cut in the two great Hoſpitals of that City. In order to that, however, the Firſt Preſident thought it proper to call together the Adminiſtrators of the <hi>Hotel Dieu,</hi> the Phyſicians and Surgeons belonging to it, and alſo Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieurs <hi>Mery</hi> and <hi>Beſſiere</hi> who had before been commiſſion'd by him to inſpect <hi>Frere Jacques</hi> Experiments on dead Bodies, to hear their Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon a Matter wherein the Lives of the Sick People in that Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpital were ſo nearly concern'd. The Aſſembly was held in the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop's Palace on the 24th Day of <hi>April,</hi> and Monſieur <hi>Mery</hi> was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to give his Opinion the firſt. He has ſet down at length the Diſcourſe he made upon that Occaſion; in which he endeavours to oppoſe the Monk's being allow'd to Cut, as ſtrenuouſly as he had in his former Report recommended him.</p>
            <p>None of the other Phyſicians nor Surgeons pretended to diſpute ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Facts alledg'd by Monſieur <hi>Mery,</hi> or the Conſequences he drew from them; but they thought, that conſidering the great Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of ſucceſsful Operations which he had perform'd in the Provinces, as they were inform'd by the Phyſicians there reſiding, it would be hard to condemn his new Method altogether, upon account of a few unlucky
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0153200400:32"/>Experiments he had made of it at <hi>Paris,</hi> eſpecially ſince the Publick was ſo much prejudiced in his Favour; and therefore they gave it as their Opinion, that the ſureſt Way was to admit him to make new Tryals, which he could by no other means do ſo well, as by being allowed to Cut in the <hi>Hotel Dieu;</hi> and this was accordingly reſolv'd on. (27)</p>
            <p>He was at the ſame time admitted to the <hi>Charité;</hi> and in theſe two Hoſpitals he Cut Sixty Patients, Forty two in the firſt, and Eighteen in the ſecond, during the Space of one Seaſon; that is, at fartheſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the 24th of <hi>April</hi> and the Beginning of <hi>July;</hi> for by the 8th Day of that Month, he had left <hi>Paris,</hi> reached <hi>Orleans,</hi> (which is 100 Miles diſtant from it) and there perform'd an Operation.</p>
            <p>The Crowds to ſee him Cut were inconceivable; there was not a Phyſician nor Surgeon who did not ſtrive to get in, inſomuch, that they were forced to have Guards to keep off the Preſs; and there have been Two Hundred Perſons preſent at once at his Operations.</p>
            <p>Of theſe Sixty Patients <hi>Dionis</hi> tells us more died than lived, and at the Time he wrote that may be true; but by a Computation which Monſieur <hi>Mery</hi> made of the different Fate of them, about <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember</hi> following, as near as I can gueſs, ſince no Part of his Relation appears to have been written after that Time; and it is certain it did not exceed a full Year, becauſe towards the latter End of it he calls the Time in which <hi>Frere Jacques</hi> Cut in the Hoſpitals the laſt Spring: By this Computation, I ſay, it appears that Twenty Five died ſoon after the Operation; Thirteen went from the Hoſpitals perfectly cured, as was thought, tho' afterwards he was inform'd that ſome of their Wounds had broke out afreſh; and Twenty Five remain'd in the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpitals, ſome afflicted with Incontinence of Urine, others with Fiſtulas, and all of them ſo very low, that according to the Information he had received from the Officers and Servants of the Hoſpitals, there was on the 30th of <hi>July</hi> very little Hopes of their Recovery. On this Day, our Author ſays, he ended his Obſervations; but as in other Places of his Book he mentions Facts which did not happen till <hi>September,</hi> it is plain they were retouched after that Time. (28)</p>
            <pb n="27" facs="tcp:0153200400:33"/>
            <p>Monſieur <hi>Mery</hi> was at Pains to examine the Bodies of ſuch as died after <hi>Frere Jacques</hi> Operations with a great deal of Care, and he has ſet down the Obſervations he made upon them: By theſe we may with great Certainty judge of the Merit of theſe Methods of Cutting for the <hi>Stone;</hi> but before we can proceed to that, ſome few Facts more, belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Hiſtory of them, muſt firſt be related.</p>
            <p>It is not mentioned, neither by <hi>Mery</hi> nor <hi>Dionis,</hi> how many died out of each Hoſpital; but it is probable that the Number was greater in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to thoſe he Cut in the <hi>Charité</hi> than in the <hi>Hotel Dieu. Dionis</hi> ſays, that Seven died there in one Day; and from thence, and from a Quarrel which <hi>Frere Jacques</hi> is ſaid to have had with ſome of the Monks of that Houſe, it was, that he and his Friends took occaſion to trump up a fictitious Story, that the Monks ſometimes poiſon'd his Patients, and ſometimes cut other Parts in dreſſing their Wounds, than thoſe which he had touched, in order to diſcredit his Operation. This Story, how unlikely ſo ever, gained the Belief of great Numbers of People, and the Death of <hi>Frere Jacques</hi> Patients turned as much to his Honour, as his having ſaved the Lives of the reſt; but at length, when upon Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſection of the dead Bodies, eſpecially of thoſe who had been Cut at the <hi>Hotel Dieu,</hi> in which there was no Suſpicion or any Fraud, the Ignorance of the Operator, and the Inconveniencies of the Operations, came to be plainly diſcovered, this Accuſation vaniſhed into Smoak; and with it the Reputation of <hi>Frere Jacques,</hi> and his Intereſt at <hi>Paris,</hi> which he had reaſon to think ſo well eſtabliſhed; ſo that it was ſoon afterwards re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved that he ſhould be no more allowed to Cut in either of the Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals. (29)</p>
            <p>What contributed very much to this ſudden Diſgrace of <hi>Frere Jacques,</hi> was the Death of the Mareſchal <hi>de l'Orge,</hi> which happened in the moſt cruel and lamentable Manner, the very next Day after he had been Cut by him; while at the ſame time Monſieur <hi>Fagon,</hi> who, notwithſtanding all the Sollicitations that were made to him, to put himſelf in the Hands of <hi>Frere Jacques,</hi> reſolved rather to truſt the Art of Monſieur <hi>Mareſchal,</hi> a skilful and regularly bred Surgeon, recovered perfectly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter undergoing the ſame Operation. (30)</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Frere Jacques</hi> finding his Credit quite ſunk at <hi>Paris,</hi> and that there was no Hopes left of getting any more Employment there, thought his
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0153200400:34"/>beſt Way was to withdraw to ſome other City in <hi>France;</hi> and <hi>Orleans</hi> was the Place he pitched upon. There, between the 8th and 15th Day of <hi>July,</hi> he perform'd Eight Operations, Five in the Publick Hoſpital of that City, and Three elſewhere; as we are inform'd by a Letter which Monſieur <hi>Noel,</hi> a Phyſician of <hi>Orleans,</hi> wrote to Monſieur <hi>Mery,</hi> dated <hi>Sept.</hi> 13. 1698. The Succeſs of theſe Operations was every bit as bad as thoſe he performed in the Hoſpitals of <hi>Paris.</hi> Three of the Eight Patients died within a few Days after the Operation; a Fourth before <hi>September,</hi> that is, in leſs than two Months after he was Cut; One reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered perfectly; and the other Three continued in a languiſhing State, being either troubled with an Incontinence of Urine, or very groſs Symptoms of a Fiſtula. (31)</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dionis</hi> ſays, he Cut afterwards at <hi>Lyons,</hi> and in other Cities in <hi>France;</hi> but he muſt certainly be miſtaken, ſince by an Advertiſement in the <hi>Amſterdam</hi> Gazette, dated the 8th of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> it appears, that on the 28th of <hi>July,</hi> that is (allowing for the Difference of the Stile) only 23 Days after his laſt Operation at <hi>Orleans,</hi> he arrived at <hi>Aix la Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelle.</hi> The Subſtance of that Advertiſement is as follows:</p>
            <p>
               <q>"<hi>Frere Jacques,</hi> Operator for the <hi>Stone</hi> to the moſt Chriſtian King, arrived at <hi>Aix la Chapelle</hi> on the 28th of <hi>July,</hi> to Cut a Man for the <hi>Stone;</hi> and he hereby gives Notice, that whoever are afflicted with that Diſtemper, the <hi>Gravel,</hi> or any kind of <hi>Hernia</hi> or <hi>Rupture,</hi> he will undertake to cure for nothing, the Rich as well as the Poor, only out of Charity and Benevolence to Mankind. He offers to all Surgeons to teach them his Way of Cutting, and all his other Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations <hi>gratis;</hi> and to all Phyſicians, to ſhow them infallible Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies againſt the <hi>Gravel.</hi> He lodges at Monſieur <hi>Blondel's</hi> a Phyſician. His Operations are all New, and of his own Invention. That for the <hi>Stone</hi> in particular never endangers Life, and no Fiſtula is to be feared after it. He has perform'd it on Multitudes at <hi>Paris</hi> and <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſailles,</hi> in Preſence of the Phyſicians and Surgeons of the King of <hi>France,</hi> and met with an univerſal Approbation." (32)</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Stile of this Advertiſement ſhows, that it was publiſhed by the Monk's own Order; and from it, as well as ſeveral other Particulars of his Hiſtory, it appears ſufficiently that he muſt have been a moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fligate abandon'd Wretch; and that under an outward Air of Simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0153200400:35"/>and Self-denial, he concealed ſome ſecret Deſign or other, which perhaps the Multitudes of Perſons that died under his Hands prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his ever putting in Execution.</p>
            <p>He gives himſelf out here not only for an Operator for the <hi>Stone,</hi> but a Curer of <hi>Ruptures.</hi> He had made ſome Experiments of his Talents that Way in <hi>Paris,</hi> and more at <hi>Orleans:</hi> His Patients all of them recovered after the Operation, at leaſt we hear of none that died; but as it was always accompanied with Caſtration, it ſoon met with a general Diſguſt, and therefore he laid it aſide during all the reſt of the Time he remained at <hi>Paris.</hi> (33)</p>
            <p>What Reception he found at <hi>Aix la Chapelle</hi> I have not as yet learned, nor whither he went from thence. It is certain he was afterwards in <hi>Holland,</hi> and Cut for the <hi>Stone</hi> there; as we learn from <hi>Albinus</hi> in the following Words, <q>"While <hi>Rau</hi> taught Anatomy and practis'd Surgery at <hi>Amſterdam, Frere Jacques</hi> arrived there to practiſe his new Method of Cutting for the <hi>Stone,</hi> as he had already done in <hi>France.</hi> For this purpoſe he obtained a Permiſſion from the Civil Magiſtrate; and <hi>Rau</hi> was frequently preſent at his Operations, which he highly blamed and condemn'd. This Freedom of his gave ſome Umbrage at firſt, and he found himſelf obliged to hold his Tongue; but afterwards, when they ſaw that all he had ſaid was confirmed by the Event, <hi>Frere Jacques</hi> Permiſſion was taken from him, and <hi>Rau</hi> made Publick Lithotomiſt in his Room."</q>

               <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> A Compariſon of the ſeveral Deſcriptions that have been given of <hi>Frere Jaques</hi> Methods of Cutting Males.</head>
            <p>IN the foregoing Hiſtory I have collected all that I can find in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors concerning the two Methods uſed by <hi>Frere Jacques</hi> in Cutting Men; but as theſe Accounts are not only ſome of them more full and compleat than others, but likewiſe differ from one another in ſeveral Particulars, I have thought it neceſſary to compare them together; it being impoſſible to judge as we ought concerning the true Merit of an Operation, except we be firſt throughly acquainted with the true Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of performing it.</p>
            <p>To begin therefore by the Preparation of the Patient, the firſt Step towards all Operations of this kind; <hi>Dionis,</hi> the only Author who has ſaid any thing about it, aſſures us, that <hi>Frere Jacques</hi> looked upon Blooding, Purging, and every thing elſe that goes under that Name, as Things indifferent and of no Conſequence to the Succeſs of the Operation; and indeed this agrees ſo well with the Character we have given of him, and eſpecially the ſhort Stay he uſually made in the Places where he Cut, that there can be no room to doubt of the Truth of it.</p>
            <p>The Inſtruments he made Uſe of were firſt a <hi>Catheter</hi> or <hi>Staff.</hi> In deſcribing this, all our Authors agree well enough; and from what they have ſaid, we may conclude that it was made of Steel, ſolid, round, without a Groove, thicker and ſhorter than thoſe uſed in the common
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0153200400:37"/>Way, ſhorter from the Top to the Bending, and bent more; that he had two ſorts, one for Men, and one for Children, differing only in Size; and that before he uſed it, he always dip'd it in Oil of Roſes, or ſome ſuch thing.</p>
            <p>His Inciſion Knife, or <hi>Biſtoury,</hi> as it is call'd in <hi>French,</hi> differ'd from the common one chiefly in Length. <hi>Buſſiere</hi> adds, that it was ſlenderer; and <hi>Dionis,</hi> that it was ſhaped like a Poinard or Dagger.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mery</hi> has given us a Figure of his <hi>Dilator</hi> or <hi>Conductor,</hi> by which it will be better underſtood than by any Deſcription that has been made of it. <hi>Dionis</hi> ſays in general, that it is pretty much of the ſame Shape with the common one, which I believe is pretty far from being true. But Mr. <hi>Buſſiere</hi>'s Deſcription will agree very well with <hi>Mery</hi>'s Figure. His <hi>Conductor,</hi> ſays he, is ſlender; and longer than the common one; the Point whereof, that is all that Part which goes into the Bladder, being of the Figure of a Lozenge, is wide and open in the Extremity.</p>
            <p>His <hi>Forceps</hi> no Author has deſcribed except Mr. <hi>Buſſiere,</hi> that is, they all believed it to be like the common one; but he tells us, that the Branches are longer, and the Holds ſhorter and wider, with many large Teeth within. It is for the ſame Reaſon that they ſay nothing of his Scoop; but Mr. <hi>Buſſiere</hi> takes Notice, that that Inſtrument, which he calls an <hi>Eurethra,</hi> is ſhorter than the common ſort.</p>
            <p>The Situation of the Patient, Number and Office of the Aſſiſtants, follow next in Order. About all theſe Monſieur <hi>Mery</hi> is entirely ſilent; <hi>Buſſiere, Dionis</hi> and <hi>Albinus</hi> agree, except in a very few Particulars. The Patient is laid upon his Back on a Bed or Table, with a ſoft Quilt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him, or only a Pillow under his Head, in ſuch a manner that the Fundament is Three or Four Inches over the Edge of the Table, the Thighs erect, not bent towards the Belly, and at a good Diſtance from one another; (<hi>Albinus</hi> ſays they are bent, and not much ſeparated;) the Legs bent ſo as that the Heels do almoſt touch the Buttock; and in this Poſture he is kept by two ſtrong Aſſiſtants, without the help of any Ligature, ſo that the Operator is at Liberty to move any Part, as he thinks convenient.</p>
            <pb n="32" facs="tcp:0153200400:38"/>
            <p>The Patient being placed in this manner, <hi>Mery</hi> tells us that <hi>Frere Jacques</hi> introduceth his <hi>Catheter</hi> into the Bladder; and <hi>Buſſiere</hi> adds, that tho' it be bigger and ſhorter than the common ones, yet it ſeems to run in eaſier; that he very often (<hi>Dionis</hi> ſays always) holds it in his Left Hand, and preſſes it cloſe towards the Fundament, in order to dilate or thruſt out that Part of the Bladder which he deſigns to Cut, till he can feel it with his Fingers through the Skin. <hi>Albinus</hi> ſeems to think that <hi>Frere Jacques</hi> made Uſe of no <hi>Staff</hi> in his Operation; for beſides, that he does not mention it in the Account he has given us, he makes the Addition <hi>Rau</hi> made to <hi>Frere Jacques</hi> Operation to conſiſt in a <hi>Staff,</hi> which he compares not with the <hi>Staff</hi> uſed by him, as he natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ought to have done, in order to ſhow wherein <hi>Rau</hi>'s Was prefera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to his, but with that uſed in the great <hi>Apparatus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When <hi>Frere Jacques</hi> had felt the <hi>Catheter</hi> through the Skin, he began to make an Inciſion on the Left and Inſide of the Protuberance of the <hi>Iſchium,</hi> and ſo cutting on obliquely from below upwards, he divided whatever came in his Way till he reached his <hi>Catheter;</hi> and it appears by all <hi>Mery</hi>'s Diſſections, from whom theſe Words are taken, that his Deſign was to cut the Neck of the Bladder length-ways, and as much of the Body of it as the Size of the <hi>Stone</hi> required.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Buſſiere</hi> deſcribes his Inciſion thus: He runneth his Knife at the Bent of the Left Thigh, upon the fat Protuberance, below the <hi>Iſchium</hi> Bone, directly upwards by the <hi>Rectum</hi> into the Bladder, which he pierceth by its Neck, and ſometimes a little above it. This Account diſagrees with the former, chiefly in the Courſe of the Inciſion from its Beginning till it reached the Bladder.</p>
            <p>According to <hi>Dionis,</hi> the Knife was plunged near the Point of the Left Buttock two Fingers breadth from the <hi>Perinaeum,</hi> and from thence puſhed directly forwards into the Body of the Bladder, as near the Neck as he could, and all this before ever he took out his Knife. Here the Neck of the Bladder is ſuppoſed to remain entire, which is contrary to both <hi>Mery</hi> and <hi>Buſſiere</hi>'s Obſervations.</p>
            <p>The firſt part of Mr. <hi>Cheſelden</hi>'s Account of his Way of Cutting, that it was by the Direction of a <hi>Staff</hi> into the Bladder near the <hi>Rectum,</hi> may
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0153200400:39"/>be either true or falſe, juſt as he underſtood it; but the ſecond Part, that the Bladder was cut exactly betwixt the <hi>Ureters,</hi> can never be true. This ſhall be ſhown in deſcribing the Structure of the Parts concerned in this Operation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Albinus</hi> has copied <hi>Dionis</hi>'s Miſtake about the Neck of the Bladder not being cut; but what he ſays further, that the Inciſion was begun on the Side of the <hi>Anus,</hi> and afterwards the Knife thruſt obliquely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and a little upwards into the Side of the Bladder near its Neck, and a little towards the lower and back Part; is exactly agreeable to what we have heard from <hi>Mery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This being the Part of <hi>Frere Jacques</hi> Method, which is of the greateſt Conſequence to be rightly underſtood, I thought it proper to bring here under one View all that has been ſaid about it.</p>
            <p>The Inciſion being made, Mr. <hi>Mery</hi> acquaints us further, that he thruſt his Finger through the Wound into the Bladder, to find out the <hi>Stone;</hi> and having obſerved where it lay, he introduced his <hi>Conductor</hi> to dilate the Wound, if the Bigneſs of the <hi>Stone</hi> required it, and alſo that it might direct his <hi>Forceps</hi> into the Bladder. As ſoon as the <hi>Forceps</hi> had entered there, he drew out his <hi>Conductor,</hi> and alſo the <hi>Staff</hi> out of the <hi>Urethra;</hi> then having felt for and laid hold of the <hi>Stone</hi> with the <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceps,</hi> he extracted both of them together.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Buſſiere</hi>'s Account of this Part of the Operation diſagrees with <hi>Mery</hi>'s chiefly in this, that he ſuppoſes the Wound to be dilated by the Knife and Finger only, not by the <hi>Conductor;</hi> that he makes him enlarge the outward Part of it Two or Three Inches after the firſt Inciſion is fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed; and that the <hi>Staff</hi> is taken out before the <hi>Forceps</hi> is introduced. He has likewiſe made this very conſiderable Addition to Mr. <hi>Mery</hi>'s Relation, that when the Monk found any Difficulty, either in getting hold of the <hi>Stone,</hi> or in drawing it out, he uſed all the Ways commonly practis'd, raiſing the Left Thigh more or leſs, putting his Finger in the Fundament, and ſometimes into the Bladder, in order to examine the Situation of the <hi>Stone,</hi> and looſen it in caſe there might be any Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heſion with the Membranes of the Bladder. Having found out and removed the Cauſe of the Difficulty, he thruſts the <hi>Forceps</hi> again into
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0153200400:40"/>the Bladder, gets hold of the <hi>Stone,</hi> and pulls it out; and at this time he uſed no <hi>Conductor,</hi> the <hi>Forceps</hi> running in very eaſily.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Saviard</hi> makes the <hi>Staff</hi> remain in the Bladder till the <hi>Stone</hi> is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted. This I take to be a Miſtake, becauſe it not only contradicts the two former Accounts, but becauſe by this means it muſt have been more difficult to ſearch for, and lay hold of the <hi>Stone</hi> with the <hi>Forceps.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dionis</hi> agrees with <hi>Mery</hi> in the few Things he has ſaid, without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving made any material Addition; and <hi>Albinus</hi> has mentioned the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction of the <hi>Stone</hi> with the <hi>Forceps</hi> in very general Terms.</p>
            <p>As for the Care of the Patient after the Operation, and the Dreſſing of the Wound, both <hi>Buſſiere</hi> and <hi>Dionis</hi> inform us, that <hi>Frere Jacques</hi> neglected that almoſt entirely, or at leaſt left it to other People; and amongſt all the Operations that he perform'd in the Hoſpitals of <hi>Paris,</hi> I cannot learn from <hi>Mery</hi> that ever he applied the leaſt Thing to any Patient whatever.</p>
            <p>In the Compariſon which I have here made of <hi>Frere Jacques</hi> firſt Method of Cutting, I have taken care to point out the Miſtakes of the ſeveral Accounts we have of it, as far I could with any Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty conclude there were any to be found. As for the other Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars in which they diſagree, and about which I have not ventured to determine any Thing, it may very well be ſuppoſed that they have all of them a real Foundation; ſince it is more than probable, that at dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Times, and on different Subjects, the Monk may have operated different Ways.</p>
            <p>There is no room for ſuch a Compariſon of his Method of Cutting upon the <hi>Gripe;</hi> for beſides, that the only thing in which it differs from the Old Operation that goes under that Name, was in the Place where the Inciſion was begun, we have no particular Account of it but from Monſieur <hi>Mery,</hi> and that has been already ſet down.</p>

               <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> Judgments concerning <hi>Frere Jacques</hi> Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of Cutting Males.</head>
            <p>HAving now finiſhed the Hiſtory of <hi>Frere Jacques</hi> Operations for the <hi>Stone,</hi> and compar'd all the Parts of his Method of Cutting, as far as there is any thing to be met with in Authors about it; we are fully in a Condition to underſtand the Judgments that the ſame Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors have made concerning the Advantages and Inconveniencies that muſt attend it; together with the Reaſons upon which their ſeveral Deciſions have been founded.</p>
            <p>Monſieur <hi>Buſſiere,</hi> as has been already ſaid, was the firſt who ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured to publiſh his Thoughts about theſe Operations, firſt in the Name of his Correſpondent, and then in his own.</p>
            <p>His Friend's Opinion is, that <hi>Frere Jacques</hi> Way of Cutting is not ſo ſure as the ancient Way, by which he means that of <hi>Marianus;</hi> and that for theſe two Reaſons: Firſt, Becauſe the Point of the Knife not being directed by the <hi>Staff,</hi> he is always in danger of piercing all the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes of the Bladder through and through; and, Secondly, Becauſe the Place whereupon he maketh the Inciſion being full of conſiderable Veſſels, one can hardly avoid Cutting of ſome of them; and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly it was obſerved in almoſt all that died in his Hands, that there was a great deal of Blood in the Bladder, and in ſome in the Cavity of the <hi>Abdomen.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="36" facs="tcp:0153200400:42"/>
            <p>The Author goes on to illuſtrate theſe two Reaſons in this Manner: He ſucceedeth better when the <hi>Stone</hi> is big and large than when it is ſmall, by reaſon that a big <hi>Stone</hi> not only extendeth the Bladder, but it ſtoppeth the Point of the Knife. He did refuſe to Cut One, in whoſe Bladder there was but a ſmall <hi>Stone;</hi> which confirmeth me in the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that the Unſucceſsfulneſs of his Operations proceedeth from the Point of his Knife not being ſtopt neither by the <hi>Staff</hi> nor <hi>Stone;</hi> for when there is but a ſmall <hi>Stone,</hi> the Bladder being empty, he muſt neceſſarily cut the whole Bladder throughly, and conſequently cut ſome of its own Veſſels, which cauſeth the <hi>Hemorrhage,</hi> which is the better voided when the <hi>Stone</hi> is large.</p>
            <p>Thus far Monſieur <hi>Buſſiere</hi>'s Friend; and what he adds as his own Opinion is not much different, except in the Experiments he has made to prove how reaſonable it is. I cannot approve the Hermit's Way, ſays he, on all Occaſions; yet I think it might be ſucceſsfully improved (by which he can mean no more than that it might be uſed) in ſome particular Caſes. What theſe Caſes are, will appear by the Obſervations he made about it, after he had received his Friend's Account.</p>
            <p>I took a Body, continues he, in the Bladder of which I put a <hi>Stone;</hi> the <hi>Staff</hi> being in the Bladder, I did preſs it downwards hard enough as to be felt through the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ments, and made the Inciſion upon it in the Bent of the Thigh, in order to know whether it would not be a ſurer Way by ſecuring the Point of the Knife; by that Way I got my <hi>Conductor</hi> and <hi>Forceps</hi> into the Bladder, and drew the <hi>Stone</hi> very eaſily; but afterwards, by the Diſſection of the Body, I found that the Artery of the <hi>Penis</hi> and the <hi>Veſiculae Seminales</hi> were cut through and through; which cannot be avoided, becauſe the Artery and <hi>Veſiculae</hi> lie imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately under that Part of the Bladder which the <hi>Staff</hi> preſſeth upon.</p>
            <p>I took another Body, and having put in the Bladder a ſmall Stone, I made the Inciſion much lower, and pierced the Bladder under the <hi>Staff,</hi> by which Inciſion I drew the <hi>Stone;</hi> then diſſecting the Body I found the Bladder cut through and its Arteries, which can hardly be avoided, the Bladder being then ſo much contracted, that both Sides of the Bladder are cut, before the Operator either feels the <hi>Stone,</hi> or ſees any Urine running out.</p>
            <pb n="37" facs="tcp:0153200400:43"/>
            <p>I took a third Body, in the Bladder of which I put a very large <hi>Stone;</hi> the <hi>Staff</hi> being in it, I made the Inciſion upon the fat Protube<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rancy under the <hi>Iſchium</hi> Bone; and piercing the Bladder below the <hi>Staff,</hi> I found immediately the <hi>Stone</hi> with the Point of the Knife, with which I cut the Bladder the Length of an Inch; through which having intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the <hi>Conductor,</hi> and then the <hi>Forceps,</hi> I got hold of the <hi>Stone,</hi> and drew it out very eaſily. Then I did diſſect the Body, and found that neither the <hi>Veſiculae Seminales</hi> nor any Artery had been cut, by reaſon that the Weight of the Stone preſſed the Bottom of the Bladder lower than the <hi>Veſiculae</hi> and Arteries.</p>
            <p>Monſieur <hi>Buſſiere</hi>'s two firſt Experiments, we ſee, confirm his Friend's two Reaſons againſt this Method; and the third ſerves for a Foundation for his own Opinion in favour of it in ſome particular Caſes; that is, he thinks that this Way might be made uſe of when the <hi>Stone</hi> is very big, and willingly I would prefer it, ſays he, to the old Way; for by this Way we avoid that extraordinary and violent Dilatation of the Neck of the Bladder, which the <hi>Stone</hi> cauſeth when it is very big, and which is the Cauſe of the Inflammation and Mortification of the Bladder that killeth the Patient. But when the <hi>Stone</hi> is very ſmall, or but of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different Bigneſs, the old Way is eaſier and ſurer.</p>
            <p>Monſieur <hi>Buſſiere</hi> has given us his Judgment of <hi>Frere Jacques</hi> Method of Cutting on the <hi>Gripe</hi> likewiſe: I cannot approve, ſays he, the Cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting upon the <hi>Gripe;</hi> becauſe, in that Way one cutteth through the <hi>Proſtates,</hi> which deſtroys the Parts of Generation. I have obſerv'd, that all thoſe who have been Cut by that Method, were never fit for Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.(35)</p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Liſter</hi> was at <hi>Paris</hi> when <hi>Frere Jacques</hi> was there, and ſaw him frequently Cut. The principal Thing to be remarked in what he has ſaid about his Method, is the favourable Judgment he makes of it; and therefore I have choſen to inſert the whole Paſſage in this Place.</p>
            <p>Another popular Diſeaſe at <hi>Paris,</hi> ſays the Doctor, is the <hi>Stone,</hi> and there are Men well practis'd in the Cutting for it. There are alſo two
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0153200400:44"/>Hoſpitals where great Numbers are cut Yearly, <hi>La Charité</hi> and <hi>Hotel Dieu;</hi> but that which I ſhall here moſt inſiſt upon is the New Way practis'd by <hi>Pere Jacques,</hi> a Monk. About the 20th of <hi>April</hi> he Cut in the <hi>Hotel Dieu</hi> Ten in leſs than an Hour's time; the third Day after, all were hearty and without Pain but One.</p>
            <p>He Cuts both by the Great and Little <hi>Appareil;</hi> in both he boldly thruſts in a broad Launcet or Stilleto into the middle of the Muſcles of the Thigh near the <hi>Anus,</hi> till he joins the <hi>Catheter</hi> or <hi>Staff,</hi> or the <hi>Stone</hi> betwixt his Fingers; then he widens the Inciſion of the Bladder, in Proportion to the <hi>Stone,</hi> with a Silver Oval Hoop; it that will not do, he thruſts in his Four Fingers and tears it wider, then with the <hi>Ducks Bill</hi> he draws it out.</p>
            <p>I ſaw him cut a ſecond time in the <hi>Hotel Dieu,</hi> and he perform'd it upon Nine Perſons in Three Quarters of an Hour very dextrouſly. He ſeemed to venture at all, and put me into ſome Diſorder with the Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Operation, and a ſtouter <hi>Engliſhman</hi> than my ſelf; however, I viſited them all in their Beds, and found them more amaz'd than in Pain.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pere Jacques</hi> cut alſo his Way in the other Hoſpital <hi>La Charité,</hi> much about the ſame time, Eleven at twice. Here Monſieur <hi>Marechal,</hi> the beſt of the Surgeons now in <hi>Paris</hi> for this Operation, harangued againſt him before the Governours; who coldly anſwered, they would be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by the Event which Way was beſt.</p>
            <p>Of thoſe Cut at <hi>La Charité,</hi> One died; and being diſſected, it was found he had his Bladder pierced in four or five Places, alſo the <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culus Pſoas</hi> ſadly mangled, alſo the Left <hi>Veſiculae Seminales</hi> cut. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this, if this Method was well executed by a skilful Hand, it might be of good Uſe to Mankind.</p>
            <p>Since my Return I had a Letter from Mr. <hi>Probie,</hi> a very learned and induſtrious young Gentleman, who was with me to ſee the Operation; that Part relating to this Matter I ſhall here tranſcribe. Indeed, I
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0153200400:45"/>mightily long'd for an Account of this Matter, the Succeſs of which I came away too ſoon to learn any thing for certain.</p>

The Perſon that died was ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper'd, that he was not expected to live; and it was thought if he had not been Cut, he had not lived ſo long. The Surgeons have a great mind to cry down the Man, tho' they practiſe his Method; for <hi>Marechal</hi> has ſince Cut after <hi>Pere Jacques</hi> Manner, only with this Difference, that <hi>Marechal</hi>'s <hi>Catheter</hi> was canulated. <hi>La Rue,</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Surgeon of the <hi>Charité</hi> Hoſpital, Cut after the Old Manner, at the ſame time when <hi>Marechal</hi> Cut <hi>Pere Jacques</hi> Way, but had not ſo good Succeſs as <hi>Marechal</hi> had; for all that <hi>Marechal</hi> Cut are alive and well, whereas the other loſt One or Two of his Number; beſides, thoſe that lived were not ſo ſoon cured, no not by a Month or Six Weeks."</q> Thus far Mr. <hi>Probie.</hi>

            <p>I now go on to Monſieur <hi>Mery;</hi> and in relating the many Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions he has given us concerning <hi>Frere Jacques</hi> Operations, I ſhall obſerve this Order; firſt, to ſet down the Obſervations themſelves in the ſame Order of Time in which they were made; and Secondly, Make a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodical Extract of the Reaſonings and Concluſions he draws from them.</p>
            <p>What the firſt Experiments made by <hi>Frere Jacques</hi> furniſhed him with upon both theſe Heads, has been already taken Notice of. Upon diſſecting the Body of the Boy on which the ſecond Tryal was made, our Author obſerved, that the Monk had cut the <hi>Accelerator Muſcle,</hi> which remained untouched in the former; and that the Beginning of the <hi>Urethra,</hi> the Neck, and that Part of the Body of the Bladder which lies near the back Part of the <hi>Os Pubis,</hi> were ſo much torn as to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0153200400:46"/>entirely ſeparated from the reſt. Theſe Accidents he judged were to be imputed to the Tenderneſs of the Parts, the Largeneſs of the Monk's Finger which he thruſts into the Bladder, and the too great Length of his <hi>Staff;</hi> and from this we may probably infer, that he was not at that time provided with ſuch a <hi>Staff</hi> proper for Boys, as we are aſſured he afterwards made Uſe of. (36)</p>
            <p>The firſt living Perſon he Cut at <hi>Paris</hi> was a Woman. Out of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond he extracted Four or Five large <hi>Stones:</hi> The Patient loſt a great deal of Blood in the Operation, and three Days afterwards a very great <hi>Hemorrhage</hi> happen'd, the Blood coming out through the Wound, the <hi>Penis</hi> and <hi>Anus</hi> at the ſame time; which made it plain that the <hi>Inteſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num Rectum</hi> had been cut; and accordingly he voided two Worms by the Wound, and Excrements were found upon the Tents applied to it. He had afterwards a <hi>Fiſtula,</hi> and died about two Months after the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration, but his Body was never opened. (37)</p>
            <p>Of Three others which Monſieur <hi>Mery</hi> ſaw <hi>Frere Jacques</hi> Cut ſoon after, one died of an <hi>Hemorrhage</hi> in two or three Days; Another was afflicted with a Tumour in the Groin different from an <hi>Hernia,</hi> and an Incontinency of Urine, tho' his Wound was cicatriz'd; the Third our Author could hear nothing of. (38)</p>
            <p>The firſt Perſon that he cut upon the <hi>Gripe,</hi> died two Days after the Operation; and being opened, his Bladder was obſerved to be torn as with an Iron Comb, by the <hi>Forceps</hi> and <hi>Curette,</hi> which had been ſeveral times thruſt into the Wound. (39)</p>
            <p>The other Obſervations which Monſieur <hi>Mery</hi> has given us, were made on the Bodies of ſuch as <hi>Frere Jacques</hi> had Cut in the two Hoſpitals. The firſt dead Body he diſſected, was of a Man who died Five Days af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Operation; his <hi>Scrotum, Penis</hi> and Bladder were gangreen'd, and the Left <hi>Levator Ani</hi> cut according to the Direction of the Fibres. In the Bladder remained one Piece of <hi>Stone</hi> of the Size of a Man's Thumb, and another ſmaller which was lodged between the Membranes of it.</p>
            <pb n="41" facs="tcp:0153200400:47"/>
            <p>In the Second, the Inteſtines were all over inflamed, and ſome Parts of them gangren'd. The Cavity of the <hi>Abdomen</hi> was filled with a ſtink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſerous Matter, the thickeſt Parts of which glewed the Inteſtines to one another, and alſo to the Bladder, <hi>Peritonaeum</hi> and <hi>Meſentery.</hi> The Bladder itſelf was gangrened, and there was a Wound in the Bottom of it, by which the Cavity of it had a Communication with that of the <hi>Abdomen:</hi> This Wound was round, and conſequently in all Probability made with the <hi>Catheter.</hi> There was likewiſe a Wound in the Neck of the Bladder, on that Side which lies next the <hi>Rectum,</hi> two Inches deep and one broad, with a Bit of <hi>Stone</hi> ſtill ſticking in it.</p>
            <p>The Third Body had been Cut on the <hi>Gripe,</hi> and the Operator had begun his Inciſion an Inch and a half higher than in the reſt. The Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of the <hi>Abdomen</hi> was here likewiſe filled with a ſtinking pituitous Matter, which glewed the Inteſtines in the <hi>Hypogaſtrick Region</hi> to the Bladder, and they were alſo very much inflam'd. The Neck of the Bladder was quite ſeparated from the <hi>Urethra,</hi> and the whole Body of it inclining to a Gangrene. It was thicker and harder than ordinary, and between it and the <hi>Peritonaeum</hi> there was found a great Quantity of Urine and extravaſated Blood. The <hi>Inteſtinum Rectum</hi> was bruiſed and ſhat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd, and of a livid Colour.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mery</hi>'s Fourth Obſervations were made on Five Dead Bodies, Four of which had been Cut two Days before, the Other ſome time longer: But in this laſt the Lower Belly was ſo much corrupted, that it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for him to examine whence that terrible Diſorder proceeded. In the reſt he found the <hi>Urethra</hi> cut off from the Bladder, and the Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſeparated from the <hi>Os Pubis;</hi> ſo that the Nerves, Arteries and Veins of the <hi>Penis</hi> being by this means either broken or cut, there was a great Quantity of Blood between the <hi>Peritonaeum</hi> and the <hi>Viſcera</hi> of the <hi>Hypogaſtrick Region;</hi> the most Part of which were very much bruiſed. In one of theſe Bodies the Inteſtines were every where inflamed, and in ſome Places gangrened, the Cavity of the <hi>Abdomen</hi> being filled with <hi>Pus.</hi> In two others it was filled with a ſerous Matter dy'd with Blood. Four of theſe Patients, as Monſieur <hi>Mery</hi> was inform'd, had been Cut upon the <hi>Gripe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His Fifth Obſervations were made upon the Bodies of Six Children, ſome of whom had been Cut upon the <hi>Gripe,</hi> and others upon the <hi>Staff.</hi> In
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0153200400:48"/>all of them he found the Bladder ſeperated from the <hi>Urethra</hi> and <hi>Os Pubis,</hi> the Blood Veſſels of the <hi>Penis</hi> broken or cut, the <hi>Rectum</hi> and all the Parts thereabout bruiſed, becauſe the Monk had thruſt his Fingers into the <hi>Anus</hi> of them all. Moreover, in one of them the Bladder was cut with the <hi>Biſtoury,</hi> from the back to the fore Part; in another, from the Left Side to the Right near the Neck. He found likewiſe a great deal of extravaſated Blood; which, together with the Contuſion of the Parts, had produced in ſome of them Inflammations and Gangreens, in others conſiderable Abſceſſes, the Matter of which run out at the Wound.</p>
            <p>The next were made on the Body of a Boy between Thirteen and Fourteen Years of Age, whom <hi>Frere Jacques</hi> had Cut upon the <hi>Gripe.</hi> Beſides that, the Bladder was ſeparated from the <hi>Os Pubis,</hi> he found the <hi>Haemorroidal</hi> Arteries cut, which had produced an <hi>Haemorrhage</hi> at two different Times; and that, together with the Mortification of the Wound, were the chief Cauſes of his Death. What was further pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to this Operation was, that in puſhing his Knife towards the Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, <hi>Frere Jacques</hi> had open'd three different Paſſages, one at the lower Part of the <hi>Scrotum,</hi> the ſecond between the Bladder and the <hi>Rectum,</hi> the third between the <hi>Peritonaeum</hi> and the Outſide of the Bladder.</p>
            <p>The Seventh dead Body was of a Child, which had likewiſe been Cut upon the <hi>Gripe;</hi> the Cavity of the <hi>Omentum,</hi> as well as the <hi>Abdomen,</hi> was full of a ſerous ſtinking Matter, the Sediment of which had glewed the Inteſtines to the Bladder, and all of them were gangrened at the Place of their Union. The <hi>Rectum</hi> was livid, and that as well as the Bladder ſurrounded by a fetid Ulcer, the Matter of which run out at the Wound. In order to extract this <hi>Stone, Frere Jacques</hi> run his Knife from the Protuberance of the <hi>Iſchium,</hi> between the <hi>Rectum</hi> and <hi>Perito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeum,</hi> and entred the Body of the Bladder without touching either the Neck or <hi>Urethra,</hi> making a Wound about five Inches deep, which he could not do without Cutting a great Number of Blood Veſſels, and cruelly dilacerating the Parts.</p>
            <p>The Eighth Body was of a Child, who died near a Month after the Operation; but not having been opened, the only Obſervation that could be made was, that during all that Time the Wound continued open, and that the Urine came out that Way.</p>

            <p>The next Male Body was likewiſe of a young Boy, who died ſix Weeks after he had been Cut. The Wound remained ſtill open, and was of a very livid Colour. Between the <hi>Rectum, Os Sacrum</hi> and <hi>Perito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeum</hi> there was a fetid Ulcer, the Matter of which run out at the Wound; the Neck of the Bladder was parted from the <hi>Penis,</hi> and the Veſſels of the <hi>Penis</hi> cut. The <hi>Rectum</hi> was wounded and gangrened; and by this laſt Accident it appears, that this Child had been Cut upon the <hi>Gripe.</hi> The Cavity of the <hi>Hypogaſtrium</hi> was filled with a ſerous pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rulent Matter.</p>
            <p>The next Obſervations are taken from great Numbers of dead Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; and, in reſpect of the reſt, may well be called General Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. In Three Patients Cut by <hi>Frere Jacques,</hi> ſays our Author, Worms were ſeen to come out; in one through the Wound, in the other two through the <hi>Urethra;</hi> which makes it plain that the <hi>Inteſtinum Rectum</hi> had been Cut in all of them, and a Communication opened, in the firſt between that and the Wound, and in the reſt between it and the Bladder. Again, it was obſerved that moſt of his Patients died with Convulſions, and all of them with a greater Loſs of Blood than com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly happens to thoſe who are Cut the Old Way.</p>
            <p>The two laſt Obſervations were made on the ſame Body, partly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and partly after the Death of the Patient. About ſeven Weeks after he had been Cut, his Wound was looked upon to be in a very good State, but as far from being cloſed as at the Beginning: both Urine and a purulent glearious Matter, mixed with Gravel, continued to run through it, and the Patient was ſtill in a very weak Condition. In nine Weeks after he died, and his Body being opened, he was found to have a <hi>Fiſtula;</hi> the Entry thereof was very narrow, but farther in it was an Inch broad, and five Inches in Length, reaching from the Bent of the Buttock <hi>(Moignon de la feſſe)</hi> to the Neck of the Bladder, and from thence between the Body of it and the <hi>Rectum.</hi> Into the innermoſt Part of it run Matter from an Abſceſs which lay between the <hi>Os Sacrum</hi> and the <hi>Rectum.</hi> All the Parts contained in the <hi>Hypogaſtrium</hi> were very black; and as there is no room to doubt but that the firſt Cauſe of the <hi>Fiſtula</hi> was owing to the Inciſion, it is likewiſe probable, that before or after having cut that Part of the <hi>Urethra</hi> which joins to the Neck of the Bladder, he had loſt his Way; ſince the Body ot the <hi>Fiſtula</hi> lay between the Bladder and the <hi>Rectum,</hi> and ſince it was evidently impoſſible for him to make an Inciſion five Inches deep, without cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0153200400:50"/>many Veſſels, and alſo making the Parts ſuffer an extreme Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, in extracting the <hi>Stone;</hi> there is reaſon to think, that from theſe two Cauſes proceeded that Fluxion which produced the Abſceſs, the Matter of which had corrupted the Parts. (40)</p>
            <p>Theſe are the Obſervations which <hi>Mery</hi> has given us, concerning the Accidents which either attended or followed upon <hi>Frere Jacques</hi> Operation; and by ſeeing them all here at length, the Reader will not only have the Satisfaction of obſerving all the various Kinds of them, but likewiſe which of them happen'd moſt frequently, and in how many different Manners they were combined in different Subjects.</p>
            <p>What the Author has remarked in ſeveral Places, concerning the particular Parts cut in particular Operations, will ſerve to confirm and illuſtrate an Obſervation I have already made, That it is not always a Proof, that where the Accounts which have been given of <hi>Frere Jacques</hi> Methods of Cutting are different from one another, ſome of them muſt be falſe; ſince by the Inſtances our Author has here ſet down, it is evident, that in the Courſe of his Operations at <hi>Paris,</hi> he differed as much from himſelf as thoſe Accounts do from one another.</p>
            <p>I go on, in the next Place, to the Concluſions which Monſieur <hi>Mery</hi> has drawn from theſe Obſervations, as far as they relate either to the Operations themſelves, or to <hi>Frere Jacques</hi> as the Operator.</p>
            <p>To begin by the Operations: The firſt Concluſion concerning theſe, which I ſhall mention from Monſieur <hi>Mery,</hi> is, that in both <hi>Frere Jacques</hi> Methods of Cutting, it is a very difficult Matter not to ſeparate the Neck of the Bladder from the <hi>Urethra.</hi> This Propoſition he proves thus: That Part of the <hi>Urethra</hi> which is join'd to the Neck of the Bladder, being ſituated in the Angle formed by the Union of the <hi>Oſſa Pubis,</hi> and the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>at Part of the Inciſion Knife being laid to the Inſide of theſe Bones, and of the Protuberance of the <hi>Iſchium,</hi> it is impoſſible to reach the <hi>Urethra</hi> but in an Oblique Line; it muſt therefore neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily be cut obliquely: Accordingly when he uſed the Staff, he cut it half thorough, and conſequently deſtroy'd half its Force; wherefore the Reſiſtance of the <hi>Urethra</hi> being now weaker than the Effort which
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0153200400:51"/>he muſt make to draw the <hi>Stone</hi> through the Neck of the Bladder, which in this Caſe remains entire, the reſt of the <hi>Urethra</hi> is quite torn off and broken; to which this likewiſe very much conduces, that as he draws the <hi>Stone</hi> from above downwards in the Direction of the Wound, the Neck of the Bladder is forced out of the Direction of the Canal of the <hi>Urethra,</hi> and by this Means more eaſily ſeparated from it. The ſame Accident may likewiſe follow from the Violence he is obliged to uſe, in order to introduce either his <hi>Forceps</hi> or his Finger into the Bladder.</p>
            <p>When he cuts upon the <hi>Gripe,</hi> the Caſe is ſtill more evident; for as here in making the Inciſion, he has not the <hi>Staff</hi> to direct and reſiſt his Knife, the <hi>Urethra</hi> is liable to be cut quite through at once, as often as he meets with that Part of it which lies between the Inſide of the <hi>Os Pubis</hi> and the Neck of the Bladder; and to this, as we have ſeen, was owing the Death of many of the Children whom he cut this Way. (41)</p>
            <p>A Second Concluſion drawn by Monſieur <hi>Mery</hi> is, that it is almoſt impoſſible to prevent both Incontinency of Urine and Fiſtulas in <hi>Frere Jacques</hi> Ways of Operating. To prove this, our Author begins by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving, That in theſe Methods it is abſolutely neceſſary, that either the <hi>Urethra</hi> alone be cut, or the Neck of the Bladder alone, or the Body of it alone, or laſtly, the Neck and Body together. If the <hi>Urethra</hi> alone be cut, and be not torn afterwards from the Bladder, he thinks ſuch Patients may recover perfectly. If either the Neck of the Bladder alone, or the Neck and Body together are cut, it is evident that the <hi>Sphincter</hi> muſt be cut likewiſe; and as this Muſcle can never recover again its former Tone, an Incontinency of Urine muſt enſue, tho' the Wound be never ſo well cured. If the Body of the Bladder alone be cut, a Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtula is inevitable, which he thus proves: The Uſe of the <hi>Sphincter</hi> is to ſhut the Bladder, and hinder the Urine from running out, except when the Bladder being compreſſed by the Muſcles of the <hi>Abdomen,</hi> the Urine is by this means, and by the Elaſticity of its own Fibres driven towards the Neck of it, with a Force which is greater than the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of the <hi>Sphincter:</hi> But if when this Force is apply'd, at the time that the Bladder is wounded, the Reſiſtance will be leſs this Way than that which is made by the <hi>Sphincter,</hi> and conſequently the Urine muſt flow out at the Wound, by the Continuance of which a Fiſtula will be formed. (42)</p>
            <pb n="46" facs="tcp:0153200400:52"/>
            <p>Thirdly, The Incontinence of Urine and Fiſtulas which happen from this Way of Cutting are altogether incurable. Both theſe Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies, our Author obſerves, may attend the old Method; but then, as the Fibres of the <hi>Sphincter</hi> may not be quite deſtroyed, it is poſſible for them to contract again and recover their former Tone; whereas, when that Muſcle is cut quite through, this can never be hoped for. Fiſtulas likewiſe which are ſo ſituated, as that Cauſticks and other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Remedies may be applied to them, are curable; but in thoſe cauſed by <hi>Frere Jacques</hi> Method of Cutting, this is impoſſible. (43)</p>
            <p>In the next Place, the <hi>Staff</hi> which <hi>Frere Jacques</hi> makes Uſe of is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether inſufficient to guide the Point of his Knife, or hinder it from ſlipping, ſometimes to one Side, and ſometimes to the other. If his Knife paſſes the <hi>Staff</hi> towards the fore Side of the <hi>Os Pubis,</hi> it will be apt to enter the lower Part of the <hi>Scrotum;</hi> and by wounding the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, opens a Paſſage for the Blood amongſt the Membranes which have been cut: By this means Abſceſſes, Inflammations and Gangrenes in theſe Parts are produced. If the Point of the Knife runs in behind the <hi>Os Pubis,</hi> beſides the Accidents mentioned in the foregoing Concluſions, he is liable to wound the Bladder through and through; and by this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion Abſceſſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in all the Parts contained in the <hi>Hypogaſtrium.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, the Place in which <hi>Frere Jacques</hi> makes his Inciſion, expoſes him very often to wound the <hi>Inteſtinum Rectum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In fine, beſides the Convulſions, Haemorrhages, and other mortal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies which often happen upon his Cutting the Blood Veſſels of the <hi>Penis, &amp;c.</hi> if any of theſe Patients ſhould recover, they muſt be impotent all their Lives after. (44)</p>
            <p>This is the Sum of what Monſieur <hi>Mery</hi> has told us concerning the Inconveniencies which he thinks may be gathered from the Nature of <hi>Frere Jacques</hi> Operations, as well as from the Obſervations which Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience furniſhed him with. As for what relates to <hi>Frere Jacques</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as an Operator, it is but of very ſmall Importance for any body now a-days, to know wherein his particular Miſcarriages conſiſted: They may be in general reduced to theſe two Heads; his Ignorance of the Structure of the Parts, join'd to a Defect of Judgment, which he
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0153200400:53"/>diſcovered on many Occaſions; and Raſhneſs and Want of Attention in performing his Operations. To the laſt of theſe were owing the Wounds he often made in the Bladder with his <hi>Staff,</hi> and the different Paſſages by which he forced his Way into the <hi>Stone,</hi> with his Knife, Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, <hi>Forceps, &amp;c.</hi> in the ſame Perſon.</p>
            <p>Monſieur <hi>Mery</hi> has likewiſe made a Compariſon between <hi>Frere Jacques</hi> Method of Cutting, with what was commonly practis'd at that Time; but as all the Particulars, upon which that Compariſon is founded, have been partly already taken Notice of in this Hiſtory, and the reſt belong to that of <hi>Marianus,</hi> it would be a uſeleſs Repetition to inſiſt any further upon it.</p>
            <p>Before we leave Monſieur <hi>Mery</hi>'s Book, it will be proper to inſert that Part of the Letter mention'd to have been written to him from <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leans</hi> by Monſieur <hi>Noel,</hi> which contains the Hiſtory of the Operations <hi>Frere Jacques</hi> perform'd there.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Frere Jacques</hi> Way of Cutting, ſays Monſieur <hi>Noel,</hi> differs from that which is commonly in Uſe, only in the Place where the Inciſion is made; for inſtead of the Region of the <hi>Perinaeum,</hi> he begins his in the Fold of the Buttock, <hi>(ply de la feſſe)</hi> from thence he goes obliquely, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting his Knife as much as he can towards the Neck of the Bladder; but as the different Thickneſs of the Parts in different Subjects varies his Operation conſiderably, it is no wonder that the Inciſion is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in the ſame Place of the Bladder; eſpecially ſince it does dot ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that he has any certain Rule for this, but cuts ſometimes higher, ſometimes lower, ſometimes further back, ſometimes further forward: However, this new Operation never ſucceeds better than when, either by Chance, or by the Dexterity of the Operator, the Inciſion happens to be in the Neck of the Bladder.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Frere Jacques</hi> perform'd Eight Operations in this City, Five in the <hi>Hotel Dieu,</hi> and Three elſewhere. The Firſt was upon a Man of Fifty Years of Age, and both Phyſicians and Surgeons who were preſent aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured me that it was done with a great deal of Dexterity; the <hi>Stone</hi> was much of the Size and Figure of an Egg, and none that ſaw it doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the Succeſs.</p>
            <pb n="48" facs="tcp:0153200400:54"/>
            <p>However, Five or Six Days after the Patient was afflicted with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Haemorrhage, and on the Tenth with another; ſince that time he has felt extream Pains in the Region of the <hi>Perinaeum, Anus</hi> and <hi>Scrotum,</hi> cauſed by an Abſceſs in theſe Parts, which is at length broken by means of proper Remedies applied to it. It open'd in the lower Part of the <hi>Scrotum,</hi> and there came cut a great Quantity of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rulent Matter. Ever ſince, the Urine runs both that Way and through the Wound, tho' in a leſs degree than before. I have ſeen him dreſs'd ſeveral times; and by examining both Wounds, I find them diſpoſed to remain Fiſtulous. The Patient is in a very low Habit of Body, and in no Condition to undergo any further Tryals for a Cure.</p>
            <p>The Second Operation was on a Man of Sixty. It was very long and troubleſome; he loſt the <hi>Stone</hi> ſeveral times, and at laſt it broke. It was of an Oval Figure, and about the Size of a Pidgeon's Egg. When it was out, there was a Part of the Inner Membrane of the Bladder found ſtick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it; and another Portion of a Membrane followed it ſome time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in which ſome Gravel was wrapt up. The Inciſion, contrary to his uſual Cuſtom, was begun at the Extremity of the <hi>Scrotum,</hi> and from thence run obliquely towards the Fold of the Buttock. The Operator had no Inciſion Knife, but was obliged to make uſe of a Razor. Ever after the Operation, the Patient was troubled with the Hickup, a Looſeneſs, and a great Tenſion in the <hi>Abdomen.</hi> The <hi>Penis. Scrotum</hi> and <hi>Anus</hi> were bruiſed, and of a livid Colour almoſt like a Gangrene, which was prevented only by the Care and Skill of the Surgeon em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd. The Wound was always foul and rotten, notwithſtanding the ſtrongeſt Deterſives that could be applied. It reſembled the Mouch of a Lampray both in Figure and Colour, and the Patient complained of an exceſſive Heat in the <hi>Scrotum</hi> and End of the <hi>Penis,</hi> through which his Urine paſſed ſometimes, but with extream Pain; and it never ceaſed to come out at the Wound, which remained in ſuch a miſerable State, that his Death was not ſurpriſing to any. His Body, however, was not opened.</p>
            <p>The Third Perſon <hi>Frere Jacques</hi> Cut was Sixty Six Years of Age. He extracted two ſmoorh Oval <hi>Stones,</hi> both of them of the Size of an Egg. I was inform'd that this Operation was perform'd very dextrouſly, and in very little Time. The Inciſion was made lower than in the reſt, that is, at a greater Diſtance from the <hi>Scrotum.</hi> In Five or Six Weeks time the Patient was perfectly recovered. He has no Incontinency of
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0153200400:55"/>Urine, and it came through the Wound only for the firſt Eighteen or Twenty Days</p>
            <p>The Fourth Patient was about Eleven Years old, but his Wound is not as yet healed. What is particular in him is, that tho' ſome Urine ſtill continues to flow out at the Wound, yet the greateſt Quantity comes through the <hi>Penis,</hi> and not involuntarily neither. His Wound ſeems now to be in a very good Diſpoſition, if the Urine that runs that Way does not hinder the Cure.</p>
            <p>The Fifth was of the ſame Age, but he died the fourth or fifth Day after the Operation, with a Fever and Vomiting. This Operation was very troubleſome and violent; and upon opening the Body, we found that the Inciſion had been made on one Side of the Neck of the Bladder, ſome Part of the <hi>Sphincter,</hi> and a little of the Body being Cut. The Figure of the Wound was triangular, oblique and tranſverſe, it ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been made at different Times.</p>
            <p>The Sixth Patient was Cut upon the <hi>Gripe,</hi> and with a great deal of Eaſe. He extracted two <hi>Stones,</hi> both of the Bigneſs of a Walnut with the Husk on. The Thirty Fifth Day after the Operation the Urine began to come out the right Way; but the greateſt Part of it paſſes ſtill through the Wound, and in all Appearance it will remain Fiſtulous.</p>
            <p>The Seventh Operation was made on a young Man of Twenty Two Years of Age. <hi>Frere Jacques</hi> could neither find the <hi>Stone</hi> nor <hi>Staff</hi> with his Knife, which made it a long while before he could extract it. The Patient died in four Days with a high Fever and Vomiting; and when he was opened, we found the whole <hi>Sphincter</hi> Cut tranſverſely. (45)</p>
            <p>To this Place likewiſe may belong the Reflections which Monſieur <hi>Saviard</hi> has made upon <hi>Frere Jacques</hi> in Obſ. 109.</p>
            <p>On the 18th of <hi>July</hi> 1698 (it is printed by Miſtake 1696) I was ſent for to the Abby of St. <hi>Germain des Prez,</hi> together with Monſieur <hi>Jacque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mier</hi> Doctor of Phyſick, Monſieur <hi>Turſan</hi> Deputy (Lieutenant) to the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0153200400:56"/>King's Firſt Surgeon, Meſſ. <hi>Collot, Tolet</hi> and <hi>Coliguon</hi> Lithotomiſts, to examine the Wound of a <hi>Benedictine</hi> Monk, who had been Cut by an Operator nam'd <hi>Frere Jacques Beaulieu.</hi> We found the Patient ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly fallen away, with a ſlow Fever, which had continued upon him ever ſince the Operation. His Wound, which we were told had been corrupted, was then ruddy enough without any Hardneſs or Tumour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, but as wide open as the firſt Day it was made. We ſaw the Urine run out at it, together with a glairous purulent Matter, and a gravelly Sediment.</p>
            <p>It was our Opinion, that the Bladder was ulcerated, and that there were but little Hopes of his Recovery; we ordered what we thought proper, but he died the 21ſt of <hi>September</hi> following, the Wound re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining always open.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Frere Jacques</hi> was and is ſtill looked upon by ſome People as a very wonderful Operator, notwithſtanding all the Diſcoveries that have been made of his Miſcarriages; and that for four or five Reaſons, 1. Becauſe he Operates differently from the other Lithotomiſts. 2. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſhows a great deal of Courage in Cutting, and Aſſurance in bragging of his Feats. 3. Becauſe he appears to be diſintereſted. 4. Becauſe he wears a Religious Habit, and has a great Air of Devotion. 5. Becauſe he pretends to have received all that he knows in Surgery by Inſpiration; and as it coſt him nothing, ſo he is willing to teach other People <hi>gratis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe are the Foundations of his pretended Merit, and it is a very eaſy Matter to examine the Solidity of them.</p>
            <p>For in the firſt Place, what Inference can be drawn touching his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities from this, that he Cuts differently from other Lithotomiſts? He is not a bit the better Operator for that, except his Method were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable to the reſt, which it certainly is in no reſpect, except in killing a greater Number of Patients, as appeared by the Tryals made of it at the Hoſpitals.</p>
            <pb n="51" facs="tcp:0153200400:57"/>
            <p>Again, is he a better Operator, becauſe he is bold and forwards? No certainly: for though Aſſurance be very commendable in an Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator; yet ſtill it is to be looked upon only as a ſubordinate Talent, and preſuppoſes Knowledge and Skill, for otherwiſe it is pernicious; and that <hi>Frere Jaques</hi> was of this kind, is plain from the Number of Perſons who died under his Hands.</p>
            <p>His Readineſs to boaſt of the Cures he had performed, has always been looked upon as a Thing very unbecoming in any Body, but much more when founded upon Lyes and Falſhoods. This is <hi>Frere Jacques</hi> Caſe; for as ſoon as he arrived in <hi>Paris,</hi> he gave out, that by his New Method he cut without Pain; that his Patients would recover in much leſs Time than is uſual, and that without any Danger of a Fiſtula, or other Accidents: All this has been found to be falſe. His Method of Cutting is much oftner attended with Fiſtulas and Haemorrhagy than the others: He cauſes great Pains in Operating, and his Patients are a great while in recovering; his Boaſtings therefore ought rather to make him be deſpiſed and undervalued, than be looked upon as any Thing extraordinary.</p>
            <p>Can his Diſintereſtedneſs be reckoned a Proof of his Ability? This is, no doubt, a very commendable Quality in him, but he does not poſſeſs it in a greater Degree than the other Lithotomiſts, as far as the Poor are concerned; for all who Cut in the Hoſpitals do it <hi>gratis,</hi> and even to ſuch as are not there, there are very few who would refuſe their Aſſiſtance upon the ſame Terms, when it is needful: But I muſt own, if <hi>Frere Jacques</hi> pretends to extend his Charity to the Rich, he outdoes the reſt; but at the ſame time he exceeds the Bounds of his Duty, by a Zeal which, according to the Goſpel Phraſe, <hi>is not according to Knowledge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His Religious Habit and Air of Sanctity are but equivocal Signs. We are all uſed to ſee ſuch Dreſſes every Day, and therefore ought not to wonder at any Body who wears them: But with relation to <hi>Frere Jacques,</hi> the Wonder is this; how if he is really and truly a Monk his Superiours ſhould ever have ſent him on ſuch an unaccountable Errand, as to go all over the Kingdom, and Cut People of both Sexes for the <hi>Stone;</hi> which he cannot do without viewing Objects which muſt put that Chaſtity, of which he has made a Vow, to a very ſevere Tryal;
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0153200400:58"/>or, if he be not a Monk, but only wears the Habit, how the Church ſhould ſuffer ſuch a Diſguiſe, which muſt infallibly ſcandalize great Numbers of People.</p>
            <p>But the greateſt Wonder of all is, that <hi>Frere Jacques</hi> ſhould be eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an excellent Lithotomiſt, meerly upon Account of his Dreſs, as if that were ſufficient to give him more ſure and unerring Knowledge in Phyſick and Surgery, than the moſt famous Univerſities, the reading good Books, the Leſſons of the beſt Maſters, and a long Practice, can give to others.</p>
            <p>I doubt not but <hi>Frere Jacques</hi> Devotion has gained him the Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of many People; for this is a ready Way to lead People where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we have a Mind: But I doubt very much, if true Devotion can be conſiſtent with the viſible Prevarication which the Exerciſe of Surgery muſt engage him in, if he be truly a Monk, or with the Diſguiſe he puts on, if he is not.</p>
            <p>We have only now to examine, if he has obtained all that he knows in Surgery in a ſupernatural Way, as he gives it out himſelf. Now the ſureſt Means to judge of the Nature of a Cauſe, is by the Effects it produces: If therefore <hi>Frere Jacques</hi> is directed, and immediately inſpired by God in all he undertakes, he ought always to ſucceed; and in that Caſe he would certainly be the moſt excellent Litho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomiſt in the World. All that the others know, they are very ready to own comes to them, either from the Inſtruction of their Maſter, or their own Labour. But as every body muſt now be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced from what happen'd at both Hoſpitals, that <hi>Frere Jacques</hi> is leſs ſucceſsful than they, it is impoſſible to believe he is divinely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired, except it be by the evil Principle of the <hi>Manicheans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having thus enquired into the Reaſons of ſo many Peoples being prejudiced in Favour of <hi>Frere Jacques,</hi> I leave every Body to judge if theſe Prejudices be well founded, or ought not rather to be looked upon as Proofs of the Ignorance and Unskilfulneſs of this Religious Lithotomiſt.</p>
            <pb n="53" facs="tcp:0153200400:59"/>
            <p>As for the Propoſals he makes in the Publick <hi>Gazettes,</hi> to teach all Surgeons his Method <hi>gratis,</hi> it is the Magiſtrates Buſineſs to hinder theſe Offers from being accepted; becauſe as his Method is pernicious, it ought rather to be aboliſhed than perpetuated, whatever he may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, that he has corrected his firſt Method, that he has made good Uſe of the Advices given him in the Hoſpitals of <hi>Paris,</hi> and that he now uſes the ſame Inſtruments with the other Lithotomiſts; for all who are Judges muſt know, that in order to make him a good Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, 1. He ought to retain nothing which makes his Method differ from the Common, which is certainly much better. 2. He ought to lay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide a great deal of his Forwardneſs in operating, becauſe to that is owing the Temerity with which he thruſts in his Inſtruments to Places which he knows nothing of, from whence irreparable Diſorders enſue. 3. He ought to lay aſide the Opinion he has of himſelf, of being the beſt Lithotomiſt in the Kingdom; than which nothing can be more falſe, both becauſe his Method is bad, and becauſe he knows nothing of the Parts concerned, or to be ſhun'd in the Operation; neither has he any Tincture of Surgery, to enable him to remedy the Accidents which may befall his Patients. While he retains this Preſumption of his own Skill, it will be in vain to think of his making any Progreſs in the Art he profeſſes. 4. He ought to Cut for five or ſix Years in the Hoſpitals under able Maſters, who might direct him in his Operations, tell him of his Faults, and explain the Conſequences of them: For it is in this Manner that all the great Lithotomiſts in <hi>France</hi> have been formed; whereas <hi>Frere Jacques,</hi> while he continues to be fond of his own bad Method, intrepid in his Ignorance, obſtinate in his Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and preſumptuous to Exceſs, will never riſe above the Level of a Quack and a Vagabond.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dionis</hi> has made a great many Remarks on <hi>Frere Jacques</hi> Methods of Cutting Males, but none of them are new; and therefore it will be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, to ſat down here the Concluſion he draws from the whole Hiſtory of them. Tho' I do not approve of <hi>Frere Jacques</hi> Way of Cutting, ſays he, yet I do not abſolutely condemn it, for there is ſomething good in his Method; and I am perſwaded, that a Surgeon, who is a good Anatomiſt, knows how to guide his Inſtrument, and is ſo far Maſter of it as to carry it where he pleaſes, may ſucceed in the Practice of <hi>Frere Jacques</hi> Operation, by reaſon that he would avoid all thoſe pernicious Accidents which attended his Performance; but it would be to expoſe the Patient to too great Dangers to cauſe him to be Cut by that Monk, who being wholly ignorant of the Parts to be Cut, his
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0153200400:60"/>bold Aſſurance in thruſting in his Poynard proceeds only from the Want of a ſufficient Stock of Knowledge to foreſee the Conſequences. (46)</p>
            <p>This Judgment of <hi>Dionis</hi> is very different from that given by <hi>Mery. Mery</hi> pretends to prove from the Nature of the Method itſelf, that it ought to be quite laid aſide, as well as from the Character of the Monk, that he in particular ought never to uſe it. <hi>Dionis</hi> on the contrary is of Opinion, that the Inconveniencies that were found to attend it, were owing more to the Operator, than to the Nature of the Operation; tho' at the ſame time it muſt be own'd, that, take all his Words together, they amount to no more than this; <hi>Frere Jacques</hi> Operation may be practiſed with Succeſs by thoſe who are able to avoid whatever the Want of Succeſs in it is owing to.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Cheſelden,</hi> by ſuppoſing that <hi>Frere Jacques</hi> Operation was the ſame with <hi>Rau</hi>'s, and that <hi>Rau</hi> practis'd his with great Succeſs, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares ſufficiently what was his Opinion of it, notwithſtanding all the Inconveniencies which he had juſt before mentioned from <hi>Dionis.</hi> Theſe therefore he muſt have look'd upon to be all owing to the Operator; and thus his Judgment will coincide with that of <hi>Dionis,</hi> with this Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference only, that his he reckons to be confirmed by Matter of Fact, which the other does not pretend to. (47)</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Albinus</hi> conformably to the Deſcription we have heard from him of <hi>Frere Jacques</hi> Method, has given us his Opinion of it in theſe Words: This Way of Cutting, ſays he, could not well be more dangerous than either the making an Inciſion into the Neck of the Bladder, or into the <hi>Urethra:</hi> And as by this Means both theſe remained untouched and altogether free from the bad Conſequences which uſually attended the thruſting in of Inſtruments, the violent Dilatations, and the extract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of large rugged Stones in a moſt cruel Manner through ſuch narrow Paſſages, this Method ſeemed highly preferable to all the reſt. But on the other hand, as this Part of the Bladder lies altogether hid, it was a very difficult Matter to get at it; yet when this Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was rightly performed, no Part lay in the Way, of Conſequence enough to hinder the Succeſs of it.</p>
            <pb n="55" facs="tcp:0153200400:61"/>
            <p>The Danger and Difficulty of it conſiſted both in the Thickneſs of the Parts to be cut through, and the Nearneſs of ſome noble <hi>Viſcera,</hi> which were by all Means to be avoided; for if either the Surgeon ſhould happen to thruſt his Knife too far in, or too much to one Side, he runs the Riſque of Cutting the oppoſite Part of the Bladder, of hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Inteſtinum Rectum</hi> and <hi>Veſiculae Seminales,</hi> of wounding or Cutting quite through the <hi>Ureter, Erector Penis, Corpus Cavernoſum Majus,</hi> the <hi>Urethra</hi> it ſelf, and of other ſuch melancholly Accidents.</p>
            <p>Likewiſe after the Wound is made, it is an eaſy Matter to miſtake in introducing the <hi>Forceps,</hi> by thruſting it not into the Bladder, but amongſt ſome other Parts which it ought to have paſſed by, and thus open and dilate them, and pull out whatever came in its Way; which would not only fruſtrate the Deſign of the Operation, but bring on many other Inconveniencies. Such Accidents we have both heard and read to have happened to <hi>Frere Jacques,</hi> who neither knew the Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of the Parts, nor had any certain Method of guiding his Knife or <hi>Forceps;</hi> which laſt Mr. <hi>Rau</hi> looked upon to be the only Defect of his Operation.</p>
            <p>Wherefore we are ſo far from commending <hi>Frere Jacques</hi> Method of Cutting, that we are not afraid to aſſert the Practice of it to be highly pernicious and deſtructive to Mankind; and had it not ſerved as a Hint to lead <hi>Rau</hi> to the Diſcovery of the beſt of all Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods, it had better never have been heard of.

            <head>CHAP. IV. Frere Jaques <hi>Method of Cutting Females.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>WE have already mentioned, in ſeveral Places, that <hi>Frere Jacques</hi> Cut Women as well as Men; but we have delay'd till now, to give an Account wherein theſe two Operations differ'd, and the Judgment that has been made of this Part of his Method.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Buſſiere</hi>'s Friend tells us upon this Head, that <hi>Frere Jacques</hi> cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth Women upon the <hi>Staff,</hi> and in the ſame Place as Men. He did per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form this Operation, continues he, in my Preſence upon Three; One whereof was a Girl of Eleven Years old; which maketh me believe that he uſeth the ſame Way in all, tho' in them he did Cut the Internal Neck of the <hi>Uterus.</hi> His Opinion therefore is, that this Way of Cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting is not ſo ſure in Women, no more than in Men, as the Ancient Way.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Buſſiere</hi> ſubſcribes to his Correſpondent's Judgment: Tho' I have not tried this Way upon Women, ſays he, yet I cannot approve it at all, ſince one cannot avoid Cutting the Neck of the <hi>Uterus,</hi> the Cicatrix of which might prove to be of ſome ill Conſequence, in caſe the Woman ſhould come to be with Child. (49)</p>
            <p>One of the three Experiments which Monſieur <hi>Mery</hi> ſaw <hi>Frere Jacques</hi> make upon dead Bodies, was upon that of a Woman, and he has given us a particular Account of his Method of Operating. The Inciſion, he ſays, was made on the Right Side, near the Protuberance of the <hi>Iſchium,</hi> the ſame <hi>Staff</hi> he uſed for Men being firſt introduced into
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0153200400:63"/>the Bladder. It was about an Inch and an half long; and by meaſuring the Situation of it by the means of croſs Lines, he found that the lower Part of it anſwered to the <hi>Anus,</hi> the upper to the external Orifice of the <hi>Uterus,</hi> and the middle of it to the <hi>Raphè.</hi> The inward Progreſs of it was in this manner; After having paſſed about an Inch and an half of Fat, it went in betwixt the <hi>Levator Ani</hi> and the <hi>Accelerator</hi> of the <hi>Clitoris,</hi> cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting this Muſcle at its Origin, and from thence pierced the <hi>Vagina</hi> quite through, beginning at the Backſide of it, and thus reached the Body of the Bladder, which it wounded lengthways from the Beginning of the <hi>Urethra</hi> to the Inſertion of the <hi>Ureters,</hi> but without touching ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them. The Inciſion in the <hi>Vagina</hi> and in the Bladder were each of them an Inch long.</p>
            <p>Tho' <hi>Mery</hi> was at this Time as much prejudiced in favour of <hi>Frere Jacques,</hi> as he was afterwards againſt him, yet his Method of Cutting Women diſguſted him from the very firſt Moment he ſaw this Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. This appears from the Reflections which he ſubjoins to his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of it. If we judge, ſays he, of <hi>Frere Jacques</hi> Way of Operating upon Women, by the Structure of the Parts, and by the Inciſion which he makes in the <hi>Vagina</hi> and Body of the Bladder, I cannot believe th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> the <hi>Stone</hi> can be extracted in them with the ſame Eaſe and Advantages as in Men, if he always follows the ſame Methods in both, as I have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto ſeen him; I mean, if he begins his Inciſion on the Inſide of the <hi>Iſchium.</hi> For if we conſider that the <hi>Urethra</hi> in Women is but ſix Lines in length beyond the <hi>Os Pubis,</hi> that the Cavity is but a Line and an half in Diameter, and that it lies along the middle of the fore Part of the <hi>Vagina,</hi> which is two Inches broad, it will be eaſy to conceive that whatever Care <hi>Frere Jacques</hi> takes to put the <hi>Vagina</hi> out of his Way, and not to wound it, it will be very difficult for him to ſhun it, and almoſt impoſſible to get into the Bladder by the <hi>Urethra</hi> in the Way he takes, ſince it is ſo very ſhort and lies ſo cloſe to the <hi>Vagina.</hi> Since therefore the <hi>Stone</hi> cannot be extracted by this Method, without Cutting the Body of the Bladder, I cannot believe it leſs dangerous than the common Way of drawing the <hi>Stone</hi> through the <hi>Urethra.</hi> As an Incontinency of Urine moſt commonly happens in this Way, ſo in that uſed by <hi>Frere Jacques</hi> a Fiſtula of the Bladder into the <hi>Vagina</hi> appears to me inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; which; is at leaſt as great an Inconveniency, ſince the Urine flows equally involuntarily here. (50)</p>
            <pb n="58" facs="tcp:0153200400:64"/>
            <p>The living Bodies which <hi>Frere Jacques</hi> afterwards Cut, were but too evident Proofs of the Truth of the Reflections Monſieur <hi>Mery</hi> here makes. The firſt of theſe was Madam <hi>de Lorrain;</hi> he began the Inciſion two Inches higher than he did upon the dead Body, and pierced the <hi>Vagina</hi> quite through, as appeared by the Quantity of Blood which run out of it. What other Accidents followed upon this Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Monſieur <hi>Mery</hi> has not told us; but we may judge what they were by the Obſervations which he made on other Subjects. (51)</p>
            <p>On the 16th of <hi>May</hi> following, ſays he, <hi>Frere Jacques</hi> cut two Girls at the <hi>Hotel Dieu,</hi> one upon the <hi>Staff,</hi> and the other upon the <hi>Gripe.</hi> The youngeſt was but Four Years of Age, and went out of the Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal the 17th of <hi>June,</hi> the outward Wound being cured; but ſhe conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued to be troubled with an Incontinency of Urine. The other was Fourteen Years old, and went out the 25th of the ſame Month, in the ſame State with the other. Juſt as ſhe was to leave the Hoſpical, I was ſent for to examine the Cauſe of her Incontinency of Urine, and I found that it came partly through the <hi>Urethra,</hi> and partly through the <hi>Vagina.</hi> Another Surgeon that was there injected Barley Water through the <hi>Urethra</hi> into the Bladder, which preſently flowed out at the <hi>Vagina,</hi> by which we diſcovered, that tho' the exterior Wound all the Way to the <hi>Vagina</hi> was healed, the other Inciſion from the <hi>Vagina</hi> to the Bladder was ſtill open. (52)</p>
            <p>Now beſides the Incontinency of Urine which attends this Accident, there are other Conſequences no leſs terrible that muſt follow upon it, eſpecially if we take in the Danger there is in this Method, of falling into many of the ſame Inconveniencies which have been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready obſerved in Men. Women muſt by this means be rendered for ever barren, ſince the continual Flux of Urine into the Bladder muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily hinder the Action of the <hi>Semen;</hi> and as the <hi>Rectum</hi> may likewiſe be pierced, the groſs Excrements may come out the ſame Way at the ſame time. From theſe and ſuch like Obſervations, drawn partly from Experiments, and partly from the Analogy of the Structure of the Parts to be Cut in both Sexes, Monſieur <hi>Mery</hi> concludes, that <hi>Frere Jacques</hi> Way of Cutting Women ought upon no account whatever to be put in Practice. (53)</p>
            <pb n="59" facs="tcp:0153200400:65"/>
            <p>Of the Eight Patients which <hi>Frere Jacques</hi> cut at <hi>Orleans,</hi> One was a Girl between Ten and Twelve Years of Age, but ſhe died the Fourth Day after the Operation; and Monſieur <hi>Noel,</hi> in the foremention'd Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to <hi>Mery,</hi> has given us the following Relation of it: <hi>Frere Jacques</hi> ſet her upon the Knees of a Surgeon's Servant, and made two others hold her Thighs: He began by making a violent Preſſure upon the <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pogaſtrium,</hi> with his Fingers half bent, as if he had a mind to bring the Bottom of the Bladder nearer its Neck: Then he introduced a Silver <hi>Catheter</hi> into the Bladder, and pulled it out again as ſoon as he had drawn off the <hi>Urine</hi> contained in it. Afterwards he put his two Fingers into the <hi>Rectum</hi> to command the <hi>Stone,</hi> and ſo made his Inciſion in the ordinary Place, only a little higher; and directing his Knife towards the <hi>Stone,</hi> he cut the Bladder. This being done, he made ſeveral Motions in the Wound, ſometimes with his <hi>Forceps,</hi> ſometimes with his Scoop, preſſing a-new upon the <hi>Hypogaſtrium</hi> to bring down the <hi>Stone,</hi> but all to no purpoſe; so that at length he was obliged to thruſt his Fingers a ſecond time into the <hi>Anus,</hi> and to uſe his Knife once more, in order ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to make a new Inciſion, or enlarge the former. Thus, by keeping the <hi>Stone</hi> well down with his Fingers, after two or three Efforts, he at length extracted it with his <hi>Forceps.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Operation was no ſooner over, but the Patient began to be tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with Pains in her Belly, Fever and Vomiting, which never left her till ſhe died: Upon opening her Body, we plainly diſcerned that the Inciſion had been made in the Middle and membraneous Part of the Bladder; that it was tranſverſe and a little oblique, with three Angles obſervable in it, occaſion'd by his having Cut ſeveral Times. The Bladder and all the Parts near it were filled with <hi>Pus,</hi> and in many of them there were Abſceſſes formed. The lower Parts of the <hi>Abdomen,</hi> ſuch as the Pyramidal Muſcles and the Extremities of the <hi>Recti,</hi> were very much bruiſed, livid, and tending to a Gangrene, tho' there was no Blackneſs nor Swelling to be ſeen upon the Skin. (54)</p>
            <p>We are told by <hi>Dionis,</hi> that one of the four Patients which <hi>Frere Jacques</hi> cut in the <hi>Charité</hi> of <hi>Verſailles,</hi> was a Girl of Seven Years of Age, who died three Days after the Operation. <hi>Dionis</hi> opened her in Preſence of Monſieur <hi>Felix,</hi> one of <hi>Frere Jacques</hi> Patrons, and found the Bladder wounded in the Body near the Neck. In the <hi>Vagina</hi> there was a Wound of the Length of a Nail, made by the Edge of the Knife, in thruſting it along that Part to come at the Bladder: On this
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0153200400:66"/>Occaſion <hi>Frere Jacques</hi> ſaid, that the Wounds of the <hi>Vagina</hi> are of no Conſequence, and that he frequently happened to pierce it. (55)</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dionis</hi> ſaw him cut Two Women more, and in both the ſame Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents happened, as appeared by the Blood which came out at the <hi>Vagina</hi> as ſoon as the Inciſion was made. And he obſerves further, that the ſame thing fell out in almoſt all the Women he cut. (56)</p>

               <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> Monſieur <hi>Mery</hi>'s Method of Cutting for the Stone.</head>
            <p>THE Account which we have given from Authors, of <hi>Frere Jacques</hi> Operations for the <hi>Stone,</hi> is very far from being to their Advantage. The moſt favourable thing that has been ſaid of them, by any Body who was in a Condition to judge of their true Merit, is, that it is poſſible they may ſucceed when perform'd by a skilful Hand; and that ſome few Caſes may happen, in which they may perhaps be preferable to the ancient Methods. But Monſieur <hi>Mery,</hi> who has been at more Pains to examine them, than all the other Authors put together, declares him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf altogether againſt the Practice of them in any Caſe; not only on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the bad Succeſs they were attended with in the Hands of that ignorant inconſiderate Monk, but alſo by comparing the Structure of the Parts concerned with the Nature of the Operation itſelf, and from thence deducing the many grievous Accidents with which the Practice of them will moſt commonly, if not always, be attended.</p>
            <p>All this, however, is to be underſtood of theſe Operations taken by the Lump; for when they are pulled to Pieces, Monſieur <hi>Mery,</hi> even in the midſt of all his Declamations againſt them, cannot help ſeeing ſome Parts of them, which he thinks preferable to what anſwered to theſe in the former Methods of Operating. It was natural for a thinking Man to endeavour to bring ſuch valuable Parts into Practice, by joining to them, either from his own Invention, or what was already in Uſe, whatever he judged proper to compleat this whole Operation of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0153200400:68"/>the <hi>Stone,</hi> freed from all the Diſadvantages which <hi>Frere Jacques</hi> Methods, taken all together, ſeem'd to him to labour under.</p>
            <p>This is the general View, which not only Monſieur <hi>Mery,</hi> but all the other Improvers of them, propoſed to themſelves in their Improvements. What theſe have been, and by whom made, I now go on to relate; that is, to explain ſuch Methods of Cutting for the <hi>Stone,</hi> as differ from and were poſteriour to thoſe of <hi>Frere Jacques,</hi> but to the Diſcovery of which the Authors of them have been led by Hints taken from what they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in his.</p>
            <p>Of theſe Improvements, the firſt that I hear of were made by Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>Mery;</hi> but before I proceed to them, it will be neceſſary to ſay ſomething concerning this great Man's Life, by abridging the Eloge which the Elegant Monſieur <hi>Fontenelle</hi> has given us of him in the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moirs of the Academy of Sciences</hi> for the Year 1722. Printed in 1724.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>John Mery</hi> was born at <hi>Vatan,</hi> in the Province of <hi>Berry,</hi> the 6th Day of <hi>January</hi> 1645. His Father was a Surgeon; and after having ſent his Son for ſome Time to School, finding that, whether for Want of Inclination, or by the Fault of his Maſters, his Genius was not turned to Letters, he reſolved to bring him up to his own Buſineſs.</p>
            <p>At Eighteen Years of Age he went to <hi>Paris,</hi> to improve himſelf in the <hi>Hotel Dieu,</hi> the beſt School in the World for young Surgeons. There, not ſatisfied with the Exerciſes of the Day, he uſed as often as he had an Opportunity, to convey a Body out of the Hoſpital to his Lodging, and hide it in his Bed till he had Time to diſſect it.</p>
            <p>In 1681, he drew up a Deſcription of the Ear, at the Deſire of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>L'A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y,</hi> Doctor of Phyſick, to be inſerted in the Second Edition of his Book <hi>De L'A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e Senſitive.</hi> It was in that Year likewiſe, that he was made Surgeon to the Queen.</p>
            <p>In 1683, Monſieur <hi>Louvoy,</hi> then Firſt Miniſter of State, appointed him Surgeon Major to the Hoſpital of the Invalides.</p>
            <pb n="63" facs="tcp:0153200400:69"/>
            <p>The Year after, the King of <hi>Porlugal</hi> having deſited that a <hi>Pariſtan</hi> Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon might be ſent him, his Queen being indiſpoſed, Monſieur <hi>Mery</hi> was pitched upon as the propereſt Perſon to execute that Commiſſion. The Queen was dead before he reached <hi>Lisbon;</hi> but by the other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Cures which he performed during his Stay there, he gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Eſteem of the <hi>Portugueze</hi> ſo much, that they made him moſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous Offers, in caſe he would reſolve to ſettle among them. He had like Propoſals made to him in <hi>Spain,</hi> through which he paſſed; but he choſe to accept neither of them, but to return to his own Country, which he did timely enough in that ſame Year, to be admitted a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Royal Academy of Sciences, by the Recommendation of Monſieur <hi>de Louvois,</hi> and to be appointed Surgeon to the Duke of <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundy,</hi> then a Child, whom he accompany'd in a Journey the Court made to <hi>Chambort,</hi> a Royal Palace near <hi>Blois.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In 1692, he was ſent by the Court on a ſecret Commiſſion to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> and indeed it always remained ſo: for to this Day no Body can tell what he went about.</p>
            <p>In 1700, he arrived at the Heighth of his Ambition, being named by Monſieur <hi>Harlay,</hi> Firſt Preſident of <hi>Paris,</hi> to be Firſt Surgeon of the <hi>Hotel Dieu.</hi> The Functions of that Poſt, together with his Place in the Academy, took up his whole Time; no Conſiderations but Friendſhip could ever perſwade him after that, to practice in the City, or teach Anatomy to any but his Pupils in the Hoſpital; and it was by his Means that the Anatomical Theatre was erected there.</p>
            <p>His great Talent lay in the Exactneſs of his Obſervations. He thought it ſufficient for his Purpoſe, to ſee Things preciſely as they exiſted in Nature, without being often at Pains to build Syſtems upon the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> he had diſcover'd. When he ventur'd ſo far as that, he was convinc'd it was upon very ſure Grounds, and therefore was very ſtiff in maintaining his own Opinions. His Hypotheſis concerning the Circulation of the Blood in a <hi>Foetus,</hi> was an Inſtance of this; and his Defence thereof againſt the numerous Attacks that were made upon it, together with his Obſervations on the Methods of Cutting practiſed by <hi>Frere Jacques,</hi> a <hi>Francomtois,</hi> make up the only Book he ever publiſh'd. There are a great many Papers of his amongſt the Memoirs of the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0153200400:70"/>Academy; and he left behind him a vaſt Number of valuable Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Parts both of Men and other Animals.</p>
            <p>He applied himſelf much to the Knowledge of the Blood Veſſels and Nerves; but uſed to give it to his Friends, as an Inſtance of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection of Human Knowledge, that the Nature and Actions of the Fluids contained in them had not been diſcover'd. Anatomiſts, he told them, might be compared to Porters, who know all the Streets and Corners of a Town, but are intirely ignorant of what paſſes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Doors.</p>
            <p>They, who converſed much with him, attribute to him ſeveral Diſcoveries which paſs under other Peoples Names; of which the <hi>Glands</hi> aſcribed to Mr. <hi>Cowper,</hi> are one Inſtance.</p>
            <p>He died on the Third Day of <hi>November</hi> 1722, in the 78th Year of his Age, leaving Six Children behind him.</p>
            <p>It appears from the Reflections Monſieur <hi>Mery</hi> has given us on <hi>Frere Jacques</hi> Operations, that he had ſeen but very few of them, before he began to think of carrying them to a greater Perfection. It would be to no purpoſe, however, to trace all the Obſervations which lie ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd up and down his Book to this purpoſe; he having ſaved us that Trouble himſelf, by bringing them all under one View, in the laſt Chapter of that Treatiſe, in which we may ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> diſtinctly firſt, by what Steps he was led to the Improvem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nts he has made, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they conſiſt, and laſtly, what are the Advantages that he thinks may be expected from them.</p>
            <p>As to the firſt of theſe, he acquaints us, That ſince the principal Diſorders which appeared in the dead Bodies of ſuch Perſons as had been Cut upon the Staff by <hi>Frere Jacques,</hi> and which he had Opened, proceeded only from this, That his Staff being ſolid and round, it was impoſſible for him, with all the Steddineſs of Hand he was Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of, to guide the Point of his Knife upon the Convex Part of it ſo ſurely, as not to miſs it upon moſt Occaſions; One would be apt to think, that in order to rectify his Operation, and evite all the diſmal
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0153200400:71"/>Accidents that attended it, nothing ſhould be requiſite but to make uſe of a furrow'd <hi>Catheter;</hi> and to adjuſt the Length of it ſo exactly, as not to run the Riſque of piercing the Bottom of the Bladder, as he frequently did.</p>
            <p>But if we conſider further, (ſays our Author) that the only Caſes in which <hi>Frere Jacques</hi> extracts the <hi>Stone</hi> with more Facility than the other Lithotomiſts, are when he Cuts both the Neck and Body of the Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, which is the moſt aſtoniſhing Part of his Operations, and was the chief Thing that procured him the Liberty of Cutting in the two Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals; and if we conſider, on the other hand, that the wounding of theſe Parts is the evident Cauſe of the Incontinency of Urine and Fiſtulas, with which the moſt Part of thoſe who ſurvived his Operations were afflicted: When theſe two Things are attended to, I ſay, we will ſee that the Improvements I have mentioned are not ſufficient, but that it is moreover abſolutely neceſſary to abſtain from cutting the Neck and Body of the Bladder.</p>
            <p>Again, if we reflect, that the Reaſon why <hi>Frere Jacques</hi> ever wounds the <hi>Rectum,</hi> is only becauſe he begins his Inciſion too low down, and that the Opening of the Nerves and Blood Veſſels, from whence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded the Hemorrhages, Abſceſſes, and Convulſions, which carried off ſo many of his Patients, happen'd by thruſting his Knife too far for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; we muſt conclude, that it would be a much ſurer Way to begin the Inciſion in the <hi>Urethra,</hi> and end it at the Beginning of the Neck of the Bladder (<hi>al' eutrée du col de la Veſſie</hi>) which is very often dilated by the <hi>Stone,</hi> which the Contraction of the Fibres of the Body of the Bladder has forced into the Cavity of it.</p>
            <p>And therefore it is that I am inclined to think, that the greateſt Difficulty which the moſt expert Lithotomiſts find in extracting a <hi>Stone,</hi> proceeds more ſeldom from the Neck of the Bladder than from the <hi>Urethra;</hi> becauſe as they Cut the <hi>Urethra</hi> on the Fore-ſide of the (<hi>au devant</hi>) of the <hi>Oſſa Pubis,</hi> and the Neck of the Bladder lying behind theſe Bones, there remains at leaſt an Inch of the <hi>Urethra</hi> under that Angle formed by their Union, which is not cut, and through which the <hi>Stone</hi> muſt paſs; that is, by a Way which is narrower than the Neck of the Bladder; it is this therefore which muſt cauſe the Difficulty.</p>
            <pb n="66" facs="tcp:0153200400:72"/>
            <p>Upon theſe Principles our Author's Improvements are founded: Wherein they conſiſt, he goes on to explain in the following Manner.</p>
            <p>In order to rectify the ancient Operation, end that of <hi>Frere Jacques</hi> likewiſe, and evite the Accidents which either accompany or follow them; I believe it would be proper, the Patient firſt being placed and tied in the ordinary Manner, to begin by thruſting a furrowed <hi>Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> into the Bladder with the Right Hand, then to hold it with the Left, and turn that End of it towards the Right Groin, that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cave Part being directed to the Inſide of the Left <hi>Os Pubis,</hi> the Groove may lie a little obliquely. Afterwards taking in the Right Hand a crooked <hi>Biſtoury</hi> well fixed in the Handle, between Three and Four Inches long, Three Lines broad or thereabout, the Edge on the Convex Side, and ending in a very ſharp pointed Stilet, about an Inch in length, thruſt it directly into that Part of the Groove which lies in the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle made by the Junction of the <hi>Oſia Pubis;</hi> conduct the Stilet all the Way into the Neck of the Bladder (<hi>conduire le Stilet du Biſtouri dans le Col de la veſſie</hi>) the Point of it being kept firm in the Groove of the <hi>Catheter;</hi> then lowering the Hand, make the Inciſion down from the Neck of the Bladder, along the Inſide of the <hi>Os Pubis,</hi> all the Way to the Protuberance of the <hi>Iſchium.</hi> The Inciſion being made, introduce the <hi>Conductors</hi> or <hi>Gorgeret</hi> and <hi>Forceps</hi> in the ordinary Manner.</p>

                  </expan> in Veſicae Collum adigenda;</hi> by which it is plain, they conceived that the Neck of the Bladder was to be pierced by the <hi>Stilet,</hi> it being in that Senſe only that there could be any Force required, which is implied in the Word <hi>adigere:</hi> But this is very fat from being the Author's Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the principal Part of his Improvement conſiſts in leaving the Neck of the Bladder untouched; and by conducting the <hi>Stilet</hi> into the Neck of the Bladder, he underſtands no more than that as ſoon as the <hi>Stilet</hi> was in the <hi>Groove</hi> of the <hi>Staff,</hi> the Operator ſhould run it along that, all the Way into the Canal or Cavity of the Neck of the Bladder, which <hi>in collum veficae adigere</hi> can never be imagined to expreſs.</p>
            <p>The Patient muſt be made to lie upon the Right Side; becauſe by this Means the Urine not having ſo eaſy a Deſcent towards the Wound, will more readily be directed into its former Channel, which
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:0153200400:73"/>will very much facilitate the Re-union of the divided Parts; and the common Practice of Binding the Patients Thighs, near the Knees, muſt not be omitted.</p>
            <p>In this manner, according to Monſieur <hi>Mery,</hi> may the Operation for the <hi>Stone</hi> be improved; and the Benefit which will reſult there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from, he thinks, will be very conſiderable; for firſt, the <hi>Stone</hi> may be extracted with as much Facility as in <hi>Frere Jacques</hi> Method, without any Danger of the Accidents which attend it. Likewiſe the greateſt Part of thoſe Inconveniencies which accompany the common Operation will be evited, becauſe the <hi>Urethra</hi> will be cut all the Way to the Neck of the Bladder, without touching the Muſcles of the <hi>Penis,</hi> or wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any Part of the <hi>Scrotum,</hi> which is moſt commonly attended with Fluxions, Inflammations and Gangreen. Laſtly, by following this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, we ſhall never be under any Neceſſity of Cutting upon the <hi>Gripe,</hi> either Men or Children, except when the <hi>Stone</hi> is got into the <hi>Urethra,</hi> and ſticks out in the <hi>Perinaeum;</hi> and in that Caſe the common Way of performing this Operation ſuffers no Difficulty. (1)</p>
            <p>This is the Account that Monſieur <hi>Mery</hi> has given us of his own Method of Cutting Males, in order to extract the <hi>Stone;</hi> whether ever he put it in Practice or not is uncertain, but if we will be at pains to compare it with <hi>Marianus</hi>'s Operation and that of <hi>Frere Jacques</hi> both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, it will be found that what is new in it is only the Place in which he makes his Inciſion, and the Figure of his Knife: And if we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare it with each of theſe Methods by themſelves, it will deſerve ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be called an Improvement of that of <hi>Marianus,</hi> than of <hi>Frere Jacques;</hi> for, properly ſpeaking, it was the Place in which he obſerved this laſt to make his Inciſion, that led him to alter the Place where <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rianus</hi>'s Followers make theirs, and pitch upon a new one equally diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from both. The other Parts of Monſieur <hi>Mery</hi>'s Operation he has no manner of Title to; but ſtill, ſince the Merit of an Invention is only to be determined by its Uſefulneſs, did this ſmall Improvement rid his Operation of the Inconveniencies which the others are liable to, he might juſtly claim the ſame Share of Acknowledgment from Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, as if he had invented a Method entirely new.</p>
            <p>Monſieur <hi>Mery</hi> had no ſooner ſeen <hi>Frere Jacques</hi> make an Experiment of his Method upon the dead Body of a Woman, but he thought of
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0153200400:74"/>rectifying that Part of his Operation likewiſe: For having made the Reflections which have been already mentioned, concerning the Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies of it, he adds, That if it ſhould appear from Experience, that his Conjectures about theſe Inconveniencies were ill grounded, and that both the Wounds of the <hi>Vagina</hi> and Body of the Bladder are eaſily cured, he hath a Way to propoſe for Cutting of Women, which muſt ſtill be preferable to that of the Monk. His Method is this: Let a furrowed <hi>Catheter,</hi> ſuch as is commonly uſed for Men, be intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced into the Bladder, and with the Convex Part of it preſs down to the Entry of the external Orifice of the <hi>Uterus (a l'entrée de l'Orifice externe de la Matrice)</hi> that Part of the <hi>Vagina</hi> which lies under the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of the Body of the Bladder, and the Beginning of the <hi>Urethra</hi> which is joined to it; then cut that Part of the <hi>Vagina</hi> upon the <hi>Groove</hi> of the <hi>Staff;</hi> and thus it will be eaſy to get into the Bladder without hurting the <hi>Urethra,</hi> if the Inciſion is made but a very little Way up in the <hi>Vagina.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By this Method the <hi>Stone</hi> may be extracted out of the Bladder of a Woman with the ſame Advantages that <hi>Frere Jacques</hi> does it in Men; becauſe, as it muſt paſs through the <hi>Vagina,</hi> it will paſs out at the broadeſt Part of the Angle which is formed by the Union of the <hi>Oſſa Pubis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It may likewiſe be made uſe of in young Girls, and is undoubtedly more ſure and leſs painful than that uſed by <hi>Frere Jacques.</hi> The Wound made in the <hi>Vagina</hi> needs not be above Two Lines deep; whereas in his Method there muſt be ſeveral Inciſions, which taken all together, are at leaſt Three Inches deep; for he not only pierces the <hi>Vagina</hi> twice, but the Wound he makes from the Buttocks into it is altogether unneceſſary.</p>
            <p>This Method ſeems, moreover, to be better than that of Drawing the <hi>Stone</hi> through the <hi>Urethra,</hi> becauſe as both that and the <hi>Sphincter</hi> of the Bladder remain untouched, there is no Danger of an Incontinency of Urine, which moſt commonly follows the other. (2)</p>
            <p>The Suppoſitions upon which Monſieur <hi>Mery</hi> builds the Advantages of this new Method of Cutting Women, are, we ſee, that Wounds in the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0153200400:75"/>
               <hi>Vagina</hi> and in the Body of the Bladder may be cured; but tho' upon the Tryals he afterwards made on dead Bodies, he was fully ſatisfied how eaſily it might be put in Practice, yet the Obſervations he had oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to make of ſuch as had been Cut by <hi>Frere Jacques,</hi> convinced him at length that theſe Suppoſitions were falſe; and conſequently, that this Method, however improved, was altogether to be rejected. This he teſtifies in the following Words: As for <hi>Frere Jacques</hi> Way of Cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Women and young Girls, ſince there remains always a Fiſtula from the Bladder into the <hi>Vagina,</hi> it is evident that neither that, nor the Method in which I propoſed it to be amended, ought ever to be put in Practice: There is no other Way left but to draw the <hi>Stone</hi> through the <hi>Urethra;</hi> and tho' an Incontinency of Urine ſhould remain, it does not make them incapable of Conceiving, which is very much to be feared from that which proceede from a Fiſtula. (3)</p>
            <p>Before I take leave of Monſieur <hi>Mery.</hi> I cannot forbear remarking that ſomething very like the Way he here propos'd for Cutting of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men is mentioned by Monſieur <hi>Buſſiere;</hi> but as that Author had put it in Practice before <hi>Frere Jacques</hi> Operations were known to him, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be called an Improvement of theſe; and therefore I did not take Notice of it in that Place, which, as being publiſhed before that of Monſieur <hi>Mery,</hi> it would otherwiſe have deſerved.</p>
            <p>In Women, ſays Mr. <hi>Buſſiere,</hi> when the <hi>Stone</hi> is but indifferent big, the old Way is preferable to any other; but if it was very big, then I had rather thruſt my Finger into the <hi>Vegina,</hi> and bring the <hi>Stone</hi> as near the Neck of the Bladder as can be, and cut the Membranes of the <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gina</hi> and Bladder upon the <hi>Stone.</hi> I did Cut a Woman in <hi>Hambourgh</hi> by that Way, of which I drew a <hi>Stone</hi> weighing five Ounces and an half, who did recover very well. By this Way we did prevent the Inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency of Urine, which follows always the Extraction of great <hi>Stones</hi> in Women. (4)</p>

            <head>CHAP. VI. <hi>Profeſſor</hi> Rau<hi>'s Method.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THE next Improvement of <hi>Frere Jacques</hi> Operation for the <hi>Stone,</hi> was made by Mr. <hi>Rau</hi> in <hi>Holland:</hi> But before I lay before the Reader wherein it conſiſted, I think it neceſſary to make him a little acquainted with that great Man's Life, by a ſhort Abridgment of the elegant and faithful Account which the learned Profeſſor <hi>Albinus</hi> has lately publiſhed of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>John James Rau</hi> was born at <hi>Baden,</hi> a ſmall Town in the Circle of <hi>Suabia</hi> in the Year 1668. His Father was a Wine Merchant, and in ſuch indifferent Circumſtances, that he was obliged, as the beſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion he could make for his Son, to bind him Apprentice to a Surgeon in <hi>Strasburg,</hi> before he was full Fourteen Years of Age: There he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained Three Years; and in that Time thinking he knew enough of his Buſineſs to gain his Living in any Part of the World, he reſolved to bid adieu to his own Country, and try his Fortune ſomewhere elſe. After he had travelled through ſome Part of Germany, he went to <hi>Hamburgh,</hi> from thence to <hi>Norway,</hi> where he lived at <hi>Bergen</hi> with Mr. <hi>Franen</hi> the Surgeon, and ſoon after to <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> being unable to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the rigorous Cold of that Climate. At <hi>Amſterdam</hi> he had the good Luck to get to be Surgeon of a Man of War, in which he went to <hi>Spain</hi> and other Countries; and upon his return to <hi>Holland,</hi> he went on board the Vice-Admiral of that Fleet, which brought King <hi>William</hi> to <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="71" facs="tcp:0153200400:77"/>
            <p>During his Service at Sea, he found Means to ſave as much Money as enabled him to go to <hi>Leyden,</hi> and there ſtudy Phyſick for ſome Time; after which he went to <hi>Paris</hi> to improve himſelf in Anatomy and Surgery under <hi>Du Verney, Mery, Mareſchal, Roumart,</hi> Old <hi>Petit,</hi> and others. In 1694, he returned to <hi>Leyden,</hi> and there took his Degree of Doctor of Phyſick, being then but Twenty-ſix Years of Age.</p>
            <p>Being by this Time weary of a wandring Courſe of Life, he reſolv'd to ſettle at <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> and to teach Anatomy, and practice Phyſick and Surgery: He remained there ſomething more than Eighteen Years; but Two of them were not paſt before he had already acquired ſo great a Reputation in Anatomy, that the Magiſtrates of that City ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed him to diſſect in the publick Theatre. He was likewiſe ſo ſucceſsful in the Practice of Surgery, that he was ſent for all over <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> by thoſe who needed his Aſſiſtance, and for the Sake of no Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration ſo much as that of Cutting for the <hi>Stone,</hi> which he performed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on above Sixteen Hundred People, with the greateſt Applauſe, and equal Succeſs.</p>
            <p>In 1705, he was ſent for to <hi>Leyden,</hi> to give ſome Publick Leſſons of Anatomy; and in 1713, he was made Profeſſor of Phyſick, Anatomy, and Surgery, in that famous Univerſity, upon the Death of Doctor <hi>Bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loo.</hi> While he remained in Health, he was extremely diligent in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging the Functions of that honourable Profeſſion; but his Health abandoned him above Four Years before his Death, which happened in a very lamentable Manner on the 18th Day of <hi>September</hi> 1719. in the Fifty firſt Year of his Age.</p>
            <p>Beſides the Anatomical Treaſure which he bequeathed to this Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity, and of which we are obliged for a very ample and methodical Account to the Author of his Life, he left the World his Oration <hi>De Methodo Anatomen Docendi &amp; Diſcendi,</hi> pronounced on the Day of his Reception as Profeſſor at <hi>Leyden;</hi> a <hi>Latin</hi> Letter <hi>De Inventoribus Septi Scroti,</hi> and a Defence of it againſt Dr. <hi>Ruyſch;</hi> together with ſeveral Improvements both in Anatomy and Surgery, the Chief of which may be juſtly reckon'd the Diſcoveries he has made of the true Method of Cutting for the <hi>Stone.</hi>

            <p>Thus far concerning the Life of our famous Lithotomiſt; we go on now to the ſame <hi>Albinus</hi>'s Account of his Lithotomy.</p>
            <p>Amongſt the other Parts of Surgery which <hi>Rau</hi> had learned at <hi>Paris;</hi> the Operation for the <hi>Stone</hi> by what is called the great <hi>Apparatus</hi> was one, and it is certain, that for ſome time after he fixed at <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> he practis'd it in that manner himſelf; but upon ſeeing <hi>Frere Jacques</hi> Cut in <hi>Holland,</hi> and having examined the Bodies of many ſuch as died in that Monk's Hands, he from that Time changed his Method of Cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in the Manner which we are now to explain.</p>
            <p>Several Accounts have been publiſhed, and many more handed about concerning this Method of Profeſſor <hi>Rau,</hi> but all of them trifling, falſe, and imperfect; and had not the learned <hi>D. Albinus,</hi> who has often ſeen <hi>Rau</hi> Cut, and is a perfect Judge of theſe Matters, thought it worth his while to oblige the World with an accurate and particular Relation of all the Seeps of his Operation, we muſt have deſpaired of ever ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a true Knowledge of it.</p>
            <pb n="73" facs="tcp:0153200400:79"/>
            <p>I ſhall trouble the Reader but with Two of theſe Accounts, both of them printed; the firſt by a <hi>Saxon</hi> Phyſician; and the other, of which ſomething has already been ſaid, by Mr. <hi>Cheſelden.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We are told by the Phyſician, that in his Travels through <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> he arrived on a certain Time at <hi>Amſterdam;</hi> and being there reſolved to attend Dr. <hi>Rau</hi>'s Courſes of Anatomy and Surgery, amongſt other Curioſities he ſaw there, one was the Operation for the <hi>Stone</hi> perform'd by him.</p>
            <p>The 7th Day of <hi>February</hi> 1707, ſays the Traveller, I and Mr. <hi>Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> went with our Maſter <hi>Rau</hi> to <hi>Cromenic,</hi> a Village near <hi>Harlem,</hi> where a Boy was to be Cut; which was done in the Preſence of two Surgeons and Burghers of the ſaid Town. After the Body was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in a proper Poſture with his Arms bound, and his Poſteriours laid higher than his Head, and his Feet ſo tied, that the Part to be Cut could not be moved; Mr. <hi>Rau</hi> kneeling with one Knee upon the Table, ſets himſelf directly before the Patient, thruſting in a common <hi>Catheter</hi> moiſten'd with Oil into the Yard; at laſt meeting with the <hi>Stone,</hi> he withdraws that, and puts in another <hi>Catheter,</hi> ſo deep that he might feel it upon the <hi>Perinaeum</hi> with his Fingers; then he makes an Inciſion in the Left Side of the <hi>Perinaeum,</hi> four Fingers breadth from the Tuberoſity of the <hi>Os Iſchium,</hi> or Huckle Bone, and a Fingers breadth from the <hi>Anus,</hi> which Place of Inciſion the <hi>Catheter</hi> depreſſes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>Perinaeum.</hi> His Inciſion Knife was guarded a Thumbs breadth, looking like a common Launcet, which was not laid above the length of the firſt Joint of the Finger: Firſt he cut the Skin, and then making an Inciſion through the Fat and the Muſcles, he applied his <hi>Itinerary;</hi> after which he penetrated the Neck of the Bladder, then putting in the Penknife into the Wound, holding it ſtrongly with his Hand, he delivered it to me; but in the mean time ſnatched up his <hi>Forceps,</hi> and drawing out his Penknife, he thruſt it in betwixt the <hi>Iti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerary</hi> and <hi>Conductor,</hi> dilating the Lips of the Wound by thoſe two ſaid Inſtruments, by which means he happily drew our the <hi>Stone.</hi> When it was extracted it was of the Size of a little Hen's Egg, moiſten'd with Blood, and on one Side ſurrounded with a ſmall little Membrane, where perhaps it had an Adheſion to the Side of the Bladder. It was almoſt of a round Figure and uneven, like a large Sand or gretty Stone. Cleanſing the Wound with a Spunge, he applied nothing but a little Lint; and ſo binding up the Patient he put him to Bed, placing under his Buttocks ſome Oatmeal to receive the Urine, that would run from
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:0153200400:80"/>the Wound and the <hi>Faeces</hi> upon Occaſion. He ordered the Curtains of the Bed to be drawn cloſe, that the Light might not diſturb the Patient's Reſt, to compoſe whom he ordered an Anodyne Emulſion to be drunk <hi>ad Libitum.</hi> After the Operation, and the Sick being juſt laid upon the Bed, he cried out of exquiſite Pains in the <hi>Glans</hi> of the Yard, when the <hi>Stone</hi> was taken away, which happens by Conſent; in all which the Membrane of the <hi>Urethra</hi> has with the inward Membrane of the Bladder.</p>
            <p>On the 7th of <hi>March,</hi> I ſaw another Lithotomy or Operation for the <hi>Stone</hi> performed by my Maſter on a <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Boy of Seven Years old; in which, beſides what I have already told you, nothing particular hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, except the falling down of the <hi>Inteſtinum Rectum,</hi> occaſioned by the Cries of the Patient; which lubricating with Oil he put up again with his Fingers, leaſt it ſhould hinder him in his Operation.</p>
            <p>By comparing this Account of <hi>Rau</hi>'s Operation with that which is given by <hi>Albinus,</hi> it will be very eaſy to ſee how full it is of Miſtakes, that is, how much it is of a-piece with all the reſt of this Author's Book.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Cheſelden</hi> makes <hi>Rau</hi>'s Method to be the ſame with that of <hi>Frere Jacques;</hi>for after tranſcribing ſome few Things from <hi>Dionis</hi> about that, he tells us, that the late Mr. <hi>Rau,</hi> Profeſſor of Anatomy at <hi>Leyden,</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd it afterwards in <hi>Holland,</hi> Cutting exactly between the Entrance of the <hi>Ureters,</hi> and with great Succeſs.</p>
            <p>It is not a little ſurprizing how Mr. <hi>Cheſelden,</hi> who is ſo perfectly well acquainted with the true Structure of theſe Parts of the Body, came to let himſelf be ſo groſly impos'd upon by the Perſon that gave him this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of <hi>Rau</hi>'s Operation, which the leaſt Reflection muſt have convinced him to be falſe and impoſſible, as ſhall be preſently ſhown. What he has added, is I believe very juſt; at leaſt it deſerves the Attention of all ſuch as ſhall ever undertake the Practice of Mr. <hi>Rau</hi>'s Operation. In my Opinion, ſays he, this Way of Cutting exceeds the two former, (that is, the greater and leſſer <hi>Apparatus</hi>) and would be yet better, if the Bladder was filled with Water before the Operation.</p>
            <p>Theſe, and many other ſuch as theſe Accounts, have been given of Mr. <hi>Rau</hi>'s Method of Cutting for the <hi>Stone;</hi> and I have only ſet down
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:0153200400:81"/>two Samples of them, to ſhow what need there was of a more exact and compleat Explanation of an Operation, which the Succeſs wherewith it was attended muſt recommend to our moſt ſerious Thoughts. This the ingenious Dr. <hi>Albinus</hi> has fully executed in the Manner which we now proceed to ſhow.</p>
            <p>After having explained the Method of Cutting uſed by <hi>Frere Jacques,</hi> and given his Opinion of it, which as we have already ſeen, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes with this Obſervation, That it had better never have been heard of, had it not ſerved as a Hint to lead <hi>Rau</hi> to the Diſcovery of his: He goes on to inform us, that <hi>Rau</hi> having fully examined the Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture and Situation of theſe Parts, which are either to be cut or ſhun'd in this Operation, diſcovered the only Defect of <hi>Frere Jacques</hi> Method to be the Want of ſome Way whereby the Inſtruments might be ſafely and ſecurely directed towards the proper Place of the Bladder. This he alſo found out, and uſed it with the greateſt Succeſs. It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not therefore be deny'd but that <hi>Frere Jacques</hi> ſhewed <hi>Rau</hi> the Way; for this, however, he ought always to be praiſed and valued, that by his own Skill and Induſtry he made that Addition to the Operation, by which alone it is rendered ſure and ſafe, and preferable to all that have hitherto been invented, whereas before, it was dangerous, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain, and oftentimes fatal.</p>
            <p>His Addition conſiſted in a <hi>Catheter</hi> furrowed or grooved on the Convex Side, which he thruſt through the <hi>Urethra</hi> into the Bladder, that Convex Side preſſing againſt the Part of it which was to be Cut, ſo as to be felt without; and by this Means ſerving to direct him in making the Wound in the Skin, in thruſting in the Knife, ſo as to cut the Bladder upon it, and in introducing the other Inſtruments which guide the <hi>Forceps</hi> ſtrait into the Wound, as was practiſed in the great <hi>Apparatus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But as the Common <hi>Catheters</hi> made Uſe of by thoſe who cut the <hi>Urethra</hi> in the <hi>Perinaeum,</hi> are for the moſt part too little bent to be able to preſs ſufficiently againſt the proper Place of the Bladder, he invented a new one, different from the others; firſt, in that where the crooked Part, and conſequently the <hi>Groove</hi> begins, the <hi>Curvature</hi> was greater, and alſo in that the <hi>Roſtrum</hi> or Beek at the other Extremity of the crooked Part was ſtraiter and longer, that the Knife might be at
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:0153200400:82"/>more Liberty to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>un both Ways upon it, and ſo make a large Wound in the Bladder. The Compariſon of the Structure of theſe Parts in the humane Body, with what was to be done in the Operation, ſeem to have led him to theſe Things.</p>
            <p>He placed the Patient, ty'd him, and ordered him to be held almoſt in the fame Manner as they who cut the <hi>Urethra</hi> in the <hi>Perinaeum;</hi> except that he laid him upon his Back on a low Table, in ſuch a Manner as that his Back was lower than his Buttocks, for the more convenient Situation of the Part to be cut.</p>
            <p>Then he kneeled down before the Patient upon his Right Knee, his Left Leg being erect, and making an acute Angle with the Thigh, the better to ſupport his Body.</p>
            <p>Next laying hold of the <hi>Penis</hi> with his Left Hand, with his Right he thruſt the <hi>Catheter</hi> artfully into the Bladder.</p>
            <p>Then taking the Handle of the <hi>Catheter</hi> between the Fingers and Thumb of his Left Hand, he turned it gently and warily towards the Patient's Belly and right Groin, that the furrowed Convex Side there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of might be apply'd to that Part that was to be Cut; that is, as has been already ſaid, to the Left Side near the Neck, and ſomething to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the lower and back Part.</p>
            <p>This being done, he preſſed the <hi>Catheter</hi> gently towards that Part, and at the ſame time put his Right Thumb upon the ſoft Place of the Buttocks, on the Left Side of the <hi>Anus,</hi> between that and the great Protuberance of the <hi>Os Iſchium,</hi> upon which we ſit, juſt oppoſite to the Convex Part of the <hi>Catheter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then preſſing the <hi>Catheter</hi> gently towards his Right Thumb, and at the ſame time his Right Thumb towards the <hi>Catheter,</hi> from the Left and lower Parts to the Right and upwards, he diſcovered and marked the exact Place on the Out-ſide which was oppoſite to the Convex Part of the <hi>Catheter,</hi> for there the Inciſion was to be begun.</p>
            <pb n="77" facs="tcp:0153200400:83"/>
            <p>This Place was on the Left Side of the <hi>Anus,</hi> about an Inch, or two Fingers breadth from that, towards the Protuberance of the <hi>Iſchium.</hi> He choſe it no nearer the <hi>Anus,</hi> for fear of hurting the <hi>Inteſtinum Rectum;</hi> and no further from it, that he might not be obliged to thruſt the Knife too obliquely towards the <hi>Catheter:</hi> However, according to the Difference of Age and Stature, Structure, and Largeneſs of theſe Parts, he cut the Skin ſometimes nearer the <hi>Anus,</hi> ſometimes farther from it, and ſometimes a little higher or lower; but the Convex Pare of the <hi>Catheter,</hi> which preſs'd upon the Bladder, always directed him to the Place.</p>
            <p>This being diſcovered, he began by Cutting through the Skin and a ſmall Part of the Fat. He made the Wound ſtrait and long, from above downwards, and a little inclined outwards towards the Protu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berance of the <hi>Iſchium,</hi> to keep farther from the <hi>Inteſtinum Rectum.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this firſt Inciſion, however, he was not very ſollicitous.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as it was made, he thruſt into it that Part of his Right Thumb or Fore-Finger, which is oppoſite to the Nail, to feel the <hi>Staff,</hi> which he kept with his Left Hand apply'd to that Part of the Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which he was to cut, with all poſſible Steddineſs.</p>
            <p>When he had found the <hi>Staff</hi> he pulled back his Thumb, and thruſt the Point of his Knife immediately into the Wound, not very deep at firſt; and directing it with all the Caution he could towards the <hi>Staff,</hi> he cut gently all that came in his Way: And for fear of wounding the <hi>Inteſtinum Rectum,</hi> he moſt commonly firſt thruſt his Finger into the <hi>Anus,</hi> to examine the Situation of it preciſely, that ſo he might be able to ſhun it with the greater Certainty.</p>
            <p>When by theſe gentle Steps his Knife had got almoſt to the Bladder, he thruſt his Thumb or Fore-Finger again into the Wound to feel for the <hi>Catheter</hi> as before, to replace it, if by any Motion of the Patient it had changed its Situation, and alſo to remind himſelf of the Poſition of the Convex Part of it, upon which he was immediately to cut the Bladder.</p>
            <p>In doing this he uſed more Caution and Circumſpection than before: He firſt begged of the Aſſiſtants not to let the Patient move any Part, eſpecially his Buttocks, and of the Patient himſelf to keep as quiet as poſſible; then holding the <hi>Catheter</hi> fixed in its Place with the Left
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:0153200400:84"/>Hand, with the other he approached the Knife towards it, through the Wound, without making any further Inciſion, but only carefully direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Point. This done he thruſt it into the Groove of the <hi>Catheter</hi> with all the Attention and Warineſs he was Maſter of: And it was eaſy for him to know when he was right, by the Point of his Knife preſſing upon the Bottom of the Groove, and upon the Sides of it when he moved it gently either Way.</p>
            <p>Then carrying the Knife along the Groove both upwards and down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, but moſtly downwards, and favouring the Motions of it by the Poſition of the <hi>Catheter,</hi> he made a pretty large Wound in the Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. The Situation of the <hi>Staff</hi> made the Inciſion incline a little from above outwards, and the Security of the Neighbouring Parts made it neceſſary it ſhould do ſo.</p>
            <p>He continued to take Care that the <hi>Staff</hi> ſhould not ſlip from the Wound, and with his Fingers examined the Largeneſs of it, feeling at the ſame Time for the naked <hi>Catheter,</hi> it he had any Suſpicion that it was out of its Place; for it was neceſſary that the Groove ſhould be cloſe to the Inciſion, that he might with the more Security thruſt the Male <hi>Conductor</hi> into it.</p>
            <p>Therefore having again deſired the Patient to lie ſtill, he took the Male <hi>Conductor</hi> into his Right Hand, and puſhed it carefully and ſteddily through the Wound towards the <hi>Catheter;</hi> and after ſome few Tryals, fixed it in the <hi>Sulcus</hi> without any thing being intercepted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, which it was eaſy to judge, both by the Reſiſtance and Hardneſs of the <hi>Staff.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When he was aſſured of this, he puſhed the <hi>Conductor</hi> with more Force, and thruſt back the <hi>Staff,</hi> drawing the Handle of it gently to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him at the ſame time.</p>
            <p>By this Means the Convex Part of it retired from the Wound into the Cavity of the Bladder, and the <hi>Conductor</hi> remaining ſtill in the <hi>Sulcus</hi> was ſafely guided thither likewiſe; and by moving it gently up and down, he diſcovered either by its touching the naked <hi>Staff</hi> or the <hi>Stone,</hi> that it was really in the Cavity of the Bladder where he wanted it to be.</p>
            <pb n="79" facs="tcp:0153200400:85"/>
            <p>The other Parts of this Operation were performed as by the great <hi>Apparatus;</hi> for with his Right Hand he kept the Male <hi>Conductor</hi> in the Bladder, and with his Left drew the <hi>Catheter</hi> out through the <hi>Urethra.</hi> Then he took the Male <hi>Conductor</hi> into his Left Hand, and upon that directed the Female into the Bladder with his Right; afterwards hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the two <hi>Conductors</hi> at a ſufficient Diſtance with his Left Fingers, he thruſt the <hi>Forceps</hi> between them into the Bladder with his other Hand, and preſently drew out the Female <hi>Conductor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then he felt with the <hi>Forceps</hi> for the <hi>Stone,</hi> that he might be ſure that Inſtrument had not miſſed its Way, but was really within the Bladder, and afterwards drew out his Male <hi>Conductor</hi> likewiſe.</p>
            <p>He uſed to open the <hi>Forceps</hi> with a conſiderable Force ſeveral times to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, both to dilate the Wound and Bladder, and looſen it as much as he could from the <hi>Stone.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When this was done, he ſearched for, laid hold of, and extracted the <hi>Stone</hi> with the <hi>Forceps,</hi> with all the ſame Precautions which they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly do, and always ought to uſe, who perform this Operation by Cutting the <hi>Urethra</hi> in the <hi>Perinaeum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As ſoon as one <hi>Stone</hi> was taken out, he thruſt other Inſtruments into the Bladder, to diſcover if there were any more behind; and with a proper Scoop, and very often with his Fore-Finger, he brought away any ſmall Bits of Stones, Sand or clotted Blood, and then the Patient was laid in a Bed upon his Back.</p>
            <p>He put neither Tent, Plaiſter nor Bandage upon the Wound, but kept it open for ſome Days after the Operation; and in the mean time ordered the Patient as much Ptiſane or weak Emulſion as he could drink; that the Urine flowing firſt copiouſly into the Bladder, might waſh it throughly, and then running out at the Wound, might carry along with it the Sand, Blood, or whatever elſe might remain. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards he cured the Wound, as other freſh Wounds uſually are.</p>
            <p>With how great Dexterity, and in how ſhort a Time he always per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed this Operation, there are innumerable Witneſſes to teſtify; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong whom I could name ſeveral Perſons of Probity, Learning and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, who are ſtill alive. How well and how ſucceſsfully he operated, the Event afterwards proved; for the far greateſt Part not only ſurvived the Operation, and did very well after it, but recovered in an incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſhort Time ſo perfectly, as never to be afflicted with a Fiſtula, invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:0153200400:86"/>Flux of Urine, Barrenneſs, or any other Accidents which ſo oftend attend thoſe in whom the Urinary Paſſages have been Cut.</p>
            <p>And tho' this Method may ſeem more difficult to be put in Practice upon Women; yet even theſe he Cut the ſame Way, provided they were Maids, or had never had Children: neither are there Inſtances wanting of his Succeſs among ſuch as had.</p>
            <p>This excellent Account has Dr. <hi>Albinus</hi> given us of <hi>Rau</hi>'s Method of Cutting for the <hi>Stone,</hi> in which he has omitted nothing that can any Way contribute to its being fully underſtood, if it is not that he has ſet down no Obſervations made on the Bodies of ſuch as died before the Wound was cured; by which we ſhould have had a more certain Account of all the Parts cut, than is to be found in this Relation at preſent.</p>
            <p>But now, if we compare a little this Method with all thoſe that went before it, it will be found to contain nothing of any Conſequence that can be called New, except the extraordinary Skill and Dexterity of the Operator, and his cautious, prudent and attentive Manner of Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. It is to theſe Things only, that is owing any Difference to be obſerved in either his Inſtruments, or the ſeveral Steps of his Operation; which Differences deſerve not ſo much to be call'd New Inventions, as the making the beſt Uſe of what was already invented. The principal Thing wherein his Way of Cutting differs from that of <hi>Marianus,</hi> is in the Place in which he makes his Inciſion; but this his Hiſtorian owns to be the ſame with that where <hi>Frere Jacques</hi> made his; tho', as I have ſufficiently proved, that Monk's Deſign was to make it in another Place. Again, he differs from <hi>Frere Jacques</hi> Methods in the Inſtruments he uſes, and the manner of uſing them; but all this he took from the great <hi>Apparatus,</hi> except the ſtrait <hi>Roſtrum</hi> of his <hi>Staff,</hi> as <hi>Mery</hi> had done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him; tho' I do not think it at all probable that he had ſeen <hi>Mery</hi>'s Book, before he had compoſed the Theory of his own Operation. Mr. <hi>Rau</hi>'s principal Merit therefore conſiſts in having made a judicious Collection of the Parts of ſeveral Methods, which were attended with the greateſt Advantages and leaſt Inconveniencies, and framing theſe into one Regular Operation, which in his Hands has been perhaps more ſucceſsful than any hitherto diſcovered; but whether it will continue ſo to be, if brought into Practice a-new, muſt be left to Experience and Time to determine.</p>

            <head>POSTSCRIPT.</head>
            <p>IN the Beginning of the foregoing Chapter, I obſerved that tho' ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Accounts of Profeſſor <hi>Rau</hi>'s Operation for the <hi>Stone</hi> have been publiſhed, and many more handed about by thoſe who pretend to have ſeen him Cut, yet they are all both imperfect and full of Miſtakes; and that it is entirely owing to the learned and accurate Dr. <hi>Albinus,</hi> that this great Man's Method was not for ever loſt to Poſterity.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as the Doctor's Book was publiſhed at <hi>Leyden,</hi> he did me the Honour, amongſt ſeveral of his ingenious Friends here in <hi>London,</hi> to ſend it me in a Preſent; and at the next Meeting of the Royal Society, I thought proper to lay before them an Abſtract in <hi>Engliſh</hi> of that Part of it which relates to Mr. <hi>Rau</hi>'s Operation for the <hi>Stone;</hi> together with ſeveral Preparations, from which I demonſtrated and deſcribed the Parts concerned in it.</p>
            <p>Theſe Preparations I have had now a good many Years by me: They make part of a compleat Collection that I have made, by which all the poſſible Ways of getting in to the Humane Bladder, in order to extract a <hi>Stone,</hi> may with the greateſt Clearneſs be illuſtrated; and the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages and Inconveniencies of each of them, as far as theſe depend on the Structure of the Parts, with the greateſt Certainty deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined.</p>
            <p>Of theſe Ways, I always reckoned that practis'd by Profeſſor <hi>Rau</hi> to be one, long before I had heard any thing of his true Method, or even, of that of <hi>Frere Jacques,</hi> from which it is taken; and indeed, my Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations will ſerve to direct in every Step of his Operation, and point
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:0153200400:88"/>out the Parts that are either to be Cut or avoided in it, as fully as if I had had <hi>Albinus</hi>'s Book before me when I went about them. And I will venture to ſay, that the Examination of ſuch Preparations as theſe, when freſh Subjects cannot be had, which every Surgeon and Anatomiſt muſt know is too often the Caſe with us, is the ſureſt and eaſieſt Way to enable us to underſtand, and make the right Uſe of what has been written upon the Subject of <hi>Lithotomy,</hi> which of late Years has made ſo much Noiſe in our Phyiſical World.</p>
            <p>But to return from this ſhort Digreſſion: If I may judge by the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, what I then offered to the Royal Society was by many Members of that Honourable Body thought no unſuitable Entertainment for them; for from that Time ſeveral worthy Phyſicians and Surgeons, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving carefully read <hi>Albinus</hi>'s Book, and examined my Preparations, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to think ſeriouſly of introducing the Practice of it amongſt us. And I moſt willingly embrace this Opportunity of doing Juſtice to the ingenious Dr. <hi>Bamber</hi> and Mr. <hi>Cheſelden,</hi> by declaring in a publick manner, (what I had many Opportunities of knowing, having aſſiſted at moſt of the Experiments they made on dead Bodies) that as it was their Turn to Cut in the two great Hoſpitals of this City the following Seaſon; I beheld with the utmoſt Pleaſure, the Alacrity, Induſtry and Application with which they ſoon made themſelves Maſters, each in the Way that ſuited his Genius beſt, of the true Method of performing an Operation, which they thought they had all the Reaſons that Theory could furniſh, to prefer even to the high Way of Cutting, which both of them had for a conſiderable Time practis'd with great Succeſs.</p>
            <p>On the 7th Day of laſt <hi>Auguſt,</hi> Dr. <hi>Bamber</hi> made the firſt Tryal of it on living Bodies in St. <hi>Bartholomew</hi>'s Hoſpital, and ſince that Time he has made ſeveral more. In all theſe Operations he has thought it proper to follow every Step of Mr. <hi>Rau</hi>'s Method, except that he filled the Bladder moderately with Water; and therefore, as his Dexterity and Skill in every Operation he goes about are ſufficiently known, there remains no more to be ſaid about them; ſave only, that as far as can be judged from the Number he has Cut, his Succeſs is hitherto at leaſt equal to that of Mr. <hi>Rau.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="83" facs="tcp:0153200400:89"/>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Cheſelden</hi> began to Cut in St. <hi>Thomas</hi>'s Hoſpital a few Days after Dr. <hi>Bamber;</hi> but as he has thought fit to vary Profeſſor <hi>Rau</hi>'s Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod conſiderably, I muſt beg leave to inſiſt a little more on his Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>I have already mention'd an Account of <hi>Rau</hi>'s Method given by Mr. <hi>Cheſelden,</hi> in the Preface to his Treatiſe on the High Operation for the <hi>Stone,</hi> publiſhed 1723, as he had received it from thoſe who had been Scholars to Mr. <hi>Rau,</hi> and ſeveral times preſent at his Operations. His Informations were indeed very lame and imperfect; but yet, even from theſe, he had conceived ſo favourable an Idea of that Method, as to think it preferable either to that of <hi>Celſus</hi> or <hi>Marianus;</hi> and withal, that it would be ſtill more ſo, <hi>if the Bladder was firſt filled with Water.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Albinus</hi>'s late Treatiſe has, as I have already remarked, given this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious and moſt expert Surgeon an Opportunity of examining the whole Matter with more Clearneſs and Certainty than he had done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; and the Fruit of the Pains he has been at, is not only to confirm him in his former favourable Opinion of it, but alſo to bring it to ſuch a degree of Perfection, as in his Judgment makes it preferable to all the Methods of Cutting that have ever been invented.</p>
            <p>Now, as Mr. <hi>Cheſelden</hi>'s Method muſt be reckon'd an Improvement of that firſt attempted by <hi>Frere Jacques,</hi> a Deſcription of it, ſuch as a Spectator is able to give, does even upon that Account very well deſerve a Place in the Hiſtory I have ventured to write of the <hi>Lateral Operation for the Stone:</hi> And if, in what I ſhall ſay about it, I ſhall happen to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake or omit any material Circumſtance, I wiſh that may ſerve as an Inducement to the happy Improver to rectify and compleat whatever is amiſs or wanting in mine, by obliging the Publick himſelf with a more accurate and full Account of his own Operation.</p>
            <p>The Table upon which the Patient is placed is higheſt at that End upon which his Buttocks reſt; and by means of a Pillow laid under him there, and another under his Head when he lies upon his Back, his Belly is lower than any other Part of his Body.</p>
            <pb n="84" facs="tcp:0153200400:90"/>
            <p>His Buttocks are placed upon the Edge of the Table, and his Knees being ſeparated from one another, and bent as much as they can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently, his Wriſts and Ancles are tied together; and he is kept in that Situation by three Aſſiſtants, One at each Leg, and a Third at his Head; who preſſes with his two Hands upon the Patient's Shoulders, to keep him from retiring backward from the Operator.</p>
            <p>The Patient being brought from his Bed in a Night-Gown, and ſituated in this Manner, the Operator thruſts an hollow grooved Steel <hi>Catheter,</hi> through the <hi>Urethra</hi> into the Bladder; and with a Syringe mounted with an Ox's <hi>Ureter,</hi> injects as much warm Water into it as the Patient can bear without Pain, in the ſame Manner as is done in the High Operation. Into one Patient of about Eighteen Years of Age, and who had a Stone weighing Six Ounces and a Quarter, Mr. <hi>Cheſelden</hi> injected Seven Ounces of Water; but he thinks the Quantity may always be determined by the Complaints of the Patient without obſerving any other Rule.</p>
            <p>When the Water is injected, and ſecured from running out, by tying round the <hi>Penis</hi> a narrow Slip of Flannel, he gives the End of the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theter</hi> to an intelligent Aſſiſtant to hold; whoſe principal Care is to keep it from riſing, but not at all to direct the Groove to the Place where the Inciſion is to be made, for a Reaſon that we ſhall hear pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently.</p>
            <p>Then the Operator having feared himſelf upon a Chair, the Heighth of which is ſuitable to that of the Table on which the Patient is laid, takes a pointed Knife with a Convex Edge, and beginning about an Inch above the <hi>Anus,</hi> on the Left Side of the <hi>Raphe,</hi> between the <hi>Accelerator Urinae,</hi> or as I name that Muſcle, <hi>Conſtrictor Urethrae,</hi> and the <hi>Erector Penis,</hi> he makes an Inciſion downwards by the Side of the <hi>Sphincter Ani,</hi> a little obliquely outwards as it deſcends from Two and an Half to Four Inches in Length, according to the Age of the Patient, or Size and Structure of the Parts. This firſt Inciſion he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to make all at one Stroke, ſo as to cut through the Skin, Fat and all, or Part of the <hi>Levator A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <pb n="85" facs="tcp:0153200400:91"/>
            <p>As ſoon as this is done, he thruſts the Fore-Finger of his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 span">

               </gap> into the Middle of the Wound, in order to preſs the <hi>Inteſtinum Rectum</hi> to one Side, that it may be in leſs Danger of being Cut; and taking a crooked Knife in his other Hand, with the Edge on the Concave Side, he thruſts the Point of it through the Wound cloſe by his Finger into the Bladder, between the <hi>Veſicula Seminalis</hi> and <hi>Os Iſchium</hi> of the ſame Side; then lowering his Hand, he continues this ſecond Inciſion up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, till the Point of his Knife comes out at the upper Part of the firſt.</p>
            <p>This Inciſion being finiſhed, he thruſts the Fore-Finger of his Left Hand through the Wound into the Cavity of the Bladder; and having f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lt. It and ſecured the <hi>Stone,</hi> he introduces his <hi>Forceps</hi> upon his Finger, and endeavours to lay faſt hold of the <hi>Stone</hi> with it; then he pulls out his Finger, and taking the <hi>Forceps</hi> in both Hands, he extracts the <hi>Stone</hi> with greater or leſs Facility, according to the Size thereof, or Largeneſs of the Wound he has made.</p>
            <p>If there are more <hi>Stones</hi> than one, he feels for the reſt with his Finger, then introduces his <hi>Forceps,</hi> and extracts them in the ſame manner.</p>
            <p>During the whole Operation, the <hi>Catheter</hi> remains in the Bladder; and all that the Aſſiſtant who holds it has to mind is, as has been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſaid, to keep it from riſing. By this means Mr. <hi>Cheſelden</hi> thinks the Bladder is preſſed down ſufficiently to facilitate the Entry of the <hi>Forceps</hi> upon his Finger without the Uſe of any Director; and it being filled with Water, there is no occaſion to Cut upon a <hi>Groove;</hi> neither is there any danger of laying hold of the <hi>Catheter</hi> with the <hi>Forceps,</hi> if due Care is taken to manage that rightly after it is in the Bladder.</p>
            <p>In this Method of Operating there are but one or two Arterial Branches cut, from which there is any Danger of an Haemorrhagy, and not always from them neither: However, if after the Wound is well cleanſed and waſhed with a wetted Spunge, any Quantity of Blood continues to run, he ties the Veſſels immediately; and then having ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied Pledgets of dry Lint and other proper Dreſſings, the Patient is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards carried to Bed.</p>

               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 span">

               </gap> regular Method of Cutting; and when <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Accident happens, which it was impoſſible to be aware of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Operation, he has been ſeldom above a Minute (ſometimes leſs) between the Beginning of the firſt Inciſion and Extraction of the <hi>Stone.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are Circumſtances, however, in which he finds it neceſſary to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ary ſome Steps of his Method. Theſe, as far as I have been Witneſs to, or can remember them, are as follows:</p>
            <p>Firſt, When having laid hold of the <hi>Stone</hi> with the <hi>Forceps,</hi> he finds by the Force it takes to draw it out, or other Signs, that it is very large, rather than expoſe the Patient to the Danger and Pain of a violent Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aceration of the Parts, he chuſes either with a Pair of Sciſſars, if it is the upper Part, or his Knife if the lower, to enlarge the Wound by an additional Inciſion.</p>
            <p>Secondly, If after the ſecond Inciſion is made, he finds by the Finger which he endeavours to thruſt into the Bladder, that the <hi>Catheter</hi> has ſlip'd into the Wound, which, by the ſtraining of the Patient and other Accidents, ſometimes happens; then he withdraws his Finger, and inſtead thereof thruſts a <hi>Gorgeret</hi> into the <hi>Groove</hi> of the <hi>Catheter,</hi> upon which he introduces his <hi>Forceps</hi> in the ordinary Manner. It is only with a View to this Accident, that he prefers a grooved <hi>Catheter</hi> to one entirely round, ſuch as was uſed by <hi>Frere Jacques.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, When the Aſſiſtant, who holds the <hi>Catheter,</hi> gives him any ground to think that he his laid hold of that with the <hi>Forceps</hi> inſtead of the <hi>Stone;</hi> which, tho' he believes it will rarely happen, yet is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible; be orders it immediately to be pulled out, and then endeavours to lay hold of and extract the <hi>Stone</hi> without that Conveniency which the pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſſing down of the Bladder would afford him, if he ſhould be obliged to introduce his <hi>Forceps</hi> oftner than once.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, When by the Smallneſs or Situation of the <hi>Stone,</hi> he finds this Method to be ea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> or more ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>fe, he thruſts his Fingers into the <hi>Anus;</hi> and having preſs'd the <hi>Stone</hi> towards the Orifice of the Wound,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:0153200400:93"/>he pulls it out with his other Hand, without uſing any <hi>Forceps</hi> at all.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, When he feels, either by his Finger, or the Reſiſtance the <hi>Stone</hi> makes to the Force with which he ſtrives to draw it out, that there is any kind of Conſtriction, either of the Ureters or Membranes of the Bladder about it, he endeavours by thruſting his Fingers into the <hi>Anus,</hi> or other proper Methods, to bring that Part near the Orifice of the Wound; and then with his Knife he cuts theſe Membranes which had formed the <hi>Sphincter;</hi> and thus the <hi>Stone</hi> being diſengaged is extracted with the greateſt Eaſe.</p>
            <p>As I have here deſcribed Mr. <hi>Cheſelden</hi>'s new Operation nearly in the ſame Order that <hi>Albinus</hi> has followed in that of Mr. <hi>Rau,</hi> it will be eaſy for the Reader to perceive what Additions or Alterations are owing to him, or, in one Word, what Improvements he has made; ſo that it would be altogether ſuperfluous to lengthen this <hi>Poſtſcript</hi> any further, by comparing them together.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Cheſelden</hi> has hitherto Cut but Seven Patients this Way that I know of; and whoever has heard of the wonderful Succeſs which at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended his Practice of the High Operation, will have but little room to doubt of the happy Event of his preſent Method, in which even theſe firſt Tryals have ſucceeded equally, if not beyond whatever he could boaſt of in the former.</p>
            <p>To conclude: Were I not afraid of being thought to paſs the Bounds I preſcribed to my ſelf in this Hiſtory, of only relating and comparing Facts together, without interpoſing my own Judgment, I might add, that in my Opinion there is nothing wanting in Mr. <hi>Cheſelden</hi>'s Method of performing the <hi>Lateral Operation,</hi> by which it can in any reſpect be improved, except the Uſe of crooked <hi>Forceps</hi> upon ſome Occaſions; for I have frequently obſerved at both Hoſpitals, that the <hi>Stone</hi> is much more eaſily extracted, when it lies on that Side of the Bladder in which the Inciſion is made, then when it lies on the other, eſpecially if the Cavity to be obſerved there, is of a preternatural Depth or Breadth, as it ſometimes happens. Therefore when this is the Caſe, I am of Opinion that if the <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceps</hi> were a little crooked, the <hi>Stone</hi> might with leſs Difficulty be laid
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:0153200400:94"/>hold of, than by the ſtrait ones which have been hitherto uſed. It is true, that crooked <hi>Forceps</hi> will be weaker than the others; but the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in Strength would be more than compenſated by the Facility of charging the <hi>Stone;</hi> becauſe in this, rather than in the Force neceſſary to extract it when laid hold of, the Inconveniency I am talking about ſeems to conſiſt.</p>
