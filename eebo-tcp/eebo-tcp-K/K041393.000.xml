            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A DISCOURSE ON THE PINDARIQUE ODE.</head>
            <p>THE following Ode is an Attempt towards reſtoring the Regularity of the Ancient Lyrick Poetry, which ſeems to be altogether forgotten or unknown by our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Writers.</p>
            <p>There is nothing more frequent among us, than a ſort of Poems intituled Pinda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rique Odes; pretending to be written in Imitation of the Manner and Stile of <hi>Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar,</hi> and yet I do not know that there is to this Day extant in our Language, one Ode contriv'd after his Model. What Idea can an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Reader have of <hi>Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar,</hi> (to whoſe Mouth, when a Child, the Bees<note n="a" place="bottom">Pauſan. Boeotic.</note> brought their Honey, in Omen of the future Sweetneſs and Melody of his Songs) when he ſhall ſee ſuch rumbling and grating Papers of Verſes, pretending to be Copies of his Works?</p>
            <p>The Character of theſe late Pindariques, is a Bundle of rambling incoherent Thoughts, expreſs'd in a like parcel of irregular Stanza's, which alſo conſiſt of ſuch another Complication of diſproportion'd, uncertain and perplex'd Verſes and Rhimes. And I appeal to any Reader, if this is not the Condition in which theſe Titular Odes appear.</p>
            <p>On the contrary, there is nothing more regular than the Odes of <hi>Pindar,</hi> both as to the exact Obſervation of the Meaſures and Numbers of his Stanza's and Verſes, and the perpetual Coherence of his Thoughts. For tho' his Digreſſions are frequent, and his Tranſitions ſudden, yet is there ever ſome ſecret Connexion, which tho' not always appearing to the Eye, never fails to communicate it ſelf to the Underſtanding of the Reader.</p>
            <p>The Liberty which he took in his Numbers, and which has been ſo miſunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood and miſapply'd by his pretended Imitators, was only in varying the Stanza's in different Odes; but in each particular Ode they are ever Correſpondent one to another in their Turns, and according to the Order of the Ode.</p>
            <p>All the Odes of <hi>Pindar</hi> are Songs of Triumph, Victory or Succeſs in the <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi> Games: They were ſung by a Chorus, and adapted to the <hi>Lyre,</hi> and ſometimes
<pb facs="tcp:0562401200:3"/>
to the <hi>Lyre</hi> and <note n="b" place="bottom">

               <hi>Pipe;</hi> they conſiſted oftneſt of Three Stanza's, the firſt was call'd the <hi>Strophé,</hi> from the Verſion or circular Motion of the Singers in that Stanza from the Right Hand to the Left.<note n="c" place="bottom">Or from the Left to the Right, for the <hi>Scholiaſts</hi> differ in that, as may be ſeen in <hi>Pind. Schol. Introduc. ad Olymp.</hi> And <hi>Alex. ab Alexandro,</hi> L. 4.

                     </gap>ox a dextra Lae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorſum.</hi> But the Learned <hi>Schmidius</hi> takes part with the firſt Opinion, as more conſiſtent with the Notions of the Ancients concerning the Motions of the Heavenly Spheres, and agreeable to <hi>Homer</hi> there cited by him. See <hi>Eraſ. Schmid. Prolegom. in Olymp. &amp; de Carmin. Lyric.</hi>
               </note> The ſecond Stanza was call'd the <hi>Antiſtrophé,</hi> from the Contraverſion of the <hi>Chorus;</hi> the Singers, in performing that, turning from the Left Hand to the Right, contrary always to their Motion in the <hi>Strophé.</hi> The Third Stanza was call'd the <hi>Epode,</hi> (it may be as being the After-ſong) which they ſung in the middle, neither turning to one Hand nor the other.</p>
            <p>What the Origin was of theſe different Motions and Stations in ſinging their Odes, is not our preſent buſineſs to enquire. Some have thought that by the Contrariety of the <hi>Strophé</hi> and <hi>Antiſtrophé,</hi> they intended to repreſent the Contrarotation of the <hi>Primum Mobile,</hi> in reſpect of the <hi>Secunda Mobilia;</hi> and that by their ſtanding ſtill at the <hi>Epode,</hi> they meant to ſignifie the Stability of the Earth.<note n="d" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Pind. Schol. &amp; Schmid.</hi> ibid.</note> Others aſcribe the Inſtitution to <hi>Theſeus,</hi> who thereby ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed the Windings and Turnings of the Labyrinth in celebrating his Return from thence.</p>
            <p>The Method obſerv'd in the Compoſition of theſe Odes, was therefore as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows. The Poet having made choice of a certain Number of Verſes to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute his <hi>Strophé</hi> or firſt <hi>Stanza,</hi> was oblig'd to obſerve the ſame in his <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſtrophé,</hi> or ſecond <hi>Stanza;</hi> and which accordingly perpetually agreed whenever repeated, both in number of Verſes and quantity of Feet: He was then again at liberty, to make a new choice for his third <hi>Stanza,</hi> or <hi>Epode;</hi> where, accordingly, he diverſify'd his Numbers as his Ear or Fancy led him; compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing that <hi>Stanza</hi> of more or fewer Verſes than the former, and thoſe Verſes of different Meaſures and Quantities, for the greater Variety of Harmony, and Entertainment of the Ear.</p>
            <p>But then this <hi>Epode</hi> being thus form'd, he was ſtrictly oblig'd to the ſame <note n="e" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Vid. Jul. Scal. Poetic. ad Fin. Cap.</hi> 97. <hi>l.</hi> 3.</note>Meaſure, as often as he ſhould repeat it in the order of his Ode, ſo that every <hi>Epode</hi> in the ſame Ode is eternally the ſame in Meaſure and Quantity, in reſpect to it ſelf; as is alſo every <hi>Strophé</hi> and <hi>Antiſtrophé,</hi> in reſpect to each other.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Lyrick</hi> Poet <hi>Steſichorus</hi> (whom <note n="f" place="bottom">

exceſſive Ignorance, he could not do it more effectually than by telling him, <hi>he did not ſo much as know the Three Stanza's of</hi> Steſichorus; that is, did not know that an Ode ought to conſiſt of a <hi>Strophé,</hi> an <hi>Antiſtrophé,</hi> and an <hi>Epode.</hi> If this was ſuch a mark of Ignorance among them, I am ſure we have been pretty long liable to the ſame Reproof; I mean, in reſpect of our Imitations of the Odes of <hi>Pindar.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My Intention is not to make a long Preface to a ſhort Ode, nor to enter upon a Diſſertation of Lyrick Poetry in general: But thus much I thought proper to ſay, for the Information of thoſe Readers whoſe Courſe of Study has not led 'em into ſuch Enquiries.</p>
            <p>I hope I ſhall not be ſo miſunderſtood, as to have it thought that I pretend to give an exact Copy of <hi>Pindar</hi> in this enſuing Ode; or that I look upon it as a Pattern for his Imitators for the future: Far from ſuch Thoughts, I have only given an Inſtance of what is practicable, and am ſenſible that I am as diſtant from the Force and Elevation of <hi>Pindar,</hi> as others have hitherto been from the Harmony and Regularity of his Numbers.</p>
            <p>Again, we having no <hi>Chorus</hi> to ſing our Odes, the Titles, as well as Uſe of <hi>Strophe, Antiſtrophe,</hi> and <hi>Epode,</hi> are Obſolete and Impertinent: And certainly there may be very good <hi>Engliſh</hi> Odes, without the Diſtinction of <hi>Greek</hi> Appellations to their Stanza's. That I have mention'd 'em here, and obſerv'd the Order of 'em in the enſuing Ode, is therefore only the more intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligibly to explain the extraordinary Regularity of the Compoſition of thoſe Odes, which have been repreſented to us hitherto, as the moſt confus'd Structures in Nature.</p>
            <p>However, tho' there be no neceſſity that our Triumphal Odes ſhould conſiſt of the Three afore-mention'd Stanza's; yet if the Reader can obſerve that the great Variation of the Numbers in the Third Stanza (call it <hi>Epode,</hi> or what you pleaſe) has a pleaſing Effect in the Ode, and makes him return to the Firſt and Second Stanza's, with more Appetite, than he could do if always cloy'd with the ſame Quantities and Meaſures, I cannot ſee why ſome Uſe may not be made of <hi>Pindar</hi>'s Example, to the great Improvement of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ode. There is certainly a Pleaſure in beholding any Thing that has Art and Difficulty in the Contrivance; eſpecially, if it appears ſo carefully executed, that the Difficulty does not ſhew it ſelf, 'till it is ſought for; and that the ſeeming Eaſineſs of the Work, firſt ſets us upon the Enquiry. Nothing can be call'd Beautiful without Proportion. When Symmetry and Harmony are wanting, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Eye nor the Ear can be pleas'd. Therefore certainly <hi>Poetry,</hi> which includes Painting and Muſick, ſhould not be deſtitute of 'em; and of all <hi>Poetry,</hi> eſpecially the <hi>Ode,</hi> whoſe End and Eſſence is Harmony.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Cowley,</hi> in his Preface to his Pindarique Odes, ſpeaking of the Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick of Numbers, ſays, <hi>which ſometimes (eſpecially in Songs and Odes) almoſt without any thing elſe makes an Excellent Poet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having mention'd Mr. <hi>Cowley,</hi> it may very well be expected, that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſhould be ſaid of him, at a time when the Imitation of <hi>Pindar</hi> is the
<pb facs="tcp:0562401200:5"/>
Theme of our Diſcourſe. But there is that great Deference due to the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, great Parts, and Learning of that Gentleman, that I think nothing ſhould be objected to the Latitude he has taken in his Pindarique Odes. The Beauty of his Verſes, are an Attonement for the Irregularity of his Stanza's; and tho' he did not imitate <hi>Pindar</hi> in the Strictneſs of his Numbers, he has very often happily copy'd him in the Force of his Figures, and Sublimity of his Stile and Sentiments.</p>
            <p>Yet I muſt beg leave to add, that I believe thoſe irregular Odes of Mr. <hi>Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,</hi> may have been the principal, tho' innocent Occaſion of ſo many deformed Poems ſince, which inſtead of being true Pictures of <hi>Pindar,</hi> have (to uſe the <hi>Italian</hi> Painters Term) been only <hi>Caricatura</hi>'s of him, Reſemblances that for the moſt part have been either Horrid or Ridiculous.</p>
            <p>For my own part I frankly own my Error, in having heretofore miſ-call'd a few irregular <hi>Stanza</hi>'s a Pindarique Ode; and poſſibly, if others, who have been under the ſame Miſtake, would ingenuouſly confeſs the Truth, they might own, that never having conſulted <hi>Pindar</hi> himſelf, they took all his Irregularity upon truſt; and finding their Account in the great Eaſe with which they could produce Odes, without being oblig'd either to Meaſure or Deſign, remain'd ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy'd; and it may be were not altogether unwilling to neglect being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceiv'd.</p>
            <p>Tho' there be little (if any thing) left of <hi>Orpheus</hi> but his Name, yet if <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Boeotic. pag.</hi> 588.</note>
               <hi>Pauſanias</hi> was well inform'd, we may be aſſur'd that <hi>Brevity</hi> was a Beauty which he moſt induſtriouſly labour'd to preſerve in his <hi>Hymns,</hi> notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as the ſame Author reports, that they were but few in Number.</p>
            <p>The Shortneſs of the following Ode will, I hope, attone for the Length of the Preface, and in ſome meaſure for the Defects which may be found in it. It conſiſts of the ſame Number of Stanza's with that beautiful Ode of <hi>Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar,</hi> which is the firſt of his <hi>Pythicks;</hi> and tho' I was unable to imitate him in any other Beauty, I reſolv'd to endeavour to Copy his Brevity, and take the Advantage of a Remark he has made in the laſt <hi>Strophé</hi> of the ſame Ode, which take in the Paraphraſe of <hi>Sudorius.</hi>
