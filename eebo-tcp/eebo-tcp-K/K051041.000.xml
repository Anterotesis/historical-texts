            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>IT has been obſerved, that Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers have always been more frequent, and done more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Miſchief, than any other Diſorders whatſoever; that they
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0198300500:3"/>have often produced grievous and fatal Effects, even when they have ariſen from Accidents, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingly, not dangerous; and that, far from being confined to the infirm, and Valetudina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, they are moſt apt to ſeize upon, and deſtroy Bodies, that are young, Vigorous, and ſound.</p>
            <p>THESE Obſervations have long ſince induced me to endeavour to point out ſome Means (eaſy, and intelligible to the generality
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:0198300500:4"/>of People) to prevent, at leaſt in ſome Meaſure, ſo great an Evil; and I have fixed upon thoſe as the moſt probable and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentic, which are mentioned in the following Eſſay. For, in making Choice of them, I have not been influenced by any <hi>Hypothetical</hi> Reaſoning, how plauſible ſoever; but I have proceeded, ſolely, upon the ſure Footing of ſuch Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations of Phiſitians, as have been confirmed by long, and
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0198300500:5"/>accurate Experience, and hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed down to us through many ſucceeding Ages.</p>
            <p>I have likewiſe ſubjoined a ſhort and plain, Account of the Production of the Symptoms of Fevers, as evidently deduced from Experience, and Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; which Account, perhaps, I ſhall hereafter attempt to illuſtrate, and enlarge. But I ſhould be much better pleaſed to find ſome abler Perſon
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:0198300500:6"/>excited, by theſe imperfect Hints, to take that Taſk out of my Hands.</p>

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0198300500:14"/>of Perſons, who (through a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, and too common Miſtake) are deemed able, and honeſt enough to cure every ſlight, feveriſh Diſorder.</p>
               <p n="3">III. AND in this Senſe it is ſtrictly true, that many ordinary Fevers have been made grievous, and mortal, which, if rightly handled in the Begining, would not have been attended with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny conſiderable Prejudice.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. THERE is likewiſe ſome Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to ſuſpect, that the commonly-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Opinion of the Nature of theſe Diſeaſes has a tendency to retard, and ſometimes abſolutely to hinder their Cure. The Opinion I mean, is, <q>"that a Fever is excited by a Foulneſs, or Diſtemperature in the Blood, which
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0198300500:15"/>is, for that Reaſon, called the Febrile Matter; that this Diſorder itſelf is a kind of Inſtrument which Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture makes Uſe of to clear the Blood of that Foulneſs; that (as<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Vid.

               <p n="6">VI. BUT the Truth is, that this Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion had its riſe in the very infancy of Phiſick; when Phiſitians were rather Obſervers than Aſſiſtants of Nature; which latter, however, they afterwards became in an eminent Degree, by
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0198300500:18"/>Means chiefly of ſuch Obſervation; and hence it was that few or no Mede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines were then preſcribed by them in theſe, or any other Diſorders.</p>
               <p n="7">VII.

               <p n="8">VIII.

FROM the critical Evacuations in Fevers having, very often, a ſtrong, fetid Smell, and other Signs of Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in them, it has been generally concluded, that they muſt neceſſarily have been derived from an infected Source; and that the ſame morbid State of the whole Maſs of Humours muſt, therefore, have given riſe to theſe Diſtempers.

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0198300500:21"/>to which many People enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good Health are ſubject, can be thought to ſhew, that the Blood of ſuch People is in a State of Putrefaction, or that their Bodies are infected with putrid Fevers,<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Gouraigne de feb. p. 275.</note> If a Vein be opened in theſe Diſeaſes, while the moſt faetid Sweat is ouzing thro' the Pores of the Skin, there ſhall not be found the leaſt, diſagreeable Smell, or Taſte in the Blood that is drawn.

               <p n="12">XII. I muſt obſerve here, that it was a Point agreed upon by all the<note n="(b)" place="bottom">Vid.

But although theſe Fevers were formerly accounted harmleſs, (and in their own Nature in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they are ſo) yet we now often ſee

The following extraordinary Caſe, and the Obſervations naturally ariſing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from, may ſerve to put this Matter in a clearer Light.</p>
               <p n="17">XVII IN the Year 1738, a Man, of about fifty, was brought to the CHA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RITABLE INFIRMARY on the INS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>QUAY, DUBLIN, with a Tumor in his Groin, which in due Time, and by proper Applications, came to Suppu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.

However, when this Tumor was opened, ſome Bones of a Chickens<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neck were extracted from it; by which, and the Patients own Confeſſion, it appeared, that he had ſome Weeks be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, haſtily ſwallowed down theſe Bones unchewed; and that they had gradually<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Vid.

This Man eate, and ſlept well, when I ſaw him; and he had done ſo from the very Beginning of his Complaint, as he himſelf avered. And, while in the INFIRMARY, he was free from every Feveriſh Symptom,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0198300500:31"/>except what the Suppuration of his Tumor naturally occaſioned. Of this I was aſſured by Mr. FRANCIS DUA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NY, one of the Surgeons of that IN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FIRMARY, who had often viſited him while he was there, and by whom I ſaw ſome of theſe Bones taken out intire, with great Dexterity. Mr. DUA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NY likewiſe informed me, that Mr. KELLY, in his Turn of Viſiting, had alſo extracted, from this Perſon, ſome Bones of the ſame Kind.</p>
               <p n="18">XVIII. Now if an Irritation of the Inteſtines, which was ſo great, that it at length deſtroyed Part of their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, did not produce any conſiderable Fever (which as I have ſaid is indeed an extraordinary Caſe) may it not eaſily happen, that the ſo much feebler Stimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0198300500:32"/>of indigeſted Humours on theſe Parts, may be often hindred, by the MUCUS which defends them, from having any ſuch Effect?

And as the Caution of the Antients, in theſe Particulars, was wiſe, and worthy of Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, ſo is the Raſhneſs of ſome modern Practitioners, as much to be dreaded and avoided.

               <p n="20">XX. BUT if Bleeding, Purging, and Vomiting in the Beginning of all Fevers without Diſtinction, have often done Miſchief, there is not leſs to be feared from the too dilatory Practice of thoſe who, as we have already obſerved, have nothing elſe in View, in the Cure of theſe Diſtempers, but the gradual Correction, or diſtant Expulſion of

If the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon indiſpoſed muſt Drink, let him Drink Water; and generally ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it will be ſufficient for him to keep to that Drink for one Day; ſometimes, if the Symptoms ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main, it will be neceſſary to continue it for two. Next to abſtinence, a very ſpare Diet is proper; with which Water muſt be drunk one Day, and Wine the next; and ſo on, until all Cauſe of Fear is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved. By theſe Means an heavy, and iminent Diſeaſe is often preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. And many are deceived, who think to put of a Beginning Sickneſs,

Sometimes, indeed, it will be neceſſary to allow him leſs even of Bread than uſual, and to tye him down to a moiſt Herb-diet.

Gal. meth. med. lib. 8. cap. 2.</note> Bathing in Waters that are too hot, or aſtringent, is apt to produce Fevers of all Sorts. And, on the other Hand, whatever brings about an early Removal of this Rigor, or Conſtriction, and thereby promotes an eaſy, and univerſal Moiſture of the Skin, will (as we have already ſhewn at large in the ſecond Part of this ESSAY) ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prevent all the worſt Symptoms of thoſe Diſorders.</p>
               <p>THE Truth of this Reaſoning is further confirmed, by the prognoſtic Signs that are obſerved, both in Bodies recovering from theſe Diſtempers, and in thoſe that are dying of them. For as to the firſt, Experience and Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0198300500:69"/>have always ſhewn us, that no Fevers are completely cured, until the Skin, from being dry, and contracted, becomes all over<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Vid. Etmull. de Feb. p. 218. &amp; alios</note> ſoft, relaxed, and moiſt. And as to the ſecond, it is well known, that the Continuance, and Increaſe of the Contraction of the Skin in the decline of theſe Diſorders, (which<note n="(b)" place="bottom">Vid. Hypp. praen. Coac. Celf. Med. p. 54.</note> Cold Extremitys, the Temples col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſed, the Noſe ſharpened, the Eyes ſunk, and the Drying up of Iſſues, and Ulcers plainly indicate) are but too of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the certain fore-runners of Death.</p>
               <p>AND the Reaſon of theſe Prognoſtics is very evident, and naturally flows from the Idea we have given of Fevers. For, as the ſick then only recover from
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0198300500:70"/>them, when, by the Removal of the Spaſms in the ſuperficial Parts of the Body, a free Paſſage is again opened to the Humours that way, from the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loaded VISCERA, (as in a complete and ſalutary CRISIS) ſo, by a too long Continuance, or great increaſe of theſe Spaſms, and by the morbid Full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Diſtenſion of the Parts with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, conſequent thereto, the Heart, and Brain muſt, at length, be intirely diſabled from performing thoſe Func<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, on which the Lives of all Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals do abſolutely depend. For this Reaſon it is, that the ſick are in<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Lom. Obs. p. 7.</note> great Danger in continual Fevers, when, after a Rigor or Shuddering, they do not grow warm. Hence like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe thoſe who dye of intermitting Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0198300500:71"/>commonly expire in the Cold Fit. And in all dead Bodies the right Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle of the Heart is found very much diſtended with Blood.</p>
               <p>FROM what has been ſaid, it follows that CRUDITY in Fevers, ſo much talked of, and ſo little underſtood, is in Truth nothing elſe, but an<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Vid. Heq. de Purg. Med. p. 206.</note> ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular, and devious Motion of the Vital Fluids, from the conſtringed Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of the Body, into the VISCERA, cauſing ſuch a Fullneſs, and Diſtenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in them, as are apt to produce the uſual Symptoms of theſe Diſtempers; and that their CRISIS, therefore, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts, not in the Expulſion of any mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſic Matter out of the Body; but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Removal of that Conſtriction
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0198300500:72"/>of the Surface, and in an Opportunity, thereby, given to Nature to reſtore to the vital Juices their due, and regular Motion through all their uſual Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels. Wherefore the Evacuations, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly happening in this Period of Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, ought to be looked upon meerly as the Effects of that general Relaxation of the Solids, which then always enſues; and to be helpful to the ſick, in no other manner, but by taking off that extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Fullneſs in the Bowels, from whence all their Complaints aroſe.</p>
               <p>AND, although, when theſe Diſeaſes are left to themſelves, and Art does not interfere with them, theſe Evacuations, for the moſt Part, happen on certain Days, which are therefore diſtinguiſhed by the Name of CRITICAL; yet we
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0198300500:73"/>often find the Matter otherwiſe, when proper Remedys have been adminiſtered from the Beginning, in order to put a Stop to them. For which Reaſon<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Vid. Etmul. Fol. 214. Helmont. de Feb. cap. XI.</note> modern Phiſitians pay not altogether ſo ſcrupulous a Regard to thoſe Days, as the Antients have done; who were more employed in obſerving the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, and Changes of Diſtempers, than in applying Medecines for their Cure. Thus we have already ſhewn, from the concurring Teſtimonys of the beſt Phiſitians, that an End may be put to ordinary Fevers on the firſt, or ſecond Day of their Appearance, though nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theſe Days was ever accounted CRITICAL.</p>
               <p>IN this manner, may be explained
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:0198300500:74"/>both the Symptoms, and Events of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Fevers, as ariſing ſolely from a preternatural Change in the Solid Parts of the Body; and without having Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to hypothetical Conjectures of their being cauſed by any acrimonious Impuritys in the Blood itſelf. For it is highly probable, that no ſuch Impuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tys can be admitted through the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely ſmall, and delicate Orifices of the lacteal Veſſels; and that as well on Account of the great Irritability of theſe Orifices, (which the Contact of every thing that is acrimonious muſt immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately cloſe) as likewiſe, becauſe theſe Veſſels are formed only for the Recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſuch a Liquor as may contribute to the Nouriſhment, and Preſervation of the Animal, or at leaſt is not deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0198300500:75"/>of it. Thus we ſays<note n="(a)" place="bottom">De Purg. M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>IN the Progreſs of Fevers indeed, when, by Means of the Spaſms in the Surface, Obſtructions have been alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy formed in the Bowels, and the uſual Secretions have been ſtopt, the Blood may become too thick, or otherwiſe

Thus it hath been obſerved, that Fevers frequently happen to Bodies,<note n="(b)" place="bottom">Vid. Syd. de Feb.</note> whoſe Humours are pure; though theſe Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours may be afterwards tainted in the Courſe of the Sickneſs. And it has been always remarked, that<note n="(c)" place="bottom">Vid. Lom. Obs. p. 4. &amp; alio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> putrid Fevers themſelves are moſt incident to Perſons, of a found, laudable, and well-conditioned Blood.</p>
               <p>THAT the Tenacity of the Blood, in theſe Diſeaſes, is in Truth nothing
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0198300500:77"/>more than the Effect of thoſe Rigors at the Beginning of them, which ſlac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and obſtruct its Motion in the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficial Parts of the Body, appears, I think, from hence, that, if Blood be drawn during thoſe Rigors, it ſhall be found ſo thick, and tenacious, as to paſs with Difficulty through the Orifice that is made in the Vein; but it will be much thiner, and come out with greater Freedom, if it be drawn either ſometime before thoſe Rigors have been felt, or when they are abated.</p>
               <p>AND, in general, the Appearances of Blood drawn in theſe, and other Diſtempers, are ſo various and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that a prudent Phiſitian will hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lay any Streſs upon them in Chuſing his Method of Cure.<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Prax. p. 141.</note> BAGLIVI
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:0198300500:78"/>has obſerved, that almoſt all thoſe have been recovered from acute Diſeaſes, whoſe Blood, when drawn, was cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with a White, and Chylous Cruſt; which, however, is vulgarly looked upon as a Mark of bad, and even corrupted Blood. And<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Therapeut. p. 277.</note> FREDERIC HOFF<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MAN informs us, that he has often ſeen Blood, taken from ſcorbutical and hectical People, that was elegantly Red and fluid, while that which had been drawn from ſound, and healthy Perſons, was thick, black, and glutinous. And I have obſerved,<note n="(b)" place="bottom">Id ibid.</note> continues he, Blood to flow from Arterys opened in a virulent Cancer, which was fluid, of a fine Red Colour, and in all Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance,

               </p>
               <p>ALL Attempts therefore to cure Fevers by directly attenuating the Blood; or by correcting, or expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling any <hi>morbific Matter</hi> ſuppoſed to be in it, muſt be vain, and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs; inaſmuch as they are levelled, not at the Cauſes, but meerly at the Effects of theſe Diſorders. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, that the rectifying of the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid Parts of the Body, ought to be the Phiſitian's chief Care, in theſe
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0198300500:80"/>and other Diſeaſes, ſeems reaſonable from this Conſideration, that the<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Vid. Fred. Hoffm. diſs. de Inteſt. duoden.</note> Operation of ſuch Medecines, as have been found ſucceſsful againſt the moſt dangerous and obſtinate Diſtempers, is, in all Probability, confined to theſe Parts; and that they produce their moſt ſalutary Effects, in the<note n="(b)" place="bottom">Id. diſs. de iuſt. Ventric. Helmont. Fol. 300.</note> Stomach and Guts, by affecting prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally their nervous Coats, and other Parts of the Body by Conſent only. We have already obſerved, that acid Medecines, which are allowed to be of great Uſe in Fevers, are intire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly changed in the <hi>firſt Ways;</hi> or at leaſt, ſoon after they have been receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the Blood.</p>
               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:0198300500:81"/>
               <p>IT now remains to ſhew, by what Means that Rigor and Conſtriction of the Surface, from which, we have proved, all the other Symptoms of Fevers ariſe, are themſelves produced; and theſe Means I take to be no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but thoſe very Things which are commonly called the remote Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of theſe Diſorders; <hi>viz.</hi> Cold tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, Exceſſes in Eating and Drinking, the Suppreſſion of ſome uſual Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge, Trouble of Mind, and other Accidents of the like Nature, when great and ſudden.</p>
               <p>FOR, Firſt; as to Gold taken, a Rigor and Conſtriction of the Surface, and a Fever thence enſuing, are ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and obvious Effects of it, that all Proof on this Head is unneceſſary.</p>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:0198300500:82"/>
               <p>Thus the<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Vid. Gal. 11. Meth. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> antient Phiſitians gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally attributed the Riſe even of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trid Fevers, to no other Cauſe, but the Obſtruction of the Pores of the Skin.</p>
               <p>SECONDLY; Exceſſes in Eating and Drinking are apt to leave Crudities in the Stomach, which, by remaining there for a certain Time, grow acrid, and vellicate its nervous Coate; and from thence a Rigor or Conſtriction may be propagated, by Conſent, to the Surface of the Body. Of this Conſent of the Stomach with the Skin, we have a plain Proof, in thoſe who are apt to ſhudder after having taken Things that are acrid or ſower. And CEL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:0198300500:83"/>FERNELIUS, and ETMULLER plainly inſinuate, that the Cauſe of thoſe Horrors, which commonly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce Fevers, often lies in the Stomach only.</p>
               <p>THIRDLY; In the Suppreſſion of every uſual Diſcharge, eſpecially when great and ſudden, there is a morbid Fullneſs, in the Veſſels, from whence the Diſcharge uſed to be made; and this Fullneſs, muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily occaſion a Spaſm, or Conſtricti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in other Parts; but in none to ſuch a Degree, as in thoſe at the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face and Extremities, by Reaſon of their great and general Conſent with all the reſt of the Body. Thus<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Coac. Praen. Fol. 444.</note>
                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:0198300500:84"/>HYPPOCRATES has obſerved, that a dangerous Rigor enſues upon the untimely Suppreſſion of the Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Women in Child-bed, or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a Miſcarriage. And hence, on the other Hand, Baths of warm Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Vid. Proſp. Alp. de Med. Aegypt. p. 114.</note>, by relaxing the Skin, invit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Humours thither, and open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the perſpiratory Pores, are apt to remove Obſtructions in the inner Veſſels, and by that Means, often renew thoſe Diſcharges from them, which had been ſuppreſt.</p>
               <p>LASTLY, That Trouble of Mind occaſions Fevers by affecting the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face in the ſame Manner, appears
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:0198300500:85"/>from the Method of Cure, ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully uſed by the antient Phiſitians in the Beginning of Fevers ſo cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which was no other, but Fric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Unction, and the warm Bath.</p>
               <p>THUS have we aſſigned for the Production of thoſe Rigors, that gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally uſher in Fevers, Cauſes, which are plain and ſufficient, and may be eaſily removed, together with their ill Effects, by a timely Application of<note n="(a)" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Vid.</hi> Part the ſecond of this Eſſay.</note> proper Remedies. And we have excluded, from that Denomination, ſuch Things only as, whatever may be thought of them, have been proved to be meerly Effects of theſe Diſtempers, hardly, if at all, to be come at by the Medecines uſual in
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:0198300500:86"/>theſe Caſes, and which, therefore, ſerve for no other Purpoſe, but to terrify the Sick, and miſlead the Phiſitian.</p>
