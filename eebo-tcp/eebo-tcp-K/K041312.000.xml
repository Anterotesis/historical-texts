            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE Old MAN's GUIDE.</head>
            <p>HEALTHFUL old age is the moſt valuable and happy period of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Life. Experience has ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd the antient more able than thoſe who have ſeen leſs, and felt leſs, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct themſelves and their deſcendants; and being freed from the empire of the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions they enjoy quiet.</p>
            <p>Philoſophy pretends to this condition; but age gives it truly. Whatever their heirs may think, it is worth preſerving; and in that ſenſe I write the preſent Treatiſe.</p>
            <p>A hundred are cut off at this advanced period, by diſorders which a proper regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men might have prevented, for one who dies of age, or its unavoidable effects. Many fall by accidents, to one who is fairly call'd away by nature: and theſe
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0246501200:4"/>accidents and diſorders it is propoſed here to give the means of avoiding.</p>
            <p>Old mens diſeaſes are hard to cure, but they are eaſily prevented: and the ſame means which preſerve their health give happineſs. It muſt be a good natural fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick which has preſerved itſelf entire ſo long, and thro' ſo many chances; and the ſame ſtrength will keep it, perhaps, much longer together under a good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulation.</p>
            <p>Moderate diet and proper exerciſe are the beſt guardians of the health of old and young: and in the advanced period here conſidered there are two great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervatives beſides; theſe are EASE OF MIND and CHEERFULNESS OF DISPOSITION, both are the natural offspring of health; and they will continue the bleſſing to which they owe their origin.</p>
            <p>We ſhall conſider firſt the hale and healthy old man; and afterwards the weakly, and the ſick: for our purpoſe is firſt to direct thoſe how to preſerve health who have it, and afterwards to reſtore, or to recover it where it is attack'd or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feebled by diſeaſes.</p>
            <div n="1" type="chapter">

               <head>
                  <hi>CHAP. I.</hi> How the old man may know he is in health.</head>
               <p>'TIS allow'd that we know ſo little of nothing, as of ourſelves: It has been ſaid principally of the mind, but it is ſcarce leſs true of the body. The fancying we have diſeaſes will often bring them upon us; and there is as much danger in forcing ourſelves to believe againſt our feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that we are well, when ſome diſorder is in the body. This is the leſs common error; but there are more inſtances of it than may be thought.</p>
               <p>To avoid both let the old man read here with a free mind. Let him not ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, becauſe God has bleſſed him with long health, he is above the reach of ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; nor neglect the care which may conquer, in its beginning, a diſeaſe that will elſe in the end conquer him. Let him be as ready to acknowledge real diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders, as careful to avoid the imaginary.</p>
               <p>Health conſiſts in a good digeſtion of the food, and a free circulation of the blood. The appetite and the condition of the ſtomach after eating will ſhew the firſt; and the latter may be known beſt by the pulſe.</p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:0246501200:6"/>
               <p>That old perſon's digeſtion is good, who has a ſharp but not voracious appetite; and who feels no pain or ſickneſs after meals. To preſerve this let him always be content with leſs than the full of what he could eat: for the ſure way to keep the ſtomach in order is not to overload it.</p>
               <p>The time of feeling the pulſe is in a morning, ſome time after getting up, and before breakfaſt. It ſhould be a rule never to omit this examination. A con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and regular attention to it will ſhew the ſlighteſt variations; and whenever ſuch happen, care muſt be taken of the health.</p>
               <p>There are mechanical methods of count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the ſtrokes by a watch; but the plainer way is better. The general regular mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure is ſeventy-four ſtrokes in a minute: but pulſes differ greatly in various perſons; and nature may be injur'd by forcing her toward a condition ſhe, perhaps, never had, nor requires.</p>
               <p>A frequent examination will inform any perſon what is the condition of the pulſe when in health; and the deviations from this are the rules to know ſickneſs.</p>
               <p>While an old man feels his pulſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular, finds his digeſtion good, and with a mind at eaſe can take his uſual exerciſe
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0246501200:7"/>freely, he may laugh at the expectation of the next in inheritance: he may be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain he is well; and we ſhall tell him how to keep ſo: For when the fault is ſeen in time it is eaſily remedy'd. If the pulſe beat too quick and high the diet muſt be a little lower; if too ſlow, and weak, the food muſt be richer. This ſhort direction will prevent diſeaſes.</p>
               <p>The doctors will not thank me for this, but I do not write it for their ſervice: they muſt own 'tis true, tho' they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like the publiſhing it. If men would pay more regard to their own conſtitutions, they would want little of their aſſiſtance; which always comes too late to prevent miſchief; and often to relieve it.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> Of preſerving a healthful ſtate in old age.</head>
               <p>EXERCISE has thro' the younger part of life been very inſtrumental in preſerving the health: when we grow old we cannot uſe ſo much; and we muſt therefore be doubly careful in our diet. That will go off with exerciſe, which will overload the body when kept quiet: that will nouriſh while we walk abroad, which, when we ſtay at home, breeds fevers. The
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0246501200:8"/>leſs exerciſe we uſe the leſs we ſhould eat; and what we do ſhould be of the milder nature.</p>
               <p>We muſt not make this change violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: for all ſudden alterations in the diet are dangerous. Our ſtrength for exerciſe will leave us by degrees, and we muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce our food in quantity and quality ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly; by a little at a time, not by a harſh change at once.</p>
               <p>Winter is the ſeaſon when old men are leaſt healthy; therefore they muſt then be moſt careful. They are colder than young perſons, therefore cold more affects them. The weakneſs of their circulation makes them cold, and this is known by their feeble and ſlow pulſe. They will know therefore that the cold weather has hurt them, when they perceive the pulſe more weak and ſlow than uſual; and they muſt preſerve themſelves againſt it; and recover the new damage by more warmth, and a ſomewhat higher diet.</p>
               <p>If perſpiration have been ſtop'd by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal cold, and no other ill effect follow, it will be ſeen by the urine being paler and more in quantity than uſual. In this caſe let flannel be put on carefully, it will encreaſe, or reſtore the perſpiration, and the urine will come to its due colour and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0246501200:9"/>quantity: after that let it be very carefully left off again.</p>
               <p>The good we ſhew it can do, proves it may alſo do harm. Health conſiſts in the evacuations having all their proper courſe and quantity; and flannel will diminiſh one as much as it encreaſes another.</p>
               <p>No diſorder is more troubleſome to old people than coſtiveneſs: and the uſe of flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel improperly will ſometimes occaſion this; by taking off too much of the natural moiſture.</p>
               <p>By this, as by the other rules, the old perſon will ſee that a careful attention to his health is the only way to preſerve it: and that things are excellent when properly uſed, which may otherwiſe be deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.</p>
               <p>If the appetite fail, or wind oppreſs the ſtomach after meals, let the perſon take more air, and exerciſe; and read or ſtudy leſs: for much ſtudy always hurts the digeſtion; and when that is impaired, worſe miſchiefs will follow.</p>

               <head>
                  <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> Of the diet of old men.</head>
               <p>IT has been cuſtomary to recommend a particular diet to old perſons; as if one courſe of living could ſuit all conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions: but this is very wrong. Old men differ as much from one another, as old from young; and according to their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral conſtitutions, a various courſe of life is neceſſary in this reſpect. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ſhall eſtabliſh no peculiar diet as fit for every old perſon; but only lay down certain general rules. Theſe will hold univerſally, becauſe they are calculated for old people, merely as they are old; not as they are of one or another conſtitution.</p>
               <p>Lighter diet is more proper for aged perſons than young; and this in their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors as well as ſolid food.</p>
               <p>Beef and pork ſhould be avoided: for the ſtomach will rarely be able to digeſt theſe when it is not aſſiſted by exerciſe.</p>
               <p>Lamb, veal, pig, chickens, and tame rabbet are very excellent food for old perſons; and out of theſe, if there are no others, a tolerable management may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce ſufficient variety.</p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:0246501200:11"/>
               <p>No aged perſon ſhould eat more than one meal of ſolid food in the day. The ſtomach will be able to manage a dinner when the breakfaſt and ſupper have been light: otherwiſe the load of one meal not being gone off before another is brought in, neither will be digeſted.</p>
               <p>The ſubſtantial meal ſhould be dinner; and this ſhould not be eaten too early, that the appetite may not be violent for ſupper. It has been obſerved already, that the quantity of food at a meal ſhould be leſs for old perſons than for young: and the older they grow, the more this ſhould be diminiſhed. This was the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of Hippocrates; and by the obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of it Carnaro lived to his extreme age.</p>
               <p>This regulation principally concerns dinner, which is the capital meal: with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to ſupper, the lighter it is the better; though we do not agree with thoſe who adviſe the omitting that meal intirely. Moderation is the rule of health in all life; but moſt of all in the old man's life. They were in the right who declared the miſchief of ſolid or heavy ſuppers; but the poets have long ſince ſaid what ſort of people thoſe are, who, in avoiding a fault, ruſh into its contrary. There is a
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0246501200:12"/>medium between a heavy ſupper and emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſs; and this is beſt. Since all agree ſolid food at this meal is wrong, let the old man eat liquid; and of all liquid diets, thoſe which are partly compoſed of milk are beſt.</p>
               <p>'Tis only in the extreme of age that men become children again in their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings; but in their bodily faculties they approach this condition ſooner: for they grow weak as they grow aged, and weakneſs is weakneſs whether it be in old men or children. For this reaſon the food of children is fit for them, at leaſt in the leſſer meal. Their digeſtive faculties are leſs powerful; but milk is in a manner ready digeſted. They want an eaſy nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment; and this affords it, without loading the ſtomach, or oppreſſing it dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the hours of reſt.</p>
               <p>Aſſes milk is moſt eaſy of digeſtion, and moſt nouriſhing; and a pint of that, with a ſmall toaſt, eaten two hours before bed-time, will be nouriſhing, and ſit eaſy on the ſtomach. The value of aſſes milk is its lightneſs: that of the cow is richer and heavier. Thoſe who uſe the latter in this caſe in the country ſhould mix it firſt with equal parts of ſoft water: in London
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0246501200:13"/>this care is unneceſſary, thoſe who ſell milk do it for them.</p>
               <p>There are many other methods in which milk is pleaſant and proper: milk pottage, thin rice milk, and other ſuch diſhes, will give a variety without having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to other things. But ſome farther change is not denied them: weak broths of veal, chicken, and mutton may be eat occaſionally; and gellies honeſtly made at home, are proper, ſafe, and nouriſhing.</p>
               <p>With this choice, the old man need not deſire meat ſuppers; and theſe things will anſwer the double purpoſe of nouriſhing and moiſtening the body; for aged perſons are naturally too dry in their conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>The breakfaſt is the only meal remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be conſidered, and this is not a very important one. Thoſe who eat no ſupper are too hungry in a morning; and the ſtomach is loaded with what they take at that time, and therefore is the leſs able to digeſt a dinner.</p>
               <p>This is the reaſon we adviſe old per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to eat ſuppers, provided they be of a right kind; theſe take off the edge of the morning's appetite, and there will remain juſt ſo much deſire to eat as will
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0246501200:14"/>lead them to get ſomething into the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach without loading it.</p>
               <p>This is neceſſary to health. We know men may faſt away their appetite; and their power of digeſtion goes in a great meaſure with it. The conduct of the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite regulates the health; and this is not enough regarded. Young people may take liberties with themſelves; for nature is ſtrong: but the older muſt pay more regard to her weakneſs.</p>
               <p>It is as eſſential to health not to keep the ſtomach empty, as not to overload it. Wind is the conſequence of emptyneſs, and this diſturbs the office of the ſtomach. It ſhould be always kept at its due em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment in advanced periods of life; and this by ſmall quantities of proper food.</p>
               <p>For theſe plain reaſons, breakfaſts are as proper, nay as neceſſary, as ſuppers. Thoſe who are troubled with phlegm ſhould eat leſs at this meal than others; but all ſhould eat ſome. A cup of chocolate, not made too ſtrong, is a good breakfaſt. Coffee I cannot adviſe generally: but the exceptions againſt tea, are in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure groundleſs.</p>
               <p>Thoſe who drink a great quantity of tea, and are careleſs in the making it, uſing a bad kind, and drinking the laſt
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0246501200:15"/>diſhes cool and palled, will unqueſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably weaken their ſtomachs: but this is not the caſe with ſuch as are more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. If the old man likes tea he need not deny it to himſelf for breakfaſt. Let him uſe the plain green tea, of ſixteen ſhillings a pound; and make it well: taking care water boils, and allowing ſo much tea that it may be of ſufficient ſtrength with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſtanding too long upon the leaves. This way we have the ſpirit, flavour, and virtue of the plant; whereas weak, half cold, bad tea has juſt the contrary qual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
               <p>Let the old man drink three moderate cups of this tea, with a little ſugar and a good deal of milk; and ſwallow it neither too hot, nor mawkiſhly cool. Let him eat with it a thin ſlice or two of good bread, with a little butter; and he will find it nouriſhing and excellent.</p>
               <p>The virtues of tea thus drank are as conſiderable as its bad qualities when ill managed. In this manner, it ſtrengthens the ſtomach, and aſſiſts digeſtion: it keeps the body from being empty without loading it: and the appetite for dinner will be the better, and the digeſtion alſo more perfect. To this we are to add, that tea in this quantity is ſufficient for
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0246501200:16"/>the great purpoſe of diluting; and that it refreſhes the ſpirits more than any other liquid.</p>
               <p>The beſt drink at meals is malt liquor, not too ſtrong, and neither new nor ſtale. For this reaſon ſmall ale is better than table-beer, becauſe it will bear keeping to a due time for ſafe uſe. For the more cordial liquors wine is the beſt. A little of this is neceſſary to old men, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the conſtitution and former manner of life, more may be born with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out inconvenience, or indeed with advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. The kind of wine muſt be ſuited to the peculiarity of the conſtitution; of which we ſhall treat hereafter: here we ſpeak generally. But for moſt old perſons of all wines ſack is the beſt, if it can be obtained pure and genuine.</p>
               <p>As occaſion ſhall require the ſupper foods here directed may be uſed by way of dinner; and broths may be neceſſary ſome times for breakfaſt. This will be known from the circumſtances. When the ſtomach cannot digeſt ſolids, theſe liquid nouriſhments muſt ſupply the place; and when more nouriſhing things are wanted, a broth breakfaſt is excellent. Vipers are extolled, but 'tis an idle fancy: I have
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0246501200:17"/>found, on repeated tryals, broth of veal and chickens is better.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> Of the foods old men ſhould avoid.</head>
               <p>AFTER directing what is proper, we ſhall conclude this article of diet, by pointing out thoſe things which are hurtful to perſons advanced in years: and this is the more neceſſary becauſe many of them are unſuſpected.</p>
               <p>Every thing that is heavy, and hard of digeſtion, muſt be avoided: and tho' vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables may be thought innocent, there are many caſes in which they prove hurtful.</p>
               <p>No general praiſe, or general cenſure, can be paſſed upon them in this reſpect; for they differ according to their kinds as much as animal foods.</p>
               <p>Carrots are to be avoided, for no old ſtomach can digeſt them. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary potatoes are innocent, and parſnips are nouriſhing.</p>
               <p>Among herbage raw ſallads ſhould be ſhunned: cabbage, and all its kinds, breed wind, and are therefore wrong: but aſparagus is diuretick; and is excellent
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0246501200:18"/>againſt that common old man's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, the gravel.</p>
               <p>Heavy cheeſe ſhould be carefully a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided; and there is nothing worſe than eating too much butter: but very fine Cheſhire cheeſe, or the parmezan in a ſmall quantity after other food, are not amiſs.</p>
               <p>All ſharp taſted things, whether food or drink, are carefully to be ſhunned. They cannot be neutral upon the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach; and they are much more likely to do harm than good. Such things are to be conſidered as medicines, and as care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully uſed.</p>
               <p>Fruits in general are to be avoided by old men; but of all others, moſt carefully raw pears.</p>
               <p>Wall-fruit, and the other produce of our garden trees and ſhrubs, when they have grown in a good ſoil, and are exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of a due degree of ripeneſs, are inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent: but this is the beſt that can be ſaid of them, and to deſerve this all thoſe cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances are requiſite; otherwiſe they hurt the ſtomach and often bring on cholicks.</p>
               <p>Cucumbers, and the like productions of the kitchen garden, weaken the digeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0246501200:19"/>and greatly prevent the natural and neceſſary ſecretions.</p>
               <p>The pine-apple, the moſt pleaſant of all fruit, is the moſt dangerous. Its ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs fleas the mouth, and 'tis eaſy to know what effect ſuch a thing muſt have upon the ſtomach and bowels of perſons weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened by age. I have known it bring on bloody fluxes, which have been fatal. There are ſeveral kinds of this fruit ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what differing in quality, and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect degree of ripeneſs in a great meaſure takes off its bad effects; but theſe are nice diſtinctions; and he who is wiſe will judge as he does of muſhrooms; where many are dangerous, avoid all.</p>
               <p>Beſide avoiding things which are hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in themſelves, thoſe who are far ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced in years ſhould be upon their guard againſt ſuch as they are not accuſtom'd to. Particular conſtitutions, in medicine, will ſhew unforeſeen averſions to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular things: and it is the ſame in foods. Let him who knows what agrees with him ſtick to that. Change is wrong, and it may be hazardous: and 'tis idle to run into the way of danger when there is no advantage.</p>
               <p>All mixtures of food upon the ſtomach are bad; and there is not a greater
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0246501200:20"/>error in an old perſon than to eat of many things at one meal. He muſt not deceive himſelf by arguing that all are innocent: two things of known qualities will often on the mixing produce a third that is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly different from them both: and theſe are dangerous trials in an old man's ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach.</p>
               <p>The management in theſe articles is nearly as important as the choice; and a regularity of eating is the next care to the ſelecting proper food, and fixing on a right quantity.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> Of air for old perſons.</head>
               <p>NOTHING contributes more to health and long life than pure and good air: but by pure we are not to underſtand bleak; nor are old men at any time to chuſe it.</p>
               <p>It is ſtrange, that many live to a great age in London, where the air has neither of theſe characters; where we breathe ſmoak, and the mixt ſtench of a thouſand putrifying ſubſtances, which cannot eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate through the thick and foul atmoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phere of the place.</p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:0246501200:21"/>
               <p>But though none will queſtion the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior quality of a clear country air, yet let not him who has attained to a healthy threeſcore and ten, then think of leaving London, to continue his days to a longer period. They ſay uſe is a ſecond nature. It becomes nature itſelf: and bad things, to which an old man has been very long accuſtomed, are better than ſudden chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. It is well known, ſome who have reached an uncommon date of life, have periſhed at laſt by a ſudden change in their food: and the air is ſcarce of leſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence.</p>
               <p>He who would increaſe the period, and the healthy condition of his days by a country air, ſhould begin it at an earlier time; when his conſtitution can better bear the ſhock of alteration.</p>
               <p>In regard to choice of air, the reaſon we declare againſt that which is too bleak is plain: for bleak and cold are always found together. Cold air chills the blood, and in old men we want rather to warm it. This is the air at the tops of hills: and ſuch ſituations all old men ſhould avoid.</p>
               <p>On the contrary, the warmeſt air of the country is that of vallies, ſheltered by riſing grounds; but this is uſually
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0246501200:22"/>damp; and more miſchief will ariſe from it than good.</p>
               <p>Therefore the choice reſts ſolely upon a gentle aſcent: the beſt place of all is toward the bottom of a ground, which does not in any part riſe to a very great height; and if there be a running water at the bottom it is ſo far perfect.</p>
               <p>But more than this muſt be conſulted for the country reſidence of the old man, or of any who would live to be old. The ſoil is of vaſt conſequence; and ſo is the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure. A clayey bottom muſt be avoided; becauſe it is always cold, and the air about it raw and damp. Rains cannot get thro' it, and they lodge till they are evaporated, chilling the ground, and loading the air with their moiſture.</p>
               <p>A clean gravel is the beſt of all. The air over this is warm, and naturally dry; for rain ſoaks through it.</p>
               <p>The north and north-eaſt winds are worſt for old men: therefore let them ſhelter themſelves from theſe by a proper choice of ſituation. Let the deſcent of the ground face the ſouth-weſt; and then the natural riſe will keep off the bleak and cold air from the oppoſite quarters. This may be aſſiſted alſo by plantations of trees; and thus the true ſeat of health and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0246501200:23"/>may be eſtabliſhed, ſo far as theſe great points concern them.</p>
               <p>He is happy who has made ſuch a choice in time; and he ſtill happier who finds him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf now in good time to make it. The later ſuch a reſidence is choſen, the more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully muſt the owner accuſtom himſelf to it: firſt in ſummer; and by degrees and at times at other periods of the year. An air thus choſen, will then give all the great articles age wants, appetite, digeſtion, and a free circulation.</p>
               <p>Exerciſe will be eaſy; and it will be pleaſant in ſuch a ſpot: but let this be under the regulation of good ſenſe. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is better than walking; but let not the old man do himſelf more hurt by a raſh and careleſs indulgence in this than it can do him ſervice. Let him never enjoy the air but when it is in a condition to do him good, nor venture upon the ground but when it is fit for his feet.</p>
               <p>No country houſe is without a garden; and the beſt part of this will be a good gravel walk. Let it be open to the ſouth-weſt, and well defended from the dangerous quarters. Let it be laid toler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably round, that the water may not lodge; and let it be kept well rolled, hard and ſmooth.</p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:0246501200:24"/>
               <p>In favourable weather he may walk in pathways in the fields: but in ſuch as is not ſo good, this walk will be highly uſeful: let him never come upon it till the dew is off the graſs; and let the ſetting ſun be the laſt object he ſees from it; even in the beſt weather.</p>
               <p>The air of early morning and of late evening is cold and unwholeſome: but ſome hours of the firſt part of the day, paſſed conſtantly on ſuch a walk, will add many years to life; and what is much better, it will give health with them.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. VI.</hi> Of exerciſe for old men.</head>
               <p>AIR led us to mention already the firſt of exerciſes, which is walking; and for thoſe who can indulge themſelves in this, there is none better: but feeble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and various accidents often deny its uſe to thoſe who moſt of all want mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. In this caſe, riding on horſeback is the next in excellence. And the beſt hours of the day muſt be choſen for that, in the ſame manner as for the other. In ſevere weather it is neceſſary to keep un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſhelter; and at all times to avoid damp or bleak places.</p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:0246501200:25"/>
               <p>Diverſions afford excellent exerciſe. Bowling is one: but the ſame care muſt be taken, that this be at a proper time. A chariot may ſupply the place of a horſe to thoſe who are more feeble; and when even this is too much, there will be a great deal of good in being driven along in thoſe chairs which are made to run about gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den-walks.</p>
               <p>To thoſe who are fond of gardening, nothing affords ſo happy, or ſo conſtant exerciſe. We do not mean that they ſhould dig, or weed the ground: but that employment which will give exerciſe without labour, and which no hand will ſo well perform as that of the Maſter; the trimming of ſhrubs, and flowering plants, the management of eſpaliers; the removal of ſeedling-flowers; the thining of fruit upon the trees; and the following and overlooking the other ſeveral works. Here will at leaſt be more and more briſk walking than otherwiſe; and in many things the little uſe of the hands will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat that exerciſe; continuing it perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly through the body.</p>
               <p>The only danger of this healthy and happy courſe, is that it is too tempting. Let him who falls into it take an invariable
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0246501200:26"/>reſolution, never to let his fondneſs for the garden carry him out too early, or keep him out too late.</p>

               <p>THE benefit of exerciſe all know; but all cannot take it. The wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will ſometimes deny the uſe of thoſe kinds we have named to ſuch as are moſt able to take them: and in this caſe, any buſtling about within doors, whether in the light of buſineſs or amuſement, will anſwer the purpoſe. The adjuſting an eſcritoire, or the new arranging the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes in a book-caſe have often produced this good effect; and billiards, or other entertainments which afford means of ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring within the houſe, anſwer the ſame purpoſe.</p>
               <p>To thoſe who are too weak for exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, even the mildeſt, and in the beſt weather, the beſt relief is a fleſh-bruſh; and its effects are more than can be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined. We know what we expect from exerciſe; and in old men, the greateſt of its advantages is the aſſiſting circulation. The fleſh-bruſh does this nearly in as
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0246501200:27"/>great a degree, excepting for the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate time: but to have the full benefit, it muſt be conſtantly and frequently repeated.</p>
               <p>Another excellent ſuccedaneum for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe is waſhing the body with warm water and rubbing it very well with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated dry cloaths afterwards. This has many peculiar advantages: the warmth aſſiſts perſpiration; the waſhing opens the pores; and the rubing afterwards is at leaſt equal to the effect of the fleſh-bruſh. The warmth and moiſture join alſo in ſoftening the ſkin, and rendering it ſupple; and this is a great point, for it is apt to grow hard and dry with age.</p>
               <p>Care muſt be taken to avoid taking cold after this. The beſt time for it is even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a warm bedchamber; and the bed ſhould be ready immediately, that the perſon may go into it hot.</p>
               <p>The hands and feet ſhould have their full ſhare in this waſhing and rubing, for the circulation is weakeſt there, and the pores are moſt liable to be ſtoped. The warm bath anſwers, in ſome degree, this purpoſe; and will be ſpoken of hereafter: but it is rather to be uſed as a remedy than a preſervative; and we are here treating of old men in health.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. IX.</hi> Of a regulation of the temper. And of the paſſions.</head>
               <p>WITHOUT entering into the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of the moraliſt or preacher, we may ſay the paſſions demand great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard in preſerving the health of old men. The motion of the blood in circulation is greatly affected and altered by them; and the nerves ſuffer more. The whole frame is diſordered; and I have often ſeen diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, and ſometimes immediate death the conſequence of giving full way to them.</p>
               <p>Nothing in this world is worth the trouble and diſtreſs men bring upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves about it, by giving way to immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate paſſions. Life is the greateſt bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and health the next; and theſe ſuffer by that fond indulgence.</p>
               <p>That the circulation is diſordered by paſſions, we know from the true and certain indication of the pulſe. In anger it beats violent and hard; in grief faint and ſlow; terrors make it irregular; and ſhame impedes its motions.</p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:0246501200:29"/>
               <p>Theſe are ſure notices of a diſordered circulation; and old men cannot bear this even for a time without damage. The ſtrength of youth reſtores all to its for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſtate when the guſt is over: but age is weak, and cannot. Philoſophy teaches the governing our paſſions; and it is true wiſdom. The old man ſhould love him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf too well to indulge them. It is not worth his while. Quiet and regularity of life in every reſpect are his buſineſs: and as he is paſt the fluttering pleaſures of youth, let him place himſelf above its troubles.</p>
               <p>Good humour, and a ſatisfaction of mind will give the aged many more years, and much happineſs in them. Diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and diſturbance wear out nature: but the temper, we adviſe, preſerves her in good condition.</p>
               <p>Of all paſſions let the old man avoid a fooliſh fondneſs for women. This ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver will ſolicit him, for nature knows her own time, and the appetite decays with the power; but if he ſolicit that which he cannot enjoy, he will diſturb his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution more than by any other means whatever; and while he is ſhortening his life; and robing the poor remainder
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0246501200:30"/>he allows of peace, he will be only making himſelf the ridicule of thoſe who ſeem to favour his vain and ineffectual de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires.</p>
               <p>In paſſionate people, what we blame as their fault, is often their misfortune. Some, from a tyrannical diſpoſition, have fixed this humour upon themſelves by cuſtom, with no other cauſe; but for one of theſe there are a hundred whoſe fury of temper is owing to a diſorder in their body.</p>
               <p>We know madneſs is a diſeaſe; and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent paſſion is a temporary madneſs. This alſo ariſes often from a redundance of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, and medicines will cure it.</p>
               <p>Let the paſſionate old man conſider, that he hurts himſelf more than any body elſe, by his anger; and he will then wiſh to be cured of its tyranny. Let him examine himſelf, whether it be a diſorder of his mind; and his phyſician, whether it lie in his body. In the firſt caſe the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy is philoſophy; but in the latter, a few medicines will reſtore him to temper: to that temper on which his life and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs depend.</p>
               <p>Let the haſty old man cool himſelf by phyſic and a low diet: and let him who
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0246501200:31"/>is melancholy and gloomy baniſh the everlaſting fear of death by warmer foods, cordial medicines, and that beſt of cordials, wine. Theſe will drive away much more than the apprehenſion of death, they will put off the reality: for melancholy would have ſunk the feeble, long before his time.</p>
               <p>Of all ſtates in the mind a diſturb'd hurry of the nerves is moſt to be avoided. The blood and ſpirits are diſorder'd by this much more than by exerciſe or bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly motion; and they are much longer in coming to themſelves again. Exerciſe ceaſes abſolutely when 'tis over: but the ſtorms of the mind leave a ſwelling ſea, which ſtrength of body alone can calm: and in age this ſtrength is faint.</p>
               <p>No diſeaſe is more miſchievous to weak old perſons than a purging: and I have ſeen this brought on inſtantly by a fit of paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, or a fright. Medicines have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to relieve the patient in vain. That which would have been ſtop'd, if natural, by a ſpoonful of chalk julep, or a doſe of diaſcordium, has in this caſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the perſon to a ſkeleton, and ſunk him into the grave in ſpite of all help.</p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:0246501200:32"/>
               <p>Why ſhould the old man diſturb his mind with paſſion? or what ſhould he dread? Death is his great terror; and he is very abſurd who brings it on by leſſer fears.</p>
               <p>Joy, tho' only a greater degree of ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, is in a violent or outrageous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree as hurtful as the other paſſions: it hurries the circulation vehemently and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regularly; it exhauſts the ſpirits; and it has often occaſioned ſudden death. It is a violence of youth; it belongs to that period of life properly: that can bear it, and to that let us leave it. Let the old man be as the quakers in this point, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways chearful but never merry.</p>
               <p>Laſt let me caution the aged man who would be happy, and would live much longer, to combat with all his power that dangerous enemy covetouſneſs. 'Tis known univerſally, and we have ſacred atteſtation of it, that too earneſt careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs brings age before its time; and in age it brings death prematurely. The old are in no danger of extravagance, and the care of heaping up for others, when it ſhortens their own life, is more than any heir can deſerve from them.</p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:0246501200:33"/>
               <p>Eaſe and good humour are the great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients of a happy life, and the principal means of a long one. The whole leſſon extends but thus much farther, that the old man love life ſo well, and value ſo little all the accidents that belong to it, that he do not give a vain attention to a part which may rob him of the whole.</p>

The old man has been cautioned againſt the cold air of evenings; and after a light ſupper, and an hour or two of ſocial converſation with his family and his neighbours, bed will be his beſt place.</p>
               <p>Sleep was intended to recruit nature, and reſtore the waſted ſpirits. This is neceſſary to all perſons; but to the aged
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0246501200:34"/>moſt, becauſe they can leaſt bear the waſte of them. The paſſions will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turb all conſtitutions, but thoſe of old perſons moſt: ſleep compoſes theſe. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 'tis of excellent uſe to them: and they may indulge in it longer than the young.</p>
               <p>Six hours is as much as a perſon in the prime of life ſhould ſleep; but in age eight or ten, according to the peculiar conſtitution, will be more proper.</p>
               <p>The natural ſeaſon of ſleep is night, and let the old man go to bed in ſuch time that he may paſs theſe hours of reſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out breaking in upon the morning. In general the moſt healthful cuſtom is to go to bed at ten at night, and riſe at eight in the morning.</p>
               <p>If the mind be hurry'd, or from any other cauſe the perſon finds he cannot compoſe himſelf to reſt ſoon after going to bed, let him ſtill riſe at the ſame time the following morning: and the next evening prepare himſelf for better ſleep. Let him go into a warm bath; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge himſelf with a glaſs of wine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the ordinary allowance, a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore bed time. This will take off his watchfulneſs; and he will ſink into the moſt pleaſing ſlumber.</p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:0246501200:35"/>
               <p>The contrary practice of lying in bed in the morning, to make up for want of ſleep at night, is every way extreamly wrong. As nothing refreſhes like ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſleep, nothing weakens and dejects a perſon more than long lying in bed in the morning. There is alſo this far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ill conſequence, that the perſon is never ſleepy again at the due time of the evening ſucceeding; and thus what was at firſt an accident, becomes by indulgence a cuſtom; the more difficult to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd and the more hurtful.</p>
               <p>He who has obſerved a temperate diet, and goes to bed regularly at ten o'clock, will naturally wake towards eight: and when he wakes let him get up: he will then be in ſpirits for the day. If on the contrary he lies doſing, he will get into a weakening ſweat: and he will be low ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited during the following day; and wak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and watchful at night.</p>
               <p>On theſe little circumſtances do the health or ſickneſs, the happineſs or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſs of old perſons depend in a great meaſure. We do not perceive them, or we overlook them: let us be for the future more careful. There is no pain in the living regularly in old age; and the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0246501200:36"/>conſequence of it is certain, a longer life, and every day of it more agreeable.</p>

               <p>HITHERTO we have treated of the condition of perſons advanced in years who are healthy: and the rules we have laid down are for preſerving and continuing that ſtate. He who ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves them duly will not fail of ſucceſs.</p>
               <p>We now ſhall conſider the ſeveral faults in the conſtitution at this period of life; and the diſeaſes riſing from them. The old man may be ſo far his own doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, as to amend the general diſtempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of his body, and to prevent thoſe diſeaſes: but if he fall into them, by neglect of theſe cautions, or in ſpite of their force, let him then call in the phyſician. We can adviſe him how to preſerve health when he has it; and how to remedy general diſorders ſo as to prevent more particular ones, if a due regimen may do that: but he is a very ill judge of the human frame, who will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to remedy its diſeaſes without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0246501200:37"/>in its ſtructure, and the virtues of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies: and he would be a bad member of ſociety who gave ſuch advice. It were as eaſy to teach any other art by writing; and as rational to attempt making a watchmaker, or a ſhipbuilder, by deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the tools. The whole life of the phyſician ſpent in attention and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence hardly qualifies him for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking: how then ſhould a few words give due information?</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XI.</hi> Of a fulneſs of blood.</head>
               <p>AN over-fullneſs of blood naturally brings on a redundance of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther humours: for as they are ſeparated from the blood, they naturally encreaſe with it in quantity; and the one or the other may, and naturally will, occaſion diſorders; much more both.</p>
               <p>The old man may know he has too much blood in his veins from theſe plain ſymptoms: his pulſe will be full and ſtrong, and quicker than it ſhould; his complexion ruddy; and his urine high coloured. The veins alſo will be ſwelled, and his breathing difficult.</p>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:0246501200:38"/>
               <p>The occaſion of all this has been too large feeding, and too little exerciſe: therefore the plain method to abate the ſymptoms, and prevent the miſchief they threaten, is by more motion, and an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemious diet.</p>
               <p>This is the change to be made: but it muſt not be ſudden. We have obſerved before, that all haſty alterations are dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous; but as this is ſlowly, let it be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly brought on. As there is in ſuch a caſe no diſeaſe come on as yet from the fulneſs, there will not any come on during a gradual courſe of emptying the veſſels by this practice. Nature will be relieved thus in a ſatisfactory manner, whereas ſhe would have been too violently diſturbed by a ſhock.</p>
               <p>The firſt rule is to retrench one third part from the fleſh eaten at dinner; of whatever kind that be. We have adviſed the abſtaining from beef and pork: but in this caſe mutton ſhould be alſo let alone, or very rarely eaten; and the din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner being made ſolely of the tender and young meats in this reduced quantity; and the next care muſt be, that theſe are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways well and thoroughly done.</p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:0246501200:39"/>
               <p>Let the perſon riſe an hour before the uſual time in a morning, and every day encreaſe the quantity of exerciſe a little: but with great care not to go out at im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper hours to endanger taking cold. In getting rid of one evil let us not run into another. This fulneſs is a ſtate in which diſeaſes are moſt eaſily brought on, and will be moſt violent. Colds are very dangerous to people in this condition, and therefore are moſt carefully to be avoided.</p>
               <p>The pulſe will ſhew whether this method reduces the redundance: and if it do not take a viſible effect in five days, it will be proper to be blooded. After this the ſame regimen will compleat the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and there will be no need for medicines.</p>
               <p>If all this fail, the warm bath every other day will probably anſwer the purpoſe. In all old mens caſes 'tis beſt to avoid medicines, if it could be done with ſafety; for they diſturb the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and the beſt guard of theſe perſons health is quietneſs.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XII.</hi> Of waſting and decay.</head>
               <p>WHEN old perſons fall into this condition, it generally carries them off. But many may be ſaved by timely care, to whom no remedies will be of ſervice after a firſt neglect. While the ſtomach is able to digeſt any thing, there is hope of recovery; but when its power is loſt, food and phyſick are thrown down the throat in vain.</p>
               <p>When an old man perceives his fleſh waſting, and his ſtrength and ſpirits fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, let him take good nouriſhment, and adapt it to the condition of his ſtomach. If it be too ſtrong, or if he take too much, the digeſtive faculty, impaired by general weakneſs, cannot manage it. He will haſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten his death by ſuch a conduct.</p>
               <p>The rule is to eat only innocent and nouriſhing things, and theſe in moderate quantities: chicken, young lamb, and veal boiled down almoſt to jelly, are the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per foods for dinner, and of theſe let him eat leſs than his appetite demands.</p>
               <p>Two hours before dinner, let him take half a pint of chicken broth; and as his
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0246501200:41"/>his ſtomach ſtrengthens, veal or mutton broth; and the ſame one hour after his light dinner.</p>
               <p>Let the breakfaſt be a yolk of an egg, beaten up with half a pint of aſſes milk, and a quarter of an ounce of conſerve of roſes: and his ſupper veal broth nearly boiled to a jelly.</p>
               <p>Every afternoon let him take half a pint of aſſes milk alone: and while this is doing, let there be no violent evacuations. A purging would be deſtructive; and morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſweats are very hurtful. Let him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore riſe early: and to compleat the cure, let him believe theſe methods will perform it: an eaſy mind will do more than food or phyſic.</p>
               <p>Quiet, good humour, and complacen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of temper will prevent half the diſeaſes of old people; and cure many of the others.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XIII.</hi> Againſt ſharp humours.</head>
               <p>THE firſt ſign of ſharp humours in the bodies of old perſons is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſs at the ſtomach: then comes on a want of appetite, with ſour belchings, wind, purgings, and defluctions; thirſt, and a feveriſh diſpoſition.</p>
               <p>The fault lies originally in the ſtomach; and generally an irregular diet has been the cauſe: high ſauces, bad wines, and ſpicy foods. The firſt ſtep to a cure is to abſtain from theſe; and life depends upon it: for to aggravate thoſe ſymptoms is to deſtroy the conſtitution utterly: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable fevers, or fatal purgings follow.</p>
               <p>The beſt beginning is by a vomit: and after this the diet muſt be all of the mild and cooling kind. Every morning let the perſon take two ſpoonfuls of ſyrup of ſnails made by bruiſing them with ſugar, and hanging them up in a flannel bag till the juice runs out: and at meals, let the drink be a tea made of marſhmallow and liquorice-root, with one third part milk, and drank juſt warm. If the ſkin grow yellow, or the white of the eyes
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0246501200:43"/>appear of that colour, a doſe of rhubarb once in three days will be needful. The beſt method of taking it is by chew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>This is as much phyſick as we would have the old man uſe in ſuch a caſe: the reſt muſt be done by a proper regimen: let him regulate his paſſions: violent anger will increaſe this diſorder more than the moſt improper foods. Let him alſo ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh fear. If he thinks himſelf in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, he will bring on that danger.</p>
               <p>He muſt never overload his ſtomach; nor ever ſuffer it to be empty. Once in two hours he ſhould ſwallow ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing Jellies of hartſhorn, truly made, are excellent; but they muſt be prepared at home: for cheating is ſo eaſy, and the true method with hartſhorn only is ſo te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious, that few who make them for ſale will do it honeſtly.</p>
               <p>Often this complaint riſes from a ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page of perſpiration in ſome part, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly in the feet. Then the buſineſs is to bring it on again by additional warmth: as by flannel ſocks and yarn ſtockings. This will in many caſes alone perform the cure; and in all others, where ſuch a ſtoppage
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0246501200:44"/>has been a part of the cauſe, it will aſſiſt the other methods.</p>
               <p>The pulſe, which was at firſt too quick, will grow moderate as theſe cautions take place, and this promiſes a cure. To com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat it, the patient muſt go to bed in time, and uſe moderate exerciſe in the beſt hours of the day. He muſt eat no fat meats, drink little wine, and avoid care and uneaſineſs of mind.</p>
               <p>If he do not ſleep well, he muſt take a ſmall doſe of ſyrup of diacodium every night.</p>
               <p>This method will reſtore him to health, and it muſt be preſerved with due care afterwards, elſe relapſes in this caſe are frequent. A vomit once in ſix weeks, and a doſe of rhubarb every ten days, with a careful diet, will make this a very healthy conſtitution.</p>
               <p>The great care is taking the defect in time; for new diſorders are eaſily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered, but eſtabliſhed ones are too ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate for ſuch conſtitutions.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XIV.</hi> Of pains and inflammations.</head>
               <p>IT is proper to treat of theſe together, becauſe they generally come together. We need not tell the old man where he is in pain: but he muſt examine careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly whether there be inflammation with it.</p>
               <p>This he will know by his pulſe beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hard and quick, and by high coloured urine: his fleſh alſo will be hotter than uſual. When pains come on without theſe ſymptoms, warmth in the part, and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience are the remedies: they muſt be conſidered as the lot of age, and born ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly: but when theſe ſymptoms join with them they threaten dangerous conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences.</p>
               <p>The firſt ſtep is bleeding: and this with abſtinence from all hot foods often per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms the cure.</p>
               <p>If there be no relief, the next day but one a vomit will be proper. If the body be coſtive, it inflames all the ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms; and if purges be given, they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the violent motion of the blood: and therefore do more hurt than ſervice. Cooling and oily glyſters are the proper
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0246501200:46"/>method; and they ſhould be repeated every morning.</p>
               <p>The diet muſt be light and cool: all ſolid foods ſhould be omitted for the firſt four or five days, and in their place aſſes milk ſhould be taken: and chicken broth and jellies muſt be the nouriſhment dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this period.</p>
               <p>After this, as the diſorder abates, the ſtrength muſt be conſidered; and by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees the uſual diet ſuch is as here recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended for healthy old men may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced. But this muſt be done gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, and with great caution; otherwiſe, a ſudden change, from low to richer diet, will certainly bring on the complaint again; and worſe inflammation.</p>

               <p>The great rule in old men's diſorders is to take them in time. This will be cured by proper diet when it is regarded early: otherwiſe medicines muſt be called in, and perhaps they will be ineffectual.</p>
               <p>The quantity of ſolid food ſhould be abated; but it ſhould not be left off whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. The drink ſhould be made of burnt hartſhorn and comfry root, two ounces of each boiled in two quarts of water to three pints, the liquor poured clear off, and drank warm with a little red wine.</p>
               <p>Rice-milk, with ſome cinnamon boiled in it, is excellent for breakfaſt; and rice-pudding for ſupper; two hours before bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time.

               <p>OLD perſons are very ſubject to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions in the urinary paſſages; and the various degrees of the gravel and ſtone follow. Theſe are diſorders difficult of cure; but they are eaſily prevented in moſt conſtitutions.</p>
               <p>Let thoſe who are ſubject to ſlight com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of this kind avoid wine, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply its place by beer of a due ſtrength.</p>
               <p>Let the diet be cooling: and in regard to exerciſe, the rule is moderation. Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent motion, or reſt for a long time toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, are equally wrong. Let the patient walk every day in the proper hours; and when the weather does not permit that, let him uſe the ſame exerciſe in his cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</p>
               <p>When fits come on, let him take man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na and oil: this is an eaſy and effectual medicine. Two ounces of manna ſhould be diſſolved in half a pint of water, and ſix ſpoonfuls of ſallad oil added to it. A ſpoonful of this taken every half hour will ſtay upon the ſtomach, aſſwage pain, ſtop
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0246501200:49"/>the vomitings which often attend this complaint; and at the ſame time procure ſtools: and while it eaſes the cholick pains will give paſſage to the ſtone.</p>
               <p>This is the courſe in the violence of a fit. When it is perceived coming on, an infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of BURDOCK ROOT ſlic'd, is the beſt remedy. Two ounces of the freſh root and a quart of boiling water poured on it makes this infuſion. The liquor is to be ſtrained off as ſoon as cold: and half a pint, a little warmed again, with a quarter of a pint of milk, and ſweetened with honey, is to be taken every four hours.</p>
               <p>This is the medicine lately publiſhed for the gout; and which many are now taking for that diſeaſe with great ſucceſs. The gout and gravel are nearly ally'd, and it is not ſtrange the ſame remedy is ſo effectual alſo in this caſe. The wonder is, that a plant of great virtue, and ſo common, has been ſo long neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the practiſers of phyſick.</p>
               <p>Of the gout it would be vain to treat here. 'Tis a peculiar ſubject, and requires a larger compaſs than any ſingle article can be allowed in this work: and it has been conſidered ſeparately in that treatiſe.</p>

               <p>OLD men muſt expect a decay of ſtrength: and it would be as idle to call it a diſeaſe, as vain to think of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies. But, beſides this which is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and neceſſary, weakneſs is ſometimes accidental, and it may thus be remedied.</p>
               <p>Great evacuations, intenſe ſtudy, violent paſſions, or a too low diet will ſometimes bring it on before the natural time, and a proper care and regimen may remove it.</p>
               <p>A lowneſs of the pulſe, feebleneſs of the limbs, a paleneſs of the face, waſte of fleſh, and low ſpirits are the ſymptoms by which this is known; and the remedies are cordial medicines, and a ſomewhat richer diet.</p>
               <p>The medicine I have found moſt effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual is this: a quarter of an ounce of ſaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fron, a dram of cinnamon, and an ounce of confection alkermes in a quart of white wine: when this has ſtood two days it ſhould be poured off, and half a wine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glaſs of it drank once a day.</p>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:0246501200:51"/>
               <p>Reſt of mind and body are alſo in this caſe great articles toward the cure. Let not the patient think he is in danger: let him venture to eat ſomewhat richer meats, but in a moderate quantity, and indulge in one extraordinary glaſs of wine at every meal.</p>
               <p>Let him riſe early; but not go out 'till the air is well warmed by the ſun, and the dews are diſperſed. If he reſide in London at the time, let him immediately go into the country: if he be too looſe in his bowels let him check it moderately by the means we have directed; and let his malt liquor be ſtrong of the hop.</p>
               <p>Between breakfaſt and dinner let him every day take a yolk of a new laid egg beat up in a glaſs of ſtrong white wine. The company of agreeable friends will be the beſt medicine in an evening; and good broth his fitteſt ſupper.</p>

               <p>THIS is a common complaint with aged perſons; and there is none more troubleſome. 'Tis difficult of cure: but relief is eaſy: and it will depend as much on the air as all other conſiderations together.</p>

               <p>The ſmoak of London is very bad; and the ill ſmells from many of the trades carried on there is as hurtful. No perſon ſubject to an aſthma ſhould live near tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in the country, nor tallow chandlers, or the like offenſive trades in London.</p>
               <p>Exerciſe at proper times is vaſtly bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial in this caſe. Walking or riding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore dinner and ſupper are particularly proper.</p>
               <p>Frequent waſhing the feet in warm water, with good rubing with dry cloaths afterwards, is alſo highly ſerviceable.</p>
               <p>All cold and viſcous foods muſt be avoided. The ſtomach muſt not be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to be empty, nor muſt it be loaded.
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0246501200:53"/>The food ſhould be of the richeſt kind that is proper for perſons advanced in years; and to aſſiſt digeſtion two or three diſhes of good tea, made carefully and taken with little ſugar and without milk, ſhould be drank conſtantly, two hours and a half after dinner.</p>
               <p>Vegetables ſhould be avoided, and one great caution ſhould be not to drink too much of any liquor whatſoever.</p>
               <p>Bleeding is uſually neceſſary; and the condition of the blood will ſhew whether it ſhould be in larger or ſmaller quantity; and whether or not it will require to be ſoon repeated.</p>
               <p>If the blood be ſizey theſe repeated bleedings will be neceſſary; and the ſame condition of it ſhews the body can ſpare theſe quantities. It ſhews alſo, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out theſe bleedings medicines can take no effect.</p>
               <p>After this the greateſt preſervative a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſharp or repeated fits is the famous gum ammoniacum. A quarter of an ounce of this being diſſolved in half a pint of water, two ſpoonfuls ſhould be taken, according to the ſymptoms, every night, or every ſecond or third night.</p>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:0246501200:54"/>
               <p>This method will prevent many fits, and abate the ſeverity of thoſe which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be put off.</p>
               <p>Thus the old man, even againſt the fury of this worſt diſturbance of his life, and all the reſt, will live happy: and be ought to value that happineſs the more becauſe he will owe it to his own diſcretion.</p>
