            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <p>IN drawing up this Report, according to the plan laid down by the Board of Agriculture, we have endeavoured to be as conciſe as poſſible, except in thoſe articles which are in a great meaſure peculiar to this diſtrict, ſome of which, we have reaſon to think, may be adopted with advantage in others.</p>
                  <p>It is ſcarcely poſſible, in an undertaking of this kind, to deſcribe all the minutiae of practice, or to notice every local improvement; but we hope that the moſt prominent features of the Agriculture of Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland, as exiſting in <hi>1795,</hi> will be found faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully recorded in the following ſheets.</p>
                  <p>As weights and meaſures vary in different diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricts, we think it right to apprize our readers that, in the following Reports of Northumberland and Cumberland,</p>

                        <p>The county of Northumberland is divided into ſix Wards.—viz. Tindale Ward, Coquetdale Ward, Glen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale Ward, Bamborough Ward, Morpeth Ward, and Caſtle Ward.—The three firſt are ſituated in the weſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern part of the county, and include the whole of the mountainous diſtrict, with a conſiderable portion of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed cultivated country:—The three latter adjoin the ſea coaſt, and being exempt from mountainous diſtrict, have been long under cultivation; the vaſt reſources of coal, Caſtle Ward in particular poſſeſſes, and the increaſed population the coal trade occaſions, give them a decided preference in point of riches and population; tho' in point of magnitude, conſiderably the ſmalleſt, occupying leſs than one fourth of the county.</p>

                           <hi>Norhamſhire</hi> and <hi>Iſlandſhire</hi> are ſituated at the northern extremity of the county of Northumberland, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend a triangular ſpace, the two ſides of which are formed by the River Tweed and German Ocean, and the baſe the northern boundary of Glendale and Bambro' Ward; it contains about 72 ſquare miles of well-inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed cultivated country.</p>

                           <hi>Bedlingtonſhire</hi> is ſituated at the ſouth-eaſt corner of Caſtle Ward, bounded on the eaſt by the German Ocean, and on the north and ſouth by the rivers Wanſbeck and Blyth, and contains about 30 ſquare miles.</p>

                           <hi>The Climate</hi>—in regard to temperature, is ſubject to great variation; upon the mountains, ſnow will often continue for ſeveral months, (and may frequently be ſeen there of a conſiderable depth) when there is none in the lower diſtricts. The weather is very inconſtant, but moſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0179800900:11"/>runs in extremes. In the Spring months, the cold, piercing, eaſterly winds are moſt prevalent; and our longeſt droughts are always accompanied by them: in ſome places they have acquired the name of <hi>ſea-pines,</hi> from the ſlow progreſs vegetation makes whenever they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue for a few weeks. Rain is of little uſe while they prevail, from the great cold which always attends them.</p>
                        <p>The mild weſtern and ſouthern breezes rarely take place before June; they are certain harbingers of rain and vigorous vegetation, and are the moſt prevailing winds through the Summer and Autumn: In the latter ſeaſon, they often blow with tempeſtuous fury, daſh out the corn, and diſappoint the juſt hopes of the induſtrious farmer.</p>
                        <p>Our greateſt falls of ſnow, or rain, are from the ſouth, or ſouth-eaſt; and whenever we have a very high <hi>weſt wind,</hi> it is a certain ſign that a great quantity of rain is falling to the weſtward, in Cumberland and Roxburgh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire.</p>

                           <hi>Sandy, gravelly, and dry loam</hi>—or what is here more generally underſtood by turnip ſoil, is found on the banks of the Tyne, from Newburn to Haltwhiſtle; on the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet, about and above Rothbury; on the Aln, from its mouth to Alnwick; and down Tweed-ſide: But the greateſt quantity of this kind of ſoil is found in the vales of Breamiſh, Till, and Beaumont.

                        <p>The aſpect of this county, in reſpect to ſurface, is mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with great variety; along the ſea-coaſt, it is nearly level; towards the middle, the ſurface is more diverſified, and thrown into large ſwelling ridges, formed by the principal rivers:—Theſe parts are well incloſed; in ſome places enriched with wood and recent plantations, but the general appearance is deſtitute of thoſe ornaments:— The weſtern part (except a few intervening vales) is an extenſive ſcene of open, mountainous diſtrict, where the hand of Cultivation is rarely to be traced.</p>
                        <p>Of the mountainous diſtricts, thoſe around Cheviot are the moſt valuable; being in general fine green hills, thrown (by ſome of thoſe convulſive changes which this globe has at ſome time experienced) into numberleſs variety of forms; the verdant, ſwift-ſloping ſides of which, incloſe and ſhelter many deep, narrow glens: through the whole of this diſtrict no mineral or other kind of ſtone is found, except brown, red, and grey whinſtone: —they extend from the head of Coquet, down to Allen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton; from thence northward to Prendwick, Branton, Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derton, Wooler, Kirknewton, and Mindrim, and occupy at leaſt an area of 90000 acres.</p>
                        <p>The other mountainous diſtricts lie chiefly on the weſtern part of the county, ſome of which adjoin the county of Durham; but the largeſt portion extends from the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Wall to the river Coquet (with a few intervening
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0179800900:13"/>incloſed vales) and to the moors north of Rothbury.— They are not marked by any ſtriking irregularities of ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, being in general extenſive, open, ſolitary waſtes, growing little elſe but heath, and affording a hard ſubſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to the flocks that depaſture them.</p>

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0179800900:18"/>the collieries; which has conſiderably reduced the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of oats in this neighbourhood.</p>
                        <p>Many of the collieries are ſituated at a conſiderable diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from the river, to which the coals are conveyed from the pits in a peculiar kind of carriage, called a <hi>New-caſtle coalwaggon; (pl.</hi> 1, <hi>fig.</hi> 1.) it has 4 ſmall wheels, about 34 inches diameter, <hi>fixed to the axles,</hi> with which they turn round, and move on a road (called the waggon-way) made on purpoſe <hi>with wood,</hi> which is formed by long pieces of wood (RA, rails) about 4 inches ſquare, laid length-ways, upon ſleepers of wood (SSS) and the thickneſs of the rail above the plane of the reſt of the road, and at the exact diſtance of the waggon wheels from each other, as it is upon thoſe rails the wheels run.</p>
                        <p>A new waggon-way (including timber, levelling, gravel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and workmanſhip) will coſt about 5s. per yard, or 440l. per mile; and the expence of keeping it in repair is generally about 1½d. per chaldron on a quantity of 15000 chaldrons annually, or 93l. 15s. 0d. per mile.<note n="*" place="bottom">It has been ſuggeſted, that a waggon-way might be ſubſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in lieu of turnpike roads, for the conveyance of heavy goods; but we preſume, that the expence of firſt making, laying out in nearly a level line, or ſo as to have little or no aſcent, and keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in repair, would greatly overbalance the additional weight to be drawn by one horſe; as the wood rots and waſtes nearly as much by a ſmall quantity of carriage paſſing along it, as a larger.</note>

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0179800900:29"/>ſhells, both univalve and bivalve, many of which are yet perfect, forming a ſtratum ſeveral feet in depth of pure calcareous earth; but the exact depth of this bed of marl has never yet been aſcertained, for want of a proper level to carry off the water: It probably may afford matter of ſpeculation to ſome readers to be informed, that in the middle of this marl there is an horizontal ſtratum of ſand about 12 inches thick; and alſo that, a few years ſince, a <hi>Red Deer Stag,</hi> in the attitude of running, and in every part complete, was found embedded in the marl: horns of the ſame animal have been found at different times in perfect preſervation; and a part of the <hi>ſcalp,</hi> with the <hi>cores</hi> of a pair of horns belonging to ſome animal of the <hi>Bos Taurus</hi> ſpecies, were lately found here: we have never ſeen any breed of cattle, the horns of which were of equal magnitude; for though the outſide ſhell or horn part was wanting, yet the <hi>core</hi> was 24 inches long, and 12 inches circumference at the root; and when in a perfect ſtate and covered with the outſide ſhell, muſt have been about 5 inches diameter: their form is a gentle curve, and have all the appearance of a pair of bull's horns; but probably of a different breed of cattle to any we have at preſent.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Clay Marl,</hi>—is alſo found in ſmall quantities, but in ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations where it could not be conveniently uſed with effect.</p>

                           <hi>Lead Ore,</hi>—has hitherto never been found in any quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity but in the mountainous diſtricts on the ſouth-weſt part of the county, towards the head of that branch of South Tyne, called Allendale; and a ſmall quantity at Fallowfield, a little to the north of Hexham.<note n="*" place="bottom">The lead mines in Allendale produce about 12000 bings of lead ore annually, which at 4l. 4s. od. per bing, is upwards of 50000l. a year.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>In this county, lead ore is wrought by the <hi>bing,</hi> a meaſure containing 8 cwt. of clean ore; the workmen being paid by the owners of the mine at different prices,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0179800900:30"/>from 8s. to 36s. per <hi>bing</hi> (for getting, and waſhing, or cleaning) according to the richneſs. quality, or hardneſs of the mine. If the owners ſell any of the ore in this ſtate, the price is generally from 3l. 10s. to 4l. 10s. per <hi>bing,</hi> but they moſtly have ſmelt mills of their own, where they ſmelt it at their own coſt, take the ſilver out of it by refining,<note n="*" place="bottom">The Alendale lead ore is ſmelted and refined at Dukesfield ſmelt-mill, and produces about 7 or 8 ounces of ſilver from each fother of lead; what is got at Fallowfield contains ſo little ſilver, that it will not pay the expence of refining; while ſome ore got in Alſton Moor, in Cumberland, yields 42 oz. of ſilver per fother.
<p>The proceſs of refining greatly improves the lead, by making it more ductile.</p>
                           </note> and then caſt the lead into long pieces, call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>pigs</hi> of 1 ½ cwt. each.—<hi>Pig lead</hi> is ſold by the fother, a quantity containing 21 cwt. which is reckoned to ſell at a fair price when at 15l. or 16l. per fother; in 1776 it was as low as 12l. and in the beginning of 1782 it was 17l. 5s.—in 1788 it roſe gradually to 23l. 10s. per fother, which was ſeveral pounds higher than it was ever ſold at before; but in the following year, it ſell to 16l. or 17l per fother, which ſhews the fluctuating price of this article.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Ore of Zink,</hi>—is found in great abundance embed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with ſpar, in moſt of the veins producing lead ore; but its diſtance from any braſs manufactures, and from water carriage, renders it of little value. In theſe mines are alſo found great variety of cryſtallizations of ſpar, quartz, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>The mines which produce lead ore are very fluctuating, and uncertain in point of profit to the adventurers; but tend to a general good, by giving employment to a numer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous claſs of induſtrious workmen, who, being ſituated in a climate improper for the production of grain, are oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to receive the greateſt part of their proviſions from the more fertile diſtricts of the county, and by thoſe means encourage its agriculture.</p>

                        <p>The principal rivers, which act as eſtuaries to the reſt, are the Tyne, Blyth, Wanſbeck, Coquet, Aln, and Tweed.

                        <p>The Tyne and Tweed are the moſt eminent for their navigation, the tide flowing up the former 16 miles, and up the latter eight or ten; the navigation of the other rivers is confined to a ſmall diſtance from their mouths; of theſe the Blyth and Aln are of the moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, from the convenience which the firſt affords to its neighbourhood, for the exportation of conſiderable quantities of coals; and both of them for corn, &amp;c. and the importation of timber, iron, and other uſeful articles.</p>

                        </head>
                        <p>ESTATES vary in their annual value from 20l. to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of 20000l. a year;—one in particular is upwards of 40000l.—Small eſtates from 20l. to 200l. a year, are found in the ſouthern and middle parts of the county, but very rarely in the northern.</p>
                        <p>There are probably few parts of the kingdom where eſtates have made ſuch rapid improvements as in this county; there being ſeveral inſtances of the value being
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0179800900:33"/>more than trebled within the laſt 40 years. Many cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes have certainly been aiding to produce this great ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; but the principal one is attributed to letting large farms, and leaſes for 21 years; by which means the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants of capital were encouraged to make thoſe great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertions, from which ſuch advantages have reſulted, not only to themſelves and proprietors of the land, but to the community at large, from the very increaſed produce, and ſuperiority of its quality.</p>
                        <p>The uſual mode of letting farms is to fix a rent, under certain conditions and covenants, 6 or 12 months before the expiration of the leaſe; but upon one of the largeſt eſtates in the county,<note n="*" place="bottom">The Earl of Tankerville's.</note> the tenants have an offer of their farms 2½ <hi>or</hi> 3 <hi>years</hi> before the expiration of the leaſe, which is a mutual benefit to both landlord and tenant; and is attended with ſo many advantages, that it is in a fair way of being generally adopted.</p>
                        <p>On ſome eſtates the practice of letting farms by <hi>ſecret propoſals</hi> is ſtill in uſe: this is a dark and myſterious mode, which frequently defeats the end it is intended to accompliſh, and inſtead, of obtaining an <hi>exceſſive high rent,</hi> the prize has been often gained at a <hi>very inferior value;</hi> and, in the language of the turf, (where only one has en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the liſts) "by walking the courſe:" and we have known ſome of the firſt farmers in the county forego their farms, rather than ſubmit to contend in the dark. Upon moſt eſtates it is generally ſtipulated, that a certain portion of the beſt old grazing, lands, on each farm, ſhall be kept in graſs during the whole term.</p>
                        <p>The quantity of land to be in ploughing is moſtly limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a certain number of acres; and at the expiration of the term, where the tenant quits on the 12th of May, he is allowed to have a crop of corn from off two-thirds of the arable lands; this is called the <hi>way-going crop:</hi> the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0179800900:34"/>entering tenant has the ſtraw, and leads the crop into the ſtack-yard.—The houſes, hedges, gates, drains, &amp;c. are kept and left in repair by the tenant, who likewiſe pays all taxes, ceſſes, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>Of the annual value of the eſtates in this county, no authentic information could be obtained; but a probable gueſs may be formed by ſuppoſing that there are 800000 acres of cultivated land, and that this on an average is worth 14s. per acre,—and that 450,000 acres of moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainous diſtrict is worth 2s. per acre.</p>

Their minds being open to conviction, they are ready to try new experiments, and adopt every beneficial improvement, that can be learnt in other diſtricts; for this purpoſe many of them have tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed the moſt diſtant parts of the kingdom to obtain agricultural knowledge, and have tranſplanted every prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice they thought ſuperior to thoſe they were acquainted with, or that could be advantageouſly purſued in their own ſituation: And ſcarce a year paſſes without ſome of them making extenſive agricultural tours, for the ſole pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of examining the modes of culture, of purchaſing or hiring the moſt improved breeds of ſtock, and ſeeing the operations of new-invented and moſt uſeful imple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                        <p>The character of a farmer is here ſo reſpectable, that gentlemen who poſſeſs landed property from 500l. to 1500l a year, think it no debaſement to follow the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion:
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0179800900:38"/>and ſo high a name have many of the farmers obtained for their ſuperior knowledge in rural affairs, that they are ſeldom without pupils from various and diſtant parts of the kingdom, with whom they have very hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome premiums.<note n="*" place="bottom">Generally 100l. per annum.</note>—Amongſt the preſent pupils may be reckoned the ſon of an Parl and the ſon of a Baronet;—who, from their abilities, attention, and anxious readineſs to learn and work at every operation, we hope will do cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit to the profeſſion, and render the moſt eſſential ſervices to their reſpective diſtricts.</p>

                        <p>For hoeing the intervals between turnips, or other crops where the ſoil is light, the coulters are taken out, and other ſets of hoes put in the holes made in the ſides CE and DE, and end CD, to hoe from 18 to 30 inches at once; for this purpoſe, in <hi>dry ſeaſons,</hi> it is preferable to the ſingle-horſe plough above deſcribed; and with proper formed hoes, will anſwer all the other purpoſes of expenſive ſcufflers, cultivators, and quicken rakes; though no more than a ſingle-horſe be required to draw it, and its price be only 30 or 40 ſhillings, according to the number and variety of the hoes.</p>

By this means the wheel moves along a ſmooth ſurface between the land-ſide and mould-board M, and the ſeed is depoſited at a regular depth: two inches anſwers very well for beans. With the ſame ſmall plough and drill I have ſown both wheat and barley, at different

                           <hi>Threſhing Machines—</hi> are now becoming general in the northern parts of the country; they are all upon the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of the flax mill; which principle was firſt introduced into this county for threſhing corn, by Mr Edward Greg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, near 32 years ſince; the machine he uſed was work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a man, who could threſh with it 12 buſhels of wheat in a day; but being hard work, and Mr Gregſon dying ſoon after, it was neglected. Mr Wm Menzie, who was ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant with Mr Gregſon at the time, ſays "that his maſter took the idea from a ſmall flax mill which a Scotchman travelled the country with, for the purpoſe of ſwingling the flax which the farmers grew for their own uſe: this portable flax mill was carried in a cart from one farm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe to another, being a cylinder of 5 or 5½ feet diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and 18 inches wide; the ſwitchers were driven by his foot, with a crank like a cutler's wheel; and that the threſhing machine Mr Gregſon had, was made at that time, and exactly the ſame as the ſaid flax mill."—Mr Tho. Gregſon thinks that his brother Edward had ſeen ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of a ſimilar nature in Scotland, probably the ſame which Mr D. Meldrum gives an account of, about the ſame time, in a letter to Mr William Charge of Cleaſby, in the county of York, which he deſcribes as being the ſame as the flax mill; that it threſhed 150 buſhels of
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0179800900:58"/>oats a day, which dropped through a ſkreen into a win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowing machine, that dreſſed at the ſame time.</p>
                        <p>Some time after this, Mr Oxley erected a threſhing machine at Flodden, moved by horſes, in which the corn was fed-in betwixt two <hi>fluted rollers,</hi> and ſtruck by ſwitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, placed as thoſe are in the preſent machines; only they are <hi>hung on hinges.</hi> Thoſe in uſe now, are <hi>fixed</hi> as were thoſe of Mr Gregſon's. The complaint of Mr Oxley's machine was, that it did not threſh common oats clean, probably for want of velocity; for it is found in the machines now uſed, that if the ſwitchers move with a velocity of 1500 feet per minute, they will not threſh clean; and experience has proved, that to threſh com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon oats clean, requires a velocity of 2500 feet per minute.</p>
                        <p>Mr Ilderton erected two threſhing machines, one at Ilderton and another at Hawkhill, worked by horſes, the principle of which was to rub the grain out by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting pieces of wood, (on the circumference of a large cylinder) rubbing againſt ſeveral <hi>fluted rollers:</hi> he uſed it many years, but it was frequently neceſſary to put the ſtraw twice thro' before it was perfectly clean.</p>
                        <p>We were informed by the late Sir Francis Kinlock, Bart. of Gilmerton, Scotland, that while he was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting to perfect Mr Ilderton's machine, he ſaw a port<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able flax mill, made for the uſe of poor families, worked by a man. It ſtruck him that it would threſh corn, and he got one made, with the addition of two ſmooth rollers for taking in the corn; the work being too hard for a man, he ſent it to Mr Mickle's mill, to have it tried by water: ſoon after, Mr Mickle's ſon built a threſhing mill at Kilbogie; and after ten or twelve had been erected in the neighbourhood, by other workmen, he applied to Mr Kinlock to take out a patent, who told him that he did not look upon it as an original invention, and that a pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0179800900:59"/>would not be of any uſe. Some time after this, Mr Mickle took out a patent (for England only) in his own name, for the purpoſe we ſuppoſe of ſecuring to himſelf his own combination of wheels, &amp;c. for movement of the various parts, as the leading principle of the machine had been applied to the ſame purpoſe at leaſt 20 years before.<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr Mickle is a very ingenious mechanic and tho' it appears he has not the merit of being the original inventor, yet he has added many uſeful improvements.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>At their firſt introduction into this county, the corn and ſtraw were thrown out together upon the floor, and cauſed great confuſion: to remedy this, a ſkreen was added, thro' which the grain dropped into a winnowing machine, and from off the ſkreen the ſtraw was taken by a man: but a <hi>circular rake,</hi> invented about eight years ſince,<note n="†" place="bottom">By Mr Balley, who firſt applied it to his machine at Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingham.</note> performs the operation much better; and at the ſame time ſaves a conſiderable expence. This rake is now added to all thoſe that have been lately erected; and only cauſes an addition to the machinery of one light wheel. Theſe machines are moved both by water and by horſes; two, four, and even ſix of the latter are ſometimes employed; the former is certainly the beſt power where it can be obtained.</p>
                        <p>From a review of the whole, it appears that the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the flax mill had been applied by different perſons at different times, for the purpoſe of threſhing corn; and ſince its being more generally uſed, different perſons have invented and uſed various combinations of wheels and other contrivances to effect the ſame purpoſe, and render the machine more perfect.</p>
                        <p>The ſimpleſt and moſt uſeful combinations and contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances are certainly the beſt: but whoſe are entitled to

                        <p>The preſent Mr Rogers ſays, he believes the machine his grandfather ſaw at Leith, was brought from Holland: An anonymous remarker, who ſigns himſelf a Scotch Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, ſtates "that it was firſt introduced by the late cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated Andrew Fletcher of Saltoun, along with the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley mill, from Holland, in the year 1711;" and we have ſomewhere read or heard, that the Dutch brought it
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0179800900:67"/>from the Chineſe, which is corroborated by the informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we lately received from the Honourable Mr Doug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſs,<note n="*" place="bottom">A ſon of the Earl of Selkirk.</note> who was ſhewn (when on his travels in France) by the late Duke de Rochefoucalt, a ſet of Chineſe drawings, repreſenting the culture of rice in all its ſtages, from the firſt planting to its being prepared for ſale, and that the laſt drawing was a repreſentation of the <hi>dreſſing</hi> or <hi>win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowing,</hi> which was performed by a <hi>machine exactly ſimilar to that we now uſe for the ſame purpoſe.</hi>

                        <p>There are many other implements uſed in this county, but as we believe moſt of them are ſuch as are well known in other parts of the kingdom, it would be of little uſe to deſcribe them here.</p>

                     <p>THE parts of this county capable of cultivation are in
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0179800900:68"/>general well incloſed by live hedges; the only exception is a ſmall part of the vales of Breamiſh, Till, and Glen: but even here, the advantage of having well-fenced fields is ſo well underſtood, and ſo much deſired by the tenants, that we hope, in eight or ten years, the whole of this valuable diſtrict will be incloſed by proper fences.</p>
                     <p>The ſize of incloſures varies with the ſize of farms. In ſome parts, from two to ſix or eight acres; in the nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern parts, where the farms are large, the fields are from 20 to 100 acres.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The fences</hi> moſt generally uſed for new incloſures, are earth mounds; at the baſe of which, and on the edge of the ditch out of which they are raiſed, are planted the quicks, generally upon a turned ſod ſix inches high; which we think too low, as we always find the quicks grow much better when planted three ſods high, with the thickneſs of two ſurface ſods laid under their roots. This in moſt caſes doubles, and in thin ſoil trebles, the ſurface ſoil, and forms a thick bed of the beſt earth for the roots of the quicks to grow in, as will be more clearly ſeen in the annexed ſketch of ſuch a ſence, fig. 2, pl. 5, where AB is the ditch, 4½ feet wide at top; BCD the mound; the baſe BD, ſix feet wide; and height CD, four feet. Q, the quicks planted upon three turned ſods, at leaſt 15 inches high, with ſurface ſods and ſoil 12 in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches thick, under and behind their roots.—The expence of making this kind of fence, is 1s. 4d. per rood of 7 yards, excluſive of quicks and railing.</p>
                     <p>The quicks ſhould never be planted nearer each other than nine inches, and upon good land a foot. Quicks four or five years old, with ſtrong clean ſtems, are always to be preferred to thoſe that are younger and ſmaller.</p>
                     <p>It is a cuſtom, in ſome parts, to clip young quicks every year; this makes the fence look neat and ſnug, but it checks their growth, and keeps them always weak in the

In point of profit, and of labour ſaved, there is no compariſon; and for beauty, we prefer nature, and think a luxuriant hawthorn in full bloom, or loaden with its ripened fruit, is a more pleaſing, enlivening, and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying object, than the ſtiff formal ſameneſs produced by the ſhears of a gardener.</p>
                     <p>Walter Trevelyan, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> of Nether-Witton, ſhewed us a new mode of raiſing fences:—He erects an earth mound (fig. 3, pl. 5,) 7 feet wide at bottom AB, 4 feet wide at top CD, and 5 feet high; on the middle of the top he plants a row of quicks Q, and on each ſide at 2 feet diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance puts in willow ſlakes WW, an inch in diameter, and 1½ or 2 ft. long, ſloping outwards, which take root and form a live fence, for the preſervation of the quicks in the middle — Theſe ſtakes are at firſt bound together by a kind of oddering; at the time we ſaw them they had been only two years done, of courſe no judgment could be formed, for ſome years to come, whether it poſſeſſed ſuperior advantages to the mode above-deſcribed: It ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to us an experiment yet undetermined. In ſome ſituations, we are inclined to believe, it may be very uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, eſpecially in cold, ſoft, marſhy ſoils: Whether it will be ſuperior in all, we ſtill entertain ſome doubts; but are perſuaded, that a full trial will be given, by the ſpirited improver who is making the experiment.—The expence is 2s. 6d. per rood of 7 yards.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Stone Walls</hi> are alſo uſed for fences in ſome ſituations; the uſual dimenſions are 2½ feet at bottom, 15 or 16 in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches at top, and 4 to 4½ feet high: About half way up
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0179800900:71"/>a row of through-ſtones are put, at the rate of 9 or 10 in a rood of 7 yards, and on the top a coping of ſods, or ſtones <hi>ſet edge-ways;</hi> the latter is preferable, as being the moſt laſting, and preſenting a more awful aſpect, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Highland ſheep from attempting to leap them— The <hi>expence</hi> of making theſe walls is from 5s. 6d. to 6s. 6d. a rood of 7 yards, for <hi>winning and walling:</hi> The expence of leading depends on the diſtance.—Twelve or fourteen cart load will do a rood.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The advantages of incloſing</hi> private property in this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty principally ariſe from ſeparating lands of different qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, which can, by theſe means, be employed in ſuch culture, or depaſtured by ſuch ſtock, as the occupier thinks moſt ſuitable; and, where ſheep are kept, they feed with more facility and readineſs, being freed from the whims of the ſhepherd, and the teazings of his dog; and, by ſeparating the dry ground from the wet, a ſtock-maſter has it more in his power to avoid that fatal mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, the rot.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Gates</hi> are made of various forms, but agree nearly in ſize, being generally 8½ feet wide, and from 4¼ to 5 feet high, with 5 ſtrong bars about 3½ inches deep, and a weaker one about 1 inch ſquare, placed between the two loweſt bars.—The lighter a gate is, eſpecially in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, the better, provided it be ſufficiently ſtrong; for this reaſon the top bar ſhould be conſiderably ſtronger than the reſt, as it is the moſt liable to be broken, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially where horſes are kept, if not made ſo high that they cannot eaſily get their necks over it. The moſt approved form is that repreſented, fig. 4, pl. 5.</p>

                        <hi>Hanging Gates,</hi> ſo as to have a proper fall or tendency to ſhut of themſelves, being little underſtood by carpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, we hope the following directions for effecting that purpoſe may be acceptable.</p>
                     <p>Having ſet the poſt perpendicular, let a plumb-line,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0179800900:72"/>AB, be drawn upon it: on this line, at a proper height, place the hook C, ſo that it may project 3½ inches from the face of the poſt; and at a convenient diſtance below this, place the lower hook D, 1½ inches <hi>to one ſide of the perpendicular line,</hi> and projecting 2 inches from the face of the poſt; then place the top loop or eye 2 inches from the face of the <hi>"hawtree,"</hi> and the bottom loop, 3½ in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches:—Thus hung, the gate will have a tendency to ſhut in every poſition.<note n="*" place="bottom">For if the weight of the gate be repreſented by the line CD, fig. 5, pl. 5, this, by the reſolution of forces, is reſolvable into other two, CE and DE, the former repreſenting that part of the weight which preſſes in a perpendicular poſition; and the latter, that part of the weight which preſſes in a horizontal direction, and gives the gate a tendency to ſhut.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>This principle has been long known and practiſed, in hanging gates that open both ways.</p>

                        <p>THE arable lands of this county being under various ſyſtems, and directed by various opinions, the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the tillage muſt differ conſiderably.—In the oper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of ploughing, it is generally agreed that the breadth of the furrow ſhould be about 9 inches, and the depth from 4 to 6 or 7 inches.</p>
                        <p>It was formerly the general practice not to plough the lands intended for fallow till after Spring ſeed-time, (and very often delayed till May, or even June) but now the fallows are ploughed before Winter, to meliorate by the froſt.—In the middle of April or beginning of May, thoſe that are intended for <hi>turnips</hi> or <hi>potatoes</hi> are harrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0179800900:73"/>and ploughed <hi>acroſs,</hi> and, where neceſſary, rolled with a heavy roller; the ſame operations are repeated two, or three, or more times, until it is thought ſufficiently fine and clean for ſowing or planting.</p>
                        <p>Thoſe that are intended to be naked ſallow for wheat, receive three, four, of five ploughings through the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; but are ſeldom harrowed, it being thought an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to wheat to have the land cloddy.</p>
                        <p>On thoſe fallows where quickens or couch graſs, &amp;c. are found, every exertion is uſed to extirpate them, by harrowing, gathering and burning, or leading off, ſo long as the ſmalleſt remains are viſible. The lime and manure are moſtly laid on before the laſt ploughing.</p>
                        <p>For barley, it is the general cuſtom to plough only once; but the beſt cultivators ſeldom ſow this grain with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out giving two or three ploughings, eſpecially when the land is to be ſown with clover and graſs feeds.</p>
                        <p>Every other ſpecies of grain is ſown after one plough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, except when beans or peaſe are to be drilled.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Trench Ploughing,</hi> is practiſed by a few; it is an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len mode for breaking up graſs lands, and is performed by two ploughs following each other in the ſame furrow; the firſt plough paring off the ſurface, from 1 to 1½ inches thick, and turning it into the bottom of the laſt-made furrow: While the ſecond plough, going 3 or 4 inches deeper, turns upon it a ſod of friable earth, which being deſtitute of tough fibrous roots, harrows to a ſine mould with little difficulty.</p>
                        <p>This practice entirely obviates the objections to drilling upon clover lea, and the additional expence will not be more than 4s. per acre, which, put in competition with the advantages to be derived from it, will leave a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able balance in favour of the practice: in breaking up old ſwards, on clayey lands, the expence is almoſt ſaved in the harrowing; on ſuch ſoils it will be found of great
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0179800900:74"/>ſervice, if they are <hi>thus ploughed</hi> in Autumn, they may be eaſily drilled with beans or peaſe in the Spring, and the ſubſequent hoeings performed with facility; operations that would be very difficult to perform, when ploughed in the manner uſually practiſed.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>The Ridges</hi> are of various forms and ſizes.—On the deep ſoiled lands, that were uſed as arable ſome centuries ſince, the ridges are moſtly very high, broad, and crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;<note n="*" place="bottom">It is a dangerous experiment to attempt to level and ſtraight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en ridges of this deſcription too ſuddenly; we have ſeen much miſchief done by it.</note> upon lands that have been lately brought into cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivation, they are ſtraight, nearly flat, and in general a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout twelve or fifteen feet broad; on dry lands, they are quite flat, and alternately gathered and ſplit. A breadth of fifteen feet anſwers beſt for ſowing broad-caſt at two caſts.</p>
                        <p>A few years ſince, the ploughing, and various other purpoſes, for which draughts are wanted upon a farm, were performed by horſes, which in ploughing or harrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing are always yoked double, and driven with cords by the ploughman, and in general plough an acre a day; but in the ſeaſon of ſowing turnips, one and a half, or even two acres, are frequently ploughed, on <hi>fine light ſoils.</hi> But ſince the great advance in the price of horſes, oxen have been more uſed, eſpecially for the purpoſes of ploughing, and carting <hi>about home.</hi>

                        </head>
                        <p>The practice of making naked fallows on all kinds of ſoils, once in 3 or 4 years, was general thro' this county, till the introduction of turnips; in a few years the fallows of the dry lands were covered with this valuable plant. On ſuch other ſoils as were found improper for this root, the naked fallows ſtill prevail, with an almoſt univerſal opinion, that it is abſolutely neceſſary to the fertility of the land; yet there are ſome few who dare to doubt this long-eſtabliſhed doctrine, and preſume to think, that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked fallows might be diſpenſed with in <hi>many ſituations,</hi> by cultivating leguminous crops, <hi>drilled at wide intervals,</hi> to admit being <hi>ploughed,</hi> or <hi>horſe-hoed</hi> between: to which, if <hi>proper hand-hoeings</hi> be added, the land will be as well pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for wheat, as if it had been a compleat naked fallow.</p>
                        <p>This is not advanced on ſpeculation or theory; inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces can be produced, where no naked fallows have been made on fields of ſtrong loam for 12 years, yet they are as clear of quickens, couch-graſs, or other pernicious weeds, as any fields in the diſtrict, that have been under naked fallow two or three times in the ſame period.<note n="*" place="bottom">It may be neceſſary to obſerve, that, previous to the adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this ſyſtem, the land was cleared of quicken, or couch-graſs, by a complete ſummer fallowing.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>Whether fallowing is or is not neceſſary, has been much agitated of late years; ſo much ſo, that the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent partiſans have obtained the appellation of <hi>"fallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſts,"</hi> and <hi>"antifalloweſts:"</hi> It happens to be one of thoſe ſubjects which can never be determined by reaſoning, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions, or bold aſſertions; <hi>fair experiments</hi> only can reſolve it; and whatever may be the reſults of ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:0179800900:76"/>it may be juſtly concluded, they will be the ſame in ſimilar ſoils, climates, and ſituations.</p>
                        <p>Tho' we are diffident in giving a decided opinion up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſo important a ſubject, yet from obſervations made on the above facts, we cannot help being inclined to think, that the quantity of maked fallow might be very much reduced, and in another century will probably be totally aboliſhed, if no fortuitous circumſtances ariſe to check the exertions and ſpirit for improvement, which have been ſo prevalent of late years, and ſo generally dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed thro' this diſtrict.</p>

                           <p>The downy chaffed wheats have ſhorter ſtraw, and are leſs liable to have the grain ſhaken out by winds (the chaff embracing the grain more cloſely,) than the ſmooth chaffed tribes, which is a conſiderable advantage; but then we are apprehenſive that this downineſs makes them retain the dews and moiſture upon the ear much longer
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:0179800900:80"/>than the ſmooth chaffed kinds, and probably renders them much more liable to be affected by thoſe diſeaſes which give a duſky dark ſhade to the chaff, and a ruſty cankering upon the ſtraw; as we recollect few inſtances of ſmooth chaffed or red wheat being troubled with this diſeaſe, of courſe the downy chaffed kinds are moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for windy open ſituations, and the ſmooth chaffed to well ſheltered incloſed diſtricts.</p>

                              <hi>Steeping</hi> in chamberlye, and powdering with quick lime immediately after, to make it ſufficiently dry for ſowing, is generally practiſed; the ſmut is ſeldom ſeen where this is properly performed,<note n="*" place="bottom">In a practice of 40 years, the Meſſrs Culley have only had one inſtance of ſmut in their crops of wheat, and this was where the ſeed had not been ſteeped; and for a number of years they have not grown leſs than from four hundred to ſix hundred acres yearly.</note> and ſome go ſo far as to ſay, that it will cure ſmutty ſeed;<note n="†" place="bottom">A field at Chillingham was ſown in 1795 with wheat, in which were <hi>a few balls of ſmut;</hi> one-third of the ſeed was ſteep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in chamberlye and limed; one-third ſteeped in chamberlye, dried and not limed; the remainder was ſown without either ſteeping or liming, in the harveſt of 1796; the whole had a few ſtraggling heads of ſmut, but appeared to be moſt in that which was unſteeped.—Mr Thompſon, of Chillingham Barns, made a ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milar experiment, and had ſmut equally alike in the pickled and unpickled, but the <hi>head ridges were conſiderably the worſt;</hi> from hence it appears that ſteeping in chamberlye is not a prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ive in all caſes.—It may be proper to remark, that there are more complaints of ſmut this year, than any other we remember; in ſome places even barley was very much affected.—We believe, that on examination, the ſtamina will always be found adhering to the balls of ſmut, from which a ſuſpicion ariſes, that the cauſe may be ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſome defect in thoſe parts, probably from injuries re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by inſects, weather, &amp;c. as we frequently find the ſame ear bearing the moſt perfect grains along with grains of ſmut.— The ſame experiment was repeated in 1796, and intended to be continued for ſome years.</note>— it is done by throwing the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0179800900:81"/>wheat into a veſſel full of chamberlye, ſtirring it about with a ſtrong ſtick, and ſkimming off the light grains as they appear on the ſurface; when this is done, the liquor is let off, (by a plug or cock at the bottom of the veſſel) and the wheat taken out and mixed with quick lime; after this, the ſooner it is ſown the better, becauſe it is apt to heat and ſpoil if ſuffered to continue in the ſacks, or in large heaps; but if dried and ſpread thin on a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary floor, will keep ſeveral days.</p>
                           <p>If the grain remains too long in very putrid chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye, its vegetative powers will be injured; 5 or 10 mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes are as long as it ſhould be ſuffered to continue.</p>

                              <hi>The time of ſowing,</hi> on the lands that receive a naked ſummer fallow, is September and October; after <hi>drilled beans,</hi> October and November; and after <hi>turnips,</hi> all thro' the winter, (as the land is cleared, and weather ſuitable,) until the middle of March.—In the year 1795, many hundred acres were ſown in Glendale Ward ſo late as <hi>the beginning of April,</hi> which was all well harveſted, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, on an average, about 24 buſh. per acre, of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent grain; in many caſes ſuperior to that ſown in the autumn: which was rather ſingular, as it is generally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected that wheat ſown ſo late does not produce the grain ſo well perfected, as that which is ſown earlier.—This lateneſs of ſowing was occaſioned by the ſnow lying ſo late in the ſpring.—And we are diſpoſed to think, from
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0179800900:82"/>many experiments, that on thoſe light ſoils, the month of February is the beſt and ſafeſt ſeed-time for wheat, maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin, and rye, of all others in the year.</p>

                              <hi>For ſpring ſowing,</hi> the golden ear, and the Burwell-red wheats, are preferred to all others; except where the land is in ſuch high condition as to endanger the crop lodging; then the velvet ear is uſed, as not being ſo apt to lodge, from the ſhortneſs of the ſtraw.<note n="*" place="bottom">In February 1792 a field of 5 acres was ſown (after turnips) with wheat: a part with <hi>Zealand,</hi> the remainder with <hi>Velvet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ear;</hi> the produce from the Zealand was 60 <hi>buſhels per acre,</hi> the Velvet-ear 48 <hi>buſhels,</hi> but the latter was injured by a blight, which was attributed to the moiſture hanging longer on the chaff of the Velvet-ear, than on the other; from which it appears, that even Zealand wheat may be ſown in the ſpring with advantage; the grain was as well perfected, as heavy, and ſold for as high a price, as any ſhewn in the market that ſeaſon.</note>—The <hi>Triticum Aeſtivum,</hi> (Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berian wheat,) or ſpring-wheat, was introduced and ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly recommended about twenty years ſince; but wherever we have ſeen it tried, the crops have been uncertain, and produce ſmall: and tho' this flinty kind will ripen, if ſown even as late as April, or beginning of May, yet it has not been able to maintain a ſtruggle with the varieties above ſpecified, and is now totally given up.</p>

The late ingenious Mr Ilderton, about twenty-ſeven years ſince, had the merit of firſt reducing the price of hoeing, by teaching boys, girls, and women, to perform the work equally as well, if not better, than men. The mode he took was ſimple and ingenious: By a light plough, without a mould-board, he divided the field into ſmall ſquares of equal magnitude, and directed the boys and girls to leave a certain number of plants in each ſquare. In a ſhort time they became accurate, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular, and expert hoers; and in a few years all the tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nips of the country were hoed by women and boys, at half the expence, and better than by men.</p>
                           <p>The preſent mode of drilling turnips was firſt introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced into this county about the year 1780; the advantages with which it is attended have ſo far recommended the practice, that very few are now ſown broad-caſt;<note n="*" place="bottom">The broad-caſt culture of turnips in the northern parts of the county, for many years previous to this, was not inferior to any we ever ſaw; and in reſpect to <hi>accurate, regular, clean hoeing,</hi> ſuperior to what we ever obſerved in <hi>Norfolk, Suffolk,</hi> or other turnip diſtricts, which we have frequently examined.</note> and as we think it is an operation that may be ſerviceable in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſtricts, we ſhall be more particular in deſcribing the manner of performing it.</p>
                           <p>The land being made ſine, prepared, &amp;c. as in the broad-caſt method, the ploughman draws his firſt furrow as ſtraight as poſſible. In returning he keeps his far ſide

A leſs diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance does not admit of ploughing between the drills.</p>
                           <p>The next operation is ſpreading the dung; which is performed by a cart going down every third or fifth fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and laying the dung in ſmall heaps; women and boys follow with ſmall three-pronged forks, and ſpread it evenly in the bottom of three or five furrows, that is, the one where the dung is dropped from the cart, and thoſe on each ſide of it: this done, the ploughman ſplits the one-bout ridges before raiſed, and covers up the dung ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly in the middle; but before the ſeed can be ſown, theſe laſt formed one-bout ridges require to be flattened at the top, by a ſmall roller that flattens two ridges at once. Upon the top, and exactly in the middle of theſe flattened ridges, the ſeed is depoſited by one or two drill machines, tied to the roller by a rope ſix or ſeven feet long; at which diſtance they follow the roller, each ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chine being guided by a man.<note n="*" place="bottom">See fig. 3, pl. 2.</note> When finiſhed, the work appears in this form:
<figure/>
Where S repreſents the feed, and D the dung directly under it, which is wholly employed in promoting the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getation of the turnips.</p>
                           <p>The roller is drawn by one horſe, driven by a boy. Setting up the ridges, and covering in the dung, is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by a common ſwing plough. The quantity of
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:0179800900:98"/>ſeed ſown, from one to two pound per acre; it being bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to have an abundance of plants, for fear of accidents. The quantity of dung uſed is from ten to fifteen two-horſe cart-loads per acre.</p>
                           <p>When the plants have four leaves, we begin to hoe; and as they have ſo much room ſideways, we leave them only eight or nine inches diſtance from one another in the rows or drills. The hoers go ſideways, and pull the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus plants, weeds, &amp;c. into the hollow intervals between the one-bout ridges, and the turnips are left as regular as if they were planted. This work is performed by women and children, with the greateſt care and exactneſs, at the expence of four ſhillings per acre.</p>
                           <p>As ſoon as the plants are recovered, which will be in eight or ten days, a ſmall plough<note n="*" place="bottom">See fig. 3, pl. 1.</note> (five inches wide at the bottom behind, and eleven inches at top) drawn by one horſe, takes the earth from the turnip rows, and with the ſoil covers the weeds, &amp;c. which the hoers had pulled into the hollow intervals between the ridges. A ſecond hoeing takes place, when the plants are ſtrong enough, and otherwiſe neceſſary; and a few days after, the ſoil or earth before ploughed from the turnip rows, into the hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low intervals, is now equally divided and laid up to each drill or ridge again, by the ſame ſmall plough and one horſe, or with a double mould-board plough.—This fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes the buſineſs, unleſs the land has been very wild and out of condition, and requires more hoeing and ploughing between the drills.</p>
                           <p>If the drills are made in the ſame directions of the rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges at the next ploughing for corn, the ſurface will be ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular, and the dung unequally diſtributed. To avoid this, on dry level lands, the drills are made diagonally a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croſs the field; but where the ridges are high, it is beſt
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:0179800900:99"/>to make the drills <hi>directly acroſs</hi> the ridges, and draw a plough down the furrows to take off the water.</p>
                           <p>It is generally ſuppoſed that a weightier crop is produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by the drill than the broad-caſt method;<note n="*" place="bottom">Turnips drilled in this manner, were ſold in 1793, for 8l. an acre, for feeding cattle and ſheep, a much higher price than was given for any ſown broad-caſt; and we have known inſtances up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thin, poor, light ſoils, that the crop of turnips was of more value than the fee ſimple of the land upon which they grew; which we hope will remove the doubts of thoſe who have ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected that this mode would not anſwer upon weak thin ſoils: To ſuch ſoils it is certainly the beſt adapted of all others.</note> but even admitting them equal in this reſpect, the ſuperiority, as a fallow crop, muſt be allowed to the drill; for the repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ploughings in the intervals, and hand-hoeings in the rows, effectually extirpate the whole race of annual weeds; and ſo much ſurface being expoſed through the winter, makes a higher preparation for any ſucceeding crop. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother advantage is, the facility with which they are hoed, as a boy or girl, nine or ten years old, can hoe them with the greateſt eaſe, and generally better than expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced broad-caſt hoers, who are apt to take too many plants away; while the young ones, from the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of making them too thin, will leave them at any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance you ſhew them.</p>

When the cattle are tied up in ſheds, which we think much better than being out in the fields, they are foddered with turnips eight or nine times a day, and with ſtraw or hay twice; great attention ought to be paid to keeping their cribs clean.</p>

                           <p>Sometimes every other ridge is led off, and the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der eaten upon the ground where they grow.</p>
                           <p>When eaten upon the ground, the ſheep are not turned upon the whole at once; but have it portioned out to them, by hurdles, or nets; ſo that they may have a freſh break once a week or ten days.</p>

                           <p>The trouble of ſelecting and tranſplanting is ſometimes diſpenſed with; but the ſeed raiſed in this manner is ſold for one-half or one-third the price of the tranſplanted

                           <p>The produce is very variable, being ſubject to many caſualties.—The average crop may be reckoned about 20 buſhels, or half a ton per acre—The land ſhould be good, and well manured after the crop; as we find the ſoil much impoveriſhed by it.</p>

                           <p>TO trace uſeful diſcoveries from their origin, through their various ſtages of improvement, is in moſt caſes both uſeful and entertaining; and teaches us not to deſpair, though our firſt attempts may be unſucceſsful; but rather hope, that by perſeverance, and varying modes and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, we ſhall at laſt attain the object ſought for. The method of cultivating turnips, deſcribed above, is an encouraging inſtance of this obſervation:—as we find that Mr Tull firſt cultivated turnips at three feet diſtance;—for in his Eſſay on the Principles of Tillage and Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, under the article Turnips, page 96, he ſays, "When I drilled upon the level<note n="*" place="bottom">"It is impoſſible to hoe-plough them ſo well when planted upon the level, as when they are planted upon ridges; for if we plough deep near to the row, the earth will come over on the left ſide of the plough, and bury the young turnips; but when they ſtand on ridges, the earth will almoſt all fall down on the right ſide into the furrow, in the middle of the interval."</note> at three feet intervals, a trial was made between thoſe turnips, and a field of the next neighbour's, ſown broad-caſt at the ſame time, whereof
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:0179800900:102"/>the hand-hoeing coſt ten ſhillings per acre, and had not quite half the crop of the drilled; both being meaſured by the buſhel, on purpoſe to find the difference.<note n="*" place="bottom">"And I have ſince found that turnips on the ſame land plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on ridges, with ſix foot intervals, make a crop double to thoſe that are planted on the level, or even on ridges with three feet intervals."</note>
                           </p>
                           <p>"Drilled turnips, by being no where but in the rows, may be more eaſily ſeen that thoſe which come up at ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; and may therefore be ſooner ſingled out by the hand-hoe, which is another advantage, becauſe the ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er<note n="†" place="bottom">"The ſooner they are made ſingle the better; but yet when they are not very thick, they may ſtand till we have the beſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience of ſingling them without much damage; but when they come up extraordinary thick, it will be much more difficult to make them ſingle, if they are neglected at their very firſt coming into rough leaf."</note> they are ſingled out the better they will thrive. <hi>Page</hi> 98.</p>
                           <p>"We need not be very exact in the number or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance<note n="‡" place="bottom">"The diſtance need not be regular; for when a turnip has ſix inches of room on one ſide, and eighteen on the other, it is almoſt as well as if there was one foot on each ſide."</note> we ſet them out at; we contrive to leave the maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter turnips (when there is ſo much difference in them) and ſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           <p>"Dung and tillage together will always attain the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary degree of pulverization in leſs time than plough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing can do alone; therefore dung is more uſeful for tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nips, becauſe they have commonly leſs time to grow than other plants. <hi>Page</hi> 102.</p>
                           <p>"I have had great crops of turnips in rows three feet aſunder, and much greater than I could ever obtain from
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:0179800900:103"/>rows thirty inches aſunder. But one reaſon why I like ſix foot rows better is, that the largeſt turnips are beſt for oxen; and are pulled up and loaded with the leaſt expence.—I find that the leaſt competent number will <hi>(cateris paribus)</hi> always be the largeſt. <hi>Preface, page</hi> ix.</p>
                           <p>"Several lands of turnips, drilled on the level of three foot rows, ploughed and doubly dunged, and alſo horſe-hoed, did not produce near ſo good a crop of turnips as ſix foot rows adjoining, horſe-hoed, though no dung had been thereon for many years.</p>
                           <p>"There was no other difference, than that the three foot rows did not admit the hoe-plough to raiſe half the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial poſture as the ſix foot rows did. The dung plough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the narrow intervals before drilling, could oper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate no farther with any great effect, than the hoe-plough could turn it up, and help it in its pulverization."</p>
                           <p>From theſe extracts it appears, that Mr Tull cultivated turnips in rows, not only on the level, but on the tops, of two and a half and three feet ridges, and both horſe and hand-hoed, as at preſent; but whether he put dung in the bottom of thoſe ridges is not ſo clear, from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, "the dung ploughed into the narrow intervals before drilling." It is unfortunate that this ingenious gentleman, to ſupport a whimſical theory, ſhould not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that dung was of any other uſe in vegetation, than in pulverizing the ſoil; though he is obliged to admit, that for cabbages, turnips, carrots, and potatoes, it will make the crops greater, and the cattle will like them never the worſe.<note n="*" place="bottom">Page 41.</note>
                           </p>
                           <p>But his diſciples entertained juſter notions of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties and value of dung to neglect it, as will appear in the ſequel.</p>
                           <p>We are informed by a gentleman who went to direct the management of an eſtate in Dumfriesſhire, in 1769,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:0179800900:104"/>that Mr Craik, of Arbigland, near Dumfries, had then drilled turnips betwixt twenty and thirty years; by tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the medium, his firſt beginning would be about 1745. The mode he purſued was as follows:—In the Autumn, as ſoon as the corn crop was off, he ploughed his land in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to two-bout ridges, in which ſtate it continued all winter; next ſpring theſe ridges were ploughed, and harrowed until ſufficiently pulverized, and at laſt ſplit to make a hollow furrow for depoſiting the dung, which was cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in by the plough going twice about, making a ridge near four feet wide; then this two-bout ridge was har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed, a ſingle-wheel drill, turning round a hollow cylin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of tin with holes in it, depoſited the ſeed directly over the dung: the drill had a ſmall roller behind to cover in the ſeed, and was drawn by one horſe. When the plants were ready for hoeing, they were ſet out at ten or twelve inches diſtance one from another, in the rows; and the intervals ploughed between through the Summer, as oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en as neceſſary.</p>
                           <p>From this place it is probable that the practice had tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled into Cumberland; for in the year 1755, Philip Howard, Eſq. of Corby, firſt cultivated turnips in that county, in drills with four feet intervals; finding the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance too wide, he reduced it to two feet, and continued it for ten years before it was followed by the farmers, who now purſue the ſame mode with little variation, except that they make the diſtance of the intervals about twenty-ſeven inches. The one-bout ridges, in which the dung is depoſited, are here called <hi>ſtitches,</hi> and are flattened at the top by drawing a piece of wood over them, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of a roller or a harrow.</p>
                           <p>About the year 1756, or 1757, Mr Pringle, formerly a ſurgeon in the army, who had an eſtate near Coldſtream, in Berwickſhire, was the firſt perſon in that neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood who cultivated turnips in this manner: His drills
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:0179800900:105"/>were at three feet and a half diſtance. Mr Cox, a ſerjeant, whom Mr Pringle brought home with him for a ſervant, ſays, that his maſter took his hints from Mr Tull's book, and that he alſo drilled all his corn crops, until he had overcome the annual weeds.</p>
                           <p>Mr William Dawſon, who was well acquainted with the turnip culture in England, having been purpoſely ſent to reſide in thoſe diſtricts for ſix or ſeven years where the beſt cultivation was purſued, with an intention not only of ſeeing, but of making himſelf maſter of the manual ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, and of every minutia in the practice, was convinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the ſuperiority of Mr Pringle's mode over every o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he had ſeen, either in Norfolk or elſewhere; and in 1762, when he entered to Frogden Farm, near Kelſo, in Roxburghſhire, he immediately adopted the practice up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a large ſcale, to the amount of 100 acres yearly. He began by drilling at three feet diſtance; but a few years after, trying various widths of intervals, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced it to two feet and a half, which he ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues. As far as we have been able to obtain informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he was the firſt that uſed <hi>a roller for flattening the</hi> tops of the one-bout ridges.</p>
                           <p>It may not be improper to remark, that Mr Pringle purſued this mode for ſeveral years, yet none of his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours followed the example; but no ſooner did Mr Daw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon (an actual farmer) adopt the ſame ſyſtem, than it was immediately followed, not only by ſeveral farmers in his vicinity, but by thoſe very farmers adjoining Mr Pringle, whoſe crops they had ſeen for ten or twelve years ſo much ſuperior to their own. It is alſo deſerving of notice, that when Mr Dawſon ſettled at Frogden, the whole of that diſtrict was under the moſt wretched ſyſtem of cultivation, and the farmers unacquainted with the value of turnips, artificial graſſes, and lime. At firſt his practice met with many opponents, and was ridiculed by the old, the ignor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:0179800900:106"/>ant, and the prejudiced; but his ſuperior crops and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits ſoon made converts: The practice in a few years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came general; and this diſtrict is now amongſt the beſt cultivated in the kingdom, the land trebled in value, and the aſpect of the country greatly improved. It is a pleaſing reflection, that the example and exertions of one man has been capable of producing ſo great, ſo laſting, and ineſtimable benefits; and it is more than probable, that this mode of cultivating turnips would have died a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with Mr Pringle, and the practice been loſt to this diſtrict, had it not been for the diſcernment and intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of this individual.</p>
                           <p>We remember ſeeing, about twenty-five years ſince, turnips cultivated in this manner, by Mr Chriſtopher Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, of Stainſby, near Ripley, in Yorkſhire, an ingenious gentleman, and great advocate for drilling, and who had drilled all his corn crops for many years: His nephew, Mr Donkin, informs us, that he had cultivated turnips in this manner, more than twenty years before this, which will be prior to the year 1750.</p>
                           <p>In Mr Benſon's practice deſcribed by himſelf, in Dr Hunter's Georgical Eſſays, page 379, the ſeed is drilled <hi>upon the dung,</hi> and that and the ſeed covered together, by harrowing acroſs the ridges:<note n="*" place="bottom">His nephew ſays "the dung and ſeed were covered in by a double mould-board plough ſet wide, and then harrowed."</note> In this paper he very properly ſums up the advantages of this mode of cultivat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing turnips; he obſerves, "the ſeed being placed upon the moiſt dung, will vegetate early in all circumſtances of the weather; and the manure being well covered, will be ſecured from evaporation in the hoteſt ſeaſons: The turnips being placed immediately over the manure, have a ready paſſage by means of their tap roots, into rich bed of nutriment, which will accelerate their growth, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe their ſize. As the crop grows upon ridges, with a

                           <p>From a review of the whole it appears, that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent mode of cultivating turnips, by drilling in rows at two feet and two feet and a half diſtance, had occurred to different people in different parts, who all, at firſt, began according to Mr Tull's directions, with the addition of dung put in the bottom of the ridge; and after trying various width of intervals, found that the beſt and moſt convenient diſtance was from twenty-four to thirty inches; but it is very clear that <hi>Mr Tull is the root from whence this excellent practice firſt originated.</hi>

                        <p>Wheat is ſet up in ſtooks of twelve ſheaves each: oats and barley are <hi>("gated,")</hi> ſet up in ſingle ſheaves; and when dry, bound tight at the bottom, and led home, or ſet up in ſtooks of ten ſheaves each. The ſtacks are moſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly round; but ſome of the beſt farmers ſet up their barley and wheat in long narrow ſtacks, which keep the corn much better and dryer: And the practice of placing corn upon ſtone pillars, with a cap or cover over them (to keep out the mice) and a frame of wood over all, is gaining ground, and cannot be too much recommended, as it not only prevents the mice getting to it, but keeps the corn dry and airy: It is an excellent method for grain that is to be kept until Summer; and one principal advantage is, that wheat may be led from the field and ſet upon thoſe ſtands almoſt as ſoon as reaped — They are made both round and oblong, but moſt of the latter.</p>

                        <p>WHAT is generally underſtood by natural meadows, are ſuch lands as are overflowed by rivers, and produce a crop of hay every year, without any returns of manure: Of this deſcription of meadows we have very few in this county; what are called meadows here, are ſuch old graſs lands as are employed for growing hay almoſt every year, the greateſt part of which are uplands: To enable them to ſtand this ſevere cropping, they are, or ought to be, manured on the ſurface, every third or fourth year: if this operation be neglected, they impoveriſh very faſt. Where they cannot conveniently be dunged as above, they are depaſtured one year, and mown the other; or, what is better, depaſtured two years, and mown the third; the produce, from 1 to 1½ tons per acre, a fair crop; the aftermath (or "Fog") is frequently let from 10 to 15 ſhillings per acre, and is moſtly conſumed in fattening oxen and cows.</p>
                        <p>Lands that are intended for meadow, are <hi>"freed"</hi> (from being depaſtured with any kind of ſtock) at differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent times in the ſpring, from the beginning of April to the middle of May, as beſt ſuits the convenience of the occupier; particular attention is paid to the mole-hills, dung, &amp;c. being <hi>"ſcaled,"</hi>

                        <p>
                           <hi>The Artificial Graſſes</hi> moſt commonly cultivated in this county are, red clover, <hi>(trifolium pratenſe,)</hi> white clover, <hi>(trifolium repens,)</hi> and ray-graſs <hi>(lolium perenne:)</hi> with theſe ſome people mix rib-graſs <hi>(plantago lanceolata)</hi> and upon ſandy ſoils, hop-medic<note n="*" place="bottom">This in ſome places is called hop-trefoil, a name properly belonging to a very different plant, viz.—Trifolium agrarium.</note> 
                           <hi>(medicago lupulina)</hi> is ſown with ſucceſs.—Few of theſe graſſes are ever grown alone, except red clover, when intended to continue only one year; and even then, a ſmall portion of ray-graſs (from one to three gallons per acre) is generally ſown with it, we think with much propriety, as it not only comes early in the ſpring, but thickens the crop, and facilitates mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the clover into hay.</p>
                        <p>But when land is intended to continue for three or more years in graſs, they are generally mixed in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of eight or ten pounds of red clover, four pounds of white clover, and half a buſhel of ray-graſs per acre: to the above quantities are ſometimes added three or four pounds of rib-graſs, and hop-medic, as the ſoil ſuits. When red clover is grown alone, 10 or 12 pounds an acre are ſown upon dry friable ſoils, and from 14 to 18
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:0179800900:113"/>pounds upon ſtrong loams or clays. They are ſown in March, April, and May, upon lands fallowed the ſummer preceding for wheat, or turnips ſucceeded by barley, and ought always to be harrowed in, as well as rolled. Harrowing is particularly neceſſary upon ſtrong lands growing wheat; and acroſs the ridges is the beſt mode of performing the operation. We find, that where corn is drilled, and the intervals hoed, it pulverizes the ſoil, and makes the fineſt preparation for graſs ſeeds of all others: where this is properly done, and harrowed once acroſs, after the ſeeds are ſown, they ſeldom or never miſs; long experience having proved, that nothing requires a finer tilth than clover and graſs ſeeds:—Upon the beſt ſoils, the clover and ray-graſs mixed, are generally ready to depaſture with fat ſheep by the beginning of April, and from May, through the Summer, will carry ſix or eight ſheep per acre, according to the luxuriance of the crop and fertility of the ſoil; the ſecond and remaining years, they are depaſtured by the ſtore flock. Theſe paſtures are frequently mown when the ray-graſs begins to flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, which not only increaſes the bottom graſs, but a quantity of excellent hay is obtained, of conſiderable value.</p>
                        <p>When the clovers are not depaſtured, but kept for hay, they are generally mown about the latter end of June; the average produce about 2 tons per acre. The ſecond crop is rarely cut for hay, but depaſtured by cattle or ſheep, chiefly the latter: When cattle are put into a freſh clover "fog," eſpecially in wet weather, they ſometimes hove, by the ſudden fermentation of the clover; to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent this inconvenience, cattle are put upon it in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the day, when it is free from dew or any moiſture, they being firſt filled with natural graſs, which hinders them from eating ſo greedily, as if put on hungry; if the clover once paſs, they ſeldom take any harm after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards:
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:0179800900:114"/>by uſing this precaution, we have not had any cattle hoven, for ſeveral years.—When very much ſwelled, an inſtrument is uſed, (ſimilar to that uſed by ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons in tapping for the dropſy) it is ſo contrived, that after being thruſt in between the hip and rib, (on the near ſide) one part pulls out, while a tube remains in the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, thro' which an amazing quantity of fetid air eſcapes, and relieves the animal; but they are very apt to hove again afterwards.</p>
                        <p>We have heard of hoven cattle being relieved, by giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them an egg ſhell full of tar.</p>
                        <p>The practice of keeping horſes in the houſe, ſheds, or fold-yards, all Summer, upon <hi>cut clover, tares, &amp;c.</hi> was introduced into this county, about the year 1770; it is now generally adopted by the beſt farmers, who find their horſes thrive better; are cheaper kept than depaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turing at large; and alſo, that a quantity of manure is gained by this means, which otherwiſe would have been in a great meaſure loſt, or of very little uſe; as the dung of horſes, when dropped in paſtures, is moſtly deſtroyed by inſects, in the Summer ſeaſon.—An acre of good clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver uſed in this manner, will keep from 2 to 3 horſes, from the beginning of June till the end of October, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 20 weeks.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Saintfoin, Lucern, and Chicory,</hi> have been tried on a ſmall ſcale, but do not ſeem to come into general uſe; the crops of clover being thought more valuable.</p>
                        <p>In order to draw any fair comparative value between the produce of old graſs lands and artificial graſſes, the ſoil and ſituation ought to be exactly alike, and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments accurately conducted; for want of ſuch data, no juſt concluſions can be made; but we believe, that gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al obſervation and experience have eſtabliſhed an opinion, that the ſame lands which in a ſtate of old graſs carried 3 ſheep an acre, will, for the firſt year of clover and ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graſs,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:0179800900:115"/>graſs, depaſture 5 or 6; on rich, old grazing paſtures, the difference will probably not be ſo great, and what they fall ſhort in Summer, will be made up by their ſuperiority in Winter; on clayey ſoils, it would certainly be a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous experiment to convert thoſe rich grazing paſtures into tillage, as a certain portion of ſuch is a valuable ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition to every farm; but they are ſo rarely ſcattered, that few farms are ſo fortunate as to enjoy ſo deſirable an appendage.</p>

                        <p>The profit of grazing, like all other ſpeculations, varies with circumſtances; but we believe we may venture to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verage it at 3l. or 3l. 10s. for keeping on graſs from May-day to Michaelmas. Cows, in general, leave more than oxen, in proportion to their weight; but they are ſubject to diſorders of the udder, that frequently reduce the profit, and deter many people from grazing them.</p>
                        <p>Some few graziers follow the old cuſtom of keeping on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one kind of ſtock upon the ſame ground; whilſt others, we think with more propriety, intermix with oxen and cows, a few ſheep, and two or three colts in each paſture; which both turn to good account, and do little injury to the grazing cattle: In ſome caſes, ſheep are a real benefit, by eating down and deſtroying the ragwort <hi>(Senecio
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:0179800900:118"/>Jacobaeo)</hi> which diſgraces ſome of the beſt paſtures in the county, where <hi>oxen only</hi> are grazed.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Sheep,</hi> that have been wintered upon turnips, are put to the earlieſt graſs that can be obtained; the clovers and ray-graſs are generally ready in April; the old graſs lands not before May: In both ſituations they are continued till ſhorn, and ſold off, from the latter end of May, thro' all June and part of July, from 2l. to 2l. 15s. each. In 1797 the prices were from 2l. 10s. to 3l. 10s each: The draft ewes, or ſhearling wethers intended for turnips next Winter, ſucceed them, and thus a regular rotation is kept up. Of late years, ſome farmers have ſold their ſhearling wethers in July, (when only 15 months old) to the butch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, for as high prices, as from 30 to 35 ſhillings each. In 1796, they ſold from 40 to 45 ſhillings each; and in 1797, as high as 50 ſhillings, after ſhearing a fleece worth 6 ſhillings.</p>
                        <p>A large portion of the lands of this county being liable to the rot, and unſafe for a breeding flock, the occupiers of ſuch ſituations, venture ewes for fat lambs for one year; theſe are bought in the Autumn, put to tup early, (ſome in Auguſt) the lambs ſold in May, June, and July; after which the ewes are fatted, and ſold in October and Nov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ember.—Such lambs as are early, and go off in May, oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en ſell for 20 ſhillings each; but the others average at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 12s. 6d. The price of fat ewes depends much on their being of a good or ſlow feeding ſort, and will vary from 24 to 30 ſhillings: The average may be called 27 ſhillings.—The proceeds from long-woolled ewes will be:

With this their cribs were kept conſtantly full: The value of bran and oat ſeeds amounts to about 6s. per per week each beaſt; of the hay and clover no account was kept, but it cannot be eſtimated at leſs than 1s. which makes with attendance 7s. per week each beaſt; near double the expence of graſs, and more than the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the cattle would pay, tho' they were certainly in very thriving condition.</p>

                     <p>The demand by the collieries and lead mines for ſmall wood, has induced the proprietors of woods on the Der<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went, Tyne, &amp;c. to cut them at an early age. From twenty-five to thirty years growth is the general term for oak, elm, and aſh; but birch, willow, and aller, are cut ſooner; and hazle for corf-rods<note n="*" place="bottom">Corves are a kind of large wicker-work baſkets, uſed for bringing coals out of pits, made of rods from ½ to 1 inch dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter.</note> once in three or four years.</p>

                     <p>In the management of theſe woods, the general prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice is to cut all away together. The ſyſtem of Anthony Surtees, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> of Newbiggen, we think preferable; he takes his away in <hi>patches;</hi> and as the older trees interfere with the younger ſprings, and where a thriving healthy oak is in a convenient ſituation, he lets it ſtand for tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; by this means the young ſpring is ſheltered, and an annual produce of upwards of 100l. is obtained from ſixty acres of woodland.</p>
                     <p>Plantations, on an extenſive ſcale, are riſing in every part of the county; and are almoſt in every inſtance doing well, and promiſe not only to repay the ſpirited exertions of the proprietors, but will add greatly to the ornament and improvement of the country.</p>

                     <p>THE <hi>commons</hi>—in this county capable of being convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into profitable tillage land are now very trifling, the greateſt part having been incloſed within the laſt thirty years; the whole amounting to near 120,000 acres. Of this, the commons belonging to the manors of Hexham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire and Allendale contain 50,000 acres, a great part (35,000) of which are high, expoſed, heathy mountains. Theſe are to be converted into ſtinted paſtures, not being thought capable of any other improvement.</p>
                     <p>The increaſed value of ſuch incloſed commons, depends (as we have ſtated in our Report of Cumberland) entirely upon the ſyſtem of cultivation purſued. Upon Bulbeck-common there are lands which, in a ſtate of common, were not worth more than 1s. an acre, a part of which has been in tillage twenty-five years, and grown three white crops ſucceſſively, betwixt one fallowing and another. This land is now dear enough at 4s. an acre; while Mr Hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per's of Black-Hedley, is worth 10s. or 12s. His ſyſtem is, when firſt broke up from heath, to pare and burn, and plough in the autumn; next ſpring plough acroſs, lime and ſow oats; then fallow and lime, 75 buſhels per acre, and ſow turnips; after which, oats and graſs ſeeds, four pounds red clover, five pounds white, and one buſhel of ray graſs, and continue in graſs ſix or ſeven years; then to plough for oats—turnips—oats—and ſow up with graſs ſeeds as before. There are inſtances, where the increaſed value is in the ratio of twelve to one, or even more; but
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:0179800900:126"/>theſe are, where the commons were of no value to the proprietor, which is in general the caſe.<note n="*" place="bottom">The ſtinted common of Holy Iſland was divided in 1790, the allotments that were gotten for a right, which never let for more than 2l. are now let for 14l. or 15l. per ann. and in a few years will be worth upwards of 20l.</note>

                     <p>Draining would be highly uſeful to many parts of theſe diſtricts; there are alſo many excellent ſituations for planting, and of all other purpoſes to which ſuch lands are convertible, this ſpecies of improvement ſeems to us the moſt promiſing to make the greateſt returns.</p>

<pb n="115" facs="tcp:0179800900:130"/>which takes place as far as it has gone.<note n="*" place="bottom">About twelve years ſince, when looking over the farm of Thornington, with Mr James Hall, (the late tenant) we were ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed with the ſudden alteration in the verdure of the land, which took place immediately at the junction of two ridges, one ſide was a fine dark green, <hi>caten very bare,</hi> and covered with a thick mat of <hi>white clover and ray-graſs;</hi> the other was a dingy brown, principally compoſed of <hi>fine bent,</hi> and <hi>ſheep's feſque,</hi> and in a great meaſure <hi>neglected by the ſheep:</hi> An explanation was deſired for ſo great a contraſt, and Mr Hall informed us, that when this parcel of land was laſt in fallow, the part which was <hi>eaten ſo bare,</hi> and looked ſo green, was <hi>well limed;</hi> the other, which the ſheep neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, had <hi>never been limed.</hi>
                              <p>It has been ſaid, and repeatedly copied by writers on Agricul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Botany, that <hi>"ſheep prefer the "Feſtuca Ovina" to all other plants:"</hi> In the above inſtance, it was quite the contrary; from which, and from other obſervations we have made, we are inclined to believe, that the idea has probably originated more in conjecture than experiment. It has alſo been remarked by bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanical writers, that ſheep refuſe to eat ragwort, <hi>(Senecio Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobaea:")</hi> The fact in, they are ſo very fond of it, they will not allow a plant to flower wherever they depaſture.</p>
                           </note> Many of theſe dry ſoils, after being limed, grow white clover na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally; where not limed, it ſeldom appears; but they cover principally with <hi>agroſtis capillaris</hi> (fine bent,) which is ſeldom eaten by any kind of ſtock, if they can get o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther food: When land has been ſufficiently limed, this plant diſappears; and wherever it is found, it may be ſafely concluded, that the ſoil on which it grows has not had its due quantity of lime.</p>
                        <p>About ſeven years ſince Mr George Reed, of South-Middleton near Wooler, cleared from broom, 30 or 40 acres of light, dry, channelly ſoil, that had <hi>never been limed,</hi> which was ſown with rye; the rye ſtubble was ploughed in the Autumn, and the worſt part of it limed at the rate of 100 buſhels per acre; next Summer the whole was drilled with turnips (dunged &amp;c. as deſcribed page 89) which came up all alike, and continued to do e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually well for three or four weeks; but little or no rain falling in that period, and the weather continuing droughty, thoſe turnips upon the land which had <hi>no lime,</hi>
                           <pb n="116" facs="tcp:0179800900:131"/>died away; whilſt thoſe upon that part which <hi>was limed</hi> were diſcernible <hi>to an inch,</hi> flouriſhed with unabated vigour, and produced an excellent crop, (for ſuch land) worth at leaſt 4l 10s. an acre; many ſimilar inſtances might be produced, but this is the moſt ſtriking we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect to have noted.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>The made of burning lime,</hi> in this county, is moſtly in draw-kilns, of the form of an inverted cone, with two or three eyes or mouths for drawing out the lime, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting air: Theſe kilns are kept burning and drawing perpetually. Some of the large ſale kilns will afford 40 or 50 cart load a day: A cart load of coals is reckoned to burn two cart loads of lime.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>The Price,</hi> at the kilns, is from 3s. to 4s. 6d. for 25 upheaped buſhels.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>The Quantity,</hi> laid upon an acre, is from 75 to 150 buſhels.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>The general practice of uſing lime,</hi> is to lay it up in heaps of three or four cart loads each; and as ſoon as the clods are fallen, ſlacked, or reduced to the ſtate of quick-lime, it is ſpread evenly upon the land, and harrowed and ploughed in as ſoon as poſſible after: ſometimes, inſtead of laying it up in heaps of 3 or 4 cart loads each, it is laid upon the land in the clod ſtate, in little heaps of about a buſhel each, which are covered with earth until ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly flacked or fallen, and then ſpread abroad.</p>
                        <p>In either mode, or in whatever manner lime is applied, it certainly has the greateſt effect, when both it and the ſoil are in the moſt pulverized ſtate.</p>
                        <p>Upon the turnip ſoils where very large quantities of lime are uſed, it would be extremely difficult to get a ſufficiency in the early part of Summer, previous to the turnip ſeaſon; in ſuch ſituations, it is uſual to lead as much as poſſible thro' the Summer and Autumn, which
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:0179800900:132"/>is laid up in very large heaps (from 50 to 150 loads each) and before Winter covered with ſods, or thatched with ſtraw, to prevent the rain from penetrating it: If well ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured, it is found in a very quick ſtate, in the Spring, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a great portion of it remaining unſlacked.</p>
                        <p>The opinions reſpecting the good or ill effects of lime, are exceedingly various; ſome aſſerting that it can never be uſed in too large a quantity; whilſt others contend, it is of no uſe whatever: Our own practice authorizes us to ſay, that upon ſome ſoils, the application of lime, (or calca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reous earth in ſome other form) in conſiderable quantities, is abſolutely neceſſary, in order to bring them to their moſt fertile ſtate, and to prepare them for the action of other manures; whilſt upon other ſoils, lime produces no ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible effect, and if uſed in large quantities, will prove very detrimental.—Thus may one of the moſt valuable appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations we know, for the improvement of many ſoils, be condemned, by thoſe who draw <hi>poſitive concluſions,</hi> from <hi>partial obſervations of facts.</hi> The practice of paring and burning, we believe, owes the opprobrium, which ſome have thrown upon it, to <hi>a ſimilar mode of reaſoning.</hi>

                           <hi>Stone Marl,</hi> has formerly been uſed in conſiderable quantities, near Tweedſide, but the more immediate effects of lime have entirely ſet aſide the uſe of ſtone marl.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Shell Marl</hi> is uſed with great advantage, at the rate of 20 or 30 cart loads an acre, on the farms of Wark, Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nylaws, and Learmouth.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Sea Wrack, Sea Ware, or Marine Plants</hi>—driven a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhore by the tide, are uſed with great effect, wherever they can be had. Of theſe the <hi>fucus veſiculoſus,</hi> and its rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives <hi>F. ſerratus and inflatus,</hi> (Skeir Ware) are not held in much eſtimation, and when uſed, require to be laid up in large heaps to putrify. If laid upon the land, as the others
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:0179800900:133"/>are, when taken immediately from the ſhore, they dry, and turn to a black coriaceous ſubſtane. The <hi>fucus digitatus</hi> (Waſſels) is the great favourite, and another ſpecies called <hi>May-weed,</hi> which we cannot point out by its Linnaean name, not having had an opportunity of ſeeing it, but from the deſcriptions we have heard, ſuſpect it to be the young plants of the <hi>fucus digitatus.</hi>

                        <p>
                           <hi>The ſhort horned kind</hi> have been long eſtabliſhed over the whole county, the other kinds are found only in the hands of a few individuals, who have introduced them with a laudable view of comparing their merits with the eſtabliſhed breed of the country.—They differ from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther breeds, in the ſhortneſs of their horns, and in being wider and thicker in their form, conſequently feed to the moſt weight; in affording the greateſt quantity of tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low when fatted, in having very thin hides, and much leſs hair<note n="*" place="bottom">It is probably from the thinneſs of their hides and hair, that they are accounted tenderer than moſt other breeds.</note> upon them than any other breed (the Alderneys excepted); but the moſt eſſential difference conſiſts in the quantity of milk they give beyond moſt other breeds: there being inſtances of cows giving 36 quarts of milk per day, and of 48 firkins of butter being made from a dairy of 12 cows: but the more general quantity is 3 fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins per cow in a ſeaſon, and 24 quarts of milk per day:
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:0179800900:137"/>Their colour is much varied, but they moſtly are an agreeable mixture of red and white. From their being in many places called the Dutch breed, it is probable they were originally brought from the Continent.</p>
                        <p>They have been much improved of late years, by the exertions and attention of enterpriſing breeders; who have already improved them ſo far, as to be ſold fat to the butchers at 3½ years old. The weight of the carcaſe is in general from 60 to 80 ſtone, (14 lb. to the ſtone) but there are inſtances of individuals attaining much greater weight.</p>
                        <p>Sir H. Grey bred and fed two ſeven-years old oxen that weighed 152 ſtone 9 lb. the four quarters only; and a ſpayed heifer, 132 ſtone, 6 lb. ditto. Mr Smith of Togſtone, a cow, 127 ſtone 11 lb. ditto.</p>
                        <p>But large ſize is not now conſidered as an excellence: Quick ſeeders, that lay their ſat upon the moſt valuable parts, and have the leaſt offal in the coarſe parts, are the kind which every enlightened breeder wiſhes to be poſſeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>The long Horns</hi> have been introduced from the improv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſtocks of the Midland counties, at different times and by different breeders; but have in moſt inſtances given way again to the improved breed of ſhort horns.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>The Devonſhire breed</hi> is only in the poſſeſſion of Walter Trevelyan, Eſq. of Nether Witton, who introduced them about three years ſince; their offspring has not yet got to a proper age to form a judgment of their comparative merits.</p>

                           <hi>The Wild Cattle</hi>—are only found in Chillingham Park, belonging to the Earl of Tankerville; and as it is probable they are the only remains of the <hi>true and genuine</hi> breed of

                        <p>Their colour is invariably white, muzzle black; the whole of the inſide of the ear, and about one third of the outſide from the tip, downwards, red; horns white, with black tips, very fine, and bent upwards. Some of the bulls have a thin upright mane, about an inch and an half, or two inches long. The weight of the oxen is from 35 to 45 ſtone, and the cows from 25 to 35 ſtone, the four quarters; 14 lb. to the ſtone. The beef is fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly marbled, and of excellent flavour.</p>
                        <p>From the nature of their paſture, and the frequent agitation they are put into, by the curioſity of ſtrangers, it cannot be expected they ſhould get very fat; yet the ſix years old oxen are generally very good beef. From whence it may be fairly ſuppoſed, that in proper ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, they would feed well.</p>
                        <p>At the firſt appearance of any perſon they ſet off in full gallop; and, at the diſtance of two or three hundred yards, make a wheel round, and come boldly up again, toſting their heads in a menacing manner; on a ſudden they make a full ſtop, at the diſtance of forty or fifty yards, looking wildly at the object of their ſurprize; but upon the leaſt motion being made, they all again turn round, and gallop off again with equal ſpeed, but not to the ſame diſtance: forming a ſhorter circle, and again returning with a bolder, and more threatening aſpect than before; they approach much nearer, probably within thirty yards, when they make another ſtand, and again gallop off: this they do ſeveral times, ſhortening their
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:0179800900:140"/>inſtance, and advancing nearer; till they come within a few yards, when moſt people think it prudent to leave them, not chuſing to provoke them further, as it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that in a few turns more they would make an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack.</p>
                        <p>The mode of killing them was, perhaps, the only mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern remains of the grandeur of ancient hunting. On notice been given, that a wild bull would be killed upon a certain day, the inhabitants of the neighbourhood came mounted, and armed with guns, &amp;c. ſometimes to the number of an hundred horſe, and four or five hundred foot, who ſtood upon walls or got into trees, while the horſemen rode off the bull from the reſt of the herd, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til he ſtood at bay; when a markſman diſmounted and ſhot. At ſome of theſe huntings, twenty or thirty ſhots have been fired before he was ſubdued: on ſuch occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, the bleeding victim grew deſperately furious, from the ſmarting of his wounds, and the ſhouts of ſavage joy that were echoing from every ſide: from the number of accidents that happened, this dangerous mode has been ſeldom practiſed of late years; the park-keeper alone generally ſhooting them with a rifled gun, at one ſhot.—When the cows calve, they hide their calves, for a week or ten days, in ſome ſequeſtered ſituation, and go and ſuckle them two or three times a day. If any perſon come near the calves, they clap their heads cloſe to the ground, and lie like a hare in form, to hide themſelves. This is a proof of their native wildneſs, and is corroborated by the following circumſtance, that happened to the writer of this narrative, who found a hidden calf, two days old, very lean, and very weak; on ſtroking its head, it got up, pawed two or three times like an old bull, bellowed very loud, retired a few ſteps, and bolted at his legs with all its force; it then began to paw again, bellowed, ſtep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped back, and bolted as before: but knowing its inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:0179800900:141"/>and ſtepping aſide, it miſſed me, fell, and was ſo very weak, that it could not riſe, though it made ſeveral efforts; but it had done enough, the whole herd were alarmed, and coming to its reſcue, obliged me to retire; for the dams will allow no perſon to touch their calves without attacking them with impetuous ferocity.</p>
                        <p>When any one happens to be wounded, or grown weak and feeble through age or ſickneſs, the reſt of the herd ſet upon it, and gore it to death.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Dairy.</hi>—This county cannot boaſt of its dairies; thoſe who live in the vicinity of Newcaſtle, and other populous places, make a handſome return by the ſale of milk, freſh butter, &amp;c. but upon moſt of the large farms in this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, dairies are not held in much eſtimation.</p>

                           <hi>Breeding young cattle</hi>—is practiſed in almoſt every part of the county. Upon the large farms, cows are kept more for this purpoſe than the profit of dairying: there are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of 50 or 60 calves being brought up in one ſeaſon, by one farmer, who did not milk more than fifteen cows.

In the Summer the calves are turned to graſs, and in the firſt Winter get turnips and ſtraw.

                        <p>In this county there are three diſtinct breeds.—The Cheviot ſheep, the Heath ſheep, and the long-wooled ſheep.</p>

                           <hi>The Cheviot ſheep</hi>—are hornleſs, the faces and legs in general white.<note n="*" place="bottom">Many of the Cheviot ſheep have dark faces, and were more ſo formerly. We were informed by Mr Chiſholm, Mr Readhead, Mr Marſhall, &amp;c. that theſe dark-faced ones grew equally as fine wool. were as hardy, and equally as good thrivers as the white-faced ones; but that the people to whom they ſold their ſheep, and eſpecially tups, preferred white faces; for which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, they have endeavoured to get quit of black faces.</note> The <hi>beſt breeds</hi> have a ſine open coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, with lively prominent eyes; body long, fore quarters wanting depth in the breaſt, and breadth both there and on the chine; fine clean ſmall boned legs; thin pelts, weight of carcaſe when fat, from 12 to 18 lb. per quarter; fleeces from 2½ to 3½ lb each, and ſold in 1792, for 11d. per lb. The wool is not all ſine, there being in a fleece of 3 lb. weight, only 2 lb. of ſine wool, worth one ſhilling per lb. (when the whole fleece ſells at 10d. per lb.) and one pound of coarſe, worth only 6 d. per lb.</p>
                        <p>They are bred only upon the hilly diſtricts in the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſt part of the county, and do not extend much farther ſouth than Reedwater.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>beſt kind</hi> of theſe ſheep are certainly a very hardy and valuable mountain ſheep, where the <hi>paſture is moſtly green ſward,</hi> or contains a large portion of that kind of herbage; which is the caſe with all the hills around Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viot, where theſe ſheep are bred; for as to the mountain of Cheviot itſelf, no kind of ſheep whatever are bred up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it; and we find it an univerſal practice, amongſt the moſt experienced ſheep farmers, to depaſture the <hi>heathy</hi>

                        <p>The ſhape of this breed of ſheep has been much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of late years; but all thoſe who have been aiding in making ſuch improvements, readily acknowledge,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:0179800900:146"/>there is ſtill much to be done; eſpecially to the fore quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which they all agree is very defective; but we hope it will not long remain ſo, as we think we ſee a ſpirit of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtigation ariſing amongſt theſe breeders, that in a few years will remedy not only this defect, but will diſcover others, which at preſent they are not willing to admit. But as knowledge is progreſſive, we cannot expect the perfection of this breed of ſheep can be obtained at once; it muſt proceed by ſlow gradations, as every other im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement hath done; it is a great point gained, that we admit defects, and are deſirous to amend them.</p>
                        <p>That breed of ſheep which brings the moſt profit to the farmer, will always be purſued by him, whatever his ſituation; but that object, we preſume, is not to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in this diſtrict from <hi>fine wool alone.</hi> Perfect moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſheep ſhould be <hi>active, hardy, well formed,</hi> and <hi>quick ſeeders:</hi> theſe qualities will always recommend them to the grazier, who will never purchaſe a ſlow feeding ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal, while he can get one of a different ſort, though at a conſiderable advanced price. But if to theſe qualities, ſo eſſential to the ſale of a mountain farmer's ſtock, can be added a <hi>fleece of fine wool,</hi> a breed of ſheep would then be obtained, the propereſt for a hilly diſtrict of any we have yet ſeen. There is little doubt but this may be accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>proper ſelection;</hi> and probably the <hi>beſt kind</hi> of Cheviot ſheep, from their hardineſs, and producing a portion of fine wool, are the propereſt ſtock for laying the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſo deſirable an improvement.</p>
                        <p>Mr Robſon, of Belford, (now of Chatto) ſays, he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved the ſhape of his ſheep very conſiderably; particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly the fore-quarter, and the wool, in having leſs but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tocks; by uſing three rams which he purchaſed in Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colnſhire, thirty-three years ſince; and we know other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of improvement, by uſing tups of ⅓ or ¼ Diſhley
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:0179800900:147"/>blood. In all theſe caſes, we do not find the ſheep leſs hardy, or wool of leſs value; but the carcaſe materially improved.<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr Smith, of Woodhall, had ſome of his Cheviot ewes put to a tup of Mr Thompſon's; the produce of which were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined when 18 months old, by Mr Robert Thompſon, and the report was, that the form was amazingly improved, and the gimmers ſtood the Winter remarkably well.

                           <note n="†" place="bottom">This criterion militates very ſtrongly againſt the Spaniſh ſheep; unleſs they can be found with carcaſes of ſuperior form, and inclination to fatten, to any we have yet ſeen.</note> from the ſame ground, in equal times.

                           <hi>The Mode of Management</hi>—amongſt the ſheep farmers of theſe hills, is to divide their flock into different parcels, viz. lambs, hogs, gimmers, ewes, and wethers, and each parcel kept on ſuch paſturage as is thought moſt proper for them. Every parcel is attended by a ſhepherd, who is bound to return the number of ſheep delivered to him, either alive, or in his account of dead ſheep, which are in
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:0179800900:148"/>general ſold at different prices, according to their good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                        <p>The ewes are 2½ years old before they are put to the tup; and are kept till five or ſix years old: the loſs of lambs is ſometimes very conſiderable, not only on being dropped, but alſo from other diſorders, as the <hi>"milk-ill,"</hi> which attacks them from 3 to 7 days old, the <hi>"quarter-ill,"</hi> &amp;c. which Mr Chiſholm of Clennel eſtimates at not leſs than 15 <hi>per cent.</hi> taking one year with another. And Mr Smith of Woodhall ſays, that "altho' the Cheviot breed be as healthy as perhaps any, yet there can hardly be an inſtance adducible of any of the different ſheep flocks coming all to the ſhears, much leſs the hogs; out of which it is common to allow two out of each ſcore."</p>

                           <hi>The Heath Sheep</hi>—have large ſpiral horns, black faces and legs, a fierce wild-looking eye, and ſhort firm carcaſſes (weighing from 12 to 16 lb. per quarter) covered with long, open, coarſe ſhagged wool. The fleeces weigh from three to four pounds each; and ſold, in 1792, for ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence per pound. They are an exceedingly active and hardy race, and ſeem the beſt adapted, of all others, to high expoſed <hi>heathy</hi> diſtricts; ſuch as we find them in poſſeſſion of here, from the weſtern parts of the county of Durham, to North Tyne.</p>
                        <p>Mr Hopper, of Blackhedley, buys year old wethers of this kind of ſheep for 10s. 6d. each, and two-year olds for 14s. which he depaſtures upon a <hi>heathy moor</hi> of 4000 acres; from whence he takes them at 3½ years old to tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nips; and ſells, the May following, from 28 to 32 ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings each: he has tried the Cheviot ſheep in the ſame manner, but thinks the other a hardier and better feeding ſheep.<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr Hopper ſays, that the beſt ſheep of this kind he has tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, are bred about Moffat, in Scotland.</note>

                           <pb n="131" facs="tcp:0179800900:150"/>The breeders of this kind of ſheep on the ſouth weſt corner of the county, are very confident, that they are a <hi>much hardier ſheep</hi> than the Cheviot breed; and upon their high expoſed heathy mountains, where there is <hi>very little green herbage,</hi> much more profitable; while the Cheviot farmers aſſert, that theirs are equally hardy, and that the greater value of the fleece gives them a decided ſuperiority. We have before ſtated that the fineneſs of wool is not a proper criterion, by which the merits of a breed of ſheep are to be determined; it can only be done by fair experiment, in which all the circumſtances of the caſe are included; but we do not find that this has ever been done by either party, and tho' it is only opinion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt opinion, yet both parties are ſo poſitive, that they are ready to quarrel with any perſon who happens to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs an opinion of his own: we ſhall therefore content ourſelves with ſtating, that the queſtion can only be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly decided by a parcel of each kind of ewes (ſuppoſe 100) being depaſtured and kept in every reſpect equally alike, upon ſome of thoſe high, expoſed ſituations, the height of which is much more elevated, and the herbage much coarſer than the Cheviot paſtures; and almoſt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally covered with <hi>Heath or Hather (Erica Vulgaris.)</hi> And at the end of <hi>five, ſix, or ſeven years,</hi> that breed which has brought the greateſt number of ſheep to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket, and made the moſt profit, will deſervedly be deemed the <hi>hardieſt, beſt,</hi> and <hi>moſt eligible,</hi> for ſuch ſituations.</p>
                        <p>Until ſome experiment of this kind determine the matter; we hope, we ſhall not give offence to either party by ſtating, that we have ſeen the heath ſheep bred with advantage upon higher and coarſer paſtures than <hi>Common Burn,</hi> or thoſe others around Cheviot, which are deemed improper for a breeding flock of the Cheviot kind; and that it may probably turn out, that each breed is particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly adapted to particular ſituations, the one to <hi>coarſe expoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:0179800900:151"/>mountains,</hi> where the luxury of green herbage is thinly ſcattered, or rarely to be found: the other, to <hi>hilly paſtures,</hi> where conſiderable portions of verdant ſurface predomin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate, ſuch as characterize the paſtoral diſtricts around Cheviot.</p>

                           <hi>The long-woolled ſheep,</hi>—which formerly occupied the lower diſtrict of this county, were called <hi>Muggs,</hi> probably from their faces being covered with a muff of wool, cloſe to their eyes. Theſe being a ſlow feeding tribe, have given way to the Diſhley breed, which were firſt intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced into this county in the year 1766,<note n="*" place="bottom">By Meſſrs Culley.</note> and by their ſuperior merit have ſo far made their way againſt every prejudice and oppoſition, that it is probable in a few years there will be a difficulty in finding a flock that is not more or leſs related to the Diſhley blood.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>The improved breed of long-woolled ſheep</hi>—are diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from other long-woolled kinds by their fine lively eyes, clean heads, ſtraight broad flat backs, round barrel-like bodies, very fine ſmall bones, thin pelts; and that ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular property of making fat at an early age, perhaps more than any thing elſe, gives them a ſuperiority over the other breed in this iſland.</p>
                        <p>The weight of the carcaſe in general is, ewes three or four years old, from 18 to 26 lb. per quarter; the wool upon an average, 7½lb. a fleece; the length from 6 to 14 inches; ſold in 1792, at 10d. per lb.</p>
                        <p>The moſt approved mode of management of this breed of ſheep is as follows: The ewes generally lamb in March, when we give them a few turnips to increaſe their milk. The latter end of June or beginning of July the lambs are weaned, and ſent to middling paſture; but a good paſture would certainly be a more eligible practice. The ewes are milked two or three times to eaſe their udders, and ſuch

And though this breed be not emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent for much tallow, yet ewes under ſuch circumſtances have been known to produce from eighteen to twenty-four pounds of tallow each.</p>
                        <p>The lambs, after being weaned, take the name of Hogs. They are generally put to turnips the beginning of Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and continue at them till the middle of April or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of May; when the wether hogs are put upon good paſture, or ſecond year's clover. The ſecond Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they have turnips until the clovers are ſufficiently grown to receive them, which is generally about the middle of April: they are clipped or ſhorn about the middle of May, when we begin to ſell them, and are moſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all ſold by the middle or end of June. Morpeth is our beſt market, where the two ſhear wethers are generally ſold for from forty to fifty ſhillings a head; in 1797, they ſold for 3l. per head on an average. At this age they are equally fat as the ewes before deſcribed:</p>
                        <p>Of late years it has been cuſtomary to fell the ſhearling wethers, in June or July, to the butchers, fatter than moſt other breeds will be at two or three years old; the weight of theſe ſhearling wethers is from 18 to 21 lb. per quarter.</p>
                        <p>We generally reckon one third of the ewes to have twin lambs. They are put to the tup, ſo as to have lambs at two years old, and kept for breeding until three or four years old, except ſuch as are of particular good forms, or have other valuable properties: theſe we keep as long as ever they will breed. Such as are defective in
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:0179800900:154"/>ſhape, ſuſpected of being ſlow feeders, or other unprofit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able qualities, we never put to the tup, or attempt to breed from them.</p>

                           <hi>Letting Tups</hi>—to ſerve ewes for the ſeaſon, has been a practice in this county for near 30 years, and is becoming more prevalent daily; the prices vary from five to one hundred guineas, for the uſe of one ſheep; and ewes are frequently taken in to be ſerved by a favourite ram, at as high rates as from 3 to 5 guineas each. The number of ewes to be ſerved by a ſhearing tup, is generally ſtipulat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not to exceed 80, and for an aged ſheep 120.</p>
                        <p>At the firſt introduction of this breed of ſheep, a great prejudice was raiſed againſt them, and clamorous outcries made, that their adoption would be the ruin of the country, and no means were left untried to depreciate their value: but every obſtacle has been overcome by their ſuperior merit, which ſeems now to be univerſally acknowledged, as may be judged from the following cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance.</p>
                        <p>In October 1795, Mr Thompſon of Chillingham Barns, having quitted a farm, he advertiſed to ſell by auction, 500 ewes, in lots of 5 each.

The wethers are generally ſold in September and October, being then ſhearlings, for, from 22s. to 26s. each; and the ewes three and a half years old, from 18s. to 24s. each; in 1796, they were as high as 2l. each.</p>

In the lower diſtricts it is now almoſt totally diſuſed; and ſome of the hill farmers have laid it aſide, and find their flocks do equally well as before; and the wool ſells for a much better price than when it is ſalved; but it is of leſs weight,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:0179800900:156"/>as may be naturally expected, from the want of near ¾ of a pound of ſalve upon each fleece.</p>
                        <p>This ſalve is compoſed of 12 lb. of butter, and 4 quarts of tar, mixed well together while warm, which quantity ſerves 24 ſheep, the number a man will ſalve in a day.</p>

                           <hi>Milking.</hi>—It uſed to be a general practice through all this county to milk ewes after the lambs were weaned, for ſix, eight, or ten weeks; from this milk great quantities of cheeſe were made, and ſold for about 3d. per pound. When kept to three or four years old, it is exceedingly pungent, and on that account ſome people prefer it to cheeſe of a much better quality.</p>
                        <p>To milk ewes two or three times after the lambs are weaned is a uſeful practice; but when continued to eight or ten weeks, it becomes very detrimental, keeps the ewes lean, and ill prepared for meeting the ſeverities of Winter.</p>
                        <p>This cuſtom has been long diſuſed by the intelligent farmers in the lower diſtricts; and we are glad to ſind it much laid aſide by the moſt conſiderable hill farmers.

                           <p>That the oxen are yoked at 3 years old, and are worked till ſix; and for the firſt year require 8, to do the work of 2 horſes; but after having been worked a year, and become tractable and ſtronger, 6 are equal to 2 horſes, either by being yoked three at a time, or two, and driven by the holder with cords; of courſe, the expence of a driver may be eſtimated to be ſaved for one half the year.</p>
                           <p>That the expences of a ploughman, the plough and other articles that are the ſame in both teams, need not be taken into the account.</p>
                           <p>And that oxen, to work regularly through the year, cannot work more than half a day at a time.</p>

                           <p>But before any proper concluſions can be drawn whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>ox teams</hi> or <hi>horſes</hi> are the moſt eligible, it will be neceſſary to conſider, whether the quantity of land em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in ſupporting thoſe animals be uſed in the moſt profitable mode to the community, as well as the occupier.</p>
                           <p>With the latter, the firſt queſtion for conſideration is, whether 8 oxen uſed in the team, or in grazing, will pay him the moſt money?</p>
                           <p>Suppoſe 8 oxen, at <hi>three years old,</hi> were put to the plough, and plough 6 acres per week; which, at 3s. 4d.<note n="*" place="bottom">If to this 3s. 4d. be added 1s. 8d. the wages for the plough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man and driver, it will make 5s. the uſual price for ploughing an acre in this diſtrict.</note> per acre, is 20 ſhillings; and if they work 48 weeks in a year, then their whole earnings (after deducting 6l. for
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:0179800900:162"/>expences of harneſs, ſhoeing, &amp;c.) will be 42l.: but if they plough only 5 <hi>acres per week,</hi> (which is probably nearer the truth), then their whole earnings will be on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly 34l.</p>
                           <p>The ſame oxen put to graze, to pay the ſame money, ſhould improve in value 5l. 5s. each, in the firſt caſe; and 4l. 5s. in the latter: but we are inclined to believe, there are few ſituations, if the cattle are of a good quick feeding kind, where they would not pay <hi>conſiderably more.</hi>

                           <p>Hence it appears, that a team of 6 oxen requires 10 acres more land to maintain them than a team of 2 horſes, which will do the ſame work: and of courſe, the produce which might be derived from this 10 acres, is loſt to the community: ſuppoſe it be one half in graſs, and the other half in ploughing, then we ſhall have,

                           <p>From this view of the ſubject, it appears, that if oxen were univerſally uſed for the draught, in the room of horſes, there would be a conſiderable defalcation in the ſupply of the markets, both in corn and animal food.<note n="*" place="bottom">In this county it is eſtimated that there are capable of cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivation, 800000 acres; and allowing ⅓ of this to be in tillage, that is 266666 acres; and that every 50 acres in tillage will require a team to manage it properly; of courſe there will be at leaſt 5333 teams, but for the ſake of round numbers call it 5000 teams.

                        <p>THE turnpike roads are moſtly in good order; thoſe that have an opportunity of getting whinſtone, or limeſtone, are the beſt; but they certainly would be better if the ſurveyors would order the ſtones to be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken ſmaller and the roads made wider. One great ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to ſome of theſe roads is the many ſteep banks they are diſgraced with, ſome of the worſt might have been avoided; but it ſeems the original ſetters-out of theſe roads had a predilection for climbing and deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſteep banks: this is notorious on both the roads up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Rimſide-Moor, without even the plea of being near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; as the leveller road would have been nearer, travelled in much leſs time, and with far leſs fatigue. Some ſimilar caſes appear on the poſt road, which we hope will be remedied in the next application to Parliament for a new act.</p>
                        <p>The townſhip roads are in ſome places good, but by far the greateſt-part are deſerving of a different appellation; the cauſe of this deficiency is in moſt caſes to be attributed to the neglect and manner of performing the ſtatute-work.</p>
                        <p>One mode of remedying this neglect, would be to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point a ſurveyor, with a ſmall ſalary, who ſhould be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered to collect the compoſition due for ſtatute-work,

                        <p>A book ſhould be kept by the ſurveyor, and yearly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined, ſettled, and ſigned by a committee of inhabitants, before it went to the magiſtrates. We know from expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, that by this means the road would be much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter made, and in near double the quantity: for when a farmer ſends his cart to perform ſtatute-duty, it ſeldom carries more than half a load, and the ſervants practiſe every manoeuvre to put off time, and do as little as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble which would not be the caſe with hired carts, as every inhabitant would be ready to report any mal-practices.</p>

                        <p>In this county there are no Canals; and notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heir manifeſt utility to a diſtrict like this, where ſuch immenſe quantities of heavy articles are to be conveyed; yet we believe, no attempt was ever made, or even ſo much as a canal projected, in any part of the county before 1792, when ſome gentlemen on Tweedſide had it in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation to make a navigable canal, from the collieries and lime works near Berwick, to Kelſo in Scotland, and from thence up the Tweed and Tiviot; but a ſurvey be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made by Mr Whitworth, it was dropt, probably on account of the great expence.</p>
                        <p>The next public notice we can trace, was given by Mr Dodd, in 1794, of a canal from Newcaſtle to Carliſle, or M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This was to paſs on the <hi>ſouth ſide</hi> of Tyne: but Mr Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man propoſed a line to paſs on the <hi>north ſide</hi> of Tyne, the peculiarity of which was, that it ſhould come from Hay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don-Bridge, to the <hi>upper parts</hi> of Newcaſtle, upon <hi>one level without a lock,</hi> and the goods conveyed from thence
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:0179800900:171"/>to the river, either by a kind of ſtair-caſe of locks, or in waggons on an inclined plane. By this propoſal, the principal ſupporters of the grand canal were divided into-two parties; the conſequence of which was, that the money to compleat the great deſign of uniting the two ſeas, could not be raiſed, and of courſe it was given up; one on the north ſide, propoſed <hi>to ſtop</hi> at <hi>Haydon-Bridge,</hi> and another on the ſouth ſide at <hi>Hexham.</hi> The ſubſcriptions for defraying the expence of the north line, we were informed were filled; and application was made to Parliament in 1797, to obtain an Act for making a canal on the north ſide, but it met with ſo ſtrong an oppoſition from the land owners, that it was thought pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to withdraw it.</p>
                        <p>The ſubſcribers for a canal on the ſouth of the river ſtill perſevere in their endeavours to accompliſh the line to Hexham, or Haydon-Bridge; and we have not heard that any oppoſition to the meaſure is intended by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietors of lands, through which it is to paſs.</p>

                        <p>This is one of the largeſt fairs in the north of England. The horſe fair begins nine or ten days before the 29th, and continues every day in the town, where great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of remarkable ſine horſes, for the field, the road, and the carriage, are ſold daily. The abundant choice of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very kind, brings great numbers of dealers from London and various other diſtant places: its celebrity has increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed very much of late years, and we believe it may be juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly claſſed amongſt the firſt horſe fairs in the kingdom.</p>
                        <p>The ſhow of cattle is alſo very great, not only for the breed of the country, but alſo for large droves of kyloes, (Scotch cattle) which are purpoſely driven from the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands, to be ſold at this fair.—The fair on the 29th, is held on the Town-moor, and is called the <hi>Cow-hill fair.</hi>

                        <p>Dr Hutton, in his Plan of Newcaſtle, in 1772, ſtates the annual conſumption of this place to be 5000 catttle, 10000 calves, and 147000 ſheep and lambs.</p>

                        <p>The commerce of this county is derived principally from the coal trade: the ſhips belonging to the port of Newcaſtle, in 1772, are ſtated by Mr Pennant, to be 3948, their tonnage, 758214—The principal exports are coals, lead, lead ſhot, wrought iron, grindſtones, pottery, glaſs, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>The exports from Berwick, are chiefly corn, flour, oat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meal, ſhilled barley, potatoes, fiſh, eggs, wool, &amp;c. coaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways; which has increaſed very much of late years: the foreign trade is chieſly to the north of Europe.</p>
                        <p>The number of veſſels belonging to this port is about 40, making upwards of 3000 tons: the receipts of the cuſtoms are, upon an average, about 3000l. per ann.</p>
                        <p>The port of Alemouth alſo employs a few veſſels in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting corn, flour, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>And a few veſſels are employed in the Summer ſeaſon, in carrying lime, from the neighbourhood of Bambro', to different parts of Scotland.</p>

                        <p>This county is not diſtinguiſhed by any ſtaple manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures;
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:0179800900:176"/>the principal are derived from, or connected with the coal trade and mines; as ſhip-building, roperies, forges, founderies, copperas, coal tar, ſoda, or marine alkali, white lead, potteries, glaſs works, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>Hexham has been long famed for its manufacture of gloves, which employs about 300 hands.</p>
                        <p>To eſtabliſh <hi>manufactures of Woollens,</hi> two or three eſſays have been lately made at Alnwick, Mitford, and Acklington; and a cotton Mill has been lately erected at Nether-Witton; all of which, from preſent appearances, we hope are doing well.</p>
                        <p>There is one ſpecies of manufacture carried on in this diſtrict, with an agricultural production of ſmall value, viz. that of ſtraw, which is not only made uſe of as a covering for the heads of the wives and daughters of the humble cottager, but has alſo lately been converted into orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that might accompany the richeſt and moſt ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did dreſs, which the palace or the drawing-room ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibits; and, for the honour of the plough, has not only been converted into buttons for the men, but alſo into rings and ear-rings for the ladies.</p>
                        <p>Agriculture is certainly benefited by manufactures in the conſumption of its produce, by the great number of people employed: but we do not find any new modes of practice or improvements in agriculture, introduced in their vicinity, or reſulting from the exertions of thoſe connected with them.</p>

                     <p>In our journey through this county, wherever we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired what was the chief obſtacle to improvement? the anſwer was univerſally, <hi>"Tithes!"</hi>—An impoſition ſo preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with miſchief, and ſo often the ſource of violent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſions betwixt the clergy and their pariſhioners, ſhould if poſſible be removed, either by purchaſe, commutation, or any other means, by which a <hi>fair equivalent</hi> ſhall be rendered for them: for ſo long as they exiſt, it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to expect that agricultural improvements will be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on to the extent of which they are capable. In our Survey of Cumberland, we have ſhewn the great uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of employing money in ſpeculations of improving land; and that the tithes, in ſuch caſes, are a large por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a man's capital in trade, and not a tenth of he natural produce of the earth, which ſome have thought was all that was intended by the original impoſers, who no doubt meant them for a good purpoſe; but if through a ſucceſſion of ages, a change of manners, of ſentiments,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:0179800900:178"/>and of cultivation, has taken place, and the ill effects of tithes be univerſally felt, and acknowledged to leſſon the quantity of food obtainable from a conſiderable portion of this kingdom, a change in the mode of paying tithes would alſo be deſirable; for the proprietors of ſuch lands are not only loſers, but the community at large. It is ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing that a grievance of ſuch magnitude ſhould have ſo long evaded the reviſion and regulation of the legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and that it ſhould be always ſo ſtrenuouſly oppoſed by the clergy, there being no wiſh to take any thing from them, but to render a <hi>fair equivalent</hi> for what is their due; and which there would be little difficulty in doing, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the many objections that have been invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to perplex this moſt intereſting queſtion.</p>

                     <head>Review of ſome particular parts.</head>
                     <p>IN taking a review of the foregoing report, we find, that the minerals are of great importance to this county. In reſpect to the coals, it appears, that they are not inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſtible, and in two or three centuries will probably be ſo far wrought out, that the metropolis will have to be ſupplied from other diſtricts with this neceſſary article, of a very inferior quality, and at a much higher price.</p>
                     <p>The moſt ſtriking parts in a view of the Agriculture, are
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:0179800900:182"/>the great extent of farms: leaſes for 21 years, and the opulence, intelligence, and enterpriſing ſpirit of the farm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers: but the moſt prominent feature, is keeping a due balance betwixt the arable and graſs lands, ſo as always to have a large breeding live ſtock, eſpecially of ſheep.—Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſyſtems of huſbandry have been tried, and the boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one of turnips, barley, clover, and wheat, has been purſued till the crops have evidently declined, particularly the turnips and clover; and the only means of reſtoring ſuch lands, has been by adopting the ſyſtem of three years arable, and three years graſs, <hi>depaſtured with ſheep,</hi> and a ſmall proportion of cattle: by this mode, nature has time to prepare a ſufficient lea-clod, which being turned up for the turnip fallow, will enſure a vigorous crop of tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nips, as it is well known they always flouriſh upon freſh land, or where they find the remains of a lea-clod to vegetate in. It is from this circumſtance, and the pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar and excellent mode of cultivating them, that ſuch great crops are produced, with not more than 10 <hi>or</hi> 12 <hi>cart loads</hi> of dung per acre: crops that are ſeldom worth leſs than 4, 5, or 6l. per acre, for the purpoſes of feeding cattle and ſheep, have in ſome inſtances been ſold for 7 and 8l. per acre. This mode of cultivating turnips in drills, is alſo of great importance, being much ſuperior to the broad-caſt culture, not only for the turnip crop, but for every other crop that ſucceeds them.</p>
                     <p>The proportion betwixt the quantities in arable and graſs, varies according to the quality of the ſoil, and other circumſtances; but in moſt ſituations it is uſual to keep a certain portion of the beſt and richeſt old grazing lands, conſtantly in graſs, as a "corps de reſerve," in caſe the artificial graſſes fail; and on ſtrong clayey ſoils, for depaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turing a portion of the ſtore flock upon in winter; for this purpoſe, it is neceſſary upon ſuch ſoils, to have a much larger portion of old graſs land, than upon dry loams;
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:0179800900:183"/>and which is generally eaten lightly in the latter part of Summer, that there may be a good aftermath, againſt the time the artificial graſſes fail.</p>
                     <p>It is this union of ſtock and tillage, and purſuing the ſyſtem mentioned in page 64, that enables the farmers to pay ſuch high rents; and which keeps the land always in a <hi>due ſtate of fertility,</hi> to produce the moſt profitable crops;<note n="*" place="bottom">There is a certain ſtate of fertility neceſſary for producing maximum crops of grain; land may be too rich as well as too poor, for growing corn: we have frequently ſeen crops of wheat rendered of little or no value, by the injudicious application of a few cart loads of manure per acre more than was neceſſary; upon lands made too rich, corn is very apt to lodge; which not only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jures the crop of grain, but entirely deſtroys the clover and arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial graſſes ſown along with it.</note> and at the ſame time is managed and kept clear of weeds at the leaſt expence. The portion that is kept in graſs for three years, breeds and fattens ſuch a number of ſheep, as leave a conſiderable profit, probably equal, if not more than the arable crops: the yearly profits of a ſheep, being eſtimated at not leſs than from 20 to 30s. 6 or 8 of which, an acre of clover will fatten, and an acre of turnips about double the number.</p>
                     <p>But this ſyſtem are obtained the principal advantages of folding, without any of its inconveniences; for if on an average The 1ſt year's clover &amp; graſs carry 7 ſheep per acre for

                     <p>It will be proper to obſerve, that the ſheep ſtock of this diſtrict has been ſo much improved within the laſt 30 years, that they can now be ſold fatter at 15 months old, than they uſed to be at more than double that age; yet we find that the ſame childiſh arguments were uſed at that time, againſt changing the "eſtabliſhed breed of the country," as are uſed by ſome people at this day, in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the worſt breed of ſheep in the kingdom.</p>

                     <p>To thoſe few who practiſe the ſyſtem of taking two white crops to a fallow, and of continuing their land in tillage for nine, twelve, or more years, and of ſowing it up with common hay-ſeeds, white clover, &amp;c. and letting it continue as many years in graſs, as it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in tillage; we would recommend the ſyſtem in the article <hi>Rotation of crops,</hi> (page 64.)</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Of drilling beans and peaſe;</hi>—we have before expreſſed our ſurpriſe, that ſo excellent a practice ſhould be neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected in all that extenſive diſtrict along the ſea coaſt, where they are ſo much cultivated; we hope that the good ſenſe and enterpriſing ſpirit of the wealthy farmers of this diſtrict will no longer be ſwayed by old cuſtoms, but will be ready to make a fair experiment, of a ſyſtem which has been practiſed on ſimilar ſoils with ſucceſs, and may, in all probability, be equally beneficial on theirs.

                        <hi>In the live ſtock</hi> of this county, there is certainly great improvement to be made, and like many other branches of ſcience, the more we inveſtigate the ſubject, the more we are convinced of its unlimited improvements: but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements of this kind are not ſo eaſily ſpread as thoſe of cultivation. If a farmer ſees any modes of practice more beneficial than thoſe he knew before, he can readily adopt them; or if he diſcovers and ſelects a new variety of any ſpecies of grain, more productive and more valuable than any hitherto known, it multiplies ſo faſt, that it is readily diſſeminated; but <hi>improved breeds of ſtock</hi> are not ſo readily diffuſed; they are much flower in their propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, and much more eaſily contaminated, and are only to be preſerved by <hi>attention</hi> and <hi>judgment:</hi> when <hi>theſe</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come general, we may hope that improved breeds of ſtock will prevail over the whole county; this period is proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly more diſtant than a true patriot would wiſh, but in the mean time we hope, that thoſe who are already poſſeſſed of improved breeds of ſtock, will not ſlacken in their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits; that by their example, the knowledge and practice of breeding may, by degrees, be better underſtood, and a ſpirit of emulation more generally diffuſed. When we conſider and reflect how ſlow that moſt valuable breed of ſheep (now beſt known by the appellation of the <hi>Diſhley breed</hi>) has ſpread, and how very ſmall a part of this iſland they ſtill cover, one would be almoſt led to think that the breeders were not bleſſed with the ſenſes of ſeeing and
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:0179800900:187"/>feeling—Mr Bakewell has been employed above 40 years in the important taſk of improving this breed of ſheep, to a degree of perfection unknown at any former period; yet it is a very few years ſince many of his near neighbours purſued a very different, and leſs lucrative ſpecies. To this day, we are pretty well informed, that more than half the large fertile county of Lincoln continue to breed a ſlow feeding, unprofitable kind, though adjoining the county of Leiceſter: which is the more to be regretted, becauſe that county certainly produces more ſheep than any other in the iſland, and perhaps we do not hazard too much if we aſſert it as our opinion, that it ſends more mutton to market than any two counties in the kingdom. However, we flatter ourſelves, that the labours of the Board of Agriculture will have a happy tendency towards opening men's eyes, and convincing them of the propriety of not only cultivating the ground in a more maſterly manner, but of ſtocking their paſtures with the moſt profitable animals.</p>

the climate muſt be various. Along the coaſt, and for a conſiderable way up the rivers, the ſnow ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom lies above twenty-four hours; but upon the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains the ſnow will continue for ſix or eight months: of court, the lower parts of the county are mild and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate, while on the higher grounds, and upon the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains and their vicinity, the air is cold and piercing; but the whole is healthy, though ſubject to great and frequent falls of rain, particularly in the Autumn, which makes their harveſts very precarious and expenſive. This exceſs of wet, we believe, is more or leſs the caſe upon the whole of the weſtern coaſts of the iſland.</p>

                           <hi>The ſoil</hi> is various, but may be claſſed under four diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent heads.</p>
                        <p n="1">1ſt. <hi>Fertile clays,</hi> or rather <hi>rich ſtrong loams,</hi> occupy but a ſmall portion of this county: formerly this kind of ſoil was generally employed in grazing, or the dairy; but ſince the introduction of growing wheat, it has been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted into tillage, and produces excellent crops of grain.</p>
                        <p n="2">2d. <hi>Dry Loams,</hi> including the various degrees from the rich brown loam, to the light ſandy ſoils. This is the moſt prevalent, occupying a greater portion of the county than any other; not only the lower diſtricts, but the fteep ſides of the mountains, are in general of this ſoil; and in many places, even their ſummits are covered with a dry ſound earth, producing green ſward, with little
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:0179800900:194"/>heath: we ſuppoſe at leaſt one half of the lower, or cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivatable diſtrict, is of this valuable ſoil, excellently adapt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the culture of turnips, artificial graſſes, the various ſpecies of grain, and of breeding and feeding the moſt improved kinds of ſtock, particularly ſheep, it being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly ſound, or ſafe from the rot.</p>
                        <p n="3">3d. <hi>Wet Loam,</hi> generally on a clay bottom. The fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tility of this ſoil is various, depending on the thickneſs of the ſtaple, and the nature of the clay below: it is danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous for ſheep, but may be applied with advantage to keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cows for the dairy, breeding young cattle and horſes, and to the culture of wheat, oats, clover, and ray graſs.</p>
                        <p n="4">4th. <hi>Black Peat earth,</hi> is moſt prevalent on the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainous diſtricts, particularly thoſe adjoining Northumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land and Durham: it is alſo found on moors or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, in the lower parts of the county; in ſome places only a few inches thick, upon a white ſand, well known, by thoſe whoſe lot it has been to cultivate it, to be an ungrateful and unprofitable ſoil.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>The ſurface</hi> is beautifully diverſified with level plains, and riſing eminences; deep ſequeſtered vales, and ſtupen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous mountains; open, braky, heathy commons, and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular incloſures, in ſome parts enriched with tufted groves and riſing plantations; the whole watered with innumerable ſtreams and extenſive lakes, abounding with fiſh of various denominations, which, with plenty of game, add to the recreation and luxury of the inhabitants.—It naturally divides into two diſtricts; the <hi>mountainous,</hi> incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of being improved by the plough; and the <hi>cultivatable,</hi> or all ſuch parts as have been, or can be improved by tillage.</p>
                        <p>The mountainous diſtricts are ſeparated into two divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, one of which bounds the eaſt ſide of the county, and is the <hi>higheſt part</hi> of that ridge of mountains, that divide the eaſtern and weſtern coaſts of the iſland, from Derbyſhire in England, to Linlithgow in Scotland. Croſs-fell,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:0179800900:195"/>Hartſide-fell, Geltſdale-foreſt, and Spadeadam-waſte, are the names of that portion of the ridge which paſſes through this county. Theſe mountains are compoſed of ſtrata of different kinds of ſtone, and are rich in coal, lime, and lead-ore; but are no way remarkable for any ſtriking irregularities of ſurface.</p>
                        <p>The other diviſion of mountainous diſtrict occupies the ſouth-weſt part of the county, known by the names of Skiddaw, Saddle-back, Helvellin, Wreynoſe, Hardknot, Sca-fell, &amp;c. &amp;c. remarkable for their ſteep, broken, rocky ſides, and romantic ſhapes; and are in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral one maſs of that kind of ſtone, which produces the beautiful blue ſlate, ſo much and ſo deſervedly eſteemed for covering the roofs of houſes. They are deſtitute of coal, lime, or metallic ores; but in ſome meaſure repay this defect, by affording ſuch valuable ſlates; and produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that ſingular mineral ſubſtance, <hi>blacklead,</hi> which is found in Borrowdale, and, it is ſaid, no where elſe in the ſouthern part of the kingdom.</p>
                        <p>The height, ruggedneſs, ſteepneſs of the ſides, (in ſome places ornamented with wood and projecting rocks) the varied forms, ſublime aſſemblage, and pictureſque beauty of theſe mountains, and the lakes they environ, form ſcenes that few other places, if any, in the iſland can equal; and have at different times exerciſed the pens of many deſcriptive writers:—it comes only within our province to remark, that this kind of ſlaty ſtone appears to be very friendly to vegetation: the ſoil which covers the ſteep ſides of theſe mountains, and found in conſiderable depth at their baſes, is in great part decayed ſlate; and the moſt fertile ſoils in the vales, we ſuſpect, have a large portion of this ſlaty matter in their compoſition; this is the caſe in the vale of Keſwick, and particularly at Mill-beck, and along the weſtern baſe of Skiddaw.</p>

                        <p>Theſe houſes have, for the moſt part, a kitchen and a parlour in front, a toofall, back-kitchen, and milk-houſe behind, with four or five lodging rooms above; the front contains five middle ſized ſaſh-windows, two below ſtairs, and three above.</p>

                        <p>ON the large eſtates, there are ſome farms from 100l. to 150l. a year, few reach 200l. and we only heard of four or five, that got as high as 3 or 400l. a year, and one of 600l.; but the moſt general ſize of farms in this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, is from 15l. to 50l. a year.</p>
                        <p>Cumberland farmers may be divided into three claſſes: the occupiers of large farms; the ſmall proprietors, (pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincially "<hi>Lairds</hi> or <hi>Stateſmen;</hi>") and the ſmall farmers.</p>
                        <p>It is to the firſt claſs, and the gentlemen farmers, that this diſtrict owes the introduction of any of the modern improvements in agriculture; and we were glad to find a ſpirit of enterprize ariſing amongſt them, for the adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of new modes of culture, and improved breeds of ſtock.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>To the ſmall Proprietors,</hi>—agriculture, we preſume, is little indebted for its advancement: theſe "ſtateſmen" ſeem to inherit with the eſtates of their anceſtors, their notions of cultivating them, and are almoſt as much at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached to the one as the other: they are rarely aſpiring, and ſeem content with their ſituation, nor is luxury in any ſhape an object of their deſires; their little eſtates, which they cultivate with their own hands, produce almoſt every neceſſary article of food; and cloathing, they in part manufacture themſelves; they have a high character for ſincerity and honeſty, and probably few people enjoy more eaſe and humble happineſs.</p>

                           <hi>The ſmall Farmer</hi>—is obliged to raiſe ſuch crops as will pay him beſt for the preſent, and avoid every expence, of which he does not receive the immediate advantage, by which means, his farm, and himſelf, are always kept in a ſtate of poverty: many of theſe ſmall farmers are alſo mechanics, and agricultural labourers, that farm from 5l. to 10 or 12l. a year.</p>

                     <p>THE <hi>Plough</hi> of this county is the ſwing plough, uſed through all the northern counties, in which we obſerved no improvement.</p>
                     <p>To ſpend time in deſcribing the harrow, roller, &amp;c. that have been uſed in almoſt every part of the kingdom for ſome centuries, would be augmenting this Report to little purpoſe.</p>

                        <hi>The Carts,</hi> through the whole of this county, are drawn by a ſingle horſe, and probably originated through ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, from the ſmall farmer keeping no more than one
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:0179800900:204"/>horſe. In thoſe times, ſimplicity and cheapneſs were on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſidered: we recollect ſeeing ſome of thoſe <hi>"tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble carrs,"</hi> without one piece of iron about them; the wheels were made of three pieces of wood, joined by pins of the ſame material. It is probable they had the name of <hi>tumble carrs,</hi> from the axle being made faſt in the wheels, and the whole turning, or tumbling round to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: but this conſtruction has given way to the wheel with a nave and ſpokes, turning round a fixed axle; which is much more managable, in quick or ſhort turns.<note n="*" place="bottom">The price of a tumble carr is 5l.—the price of the other kind, 7l. ready for yoking.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>The advantages of ſingle horſe carts are ſo well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood in this county, that we did not ſee any other uſed.</p>
                     <p>Three ſingle horſe carts are driven, without any dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, by a man, or a boy, or even women and girls; along the coaſt, more than half the carts are driven by females, and many of theſe under twenty years of age, with as fine forms and complexions, as ever nature be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed on the ſofter ſex. We cannot help ſaying, we were diſguſted at ſeeing them put to this employment; and eſpecially, at their riding in ſo aukward a manner be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the cart-ſaddle.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Double mould-board Ploughs</hi>—are uſed by ſome farmers, to form the one-bout ridges for turnips and potatoes, and alſo for earthing them up.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Winnowing Machines</hi>—have been lately introduced, and are now become very general; twenty years ſince, corn was winnowed without any ſort of machine; and the farmer was under the neceſſity of waiting for a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural wind, ſufficiently ſtrong to blow the chaff from the grain; and very often had to take it to ſome eminence at a diſtance, where the breeze was more certain.</p>

                     <p>THE mountainous diſtricts are all open, and moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably will long remain ſo: the cultivatable parts are a mixture of old incloſures and commons, interſperſed through every part of the county.</p>
                     <p>The ſize of incloſures, in general, is in proportion to the ſize of farms: the ancient fields are ſmall and irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar; the fences of various conſtructions; walls, earth mounds, thorns, hazle, and other bruſh-wood, all lend their aid in a greater or leſs degree; and, in two or three places, we obſerved large tracts totally incloſed by whin-fences,<note n="*" place="bottom">
                           <hi>Ulex Europeans.</hi>—Furze.—Gorſe.—Whins.</note> which have a very ragged, ſlovenly, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couth appearance, from the numberleſs gaps where the whins have been deſtroyed by froſt, an accident to which this plant is very liable; nothing but the greateſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity can juſtify the uſe of whin-fences.</p>
                     <p>The fields of thoſe commons that have been divided within the laſt thirty years, are laid out in ſtraight lines, and moſtly incloſed by quick fences, which in general have done very well.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The advantages</hi> that ariſe from incloſing, <hi>in reſpect to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of produce or value,</hi> muſt entirely depend upon the modes of management, purſued after the incloſing takes place. From the abundant crops produced by land, which has never grown grain before, the occupier vainly
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:0179800900:206"/>thinks, that it will always continue to do ſo; and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception is ſtill increaſed, by the ſtimulating effects of lime; but alas! after having got nine or ten crops, the golden proſpect vaniſhed the farther they proceed, the more they are convinced of their error; and growing corn having become a loſing trade, the land is left to graſs: but what can it produce? already exhauſted by repeated corn crops, and over dozes of lime, it remains a ſpectacle of the bad effects of ſuch culture, and a warning to others to avoid the ſame courſe: even under this treatment, the increaſed value is in the ratio of three or four to one; had theſe lands been continued in tillage only three years at one time; the firſt year oats; ſecond, fallow, turnips, or rape: the third, wheat or oats, or (if the ſoil ſuited) bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, ſown up with clover and ray-graſs, and depaſtured with ſheep for three, four, or five years, according to circumſtances and ſituations, we will venture to ſay, the land would have gone on improving, from rotation to ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; would have been more proſitable, and put on a very different aſpect to what it does at preſent, and have been worth double the rent it now lets for.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The advantages</hi> ariſing from incloſing of commons, in reſpect to the <hi>improvement of ſtock,</hi> is obvious; while in a ſtate of common, every one turns on what he pleaſes; and there is generally double the quantity of ſtock that there ought to be. The conſequence is, they make no improvement; <hi>they barely exiſt;</hi> the yearly proſits how ſmall! Should an enlightened breeder wiſh to improve his ſheep, how is he to effect it, while his ewes mix pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuouſly with his neighbour's ſlocks? If he had the beſt tup in the kingdom, can he be ſure that one of his ewes would be tupped by him, while there are probably not leſs than a ſcore of his neighbour's to conteſt the female with him? On the other hand, if the common were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed, every one would ſtint with that ſpecies of ſtock
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:0179800900:207"/>for which his allotment was beſt adapted, and in ſuch numbers as would inſure profit: when he can confine his ewes within his own incloſure, he can make whatever ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment he pleaſes, by putting a few, or many ewes, to any particular tup, without any fear or apprehenſion of having a ſpurious breed, by the interference of his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour's: he is alſo enabled to keep his flock from many diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders: few commons but have ſome tracts of land liable to the rot: how are they to be prevented from depaſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon it? or if the ſcab, or other infectious diſorders, have taken place amongſt any flock on the common, how is he to avoid it?</p>
                     <p>To the queſtion put by the Board, "has incloſing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons decreaſed population?"—We anſwer, that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conceive, how incloſing of commons can decreaſe po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation: unleſs an increaſe of corn and cattle, an increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed demand for labourers and mechanics of various de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominations, tend to decreaſe mankind; the contrary poſition muſt certainly hold good in an eminent degree.</p>

Some few ſow hay-ſeeds and a little white clover; but the greateſt part leave it to nature.<note n="*" place="bottom">On aſking a farmer at Uldale why they ſowed no clover, or graſs ſeeds, he replied, <hi>"we have no occaſion, for the land is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally girs-proud."</hi> Thoſe that are experienced in cultivation, will readily admit, that after growing from ſix to twelve white crops in ſucceſſion, it can ſcarcely be otherwiſe than <hi>graſs-proud.</hi> There is certainly graſs in abundance; but of ſuch kind, as no good farmer would wiſh to be poſſeſſed of. This barbarous ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem is practiſed upon many dry loamy ſoils; which, after being thus left to graſs, cover amazingly faſt with moſs, probably owing to the bad cultivation and exhauſting crops of corn more than to the wetneſs of the climate, to which it is generally attributed.</note>

                           <hi>Wheat</hi> is a modern production here; a general opinion uſed to prevail, that wheat could not be grown in many parts of this county. We were informed that it is not much more than 40 years, ſince Summer fallows for wheat were firſt uſed; and it is not twenty years ſince Lord Muncaſter introduced Summer fallows, and the cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of wheat, in the neighbourhood of Ravenglaſs, where it is now grown in great abundance, as well as all along the coaſt to Scotland, and in the neighbourhood of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſle. The wheat that is ſown after turnips or clover, is trifling, the main ſupply is from Summer fallows; they generally ſow two buſhels and a half per acre, in Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber or October, as the ſeaſon ſuits, and they reap from ſixteen to thirty buſhe's per acre.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Barley</hi> and <hi>Oats,</hi> being the grains from which the bread of the inhabitants is made, were probably the firſt, and only corn, grown in this county for many centuries; <hi>bigg</hi> or <hi>bear,</hi> with four rows of grains on the ear, was the kind of barley formerly cultivated; but lately, the common early ſort, with two rows, has been introduced. They ſow two and a half buſhels per acre, in April or May, and reap twenty-one buſhels on an average.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>The Common Oat,</hi> was the only variety grown in this county, and is now by far the moſt prevalent; but of late
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:0179800900:211"/>years, a few enterpriſing individuals have introduced the early varieties of this grain, with great advantage; they are diſtinguiſhed from the common oat by the name of <hi>layland oat,</hi> and are the Dutch or Frieſland oat.<note n="*" place="bottom">Laſt year Mr Falder, near Roes Caſtle, introduced the oat, known on the eaſt borders by the name of <hi>Church's Oat,</hi> (a vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, and perhaps the beſt variety known, of the Poland oat) and which will, no doubt, anſwer well on all the beſt rich ſoils in the county.</note>

                           <hi>The Produce</hi>—from 15 to 40 buſhels per acre; but the average of the county was ſtated to us, to be only 20 buſhels per acre.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Peaſe.</hi>—In a climate where ſo much rain falls, and where the harveſt is ſo precarious, the culture of peaſe would be attended with ſo many chances of loſs, and ſo few of gain, that we were not ſurpriſed to find them ſo generally neglected. The difficulty of harveſting them, has probably firſt ſuggeſted the idea, of building their ſtacks in the <hi>cloughs</hi>
                           <note n="†" place="bottom">Where the main ſtem divides into branches.</note> of trees, and afterwards in ſlender high pyramids round the boles of tall trees, to prevent them from blowing over: by this method, they can alſo lead and ſtack them, in a damper or moiſter ſtate; and as they do not come near the ground by five or ſix feet, they are ſeldom troubled with mice. The greateſt diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the ſtacks is not more than ſix or ſeven feet; the height of many twelve or fifteen; if the tree has not a ſufficiency of convenient branches to bear the bottom, they nail a ſtick or two acroſs, to form a baſe. When finiſhed, they have a very ſingular appearance.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Turnips,</hi> were firſt cultivated in this county, to any ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, for the uſe of cattle, by Philip Howard, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:0179800900:212"/>in the year 1755: his firſt eſſay was drilled at four feet diſtance; the crop amazingly good; the weight on an average, 10 lb. each turnip; ſome weighed 25 lb; he afterwards continued to grow them at two feet, and two and a half feet diſtance, with conſtant ſucceſs, for eight or ten years, before any farmer followed the example; at laſt, Mr Collins, of Wetherall, made a trial, and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded; others ſoon followed him</p>
                        <p>It is, therefore, about thirty years ſince a few farm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers firſt began to cultivate turnips; and conſidering with what tardineſs new modes of practice generally make their way amongſt that uſeful claſs of ſociety, it is no wonder that the growing of turnips ſhould, in a great meaſure, be ſtill confined to the vicinity where their cultivation originated, and we ſuppoſe, by the mode of practice, that from this ſource may be traced the various patches of turnips we obſerved at Netherby, Burgh, Dalton, and a few other places.</p>
                        <p>The land, after being made ſufficiently fine by repeated ploughings and harrowings, is ſet up in one-bout ridges<note n="*" place="bottom">Provincially <hi>"ſtitches."</hi>
                           </note> at 30 inches diſtance; the dung is put in the bottom of the hollow intervals, and covered with earth by the plough; the top of the one-bout ridge is flattened by trailing a piece of wood over it, and on the <hi>flattened top</hi> the turnip ſeed is ſown by a drill, which a man puſhes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him like a wheel-barrow.</p>
                        <p>The drilled turnips are hoed, and ſet out a about eight or nine inches diſtance in the rows, which are ploughed between by a ſmall plough.</p>
                        <p>Hoeing broad-caſt turnips is not underſtood; if any are ſown this way, they go unhoed; and if too thick, are
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:0179800900:213"/>hand-weeded. Meſſ. Williamſon and Monkhouſe paid 20s. per acre this year, (1793) for hand-weeding their broad-caſt turnips.</p>
                        <p>The value of this excellent vegetable is not ſufficiently underſtood in this county, otherwiſe it muſt have made a more rapid progreſs. Probably this may be owing to its being applied to feeding their <hi>own breed of ſheep.</hi> We ſaw ſeveral acres of turnips this year, that were ſold for, from 3l. to 3l. 10s. per acre, which a Northumberland grazier would have thought worth five or ſix pounds an acre, for feeding the <hi>improved</hi> breed of long-woolled ſheep.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Potatoes</hi> are cultivated in one-bout ridges, by almoſt every farmer, not only for the uſe of their own families, but for ſale, where the ſituation is not too diſtant from a good market. It is only upon the eſtate of Sir James Graham, at Netherby, that they are applied to feeding cattle and ſwine: and by Lord Muncaſter, to feeding cattle, who alſo gives them to his horſes; Mr Lamb and Mr Blalock favoured us with the following particulars:</p>
                        <p>Mr Blalock feeds cows, and ſays, that 120 buſhels of potatoes, with 16 ſtones of oatmeal, will fatten a cow in three months, equally well as turnips, of 3 or 4l. value.</p>
                        <p>The ſmall farmers apply potatoes to feeding ſwine: thirty buſhels of potatoes and ten of corn, made in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to meal, will fatten a ſwine of eighteen or twenty ſtones weight, equal to corn of 1l. 15s. value. The potatoes are <hi>boiled,</hi> and meal mixed with them.</p>
                        <p>From theſe data, the value of potatoes may be nearly eſtimated:

                        <p>
                           <hi>Artificial Graſſes,</hi> are here confined to a ſmall number —red clover, <hi>(trifolium pratenſe)</hi> white clover <hi>(trifolium repens)</hi> common hay-feeds, with a little rib graſs <hi>(plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tago lanceolata)</hi> and ray-graſs, <hi>(lolium perenne.)</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>We were informed, that in 1752, no perſon in the county had thought of ſowing a field down with clover, or even hay-ſeeds; and that Philip Howard, Eſq. of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, was the firſt who ſowed a field with clover, and taught his countrymen the uſe of artificial graſſes; yet it is but a few that have benefited by his laudable exertions.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Red Clover,</hi> is principally ſown where the turnip culture, and ſummer-fallowing for wheat, are practiſed, and the land continues only two years in graſs: it is generally mown the firſt year, and depaſtured the ſecond. The great objection to growing this valuable graſs, is the <hi>hov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of cattle, which may be obviated by depaſturing it with ſheep, or by a little caution in having the cattle pretty full, before they are turned into it, and to take care to put them to it on a dry day. Some object to it, becauſe they have taken a fancy that it impoveriſhes the ſoil. Old Ellis ſays, <hi>"Clover is the mother of corn."</hi> We believe that, could the Cumberland farmers be induced to make an experiment, they would be of the ſame opinion, and would find their profits ſo ſuperior to what they are at preſent, that they would become converts to the cauſe. We hope we do not exaggerate when we ſay, that the profits of red clover for two years, would be double to that derived from the ſame quantity of ground ſown with
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:0179800900:217"/>white clover, rib graſs, and hay-ſeeds; and that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of the ſucceeding crop of corn would be nearly in the ſame ratio.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>White Clover,</hi> has many advocates, and is certainly a valuable plant, where land is intended to continue in graſs for a few years, which is generally the caſe here; and by thoſe who ſow any kind of graſs ſeeds, it is in great repute; it is ſeldom or never ſown alone, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied by what is here called <hi>common hay-ſeeds,</hi> which are generally harmleſs, from the heat they moſtly get in the ſtacks, and their vegetative powers thereby deſtroyed: where that is not the caſe, we fear more weeds than uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful plants would be the produce; for when it is conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that of the uſeful plants which compoſe a good mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, ſcarce two of them flower and ripen at the ſame period; and as the time of mowing is governed more by the weather, or other circumſtances, than the collection of uſeful ſeeds, it may happen, that not one valuable plant may then have its ſeeds in that ſtate of perfection, which is neceſſary for the reproduction of its ſpecies; at the ſame time it is probable, that you may obtain the ſeeds of many plants, which you would wiſh to avoid.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Rib Graſs,</hi> is ſown in ſome places where land is intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to continue in graſs.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Ray-graſs,</hi> has here but few advocates; a general pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice againſt this plant ſeems to have taken place, we think <hi>unjuſtly,</hi> for we are convinced, from long experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that under proper management, it is a valuable graſs; it grows in all ſoils, and in all ſituations; early in the Spring, and late in Autumn; and even thro' Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, on dry ſoils and in open weather: the only reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able objection we know of, is the great propenſity it hath to run to ſeed; but this may be eaſily obviated, by eating it bare with cattle, or by mowing the paſture juſt before
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:0179800900:218"/>it begins to flower, which increaſes the eatage, by the quantity of bottom graſs it ſends forth after the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                        <p>It is the propereſt graſs we know, to ſow along with red or white clover; and we would beg leave to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it, inſtead of <hi>common hay-ſeeds,</hi> ſo univerſally ſown in this county, with clover, both red and white.</p>

                        <p>The moſt general ſyſtem of grazing is,—on the richeſt grounds, <hi>cattle with a few ſheep;</hi> on the leſs luxuriant, <hi>ſheep only.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The kinds of cattle uſually fatted are the native coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try breed, and Scotch cattle, both Kyloes and the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loway kind. Of theſe, they ſind the Kyloes the quickeſt feeders, the Galloway next, and their own country breed of long horns the ſloweſt.</p>
                        <p>The proſits of grazing cattle depend much on the ſkill of the buyer, in <hi>ſelecting</hi> the <hi>quickeſt feeders;</hi> and, when fat, in ſelling them for their <hi>full value;</hi> alſo, not unfre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, on the ſtate of markets.</p>
                        <p>The beſt grazing lands we ſaw were at Pap Caſtle, near Cockermouth, let at 3l per acre; and the holm lands on both ſides the Eden, near Carliſle, let at 2l. 10s. per acre, for the purpoſes of <hi>grazing only.</hi> Mr Tealſon, of the
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:0179800900:219"/>former place, buys in oxen and heifers in October, keeps them all Winter upon the paſtures out of which his fat ſtock has been recently ſold, and gives them a little hay in bad weather. After keeping them near twelve months, they leave, on an average, <hi>a profit of</hi> 5l <hi>each;</hi> their weight, from fifty to ſixty ſtone. But this interligent gentleman was candid enough to confeſs, that he thought ſheep, mixed amongſt cattle, a more profitable ſyſtem; and we were glad to find this mode practiſed by all the beſt gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ziers in the county.</p>

                     <p>THIS county is far from being well wooded. The Irthing, Eden, and Caldew, are the only rivers,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:0179800900:221"/>whoſe banks produce any quantity of <hi>natural wood;</hi> and of theſe, the banks of the Caldew ſeem to have the larg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt proportion of old oak-timber. Of the value of the oak-timber proper for the purpoſes of ſhip-building, we could obtain no ſatisfactory information, but ſuſpect, from what we ſaw, it is of ſmall extent: we fear, the oak is not ſuffered to attain a ſufficient age for this purpoſe; as we ſaw a wood near Weſt Ward (now felling) of upwards of two hundred acres, that was little more than thirty years old, the whole cut away, without leaving any to ſtand for ſhip timber.</p>
                     <p>Of late years, many plantations have been made near gentlement's ſeats, which ſhew, by their vigorous growth, how well adapted the greateſt part of this county is for the production of wood. From the nakedneſs of the country along the coaſt, one would naturally conclude, that the ſituation was inimical to that production; but Lord Muncaſter's extenſive and thriving plantations near Ravenglaſs ſhew, that the nakedneſs of the land is owing to other cauſes.<note n="*" place="bottom">If a cuſtomary tenant plants wood, he cannot cut it without leave of the lord; in ſome caſes, the lord claims it as his own, which ſufficiently explains why the occupiers do not plant wood.</note>

                     <p>THE <hi>extent of waſle lands,</hi> in this county, is very great: —Of mountainous paſture, 342,000 acres, which we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:0179800900:222"/>not capable of improvement from the plough; yet many parts of theſe diſtricts might be applied to planting, with conſiderable advantage, and would probably in this way, make a better return, than if the ſoil had been in ſuch a ſituation as to admit of being converted into tillage. We were glad to ſee a large plantation of larches thriving exceedingly well, on the ſteep edge of the weſt ſide of Skiddaw, lately planted by Mr Story. We hope the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample will be ſpeedily and extenſively followed, by every propriertor of ſimilar ſituations; but, unfortunately, the greateſt part of theſe diſtricts is in a ſtate of common, and no improvement of this kind can take place while they continue in that ſituation: of courſe, the firſt ſtep to improvement is a diviſion, and for every proprietor to know his own part If this cannot be done, the only means of improvement then left is, to convert them from unlimited commons to ſtinted paſtures.</p>
                     <p>The preſent value per acre, of theſe mountainous diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricts, may be nearly eſtimated from the following data:</p>
                     <p>Mr Greenhow, of Thr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

They can ſcarce be in a leſs produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſtate; an acre of wood, if it only grew broom-ſticks, would pay much better.</p>

                        <hi>Of the Commons,</hi> in the leſs elevated parts of the county, there are many, with large tracts of excellent ſoil, capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of being improved by judicious culture, proper drain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and improved breeds of ſheep, to many times their preſent value; which is certainly very ſmall, probably not more than from one to two ſhillings per acre.

<pb n="203" facs="tcp:0179800900:223"/>is lamentable to ſee ſuch extenſive tracts of <hi>good corn land</hi> lying waſte, of no value to its owners, and of no benefit to the community. Inſtead of the preſent ſcarcity of grain, large quantities might be yearly exported; and inſtead of the ill formed, poor, ſtarved, meagre animals that depaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the commons at preſent, an abundant ſupply of good fat mutton would be had to <hi>grace</hi> the markets of the county, and alſo to ſend off large ſupplies to Newcaſtle, Liverpool, Mancheſter, and other populous manufactur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing places.</p>
                     <p>It is difficult to ſay, what would be the increaſed value of ſuch land, under proper management; we think we cannot be wrong in ſtating, that it would be at leaſt from ſix to eight times the value to the proprietors.—But of what advantage would it be to the public?</p>

                        <p>DRAINING, is one of thoſe improvements which has been introduced of late years into the northern counties; and where it is done with judgment, is, in many ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, of the greateſt conſequence.—Cumberland has not been behind its neigbours in adopting this beneficial mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: we were glad to obſerve, in many places, great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages gained, both by hollow and ſurface drains; ſome done with great art, by one or more hollow drains run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in the direction of the outburſt of water, and cut deep enough to get through the bed of ſand or gravel in which the water runs, and by that means arreſt the ſource, which drowns the land below it; but the like intelligence has not in all places prevailed, for we often ſaw the drains running in parallel directions, <hi>perpendicular to the ſource,</hi> and at ſuch diſtances, as the drainer thought the nature of the ſoil required; this is more particularly the caſe, where ſurface drains are uſed. The hollow drains are
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:0179800900:225"/>filled with ſtones when they can be got, otherwiſe with ſods.</p>

                           <hi>Farm-yard dung,</hi> is here, as in moſt other places, the chief reſource of the farmer: where turnips are grown, it is wholly applied to their culture; where they are not grown, it is uſed for the various purpoſes of dreſſing graſs land, and for the barley and wheat crops.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Lime,</hi> is found in great abundance in many parts of this county, and of an excellent quality. The quantity laid upon an acre varies from ſixty to an hundred and fifty buſhels; we found it a general opinion, that lime did lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle good to land that had been long accuſtomed to it; and that thoſe who had uſed the large quantity of 150 buſhels per acre, found their lands greatly exhauſted, and were now fully convinced of their error in continuing it ſo long, eſpecially in ſuch large quantities. We have had many opportunities of obſerving the abuſe of lime, which, moſt probably, is one of the beſt manures known, for particular ſoils and ſituations, and under peculiar circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, and proper reſtrictions; yet, like many other good things, a ſuperabundance may be prejudical; or rather, we are ſenſible, that too often repeated, and in large quantities, it becomes hurtful.</p>
                        <p>Lime is moſtly laid on, while the land is in a ſtate of fallow; but in ſome places, we found it laid upon the graſs land, <hi>one</hi> or <hi>two</hi> years before they intended to plough it out. We doubt the propriety of the latter mode.</p>

                           <hi>Compoſt.</hi>—It ſeems a general practice through every part of the county, to make a compoſt of lime and earth, in the proportion of one cart-load of lime, to four or five of earth; they uſe it as a top-dreſſing to their graſs lands, and find it very beneficial.</p>

We were
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:0179800900:227"/>ſorry to find, there was little more water than what was collected by rains; the ridges narrow and long; the trenches ſmall, and inadequate to carry a ſufficient quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of water, for the purpoſe intended. It is unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, that the firſt attempt ſhould have been made in ſuch a ſituation, and under ſuch circumſtances, in a county ſo pregnant with favourable ſituations, and the water of ſuch an excellent quality, uncontaminated with mineral particles, or infuſions that are ſuſpected to be inimical to vegetation.</p>

                        <p>At Bleatarn, Mr Richardſon has made great improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, on a poor black moory ſoil, growing very ſhort heath, in its original ſtate, not worth ſixpence per acre. He ploughs in Autumn, and lets it lie till the Autumn following; then ploughs acroſs; and the next Summer makes a complete fallow, which he limes, after the rate of one hundred and fifty buſhels per acre; and in April or May following ſows it with graſs-ſeeds (without corn) in the following proportion per acre: white clover, 8 lb.; red, 4 lb.; rib-graſs, 4 lb.; ray-graſs, 1½ buſhels; and common hay-ſeeds, 6 buſhels.</p>
                        <p>Another mode is to plough up in the Winter, and leave it in that ſtate thro' the Summer, to rot, until next Spring, when it is ploughed acroſs, and made ſufficiently fine by repeated harrowings, ploughings, and burning of the ſods, to ſow with turnips in June: to the above quantity of lime is added 30 ſingle-horſe cart loads of dung. On a part of the fallow this year, we ſaw ſome drilled turnips,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:0179800900:228"/>worth 3l. an acre: in addition to the lime, they had fifty ſingle-horſe cart-loads of dung per acre: but as dung is rarely to be procured for improvements of this kind, we think, that a crop of rape might be got for Spring ſeed, without dung, which would certainly be better than a naked fallow, as in the firſt mode. The lands that have been laid down two years, were full of graſs,<note n="*" place="bottom">From many obſervations made on ſimilar improvements, we have always found the firſt and ſecond years graſs by far the moſt valuable; after this they decline in value, and in a few years re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to their original heath, if not prevented by ploughing.</note> and excellent paſture for ſheep; but to make them thus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive, they are loaded with the following expences, which, according to Mr Richardſon's eſtimate, including the various ploughings, harrowings, lime, dung, graſs-ſeeds, intereſt of money, &amp;c. amount to 11l. 11s. 6d. per acre: from which taking the value of the turnips 3l. leaves 8l. 11s. 6d. the expence per acre, on the graſs.</p>
                        <p>Near Naward Caſtle, Mr Ramſhay has made great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertions in reclaiming peat-moſs, <hi>by throwing it up with a ſpade,</hi> into round ridges ſeven yards wide; the top being from twelve to eighteen inches higher than the furrow, which is cut deep enough to act as an open drain.

                        <p>THE <hi>Cattle,</hi> are a ſmall breed of long horns, with a few exceptions of the Galloway breed intermixed, particularly along the coaſt from Whitehaven to Carlifle.</p>

                           <hi>This breed of long-horns</hi> is not diſtinguiſhed by any pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar good qualities, which is not to be wondered at, when it is conſidered that, probably at this time, there is not one perſon in the county that pays any attention to its improvement. Twenty years ago Mr Hazle, of Dale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main, had made ſome progreſs in this buſineſs, and gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a very uſeful breed of long-horned cattle; but his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors neglected them, and the labours of the good old man are totally loſt.</p>

                           <pb n="210" facs="tcp:0179800900:230"/>The long-horned, and the Galloway polled cattle, are probably the beſt adapted to this county of any other; but the kind of long-horns that occupy it at preſent, may certainly be much improved, by paying proper attention, to breed always from the beſt males and females that can be ſelected. This end would be the readieſt attained, by getting good bulls and heifers from the midland counties, where the long-horned breed are brought to great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>

                           <hi>The Dairies</hi> are ſmall, and moſtly employed in making butter, of an <hi>excellent quality.</hi> Thoſe that are ſituated in the vicinity of towns, ſell it weekly, by the pound, to ſupply the conſumption of the inhabitants. In other ſituations, it is put into firkins of 56 lb each, and ſent to diſtant markets.</p>
                        <p>The average quantity of butter from one cow, is generally eſtimated from one to two firkins: ſome cows will give twelve quarts of milk at a meal, and make ſeven pounds of butter per week; but the moſt general average is, ſeven or eight quarts of milk at a meal, and from 3 to 5 pounds of butter per week, through the Summer.</p>
                        <p>Skimmed milk <hi>cheeſe,</hi> is the principal kind made here, and chiefly conſumed at home.</p>
                        <p>On thoſe farms that have a right of common, the graſs lands are employed through the Summer in growing hay, depaſturing their cows, and ſometimes young cattle; but the latter are more generally ſummered on the commons, and in Autumn brought into the old incloſures, till the approach of Winter, when all the cattle are houſed.</p>

                        <p>Of this breed of ſheep, (commonly called <hi>Herdwicks,</hi>) the ewes and wethers are all polled or hornleſs, and alſo many of the tups; their faces and legs ſpeckled; but a great portion of white, with a few black ſpots on thoſe parts, are accounted marks of the pureſt breed, as are alſo the hornleſs tups; they have ſine, ſmall, clean legs. We were told that the lambs, when dropt, are well covered; the wool is ſhort, and form as thick matted fleece, much finer than that of the black-faced heath ſheep; with which variety they ſeem to have been croſſed, as we ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, from ſome of the rams having ſpiral horns, and from ſome <hi>kemps</hi> or <hi>hairs</hi> being intermixed amongſt ſome fleeces of the wool: they are a lively little animal, well adapted to ſeek their food amongſt theſe rocky mountains, in many places ſtony and bare; and where covered, the ſoil is thin, but the herbage moſtly green, though heath is found on their ſummits. They have no hay in Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and ſupport themſelves in the deepeſt ſnows, by ſcratching down to the heath, or other herbage; indeed it ſeldom happens, but that ſome parts of the mountains are blown bare, which the ſheep find out. They do not face the coming ſtorm as reported, but, like other ſheep, turn their backs on it; and, in ſuch weather, they gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally gather together, and keep ſtirring about; by which means they tread down the ſnow, keep above it, and are rarely over-blown.</p>

                           <pb n="212" facs="tcp:0179800900:233"/>The ewes are kept as long as they will breed lambs, and are often from ten to fifteen years of age before they are ſold: the wethers go off at four and a half years old. Both ewes and wethers are ſold from theſe mountains, and killed without being put on any better paſture: we ſaw a carcaſe of one of the wethers at Ravenglaſs, very good mutton, which weighed 11 lb. a quarter, and had 10 or 12 lb. of tallow. The ewes weigh from 6 to 8 lb. a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; the fleece weighs 2 lb. and ſoid laſt year at 6d. per lb. which we think much below its value.</p>
                        <p>The mountains on which theſe ſheep are bred, happen not to be common, but belong to Lord Muncaſter; as do alſo the ſtock that depaſture them, which have, time im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorial, been farmed out to <hi>herds,</hi> at a yearly ſum. From this circumſtance, theſe farms (three or four in number) have obtained the name of <hi>Herdwicks;</hi> that is, the diſtrict of the <hi>herds;</hi> and the ſheep, the appellation of <hi>Herdwick ſheep.</hi> They have obtained ſuch a character for <hi>hardineſs</hi> of <hi>conſtitution,</hi> that Mr Tyſon,<note n="*" place="bottom">We were told by Lord Muncaſter's agent, that the family of Tyſons have lived in this ſequeſtered ſpot above four hundred years.</note> who farms the principal flock, ſells a number of tups every year into va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious parts of the county, to <hi>improve the hardineſs of other ſlocks;</hi> the price is often as high as two guineas and a half.</p>
                        <p>The ſheep, through the whole of this county (except the <hi>Herdwicks)</hi> have been deſcended from the <hi>black-faced, coarſe-woolled, heath ſheep;</hi> but by croſſing with ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kind, (probably the <hi>Herdwicks)</hi> many of them have acquired a large portion of <hi>white</hi> on their <hi>faces</hi> and <hi>legs;</hi> ſome have thoſe parts ſpeckled, and others totally black; they are in general horned, high ſhouldered, narrow back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, flat ſided, ſtrong boned, and many with thick, rough, hairy legs.

                        <p>
                           <hi>The management of ſheep,</hi> over all this county, is very ſimilar; through the Summer the whole flock is depaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured on the commons, and range at large without any perſon to look after them: in November, the whole are gathered together and ſalved;<note n="*" place="bottom">The ſalve is compoſed of butter and tar, in the proportion of ſixteen pounds of the former to four quarts of the latter. This quantity will ſalve forty ſheep.</note> the old ſheep are turned again upon the common, but the hogs are kept in the old incloſures; ſome part of which has been kept uneat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, to ſupport them through the Winter: on the approach of ſnow, the old ſheep are brought to the incloſures, or to ſome part of the common adjoining, and are daily fod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered with hay, while the ſtorm continues. Thoſe who have not a ſuſſiciency of incloſed ground for wintering their hogs, take wintering for them, in thoſe parts of the low country where they do not breed ſheep; the price, 2s. per head, to have hay in bad weather.</p>
                        <p>In Eſkdale and Mitredale, they formerly kept their hogs in the houſe all Winter on hay, and drove them to water once a day; but this practice is now laid aſide, and they winter them upon the incloſed grounds, which are previouſly kept freſh for that purpoſe.

At Penruddock we obſerved ſome ſingularly rough legged, ill-formed ſheep; on aſking an old farmer, from whence they had that breed, or where they got their tups? He innocently replied, <hi>Lord, Sir! they are ſik as God ſet upon the land, we never change any!</hi> The latter pare of this ſimple ſtatement we readily believe; but that God <hi>ſet upon the land</hi> ſuch ill-formed, unproſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble animals, we cannot ſo readily aſſent to; and rather think, they have acquired their preſent ill-form, and bad properties, by the indolence and ignorance of the owners.

                        <p>For men, per day, 10d. and victuals; in harveſt, 1s. and victuals—For women, hay-making, 8d. and victuals;—harveſt, 10d. and victuals.—The hours from 6 to 6.</p>
                        <p>The victuals are eſtimated at 8d. per day for men, and 6d. for women.

                           <hi>The Commerce</hi> of this county conſiſts, principally, in the exportation of coals from Whitehaven, Workington, and Maryport, to Ireland, &amp;c. The number of veſſels employed in this trade amounts to upwards of 300, from 60 to 120 tons burden. This lucrative trade has ariſen to its preſent importance, within the laſt hundred years; it originated at Whitehaven, from the exertions of Lord Lonſdale's anceſtors, to whom the coal in that neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood principally belongs.</p>
                        <p>Mr Curwen is the principal coal-owner at Workington, and Mr Senhouſe at Maryport. At all thoſe places, coal cannot be wrought faſt enough to ſupply the demand; veſſels have frequently to wait ſix or eight weeks before
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:0179800900:244"/>they can get a loading; a certain ſign of an increaſing trade.</p>
                        <p>"We have not been able to aſcertain at what period navigation was advanced in Cumberland. A ſurvey was taken by commiſſion from the crown, in the year 1566, of the trade and ſhipping of this county, <hi>(inter alia;)</hi> Whitehaven was then ſo far from promiſing it would ever arrive at its preſent wealthy and flouriſhing ſtate, that it conſiſted only of <hi>ſix cottages,</hi> ſcattered on the beach, and hidden in the creek from the eye of an enemy, and to this dejected port one ſmall bark only belonged, of nine or ten tons burthen. Nay, it is not more incredible than true, that there was at that time only one veſſel ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaining to the whole county, that was of ten tons bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then. The whole exports of this extenſive county, were nothing but a ſmall quantity of <hi>herrings and cod fiſh;</hi> and the inhabitants knew ſo little of the luxuries and enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of life, that the whole of this great coaſt receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no other <hi>imports</hi> than a little ſalt.</p>
                        <p>About the year 1582, the Earl of Lincoln being Lord High Admiral, cauſed an account to be taken of the ſhips and mariners within this county; when all the veſſels a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted only to twelve, and not one carried eighty tons. The number of mariners and fiſhermen were 198, of whom many had never navigated a veſſel ſuperior to an open boat.</p>
                        <p>In 1607, <hi>Workington</hi> was the chief haven, and the place from whence certain criminals, ſentenced to baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, were exported to Ireland.<note n="*" place="bottom">Hutchinſon's Hiſtory of Cumberland.</note>"</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Maryport,</hi> in the year 1752, conſiſted of only one farm-houſe; in that year another houſe was built. It is now a neat, well built, middle-ſized market-town, with a ſmall and good harbour, incloſed by two piers; and in
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:0179800900:245"/>1793, contained 3445 inhabitants, which increaſe about 100 yearly. The ground upon which the town is built, belonged to Humphry Senhouſe, Eſq. To encourage ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlers, he ſold off houſe and yard ſteads, reſerving a ground rent. The land around it lets for 2 or 3l. an acre, which would not have been worth more than 1l. had things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained as they were in 1752.</p>
                        <p>The quantity of coals exported from theſe ports, taken on an average of 11 years, (from 1781 to 1792) is as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows:

                        <hi>CHAPTER XVI.</hi> OBSTACLES TO HAPROVEMENT.</head>
                     <p>ONE great obſtacle to improvement, ſeems to ariſe, from a laudable anxiety, in the cuſtomary tenants, to have their little patrimony deſcend to their children. Theſe ſmall properties (loaded with fines, heriots, and boon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days,<note n="*" place="bottom">See Tenures, page 178.</note> joined to the neceſſary expence of bringing up and educating a numerous family) can only be handed down, from father to ſon, by the utmoſt thrift, hard labour, and penurious living; and every little ſaving being hoarded up, for the payment of the <hi>eventful ſine,</hi> leaves nothing for the expences of travelling, to ſee improved modes of culture and to gain a knowledge of the management and profits of different breeds of ſtock; and be convinced, by ocular proofs, that their own ſituations are capable of producing ſimilar advantages. And even ſhould they be half inclin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to adopt a new practice, prudence whiſpers, that, ſhould the experiment fail, it would require the ſavings of many years to make good the deficiency.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>cuſtomary tenure</hi> is allowed, on all hands, to be a great grievance and check to improvement. Would not this be beſt done away on the diviſion of commons, as was the caſe at Brampton, &amp;c. where Lord Carliſle had 1-2th for his conſent as lord of the ſoil, and for enfranchiſing the allotments. There are other lords who aſk 1-4th
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:0179800900:248"/>for their conſent and enfranchiſing.<note n="*" place="bottom">The portion given to the lords of manors, for their conſent as lord of the ſoil, in moſt parts of the kingdom, is one-ſixteenth. The part to be allowed for enfranchiſing will depend on the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the tenure.</note> The yearly value of the various cuſtoms, fines, &amp;c. might be eaſiſy ſettled by commiſſioners; and twenty-five years purchaſe, on <hi>this value,</hi> be the price of enfranchiſement, which might be allowed out of the allotment, upon the diviſion of a common; or paid in money, at the option of the tenant.</p>
                     <p>On theſe terms, neither party would have reaſon to complain; but where a tenant cannot enfranchiſe, under forty years purchaſe, it would be a humane act of the legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlature to relieve theſe bondagers, by law; or laudable in the Board of Agriculture, to induce ſuch lords of manors, to accept a fair equivalent for theſe dregs of vaſſalage.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Letting no Leaſes,</hi> or leaſes for five or ſeven years, is another great obſtacle to improvement. To ſuch propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etors of land we would beg leave to hint, that no tenant will ever make improvements under the uncertainties of a <hi>ſhort leaſe,</hi> much leſs where there is <hi>none.</hi> A tenant may be well convinced, that by proper culture, draining, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved breeds of ſtock, &amp;c. he could make his farm, in a few years, worth <hi>one third</hi> more than it is at preſent; but this cannot be done without laying out money: ſuppoſe 100l. and ſuppoſe, by this means, the increaſed yearly value of his crop is 20l. Now it is clear, it will be ſix years before he can be repaid the principal and intereſt of the ſum expended. Should his leaſe expire in the fifth year, he would be a loſer; and ſhould he have no leaſe, he might be turned off his farm at the end of the ſecond year. Under ſuch circumſtances, the chance of loſs is much greater than the proſpect of gain. By rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning in this manner, he concludes, that it is ſafer to have his 100l. at intereſt at 5 per cent. than riſk it in
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:0179800900:249"/>improving his farm under ſuch uncertainties; and that it will be the ſureſt game, to take <hi>every advantage</hi> of the farm in his power.</p>
                     <p>On the other hand, if his leaſe had been for twenty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one years, he would have foreſeen, that, by laying out his 100l. he would gain 200l. and, as "the hope of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſweetens labour," he would have doubled his exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and gone on from improvement to improvement; and at the expiration of his term, his landlord would have the ſatisfaction of ſeeing his tenant had acquired a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petency, his farm increaſed in value, and the community benefited by the increaſed produce. We have heard, it is true, ſome arguments urged in favour of letting <hi>no leaſes;</hi> ſuch as would have been uſed by a feudal lord, and which, we are perſuaded, cannot long be held by liberal and benevolent minds, enlightened by ſcience, or anxious to promote the true intereſts of their country.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The payment of Tithes in kind,</hi> is univerſally agreed to be a material obſtacle to the advancement of agriculture: according to the preſent mode of collecting tithes, it is not a tenth of the <hi>natural produce</hi> of the land, but a tenth of the <hi>capital employed in trade.</hi> If a man employs 100l. in trade, he receives his profits, without any deduction; but if he ſhould lay out this 100l. on a ſpeculation of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving a piece of land, (ſay, draining a bog) he finds, if his ſcheme ſucceeds, that the produce is not all his own; the tithe owner comes, and takes away <hi>one tenth,</hi> (which is probably <hi>all the profit,</hi> after deducting common intereſt for the money expended;) and this, from off land that never afforded any tithe ſince the creation, nor <hi>ever would have done,</hi> had not this ſpirited improver laid out his 100l. on improving this bog, rather than employing it in trade, where he could have received at leaſt 10 per cent. for his money. The bog would then have continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unprofitable, and the tithe owner would have received
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:0179800900:250"/>
                        <hi>no injury;</hi> for neither he, nor any of his predeceſſors, had ever reaped any advantage from it.—This obſtacle certainly might be removed, by giving a fair equivalent for tithes.</p>

                  <head>CONCLUSION.</head>
                  <head>MEANS OF IMPROVEMENT.</head>
                  <p>THE firſt that preſents itſelf, is a reform in the culture of the arable lands. To thoſe who have been accuſtomed to take two, three, four, five, &amp;c. white crops in ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, we would recommend, to continue their lands in til<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage <hi>no more</hi> than <hi>three years at one time;</hi> and in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond year to fallow for turnips, or wheat, according as the ſoil ſuits; after turnips, barley, or wheat; and on the barley or wheat, ſow red clover, white clover, and ray-graſs;<note n="*" place="bottom">To theſe may be added, hop-medic, and rib-graſs, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to circumſtances.</note> and continue in graſs, two, three or more years, (according to ſituation and circumſtances.) Where neceſſity urges, the clover may be mown for hay the firſt year; but would recommend to depaſture it as much as poſſible with ſheep, which of all other ſtock are the moſt profitable, and the moſt improving for land that has been exhauſted by tillage.</p>
                  <p>It would probably be right, in moſt ſituations, to have one-third or one-fourth of the farm in old graſs, for the purpoſes of the dairy, and the ſheep ſtock in Winter; and we would obſerve, that where land is worth 40s. per acre in graſs, it would be a dangerous experiment to plough it up, in ſuch a climate as Cumberland poſſeſſes.</p>
                  <p>We know that in ſome parts of the kingdom, lands are let at higher rents, for the <hi>purpoſes of tillage only;</hi> but then, their ſoil, climate, and ſituation, are peculiarly good; and it is a queſtion, whether, if theſe lands had been in old graſs, they would not have been worth more for grazing, than they are at preſent for growing corn;
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:0179800900:252"/>probably as good as the land at Pap Caſtle, let at 3l. an acre, for grazing only,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The live Stock</hi> next offers itſelf for conſideration. Of the propereſt breed of horſes, and horned cattle, we have before given our ſentiments: it only remains to ſuggeſt, what improvements may be made in the ſheep; of which there ought to be at leaſt two, if not three, diſtinct breeds; that is,</p>
                  <p>For the lower diſtricts, a breed of <hi>improved</hi> long-wool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led ſheep:</p>
                  <p>For the mountainous, a breed of mountain ſheep, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apted to the <hi>herbage</hi> and <hi>ſituation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the high, heathy ridge of mountains, on the eaſt ſide of the county, the <hi>true black-faced heath ſheep</hi> are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably the beſt adapted; as we think them the hardieſt, and beſt calculated, for living <hi>altogether upon heath,</hi> of any other breed we know; of courſe a little attention to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of the preſent breed, by good tups, of the <hi>true heath ſheep,</hi> is all that is here wanted.—But for thoſe mountains, on the ſouth-weſt part of the county, which have ſo large a portion of ſound green ſward, we think a fine-woolled ſheep might be kept to advantage; probably the South Down, or at leaſt a croſs betwixt the <hi>South Down</hi> and the <hi>Herdwick ſheep;</hi> from the known inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion theſe breeds have to make fat, the carcaſe would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be as good, and the fleece would as certainly be of <hi>double value,</hi> as that of the preſent breed.</p>

                     <pb n="233" facs="tcp:0179800900:254"/>From hence it appears, that the preſent breed of ſheep are kept three years for nothing, or that the improved breed of long-woolled ſheep will leave as much profit in one year, as the preſent do in four; or a flock of 25 of theſe long-woolled ſheep would leave as much profit as 100 of the preſent race, and that for graſs only, as the expence of wintering on turnips was deducted in the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove ſtatement.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Incloſing of Commons,</hi>—we have already pointed out, would be a great ſource of improvement in this county, could it be done at a moderate expence, and on equitable terms; the charges of obtaining an act of parliament, and the various additions made thereto by the practitioners of the law, are in ſome caſes three or four times more than all the other expences put together. Surely this might be avoided by a general act. The Houſe of Commons has already laid a foundation, by the ſtanding orders re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting ſuch bills.—If two-thirds of the proprietors re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt a diviſion, we ſee no reaſon why they ſhould be put to the expence of obtaining an act of parliament, becauſe two or three, or poſſibly only one, ignorant or ill-natured perſon or perſons, are abſurd enough to oppoſe it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Watered Meadows</hi>—is another ſource of improvement, from whence great advantages may be derived; the ſtreams are not confined to any particular diſtrict: they are found equally pure, whether they have their ſource from the limeſtone rocks, on the eaſtern and middle parts of the county; or from the immenſe mountains of blue ſlate rock, in the ſouth-weſt diſtrict. Numberleſs are the rivulets that might be employed, with the greateſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage in watering, and in moſt places would be turned over the land at the leaſt expence; being obliged at preſent, to be kept within their bounds by proper fences, and ſeem to ſolicit their indolent owners to employ them, for their own emolument, and the benefit of the public.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="234" facs="tcp:0179800900:255"/>There are alſo many fine opportunities for employing the larger rivers; ſome hundred acres of the flat tract of land below Keſwick, to the top of Baſſenthwaite-lake, might be irrigated, and prevented from being overflowed by embanking; a large portion near the foot of the lake, is capable of the ſame improvement. In Eſkdale, Lord Muncaſter has a fine opportunity of watering an exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive tract.<note n="*" place="bottom">We are glad to find that his Lordſhip has taken the hint, and brought an experienced perſon from near Cirenceſter, in Glouceſterſhire, with a view of introducing this ſpecies of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement into this county; he purpoſes irrigating about 200 acres, in different ſituations, and upon different ſoils, and with water of different qualities.</note>—Near Carlton, on the Pettril, on the Ellen, and at many other places, we obſerved, where irrigation might be applied to great advantage.</p>
                  <p>We made an excurſion to the Biſhop of Llandaff's, at Colgarth Park, where that reſpectable prelate has a moſt admirable ſituation for watering.—He purpoſes to have a man from thoſe parts where the practice is beſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood; a plan we highly approve; and from his known ſcientific acquirements, enlarged ideas, activity, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance in every good purſuit, we have no heſitation in ſaying, that future improvers will revere his memory, and admire the man, for adding to the character of a <hi>good biſhop,</hi> that of a <hi>good farmer;</hi> and for bleſſing theſe northern re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions, by the introduction of a practice, from which ſo many, and ſuch great benefits are to reſult.—To this place, we hope, the Cumbrians will reſort, to be taught the moſt improved modes of irrigation; and by introducing the practice into their own country, will reap the rewards which it is ſo highly capable of affording, from this ſource of improvement.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Draining,</hi>—has been practiſed with great advantage, by a few enterprizing individuals; but much remains yet to be done, in almoſt every part of the county:

                     <hi>By Embanking,</hi> great advantages might be gained, eſpecially on the marſhes of Burgh, Rowcliff, Abbey-Holm, and at the mouth of the Duddon. To point out the mode by which this could be beſt accompliſhed, would require a more particular ſurvey; it is ſufficient, on this occaſion, to hint, that it may be done, and that conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able benefits would acrue from it, not only to many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals, but to the public at large.<note n="*" place="bottom">The ſouth-weſt part of Cumberland is in a manner inſulated, and cut off from all eaſy, ſafe, and ready communication with the ſouthern and weſtern parts of the kingdom; on the one hand, by the barrier of mountains which ſtretch from Kendal and Ulverſtone, to Penrith and Keſwick; and on the other, by the ſlow of the tides over the Lancaſter, Cartmel, and Duddon ſands; by which the paſſage is not only interrupted for ſeveral hours twice a day, but alſo rendered very unſafe and dangerous: all which might be avoided, by proper embankments, and at the ſame time a great quantity of land gained from the ravages of the ſea.</note>

                  <p>A common carrier at Carliſle, who many years employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a waggon, has laid it aſide, and now uſes <hi>ſingle-horſe carts only;</hi> as he finds he can, by that means, carry much greater weights.</p>
                  <p>There are few articles which may not be carried on a carriage of two wheels, equally as well as upon one of four, except long timber; and as waggons are ſo deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to roads,<note n="*" place="bottom">The ſuperior goodneſs of the roads in Cumberland may, in a great meaſure, be attributed to the univerſal uſe of ſingle-horſe carts.—Wherever waggons are uſed, they are the deſtruction of roads, eſpecially in hilly countries, where they are obliged to lock the wheels; the banks are in a manner ploughed up with them, and the nine inch wheels are, in reality, no more than three inch wheels by the artful mode of laying on the middle courſe of tyre, which is <hi>raiſed an inch above the reſt;</hi> inſtead of being nearly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from tolls, every <hi>horſe</hi> drawing in a <hi>waggon,</hi> ought to pay <hi>treble</hi> to what ſhould be exacted from a <hi>horſe</hi> drawing in a <hi>ſingle-horſe cart.</hi>
                     </note> why ſhould their uſe be longer perſiſted in, as it is clear that the ſame number of horſes yoked in ſingle horſe carts, will draw more than when yoked ſix or eight together;—they are eaſier loaded and unloaded, are much more handy, for almoſt every purpoſe; and ſix or eight may be driven by a man and a boy, which is a trifling additional expence. If a middle-ſized Cumberland horſe
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:0179800900:258"/>draws 15 cwt. a large ſtrong waggon horſe will as eaſily draw 20 cwt. and which is done in ſome parts of the kingdom.</p>

                  <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
                  <p>GREAT Britain had long availed herſelf of her natur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally fortunate poſition for commerce, which, encouraged by every means that the wiſdom of the legiſlature could deviſe, had been carried to an extent hitherto unequalled in the univerſe; and the induſtry of her inhabitants, aſſiſted by the foſtering hand of government, had brought many branches of manufactures to the higheſt ſtate of perfection; while the cultivation of her fields was left to the feeble exertions of the huſbandman, aided, only by bounties on the raiſing of flax, and on the exportation of corn. It was reſerved for our days, to behold a Board, compoſed of the firſt officers of the ſtate, and of perſons equally reſpectable for high rank, diſtinguiſhed abilities, and independent fortune, eſtabliſhed to fix the attention of a great nation on the improvement of its ſoil, and to direct and aſſiſt in the ancient and moſt important of all arts, that of providing food for man.</p>
                  <p>The eyes of all Europe are already turned to this Board, which, it is believed, is the firſt national eſtabliſhment, on a great ſcale, that ever exiſted in any country in favour of agriculture, and the advantages of which now appear ſo obvious that it is a matter of aſtoniſhment that ſuch an inſtitution was not ſooner erected.</p>
                  <p>At the time of the landing of the Romans on this iſland, corn was raiſed only on the coaſts, and even ſo late as the expedition of Severus, tillage was altogether unknown in thoſe parts which lay between his wall and that of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toninus. But, under the dominion of that wonderful
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:0179800900:262"/>people, it ſoon came to be conſidered as the granary of the weſtern Empire, and immenſe quantities of corn were annually exported for the uſe of the armies in Germany and in Gaul; and in the year 359, when there happened to be an extraordinary demand upon the continent, Julian ordered eight: hundred ſhips to be built, larger than the common barks, and ſent them to Britain for grain. It is not poſſible to aſcertain the capacity of theſe veſſels, but it is probable, from privileges that were granted to thoſe who built ſhips above a certain ſize, that many of them would contain more than ten thouſand Roman mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia, or upwards of three hundred Engliſh quarters.</p>
                  <p>Conſidering the change of manners, it is not to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, that the days of ancient Rome will be revived, when the moſt diſtinguiſhed citizens united the culture of the liberal arts with the tillage of their fields, and when the higheſt Officers of the State, having left the helm of government, did not diſdain to lay hold of the ſtilts of the plough. When, however, we contemplate the rapid pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs which agriculture made in this iſland, in the rude days of that ſuperſtitious people, who were governed in their time of ſowing by the age of the Moon, and the ſetting of the Pleiades, what may not be hoped for from the ſpirit of an enlightened nation, fully excited and directed to its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per objects by the newly eſtabliſhed Board, under whoſe auſpices, were but the ravages of war to ceaſe for a century, Great Britain would attain to an incredible degree of wealth and cultivation? Enjoying a ſoil of great original fertility, and a climate favourable to the growth of moſt branches of the vegetable kingdom, its craggy mountains and verdant hills would be cloathed with lofty timber, or bleat with innumerable ſlocks, its meadows would rear the ſtately bullock, and its fruitful plains would wave with the richeſt crops of every grain that the influence of a Britiſh ſun can pour into the lap of plenty. The perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:0179800900:263"/>hand of induſtry would even teach trees and plants to flouriſh that at preſent are ſickly and droop, and can hardly exiſt through the ſeverity of an inclement winter. In a few centuries more, others might be cultivated with ſucceſs, which, if directly tranſplanted to our climate, would immediately periſh When peaches were firſt raiſed in Italy, all the world was ſurpriſed that they could be brought to perfection out of Perſia. What would Caeſar and Diodorus Siculus ſay, were they told that the moſt eſteemed wines of Europe are produced in Gaul, Germany, and Hungary, where they imagined that vines would not grow? Or Strabo, if he knew that figs can be propagated in the north of Scotland? Or Lucullus, that cherries will grow almoſt any where, which in his time were known only in Ceraſus, and the milder climates of Europe?</p>
                  <p>Trees and plants, being altogether paſſive, accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date themſelves very ſlowly to a change of climate; but the idea has been already<note n="*" place="bottom">No apology is due to the author of J.

                  <div type="part">
                     <head>Extent of the County.</head>
                     <p>THE county of Weſtmoreland was ſurveyed in 1768, and a map of it, upon a ſcale of an inch to a mile, was engraved by Thomas Jeffreys, geographer to his Majeſty, in 1770. It appears, from this map, that the greateſt breadth of the county, from its ſouthern boundary, near Burton, to its northern one, near Penrith in Cumberland, is thirty-two miles, and that its greateſt length, from eaſt to weſt, is forty miles.</p>
                     <p>I covered this map very exactly with fine writing paper, except the Eſtuary near Millthrope and Windermere lake; I then cut out a ſlip of the paper of an inch in breadth, and of ten inches in length, and weighed it accurately; from another part of the ſame paper I cut another ſlip, two inches in breadth and five in length, and found it to be preciſely of the ſame weight as the firſt ſlip; and hence, as the ſurfaces of the two ſlips were equal, we may collect that the paper was of an uniform thickneſs. The area of each of theſe ſlips was ten ſquare inches, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly covered a ſpace on the map equal to ten ſquare miles; I then weighed the whole of the paper which had covered the map, and by comparing the weight of the whole with the weight of what had covered ten ſquare miles, I found
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:0179800900:265"/>the number of ſquare miles in the whole to be 844; now there are 640 ſtatute acres in a ſquare mile, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently 540,100 acres in the whole county.</p>
                     <p>I meaſured this map in the ordinary way by reſolving it into triangles, and found its area to be equal to 636 ſquare miles, or 407,040 ſtatute acres.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Templeman,</hi> in his ſurvey of the globe, makes the area of the county of Weſtmoreland equal to 633 ſquare miles, and conſequently, according to him, it contains 405,120 acres. The medium of theſe three different eſtimates (though I am moſt diſpoſed to rely on the firſt) is 450,772.</p>
                     <p>Profeſſor <hi>Zimmerman,</hi> in his political ſurvey of Europe, eſtimates England and Wales at 54, 112 ſquare miles, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounting to 34<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>631,680 ſtatute acres. <hi>Templeman,</hi> in the work above mentioned, ſays that England and Wales contain 49,450 ſquare miles, or 31,648,000 ſtatute acres; the mean of theſe two gives 33,139,840 ſtatute acres for the whole ſurface of England and Wales, and hence the county of Weſtmoreland may, in ſuperficial content, be eſteemed a ſeventy-third part of England and Wales.</p>

                  <div type="part">
                     <head>Proportion between the Cultivated and Waſte Lands in the County.</head>
                     <p>In 1689, when a bounty was firſt granted on the expor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of corn, one-third part of the land in England and Wales, or about eleven millions of acres, was ſuppoſed to lie in uncultivated commons; if this was then a juſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion between the cultivated and waſte parts of the kingdom, we may ſafely conclude, that much above one-third part of Weſtmoreland was then waſte land; as it is evident, from a bare view of the county, that few, if any counties in England, have, in proportion to their whole extent, ſo much uncultivated land as this has. The many incloſures which have taken place, during the
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:0179800900:266"/>laſt hundred years, have leſſened in ſome degree, the waſte land of the whole kingdom; but no incloſures of much conſequence have taken place in Weſtmoreland. Inſtead of one-third, I am diſpoſed to conjecture that three-fourth parts of Weſtmoreland conſiſt of uncultivated land: I will ſtate my reaſons for this conjecture, being as ſenſible as any perſon can be of the objections which may be made to it; but in a matter where there are no <hi>data</hi> to proceed upon, a conjectural argument may be allowed.</p>
                     <p>It appears, by the return made by the overſeers of the poor to the Houſe of Commons, that the ſum raiſed by aſſeſſment in all the pariſhes and townſhips of the county, at a medium of three years, ending in 1785, amounted to 5,757l.. The town of Kendall, including Kirkland, is the only large town in the county; it is found, by an actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ſurvey made this year, to contain 8089 inhabitants, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing experienced an increaſe of 518 inhabitants ſince the year 1784; of the preſent number 143, or about one fifty-ſixth part of the whole, are <hi>paupers</hi> living in the workhouſe. The poor rates of this town amounted, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſame return, to 1125l. a year; this ſum being ſubducted from the annual amount of all the poor rates in the county, leaves 4632l. for the ſum raiſed from all the eſtates in the county, excluſive of Kendall. From particular inquiries in various pariſhes, I am of opinion, that the poor rates do not, in this county, exceed a ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in the pound in the actual rental of all the lands; but a ſhilling in the pound (ſuppoſing the ſum annually raiſed to be 4632l.) will give a rental of 92, 640l. All the land in Weſtmoreland, which can either be ploughed or mown for hay, is worth at leaſt a rent of a pound a ſtatute acre on an average; and hence it may be inferred, that 100,000 acres of ſuch land, or leſs than one-fourth part of the whole, would yield a rental equal to, if not exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the rental of the county. The high incloſed rough
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:0179800900:267"/>paſtures are let from one to five ſhillings an acre. But whether the uncultivated land in Weſtmoreland be equal to three-fourths, or one half of the whole, it cannot be queſtioned, that there is ſo much of it, as to render its improvement a matter not only of individual concern, but of national importance.</p>

                     <head>Improvement of Waſte Lands.</head>
                     <p>The uncultivated lands in Weſtmoreland are of various ſorts, with reſpect to ſoil and ſituation, and capable of different ſorts of improvement. Some of them conſiſt of extenſive commons in low ſituations, and are of an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſoil; theſe might be improved by incloſures, without any riſk of loſs by the undertaking. Others conſtitute extenſive mountainous diſtricts, called by the natives <hi>fells</hi> and <hi>moors;</hi> the ſoil of theſe is, generally ſpeaking, an hazel mould. In its natural ſtate, it produces little elſe than a coarſe benty graſs, heath, and fern; or, in the language of the country, <hi>ling</hi> and <hi>brackens.</hi> Many of theſe fells are, in their preſent ſtate, of ſo little value, that the liberty of keeping ten ſheep on them may be hired for ſixpence a-year. Suppoſing ſix acres to be ſufficient for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of ten ſheep, the rent of ſuch land is a penny an acre; and the price of the fee ſimple of it, at twenty-four years purchaſe, two ſhillings. Whilſt there is an acre of ſuch waſte, improveable land in Great Britain, it may be hoped that, when the legiſlature ſhall turn its attention to the ſubject, no inhabitant of the iſland will be driven by diſtreſs, to ſeek a ſubſiſtence in Africa or America.</p>
                     <p>Above forty years ago an experiment was tried in Spain, with reſpect to the cultivation of waſte lands. Several thouſands of poor and vagabond people were ſettled on them at the expence of the government. If this experiment has ſucceeded (which may be eaſily known,) ſo far, as that the land has been made produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:0179800900:268"/>that the ſettlers have been increaſed, and that the government has been reimburſed the whole or a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal part of its expence, it may induce other governments to adopt the ſame or a ſimilar plan. The giving a cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, and a few acres of land, under a ſmall reſerved rent, and perhaps under other uſeful reſtrictions, to a poor man, is certainly a good way of improving the land. When a man has lands of his own, he and his family will exert in its cultivation, a quantity of labour which would not otherwiſe be brought into exiſtence. The value of this, otherwiſe non-exiſting labour is, in one reſpect, nothing; it ought not to be reckoned as a part of the expence attending the improvement of the land; and, on that account, many thouſands of acres of land might be brought into cultivation, which would not, in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way, pay the expence of improvement. The man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of improving moor-land, by paring, burning, liming, &amp;c. is well underſtood by ſome few individuals, and the advantage reſulting from it aſcertained, by what has been recently practiſed in ſome parts of the county on private eſtates.</p>
                     <p>There are many barren mountains in this county which do not admit improvement by paring and burning, and which are incapable of being profitably converted either into arable or good paſture land: yet the higheſt and moſt craggy parts, two acres of which do not afford ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance for ſix months in the year to one ſheep, might, with a great proſpect of ſucceſs, be planted with larches; I ſay with a great proſpect of ſucceſs, for I do not ſpeak with certainty, not knowing whether there are in Great Britain any plantations of larch made on ſuch expoſed and rocky ſituations as are here ſpoken of: But, on the other hand, it is known, that the larch grows in Italy on higher mountains than any that we have in this iſland; and not only that it grows in Italy, where the climate is
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:0179800900:269"/>leſs ſevere than in Great Britain, but that it grows in the north of Ruſſia, where it is much more ſevere; for at Archangel, in the latitude of 64°, ſhips are built of larch growing in that climate.</p>
                     <p>It may be of uſe to ſtate the probable profit which would attend planting the land in queſtion with larch. A thouſand acres of this ſort of land might be incloſed with a circular wall ſix feet in height, (where the ſtones can be eaſily gotten, as they may in moſt parts,) after the rate of ſix ſhillings an acre, or 300l for the whole; five hundred larches, two feet in height, (ſo as to enable them to reſiſt the long graſs,) might be planted on each acre for fourteen ſhillings; hence a plantation of 500.000 larches might be made for 1000l. Now 1000l. improv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at compound intereſt, at the rate of 4l. per cent. would, in ſixty years, amount to the ſum of 10 519l.; this is the accumulated loſs attending the incloſing and planting 1000 acres of rocky land in ſixty years. The rent of 1000 acres, at one penny an acre, is 4l. 3s. 4d. a-year; in eight years the larches would be out of all dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger from ſheep, ſo that the loſs of rent ought only to be eſtimated for eight years; but 4l. 3s. 4d. a year, though improved after the ſame rate of compound intereſt, would not amount to 40l. in eight years; ſay, however, that it would amount to 81l. which is allowing more than two pence an acre for the annual rent of the land, then would the whole expence attending the plantation in ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years be 10,600l. If the amount of 81l for 52 years, be taken into conſideration, the expence of the plantation in 60 years will be 11,222l. I have here ſuppoſed ſheep to be ſhut out of the plantation for eight years; if it ſhould be found, that ſheep will not crop the larch, and from more than one obſervation, I have reaſon to believe that they will not, they need not be ſhut out at all; nor, on diſtricts, where nothing but ſheep are depaſtured, need
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:0179800900:270"/>any fence be made. I know the advocates for cloſe plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, inſtead of 500, would require 5000 larches for each acre; I am not convinced of the utility of ſuch cloſe planting, except where it is intended to nurſe up oaks, or other kinds of wood; but if that mode ſhould be adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the thinnings, after twenty years growth, would pay the expence of it. At the expiration of ſixty years, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that only 250 larches remained on each acre, or that one half had periſhed; the probable value of them may be thus eſtimated. From a great many experiments made by myſelf and collected from others, I find the annual in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe in circumference of the larch, at ſix feet from the ground, to be one inch and one half on an average of ſeveral years; and this inference has been drawn from the actual admeaſurement of larches in different parts of England and Scotland, and of different ages, from ten years old to fifty. On this ſuppoſition, the larches would meaſure, one with another, ninety inches in circumfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, at ſix feet from the ground. A larch which mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures ninety inches, at ſix feet from the ground, would meaſure above ſeventy feet from the ground; but ſuppoſing ſeventy inches to be the circumference at twenty feet, and the length of the tree to be forty feet, neglecting the remaining top; then will its ſolid content be eighty-five cubic feet, and the value of the tree, at nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence a foot, above three guineas. But as the trees are ſuppoſed to be planted in an high, bleak, barren ſituation, their annual increaſe may not be ſo great as is here ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed; inſtead of being worth, at ſixty years after plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, three guineas a piece, admit that they are worth on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ten ſhillings each, then would the whole plantation be worth 125,000l. and deducting the whole expence, 10,600l. as before eſtimated, there would remain a profit of 114,400l. The preſent value of 114,400l. to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſixty years hence, is above 10,000l. (intereſt of
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:0179800900:271"/>money at 4l. per cent.) Ten thouſand pounds at 4l. per cent, purchaſes an income of 400l a year: by planting then, a barren eſtate, of a thouſand acres, is improved from 4l. 3s. 4d. to 400l. a year, reckoning the value of a reverſion as a preſent certainty. Sixty years is a great part of the life of a man; but it ought to be conſidered as nothing in the exiſtence of a nation, or even of a family, which is a little nation. The waſte lands in this and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther counties, are a public treaſure in the hands of private perſons; all of them ought to be converted into arable, meadow, or paſture land, which are capable of admitting, with profit, that kind of improvement. and ſuch of them as will not pay for that mode of improvement, ought to be covered with wood; the high parts, and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially the ſheltered dells in the high parts, with larch, and the lower with oak, aſh, &amp;c. When a ſpirit of ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricultural improvement is fully excited, the individuals to whom ſuch uncultivated lands belong, will be prompt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by an attention to their own intereſt, to forward every judicious plan which may be propoſed, for rendering them more uſeful to the proprietors and to the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; their preſent application to the Summer-mainten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of a few miſerable ſheep, ought not to be perſevered in, if any other uſe can be made of them.</p>

                     <head>Coppices.</head>
                     <p>In ſome parts of Weſtmoreland, conſiderable portions of land are covered with coppices, conſiſting principally of oak, aſh, alder, birch, and hazel. Theſe underwoods are uſually cut down every ſixteenth year: The uſes to which they are applied are chiefly two—hoops and char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coal The hoops are ſold in the wood at 5l. a thouſand; they are generally manufactured in the country, and ſent by ſea to Liverpool; the charcoal is ſent to the iron fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces in the neighbourhood. The value of a ſtatute acre
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:0179800900:272"/>of coppice-wood, of ſixteen years growth, is variable from 10l. to 15l.; and if it conſiſts altogether of oak, its price may amount to twenty guineas; 6l. for the charcoal, and 15l. for the bark; it being the cuſtom here to peel the bolls, and all the branches of the oak, which are equal to the thickneſs of a man's thumb.</p>
                     <p>It is an extraordinary thing, to ſee any trees left to ſtand for timber in theſe underwoods, the high price of bark being a temptation to cut the whole down. Fine ſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, from nine to twelve inches in circumference, at five feet from the ground, and with bark as ſplendid as poliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſilver, are felled by the unfeeling proprietor, with as little regret as if they were thorns or briars. Of late, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, ſome few owners of underwoods have left ſtandards, and if they conſult their intereſt, the practice will become general. As this is a point denied by many proprietors of coppices, it may be of uſe to explain the principles on which the obſervation is founded.</p>
                     <p>Suppoſe a ſtatute acre of underwood to be, in the ſpring of 1794, ſixteen years old, and that the whole is then cut down and ſold for 14l.; this ſum will, in ſixty-four years, (reckoning compound intereſt at 4 per cent.) amount to 172l. In 1810 another fall of underwood, of the ſame value, will be made; the 14l. then ariſing, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved for forty-eight years, in the ſame way, will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce 91l. In 1826 another 14l will ariſe from another fall of the underwood; this ſum, improved for thirty-two years, will amount to 49l. In 1842, another fall will produce 14l. which, in ſixteen years, will become 26l. And laſtly, in 1858, or in ſixty-four years from 1794, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother fall will produce 14l. The amount of the value of the five falls, thus eſtimated and improved, will be 352l. Let us now calculate the profit which would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult, in the ſame time, from the ſame acre of underwood, if it was managed in a different way. Inſtead of cutting
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:0179800900:273"/>the whole down in 1794, let us ſuppoſe that 150 of the beſt young oaks are left to ſtand for timber; the then value of theſe, at 2d. a tree, is 25s. this being ſubducted from 14l. the value of the whole coppice, leaves 12l. 15s. This ſum, improved as before, will amount, in ſixty-four years, to 156l. (ſhillings and pence in theſe calculations being neglected.) The next fall in 1810 ought not to be valued at more than 10l. as 150 trees, then of thirty two years growth, will do ſome injury to the underwood: 10l. in forty-eight years will amount to 65l. The next fall in 1826 may be valued at 8l. and at that time ſeventy five trees ſhould be taken down; theſe trees will then be forty-eight years old, and worth 15s. a tree, or 56l. in the whole; this added to 8l. the value of the then under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, makes 64l. which, in thirty-two years, will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce 224l Without eſtimating the underwood in 1842, and in 1858, at any thing, or the value of the paſturage for thirty-two years at any thing, let us ſuppoſe the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty-five remaining trees to be cut down in 1858, being then eighty years old, and that they would, one with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, be worth 4l. a-piece, or 300l. in the whole: The ſum of the profits, thus ariſing, is 745l. or more than double the other amount.</p>
                     <p>It is a general opinion in this, and, I believe, in other countries, that it is more profitable to fell oak wood at fifty or ſixty years growth, than to let it ſtand for navy-timber to eighty or one hundred. According to the price which is now paid for that commodity, either by the Navy-Board, or the Eaſt India Company, I believe the opinion to be founded in truth. The following obſervations contain the reaſon for this belief.</p>
                     <p>If profit is conſidered, every tree of every kind ought to be cut down and ſold, when the annual increaſe in value of the tree, by its growth, is leſs than the annual intereſt of the money it would ſell for:—this being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:0179800900:274"/>we have only to inquire into the annual increaſe in the value of oaks of different ages.</p>
                     <p>In the Philoſophical Tranſactions, for 1759, there are ſome uſeful tables reſpecting the growth of trees, by Mr Marſham; from theſe tables the two following inferences may be drawn:—
<list>
                           <item>1. That it is highly profitable to let young thriving oaks, which are not worth above 30s. a tree, continue ſtanding.</item>
                           <item>2. That it is not profitable to let oaks of 80 or 100 years growth, continue ſtanding.</item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p>Three oaks, marked in the tables, No. 8, 11,—12, in April 1743, before they began to ſhoot, contained eleven and one half feet of wood, and were altogether worth, at eighteen pence a foot, bark included, 17s. 3d. The ſame trees, ſixteen years afterwards, contained thirty-four and one half feet, and were worth 2l. 11s. 9d. Now, if 17s. and 3d. had been improved at the rate of 7 per cent. at compound intereſt for ſixteen years, it would not have amounted to 2l. 11s. 9d.; and of conſequence the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietor, by letting ſuch, oaks ſtand, improves his property in as high a degree, as if he put out his money to intereſt at near ſeven and a half per cent.</p>
                     <p>Three oaks, No. 2, —3, —5, in 1743, contained 100½ feet of timber, and were worth 7l. 10s. 9d. The ſame trees, ſixteen years afterwards, contained 132½ feet, and were worth 9l. 18s. 6d. Now, 7l. 10s. 9d. the value of the trees in 1743, improved, at the low rate of intereſt of 2l. per cent. would, in ſixteen years, amount to a ſum exceeding 9l. 18s. 6d. The proprietor, then, by letting ſuch trees ſtand, does not improve his property at the rate of 2l. per cent.</p>
                     <p>The oak, No. 1, in the third table, was worth 1l. 2s. 6d. in 1757, it gained in one year one foot, or 1s. 6d. in va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue; if it had been worth 30s. and had gained one foot,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:0179800900:275"/>there would have been no proſit in letting it ſtand, as the intereſt of 30s. at 5 per cent would have produced 1s. 6d. in the year; and it is for this reaſon that I have fixed upon 30s. as the value of trees which ſhould be cut down; if they are cut ſooner or later, the proprietor will be a loſer. It muſt not be ſuppoſed, however, that great preciſion can attend this obſervation; ſince particular ſoils, or the greater or leſs thriving condition of the wood, may render it uſeful to cut down trees before they are worth 30s. or to let them ſtand a while longer. It ought to be remarked alſo, that large trees ſell for more per foot than ſmall ones do, yet the uſual increaſe of price, is not a compenſation to the proprietor, for let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his timber ſtand to a great age. This may be made out from the following experiment:</p>
                     <p>On the 27th October 1792, I meaſured, at ſix feet from the ground, the circumference of a very fine oak, of eighty-two years growth, from the time of its being planted, and found it to be 107 inches: On the ſame day of the month, in 1793, it meaſured 108 inches.—There is not one oak in fifty (at the age of this) which gains an inch in circumference, in one year. The length of the boll of this tree was about eighteen feet; it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained about eighty-four feet of timber, and was worth, at 3s, a foot, 12l. 12s. It gained in one year very little more than a foot and one half of timber, or 4s. 6d. in value; but the intereſt of 12l 12s. at 4l. per cent. a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts, in one year, to above twice the value of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, even of this tree, which is a ſingularly thriving one.</p>
                     <p>I have been the more particular on this ſubject from a public conſideration. Many men are alarmed leſt our poſterity ſhould experience a ſcarcity of oak timber for the uſe of the navy; and various means of increaſing its quantity have been recommended with great judgment.
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:0179800900:276"/>In addition to theſe means, the making a much greater than the ordinary increaſe of price on timber of a large ſcantling, might be not improperly ſubmitted to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of thoſe who are concerned in the buſineſs. If the Navy-board would give 8l. or 9l. a load for timber trees containing 100 cubic feet or upwards, inſtead of 4l. or 5l. every man in the kingdom would have a reaſonable motive for letting his timber ſtand till it became of a ſize ſit for the uſe of the navy; whereas, according to the preſent price, it is every man's intereſt to cut it down ſooner.</p>
                     <p>In the neighbourhood of Ambleſide there is found a ſtratum of gray limeſtone, which, though it contains a little clay, might be as ſerviceable as the pureſt ſort for agricultural purpoſes; but, unfortunately for the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of this part of the county, coal is ſo dear, that very little of this limeſtone is burned. The lime which is uſed in the culture of the lands being either fetched from Kendall, or brought up Windermere lake, at a great expence. As there is great plenty of coppice wood in the diſtrict here ſpoken of, it may be uſeful for the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers and land-owners to conſider, whether the burning of lime with fagots in a flame-kiln, as is practiſed in Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fex, may not be a more beneficial application of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derwoods than the converting them into charcoal. Even the ſpray-wood, here called <hi>chats,</hi> which is too ſmall to be made into charcoal, and which is now ſold for ſixpence a cart, or more generally left on the ground, might be made into fagots, and mixed with wood of a larger ſize, ſo that no part of the coppice would be loſt. In Suffex they uſe 600 fagots, cut in the Winter, and weighing, when dry in the Spring, thirty-ſix pounds each, for the burning of 480 Wincheſter buſhels of lime.</p>
                     <p>May I be permitted to hazard another conjecture, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting the uſe to which coppices might be applied,
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:0179800900:277"/>without injuring either the quantity or the quality of the charcoal obtained from them? Pit coal yields, by diſtilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, about a twenty-fourth part of its weight, of a thick tenacious oil, reſembling tar. All ſorts of wood yield a ſimilar oil by the ſame proceſs: I do not know whether the oil from wood be of an inferior, or of a ſuperior quality to that from pit coal; but I ſuſpect it to be fitter for cordage, &amp;c. In the ordinary way of making char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coal, the whole of this oil is diſperſed in the form of ſmoke; may it not deſerve to be inquired, whether this oil might not be ſaved with profit? The proceſs which is uſed in America, for extracting tar from the pine tree, is little different from that by which charcoal is made in England. Whether the quantity of oil which might be obtained from a pit of wood, when converted into char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coal, would exceed in value the expence of procuring it, can only be decided by experiment. The reader may form ſome gueſs at the quantity, from the following ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: The black part of guiacum wood yields a tenth, the ſappy part a thirteenth part of its weight, of thick black oil. Saſſafras wood, oak, aſh, alder, birch, &amp;c. give by diſtillation, (and making charcoal is a ſpecies of diſtillation) from a twenty-fourth, to a twelfth part of their reſpective weights, of this oil. The difference in quantity ariſes from a diverſity in the texture, age, and dryneſs of the woods. I ſuppoſe that a cord of coppice wood would weigh a ton, and that four cords would make one dozen of ſacks of charcoal, and that wood of this ſort would yield a twentieth part of its weight of oil; on theſe ſuppoſitions there is diſſipated in making one dozen of charcoal, 448 lbs. of oil, or one ton in every five dozen.</p>

                        <p>WESTMORELAND is ſituated between 54° 11′ 30″, and 54° 42′ 30″, N. lat. and between 2° 20′, and 3° 12′, long. W. from London. It is an inland county, bounded on the N. by the biſhopric of Durham and Cumberland, on the W. by Cumberland and Lancaſhire, on the S. by Lancaſhire and Yorkſhire, and by York<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire and Durham on the E.; and contains, according to the Biſhop of Landaff's Preliminary Obſervations, about 844 ſquare miles, or 540160 ſtatute acres: three fourth parts of which, he conjectures to conſiſt of uncultivated land.</p>

                        <p>The climate of this county, as may be expected from its vicinity to the weſtern ocean, over which the ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſt winds blow for eight months of the year, and bring the exhalations to deſcend in rain on the mountains, is remarkably moiſt. The quantity of rain that falls in the weſt part in a year has been aſcertained by rain-gages
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:0179800900:279"/>kept at Kendall, and on the banks of Windermere. In the wet year, 1792, it amounted to eighty-three <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

The air, however, is pure and healthful, the Winters rather long and ſevere. In the Winter 1791-92, thirty-ſix pounds were paid for cutting only a horſe track through the ſnow upon leſs than ten miles of the road from Shap to Kendall.</p>

                        <p>The county in general is ſo mountainous and hilly, that a great proportion of it muſt for ever remain undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbed by the plough.

The moſt prevailing ſoil in Weſtmoreland, is a dry gravelly mould; ſand and hazel mould appear in various parts, but chiefly in the E. and N.; clay is found on a few farms towards the Eden and Eaſtern mountains, and a heavy moiſt ſoil on others in the N. parts of the county. Peat moſs makes its appearance in ſmall patches in many of the vales, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds on the tops of ſeveral high mountains, which, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, are in general covered with a dry ſoil, upon a hard blue rock, provincially called <hi>rag.</hi> The ſoil that lies up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a limeſtone bottom is uniformly eſteemed the beſt.</p>

The Kent riſes in Kentmere, waſhes the vale of Kendall, and loſes itſelf in the Eſtuary near Milthrope, the only ſeaport in the county. The third is the Lon or Lune, which has its ſource in Ravenſtonedale, and flows through the vale to which it gives its name, till it enters the county of Lancaſter, below Kirkby-Lonſdale.</p>

                        <p>The lands of the <hi>ſtateſmen</hi> and farmers in this county lie ſo intermixed that their habitations and offices, which are often built together in little ſtraggling villages, muſt of neceſſity be very inconvenient for farming purpoſes; but convenience has been little ſtudied even on thoſe farms whoſe fields lie unmixed. The principal ſtructure is a barn, which, at the ſame time that it has a ſtable and cow-houſe underneath, is frequently large enough to contain the whole crop of both corn and hay, ſo that it is rare to ſee a ſtack of either. Theſe barns are often twenty yards in length, five in width, and five yards in height in the ſide walls. The expence of bringing all the materials from a moderate diſtance, and of building a barn of ſuch dimenſions with a ſlated roof, may be about ſeventy guineas. The houſes are generally covered with ſlates, which are found in ſeveral parts of the county.
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:0179800900:283"/>The ſlates are not nailed on boards, but hung with oak pegs on laths, and plaiſtered in the inſide of the roof. A few houſes are ſtill thatched with wheat ſtraw, which is ſold from 1s. 2d. to 1s. 8d. a threave of twenty-four ſheaves.</p>
                        <p>The expences of repairs are, for the moſt part, defrayed by the landlord.</p>

                        <p>FARMS in general are ſo ſmall, that it is rare to meet with one of 100l. a year of rent, though there are ſome of even 200l. or 250l. a year.</p>
                        <p>It might be uſeful to know what proportion of the lands in the county is poſſeſſed by that numerous and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectable Yeomanry already mentioned as occupying ſmall eſtates of their own from 10l. or 20l. to 50l. a year. Theſe men, in contradiſtinction to farmers, or thoſe who hire the land they occupy, are uſually denominated <hi>ſtateſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</hi> They live poorly, and labour hard; and ſome of them, particularly in the vicinity of Kendall, in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervals
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:0179800900:284"/>of labour from agricultural avocations, buſy them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in weaving ſtuffs for the manufacturers of that town. The conſciouſneſs of their independence renders them impatient of oppreſſion or inſult, but they are gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and obliging when treated by their ſuperiors with kindneſs and reſpect. This claſs of men is daily decreaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The turnpike roads have brought the manners of the capital to this extremity of the kingdom. The ſimplicity of ancient times is gone. Finer clothes, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter dwellings, and more expenſive viands, are now ſought after by all. This change of manners, combined with other circumſtances which have taken place within the laſt forty years, has compelled many a <hi>ſtateſman</hi> to ſell his property, and reduced him to the neceſſity of work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as a labourer in thoſe fields, which perhap he and his anceſtors had for many generations cultivated as their own. It is difficult to contemplate this change without regret; but conſidering the matter on the ſcale of national utility, it may be queſtioned whether the agriculture of the county will not be improved as the landed property of it becomes leſs divided.</p>
                        <p>It is painful to one, who has in his compoſition the ſmalleſt ſpark of knight errantry, to behold the beautiful ſervant maids of this county toiling in the ſevere labours of the field. They drive the harrows, or the ploughs, when they are drawn by three or four horſes; nay, it is not uncommon to ſee, ſweating at the dung-cart, a girl, whoſe elegant features, and delicate nicely-proportioned limbs, ſeemingly but ill accord with ſuch rough employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                        <p>A judgment of the refinement and civilization of a people has been often formed from their treatment of the fair ſex, and in this reſpect France was formerly held up to the world as a model. Unfortunately the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of nations are too often painted by thoſe who have
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:0179800900:285"/>been converſant only with perſons in what may be called high life; but were it allowable to apply this rule even to France, and to look for ſpecimens into the lower or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of ſociety, (and it is there ſurely that the moſt faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful repreſentatives of national character or manners are to be met with) it would be found that the women, even in the boaſted days of her monarchy, were doomed to the ſevereſt labour, to load the dung-cart, to ſaw the wood, and to threſh the corn.</p>
                        <p>The common people of both ſexes wear, eſpecially in the winter ſeaſon, inſtead of ſhoes, <hi>cloggs,</hi> which differ from ſhoes in this, that the bottom part is made of wood. The wood is generally either birch, alder, or ſycamore; it is about an inch in thickneſs, and a rim of iron is nailed round the bottom of it. A pair of <hi>cloggs</hi> coſts 3s. 6d.; they keep the feet warm and dry, and, with good care, will laſt a twelvemonth.</p>

                        <p>The rent of the land varies with its ſituation and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tility. In all ſituations, and of all qualities, it has encreaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed greatly in its value within theſe few years. This may be owing partly to the advance in the price of its produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and partly to improvements in the art of farming. At Shap, Ambleſide, and in Troutbeck, the beſt hay-meadows are let at about 50s. the cuſtomary acre. Near towns the rent of the beſt fields to be mowed may be, at a medium, rather above 3l. per acre. At Kirkby-Stephen and Appleby they are not quite ſo valuable. Near Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall, Burton, and Milthrope, ſome fields are let at 4l.; and at Kirkby-Londſdale there are a few which fetch above 5l. Lands of inferior kinds may be hired for paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture at all varieties of price. In Ravenſtondale, where no tithes are paid, and where the land derives no part of its value from its ſituation, there are between 2000 and 3000
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:0179800900:286"/>acres incloſed; four fifths of theſe are let from 4s. to 11s. the ſtatute-acre, and the remaining fifth from 20s. to 40s.</p>
                        <p>In the bottom of Weſtmoreland a farm of an hundred acres of incloſed land may be hired upon leaſe for 150l. A farm containing much coarſe paſture-land may be had for 20s. or 24s. per acre. It is not always known whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther theſe coarſe paſtures have been meaſured, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſometimes eſtimated by the number of cattle they can maintain.</p>
                        <p>Beſides the rent, the farmer is ſubjected to the payment of tithes, poor rates, and road money</p>

<pb n="269" facs="tcp:0179800900:288"/>although not neatly conſtructed, they are perhaps not ill ſuited to the ſoil they are deſtined to cultivate; ſome of them have a wheel at the extremity of the beam, which, it is imagined, ſerves to keep the furrow of an equal depth. They are drawn moſt commonly by two, but ſometimes by three horſes. The turnwriſt plough has been intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced into the county by the Biſhop of Landaff, and may be of great ſervice in ploughing the ſides of the hills, which are very numerous and ſteep in the arable lands.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Carts.</hi>—The carts are of various deſcriptions and ſizes. Thoſe moſt commonly uſed may be fifty-two inches in length, thirty-ſix in breadth, and fourteen and one half inches in depth, containing leſs than ſixteen cubic feet. They are mounted in ſome places upon clog-wheels, and have two-thirds of their length before the axle, which is of wood. There is ſcarcely a farming waggon to be met with in the county; it being a general opinion that four horſes in four ſeparate carts will draw a greater weight than if they were yoked together in a waggon.</p>
                     <p>The winnowing machines, which are here very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and the harrows, are both of the ordinary kinds. The drill huſbandry being yet in its infancy, there are few inſtruments for hoeing or drilling.</p>

                     <p>EXCEPT a very few open fields on the eaſt ſide of the river Eden, the whole cultivated land in the county is divided, by hedges or ſtone walls, into incloſures, many of

                        </p>
                        <p>WHEN a field of graſs is overgrown with moſs, which commonly happens in ſeven or ten years, it is broken up with the plough in the beginning of March, and ſown about the firſt of April with oats, at the rate of ſeven and one-half Wincheſter buſhels upon the cuſtomary acre of 6,760 ſquare yards. The crop is reaped about the middle of September, and ſixty buſhels are reckoned a tolerably good return.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Second Crop.</hi>—The land is ploughed for the ſecond crop as ſoon after Candlemas as the weather will permit, and eighty or a hundred cart-loads of ſtable-yard dung are laid upon the acre. It is ploughed again in April, and ſown with four buſhels of barley or bigg: The har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt is earlier than that of the oats, and fifty-four buſhels are reckoned a good crop. Some farmers plough three times for barley, but it is the general practice that is here deſcribed.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="271" facs="tcp:0179800900:290"/>
                           <hi>Third Crop.</hi>—After the barley the land is ploughed in April, and eight buſhels of oats per acre are immediately ſown upon it. The harveſt is commonly in September, and the crop is uſually as good as the firſt was.</p>
                        <p>This is the moſt ordinary ſucceſſion of crops, though it is ſometimes broken through by taking two crops of oats before the barley, which, in that caſe, is followed by another of oats. The land is then left to itſelf, and the firſt year it produces a light crop of hay of bad quality. In the third year the crop is at the beſt with regard to both quantity and quality. In ſeven or in ten years it is again moſſed over, and is again ploughed up to undergo a ſimilar treatment.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Exceptions</hi>—1ſt. To this general mode of management there are ſeveral exceptions, which perhaps it would be improper to omit. From Kirkby-Steven to Brough and Appleby, and from that town to Temple-Sowerby, the ſoil is a deep ſand, which, by cultivation, becomes more compact, and more retentive of moiſture. The fields of graſs, moſs over ſooner or later, according to the quality of the ſoil; ſome, where the ſoil is thinneſt, and the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent ſtratum the pooreſt, it is judged neceſſary to break up after an interval of only four or ſix years. In this part of the county there are particular farms, where, after the ſecond crop, which is oats generally inferior to the firſt, the land is ſummer fallowed, planted with potatoes, or ſown with turnips, which laſt are given to the wintering ſtock of cattle and ſheep. Dung is always laid upon the fields deſigned for turnips and potatoes, and the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der upon the fallow, which is likewiſe invariably and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſucceſsfully limed at the rate of ſeventy-five Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter buſhels per acre. What is ſo fallowed is ſown, in the middle of September, with two and one-half buſhels of rye per acre. The crop is reaped before a year goes round, and thirty buſhels are reckoned a good return.
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:0179800900:291"/>In the month of May, graſs-ſeeds are ſown amongſt the rye, but are never covered either by the harrow or the roller. Thoſe fields which were turnips and potatoes are ſown with barley or oats, and graſs-ſeeds, in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing quantities to an acre: eight pounds narrow-leafed red clover ſeed, which is preferred to the common broad-leaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed clover, becauſe it remains longer in the ground; four pounds white clover, four pounds hop clover, four pounds of rib-graſs, and from five to ten buſhels of hay ſeeds ſhaken from the crop of the former year. Theſe conſiſt chiefly of <hi>Bent</hi> graſs, which ſeems to be a ſpecies of rye-graſs, of the great <hi>Poa,</hi> or oat graſs, and <hi>Dark</hi> graſs, or Flanders hay-ſeeds. The firſt year, whether it be hayed or paſtured, the crop is far more valuable than that of any natural graſs in the neighbourhood upon ſoil of an equal quality; and the cattle, eſpecially the horſes, uniformly prefer theſe artificial graſſes to thoſe which the land produces of its own accord.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Exception 2d.</hi>—In the immediate neighbourhood of Kendall, where the ſoil is gravelly or ſandy, it is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual to take potatoes for the ſecond crop, and barley for the third; the land is then ſometimes left to itſelf, but for the moſt part the barley is followed by a crop of oats. A great many potatoes are grown and conſumed in the county. The price, at the time of taking them up, is commonly 1s. 4d. per Wincheſter buſhel; in the Winter and Spring it often riſes to 2s. The produce is variable, from 250 to 350 Wincheſter buſhels per ſtatute acre. They are cultivated in various ways, but chiefly by the plough. The inhabitants think that potatoes from freſh ground are of the beſt quality, but the product is uſually the greateſt from an oat ſtubble. Sometimes the farmer grows the potatoes at his own riſk; at others he manures the land with 100 cart-loads of dung per cuſtomary acre, ploughs it once, and lets it in this ſtate at 2s. the perch
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:0179800900:292"/>to the manufacturers and labourers of Kendall, who fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the plants and the reſt of the labour. The price they pay is high, but reckoning little for the work they beſtow upon it, which is conducive to their health, they are often well ſatisfied with their crop which is ſometimes very great, the land being well adapted for the cultiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this root.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Exception 3d.</hi>—From Millthrope to Burton, and from Burton by Farlton to Kirkby Lonſdale, both the farms and incloſures appear to be ſomewhat larger than in moſt other parts of the county, and it is not quite ſo rare to ſee a few acres of wheat. The land deſigned for this crop is ſummer-fallowed after the firſt or ſecond year from the ley, and is well manured with dung or lime, or with both. It is ſown in September, with wheat ſoaked in brine, or waſhed with chamberlye, and dried with lime, at the rate of four buſhels per cuſtomary acre. Forty-five buſhels are reckoned a good crop; and the harveſt may be ten days earlier than it is in the northern parts of the county. If the land is again manured, it is ſown with barley after the wheat; if not manured, it is ſown with oats.</p>

                        <p>EVERY occupier of land, whether <hi>ſtateſman</hi> or <hi>farmer,</hi> having it in his power to keep any number of cattle, through the months of Summer, upon <hi>joiſted</hi> fields where they may be kept at a cheap rate, or upon commons where they may be kept almoſt for nothing, it is a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal object with him, to provide for them plenty of Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter food. Hence his attention is chiefly directed to his crop of hay. It has been already ſtated, that the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of land, at preſent under culture, does not exceed one-fourth part of the whole county, or 135,000 acres. Had all the arable land in the county been cropped with corn three years out of twelve, there would have been preciſely one-fourth part of the whole in tillage; but there are many paſtures of an inferior ſort, which are very ſeldom ploughed, and in the high parts there is a much ſmaller proportion of the land in corn than there is in the low parts. In the very extenſive manor of Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venſtondale, although there are between 2000 and 3000 acres incloſed, there are not ſixty acres of corn; and it is probable that there are not in the county more than 20,000 acres under crops of corn in one year. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining 115,000 acres are cut for hay, or depaſtured with fattening beaſts and riſing ſtock, or with cows ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the purpoſes of the dairy. From ſuch an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection of the county as was had with a view to the
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:0179800900:294"/>framing of this Report, the proportions uſed for theſe different purpoſes cannot be even gueſſed at; but that for hay is perhaps the moſt conſiderable. A prejudice againſt the artificial graſſes prevails ſo generally over all the county, that it may be almoſt literally ſaid, they are never ſown. When the land has produced a few crops of corn, and it is judged that the moſs is quite deſtroyed, it is left to itſelf; and ſuch is the humidity of the climate, and ſo ſtrong is the vegetation of weeds and natural graſſes, that the very firſt crop has, by actual experiment, been found to produce 120 ſtones of hay per acre, weighed from the field. As every perſon who expects to have occaſion for hay, hires a field to ſupply him with that commodity, it is not often that hay is ſold in large quantities; and it is ſtill ſeldomer that the quantity raiſed upon an acre is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly aſcertained. When ſold, it may bring from 4d. to 6d. a ſtone in Winter and Spring, or from 4s. to 5s. a cubic yard. A cubic yard in the lower part of a well-preſſed mow may contain twelve ſtones of hay, and has been known to ſell as high as 7s. or 8s. In the ſouthern and in the eaſtern parts of the county, much attention is paid to the making of compoſt dung-hills, which, with the dung that remains after manuring for the barley crop, are always laid upon the hay grounds, and are thought conſiderably to retard the progreſs of the moſs. At Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall and other places, where dung can be purchaſed, they are manured after the firſt crop, and every third year while they continue in graſs.</p>

                           <hi>Fattening Cattle.</hi>—The young cattle are kept on the lands of inferior quality in Summer, and have ſtraw and a little hay given them in Winter. When three years old, if barren, they are either fattened in the paſtures, or ſold to the graziers of Yorkſhire and Lancaſhire from 5l. to 8l. a piece; if with calf, from 7l. 10s. to 10l.</p>
                        <p>Ten thouſand Scotch cattle are annually ſold at Brough-hill fair in the end of September. Though numbers of theſe are carried off by drovers to the ſouth of England, and many are brought by graziers from other counties, great quantities remain in Weſtmoreland. They are wintered on the coarſe paſtures, and in the ſtraw yard; in May following the young ones are ſent to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons; and thoſe of an age proper for feeding are put upon the beſt grounds, and are ready for the ſhambles in October.</p>

                     <p>AT Whinfield Foreſt, and at Lowther-hall, the ſeat of the Right Honourable the Earl of Lonſdale, there are
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:0179800900:297"/>very extenſive plantations, where many of the trees have grown to an uncommon ſize. Several of the oaks at Lowther-hall, have been valued at fixty pounds a piece. There are many ſmaller plantations, and various clumps of trees throughout the county, where the wood ſprings with a degree of vigour, hardly to be expected in ſuch bleak and expoſed ſituations as many of them are planted in.</p>
                     <p>On the diviſion of Kendall common, part of a very high and rocky hill, not being capable of any other im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement, was planted with Scotch fir, larch, oak, aſh, &amp;c. &amp;c. all of which are very thriving.</p>
                     <p>The banks of the lakes are likewiſe adorned with very beautiful coppices.</p>
                     <p>The Biſhop of Landaff has planted, on ſome high ground near Ambleſide, above an hundred acres with oak, aſh, elm, beech, ſycamore, Scotch fir, and larch. He is doubtful whether the climate be not too cold for any ſort of wood, except the fir and larch; the other kinds, after ſeven years growth, are alive, but ſtunted; they ſhoot a little in the Spring, but that ſhoot periſhes, as to its greateſt part, in the Winter. Some of them have been out down, but the new ſhoots do not promiſe well. The firs and larches, but eſpecially the larches, thrive as well as he could wiſh.</p>

                     <p>THE Waſtes in this county are very extenſive and valuable. They are depaſtured chiefly with ſtocks of
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:0179800900:298"/>ſheep, which are managed in nearly the ſame way, whether the ground be in common, or in ſeveralty.</p>
                     <p>In Winter, all the ſheep are brought down to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed fields, except the wedders, which, being thought able to endure the ſeverity of any ſtorm or fall of ſnow, are left to ſhift for themſelves upon the waſtes, where they remain till they are four years and a half old, when they are ſold from 9s. to 13s. a head. Having dropped their lambs, the ewes, in the end of April, are ſent back to the waſtes, where the whole flock paſtures indiſcrim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inately without an attendant. The lambs are ſometimes ſuffered to wean themſelves; at others, the teats of the ewe are faſtened up to her udder by a plaiſter of coarſe paper and pitch. The value of the wool, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of ſalving, are the ſame with thoſe mentioned, ſect. 2.—chap. 13.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Scotch Sheep.</hi>—Great numbers of Scotch hogs and din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds are annually bought at Stagſhawbank fair in the month of June, and grazed on the waſtes of this county. On ſome they are found to anſwer very badly; on o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers they thrive well, and are ready for the grazier a year earlier than thoſe of the native breed. There is here a ſtrong prejudice in favour of theſe coarſe-woolled ſheep, which there is every reaſon to believe is ill found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the ſort now known under the name of the <hi>Cheviot</hi> breed being equally hardy, and much more profitable from the ſuperior value of their fleece.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Black Cattle.</hi>—In addition to all theſe ſheep, numerous herds of black cattle are likewiſe to be ſeen upon the commons. A few of theſe are of the breed of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the reſt are Scotch, either bought at Brough-hill fair in the end of September, and wintered on the low grounds and in the ſtraw-yard, or purchaſed in the Spring from drovers, who fetch them from Galloway and Dumbarton.

                     <p>It is generally underſtood that no perſon ſhall ſend to graze on any common more ſtock than he can winter upon his eſtate or farm, in right of which he has a title to paſturage on that common. This regulation, however, is little attended to, and the commons are almoſt always overſtocked to ſuch a degree, that many perſons do not think it worth while to avail themſelves of their right of commonage.</p>
                     <p>On ſtinted paſtures, it is very ordinary to hire out the right of keeping both cattle and ſheep. A Summer's graſs for an ox, or for ten ſheep, on Foreſt Hall, and Moſley common, is let at 4s.; on a part of Troutbeck common, where no ſheep are allowed to feed, an ox may be kept for 3s. 6d. and on another part of the ſame com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, <hi>an ox or ten ſheep may remain all the year for ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence.</hi>

                        <p>THE importance of having the land lie dry, and of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting the water, which, in wet weather, breaks out up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the declivities of the hills, from chilling the fields be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, is well known in Weſtmoreland. The method of draining is faſt improving, and the practice is daily gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ground.

                        <p>The operation of paring and burning is much practiſed in Weſtmoreland, both in improving moor lands, and in reclaiming rough paſtures, that have been allowed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn almoſt to a ſtate of nature It produces excellent crops at firſt, but the effect is diminiſhed every repetition, and farmers are too apt to exhauſt the land by repeated crops of oats without any manure.</p>
                        <p>The expence is ſaid to be from 15s. to 20s. per ſtatute acre.</p>

<pb n="282" facs="tcp:0179800900:301"/>avocation. In thoſe parts of Weſtmoreland where ſummer-fallowing is not practiſed, the land deſigned for barley and potatoes always receives the ſtable yard dung at the rate of 60, 80, or 100 ſingle-horſe cart-loads an acre; and in Autumn, what remains is laid upon the hay-grounds, at a rate per acre conſiderably leſs.</p>
                        <p>On ſome few farms in the neighbourhood of Appleby, where ſummer-fallow and crops of turnips may almoſt be ſaid to enter into the general courſe, the dung is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in Winter from the yard to the fields, and laid down in a heap, which is turned over two or three times, with a view to accelerate putrefaction. Twenty cart-loads per acre are laid upon the turnip land and the fallow, and its operation is always aſſiſted by the addition of ſeventy-five Wincheſter buſhels of lime. Dung is ſold at Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall and at Milthrope for 1s. a cart load.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Lime.</hi>—In moſt parts of Weſtmoreland, limeſtone is ſound in inexhauſtible plenty; but coals to burn it muſt be carried from ſuch a diſtance, that its application to the purpoſes of agriculture has not yet become general. When, by the projected canal to Kendall, coals ſhall be brought into the heart of the county, its uſe muſt ſoon become univerſal.</p>
                        <p>It is ſometimes laid upon the land when it is in tillage, but for the moſt part it is ſpread upon the ſurface of graſs fields; and it has been found to ſweeten ſuch as are coarſe and benty amazingly.</p>
                        <p>In whatever way it is applied, and in whatever quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, varying from 75 to 480 Wincheſter buſhels an acre, it is always attended with wonderful effect. The price at the kilns is 3d. or 4d. a buſhel.</p>

<pb n="283" facs="tcp:0179800900:302"/>check for years the progreſs of the moſs. One hundred cart-loads of earth, rakings of the roads, mud, or rotten leaves, and fifty of dung, carefully mixed with 300 Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter buſhels of lime, are laid upon three acres with great advantage.</p>

                        <p>The fertility attending the overflowing of the Nile, and other muddy rivers, has been long known and well ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, from their depoſiting the earthy, oleaginous, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line, putreſcent ingredients, with which, in their courſe from the mountains, they become impregnated; but it is a late diſcovery in philoſophy which teaches us, that pure
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:0179800900:303"/>water is itſelf compounded of two principles, and that one of its component parts is, by the proceſs of vegetation, converted into the ſubſtance of vegetables.

                        <p>THE attention that was formerly paid to the breed of black cattle has rather diminiſhed of late years. They are long-horned, very much reſemble the Lancaſhire breed, and, when kept to a proper age, grow to a great ſize. As a heifer of three years old can be ſold for as much as an ox would fetch at four, it is rare to ſee a oullock of the country breed; but to judge from thoſe of all ages in the paſtures at Lowther-hall, they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent feeders, and poſſeſs, in an eminent degree, the very deſirable property of laying the fat upon their backs and other valuable parts. The heiſers and barren cows,
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:0179800900:304"/>if well choſen, are confeſſedly good thrivers, and are in great requeſt among the graziers of Yorkſhire and Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſhire. Not many years ago there was killed, at Low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-hall, a bullock of the country breed, whoſe carcaſe weighed one hundred and thirty-two ſtones.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Dairy</hi>—There are few counties in England, in which there is no great manufacturing town, where more milch cows are kept in proportion to its ſize, and where the produce of the dairy forms a greater part of the profits of the farmer. It may be naturally ſuppoſed that he is particular in the choice of his cows, and that they are remarkable for giving a great quantity of milk. Neither ſuppoſition, however, is founded in truth. The farmer keeps juſt ſuch cows as he has bred, and they by no means yield ſo much milk as would be expected from thoſe of the Dutch, or even the Scotch breed,<note n="*" place="bottom">The Ayrſhire breed is reckoned the beſt for milch cows in Scotland, particularly in the neighbourhood of Dunlop. The comparative value of all the different breeds, in regard to quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of milk, &amp;c. the Board of Agriculture propoſes to aſcertain.</note> upon a paſture of the ſame quality. Farmers in the country ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally eſtimate the expence of keeping a milch cow at five pounds a-year, and the produce at eight pounds. Cows in the country are kept for the ſake of making but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, of which great quantitles, of an excellent quality, are ſent yearly to the London market in firkins of 56 lbs net, at from 30s. to 35s. each. In the immediate neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of Kendall, the dairy turns out to better account by ſelling the new milk, which is contracted for all the year at 1½d. a quart, being the ſame price which the London cow-keepers receive. The ſkimmed milk is ſold at one third part of that rate. The ordinary price of a good milch cow may be about ten pounds.</p>

                        <p>The breed of ſheep, kept on the mountains and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons of Weſtmoreland, is either native or a croſs with Scotch rams. No attempt has yet been made to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove either the carcaſe or the fleece. They are horned, dark or grey faced, thick pelted, with coarſe, ſtrong, hairy wool. The whole ſtock upon a farm is herded to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, which is different from the practice in thoſe counties where ſheep farming is thought to be the beſt underſtood.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Wintering</hi>—Thoſe ſtore-maſters who have not upon their own farms paſtures ſufficient for the wintering of their young ſheep, ſend them to the low grounds from the 1ſt November to 6th April, and pay 2s. a-head for thoſe that return. They are ſo ſubject to the <hi>Black water (Sickneſs, or Middling-ill)</hi> that, at an average, ten out of an hundred die before Chriſtmas. After that, being very hardy, they ſeldom die, and never of that diſeaſe.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Price.</hi>—The wedders are ſold in October, when four years and a half old, from 9s. to 13s. each; the barren ewes at Lammas, from 8s. to 10s.; and the old ewes about 6s. to be wintered in the incloſed grounds, and fattened with their lambs the enſuing Summer.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Salving.</hi>—In October, or the beginning of November, the whole flock is ſalved ſo heavily, that a gallon of tar and 16 lbs. of butter are expended upon thirty-five ſheep. A man may be hired for this work at 1s. 8d. a-day, in which time he will not ſalve above ten or a dozen; or he will undertake to ſalve them at 2d. a-head. The whole expence is about ſixpence a-piece. It has been repeatedly tried to ſubſtitute tobacco-liquor for the butter and tar, but it is generally imagined that the wool is better for the ſheep having been ſalved. Near Kirkbyſteven, this
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:0179800900:306"/>operation is performed with oil and tallow, at an expence of 4d a head.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Wool.</hi>—The wool is worth, on an average of years in time of peace, 5d a pound. Part of it is ſold to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacturers of Kendall, and part of it to thoſe at Bradford, and other places in Yorkſhire. The ewes are ſaid to bear the beſt wool; and on an average of a flock fix fleeces weigh a ſtone.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Silverdale Breed.</hi>—Silverdale, a ſmall diſtrict in the neighbourhood of Millthrope, gives its name to the breed of ſheep in this part of the county. The ſoil is good, and on a limeſtone ſtratum, and a branch of the ſea is nearly contiguous to it. They are horned, white faced, and cloſe woolled. They are ſaid to be native, and are much ſuperior to the common ſort, in regard both to fleece and carcaſe. At the ſale of a farmer's ſtock, in October 1793, the lambs of this breed brought 10s. 7d. a-piece, the dinmonds 17s. 1d. and the ewes at the age of three years and a half, 17s. 6d. or 17s. 8d. In the townſhips of Burton and Holme, where this breed is kept, five ſheep at an average yield a ſtone of wool, which is worth 8d. a pound. At a medium of the whole pariſh of Burton for eight years, from 1772 to 1779 in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive, it required ſix fleeces to weigh a ſtone.</p>
                        <p>It is not unuſual for the proprietor to be owner of the ſheep upon the farm. In this caſe the farmer is to be conſidered as little better than a ſhepherd. The flock is valued at the time of his entry, and again at his removal, and the difference between theſe valuations is ſettled in money.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Experiments.</hi>—1ſt, Twenty Lincolnſhire <hi>Mugg</hi> ewes, that had been tupped by a ram of Mr Bakewell's breed, were brought into Weſtmoreland in the month of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember 1789, and lambed in February 1790. Theſe <hi>Mugg</hi> ewes were tupped in 1790 by a common Weſtmore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:0179800900:307"/>ram, and the dinmonds produced by this croſs have turned out the beſt ſheep in the county, and weigh from 18 lbs. to 20 lbs. a quarter, and are thought to be ſuperior to thoſe of the firſt breed.</p>
                        <p n="2">2d. Six of the lambs produced from the tup of Mr Bakewell's breed and the <hi>Mugg</hi> ewes, were rams. Four of theſe rams were put to ewes of the common breed in the county, and the lambs ſprung from this croſs are much of the ſame ſize as the ordinary breed; but they are broader on the back, and finer in the wool. As the experiment has not yet been long tried, it muſt be left to time to ſhow what the reſult will be.</p>
                        <p n="3">3d. The lambs produced by the Lincolnſhire ewes, and their own lambs of February 1790, are not ſo ſtrong as theſe lambs of 1790, which the ſhepherd is diſpoſed to attribute to a ſcarcity of food in the Spring, rather than to any defect in the breed.</p>
                        <p n="4">4th. Thirty of this breed were left unſalved in 1791; they were in good condition, and had no ſcab. Theſe ſame were again left unſalved in 1792, and broke out in ſcab early in 1793. It muſt be remarked, that the ſheep at the time of ſalving in 1792 were not in ſuch condition as in 1791; ſo that it does not appear, from this experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that there is any neceſſity for ſalving ſheep in good condition.</p>
                        <p n="5">5th. The Lincolnſhire ewes do not carry ſo much wool, nor is it of ſuch a good quality, as when they were brought into the county.</p>

                        <p>As there is but a ſmall portion of the county under crop, the horſes are not numerous, nor has any conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able attempt been made to improve the breed of theſe uſeful animals.

<pb n="289" facs="tcp:0179800900:308"/>are neither ſtrong nor handſome; ſixteen or ſeventeen pounds are reckoned a good price for a horſe at five years old. Moſt commonly two, tho' ſometimes three, and in the weſtern part of the county even four, are yoked to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in a plough.

                        <p>The ſwine of Weſtmoreland, though not large, are good in their kind. Farmers, butchers, and others, who kill ſwine, often diſpoſe of the hams to perſons who make a trade of curing them for ſale. Perhaps there may not be any thing peculiar in the mode of making hams in this county: but it is believed that a detail of the proceſs may be entered here without impropriety.</p>
                        <p>The hams are firſt rubbed very hard, generally with bay ſalt; by ſome they are covered cloſe up, by others they are left on a ſtone bench to allow the brine to run off. At the end of five days they are again rubbed as hard as they were at firſt, with ſalt of the ſame ſort, mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with rather more than an ounce of ſaltpetre to a ham. Having lain about a week, either on a ſtone-bench, or in hogſheads amongſt the brine, they are hung up by ſome in the chimney amidſt the ſmoke, whether of peats or coals; by others, in places where no ſmoke ever reaches them. If not ſold ſooner, they are ſuffered to remain
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:0179800900:309"/>there till the weather becomes warm. They are packed in hogſheads with ſtraw or oat-meal ſeeds, and ſent to London, Lancaſter, and Liverpool, in ſuch quantities as to form one of the principal branches of export from the county.</p>
                        <p>In 1792, neat hams of 16 or 18 lbs. weight were ſold as high as 5½d. per pound when green; when cured, in 1793, they were ſold at 7½d. a-pound. It has been found by experiment that hams loſe twenty per cent. of their weight in the curing.</p>

                        <p>LABOUR is dearer in Weſtmoreland than it is in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt any of the counties either to the north or ſouth of it. This probably is owing to the great number of ſmall land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders, or <hi>ſtateſmen</hi> above-mentioned, who doing the work upon their own eſtates, with their own hands and thoſe of their families, are perhaps diſinclined to labour for other people.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Servants by the year.</hi>—A hind may be hired by the year at twenty pounds, a houſe, a garden, and a patch of ground to grow potatoes; and an unmarried man at from ten to twelve guineas a-year, and board and waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>By the day.</hi>—The wages of an ordinary labourer are from 1s. 4d. to 1s. 8d. a-day; he begins to work be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween ſix and ſeven, reſts an hour at dinner, and leaves it off between ſix and ſeven in the evening.—The la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers on the highway from Shap to Kendall receive
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:0179800900:311"/>1s. 9d. a day for nine months in the year, and 1s. 6d. a-day for the other three months.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>By the month.</hi>—On the large farms, in the ſeaſons of hay and harveſt, it is not unuſual to hire labourers by the month of four weeks, at the rate of 1l. 12s. 6d. and victuals. They breakfaſt on milk-pottage, and bread and cheeſe, receive a pint of good beer in the forenoon, and another in the afternoon; they dine on meat boiled, ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, or roaſted, and potatoes or pudding; ſup on cold meat, and have plenty of common beer to drink through the day. They begin in the morning as ſoon as the corn is dry, reſt none but while at meals, and continue as late as they can ſee to work. Four men may cut, tie, and ſtook a cuſtomary acre in a day, leaving a ſtubble from nine to fourteen inches in length.</p>

                           <hi>Cutting of hay per acre.</hi>—The price of mowing a cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomary acre of graſs varies from 2s. 6d. to 3s. 6d. and a man uſually mows an acre in a day.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Per. day.</hi>—When hired by the day, a mower's wages may vary from 1s. 4d. to 1s. 10d. and victuals.</p>

                           <hi>Maſon's wages.</hi>—Maſons in ſummer have from 2s. 2d. to 2s. 6d. a-day, or 1s. 2d. or 1s. 6d. and victuals; and in winter 4d. or 6d. leſs. At Millthrope a few are hired all the year at 1s. 10d. a-day, wet or dry. When they do their work by the piece, and furniſh every thing, they are paid 2s. or 2s. 6d. a ſquare yard for a wall of two feet in thickneſs built with lime; if materials are furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to their hand, they are paid 8d. or 10d. a-yard. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven yards and a half in length of a dry ſtone wall, five feet and a half in height, coſt 1s. 6d. or 1s. 8d. in build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>

                           <hi>Carpenter's wages.</hi>—The wages of a carpenter or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon country wright, differ very little from thoſe of a maſon.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Threſher.</hi>—A farmer's own ſervants generally threſh out the corn. When perſons are hired for this purpoſe, they receive about 1s. for threſhing a load of ſeven and a half buſhels of oats, and 1s. 3d. for that of barley; and from 4d. to 8d. a boll of rye, conſiſting of two Wincheſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter buſhels.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Miller.</hi>—Farmers commonly have their meal made from oats of their own growing. The miller receives 4d. a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>load for drying the oats. If they are good in quality, a load of ſeven and a half buſhels will yield 176 pounds of meal, beſides paying the miller his toll for grinding, which is gueſſed to be about four per cent. Wheat is made into flour for 4d. a-buſhel. Numberleſs ſtreams rendering the precarious aſſiſtance of windmills unneceſſary, there is but one in the county, and it is employed in grinding bark for the tanners at Kendall.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Thatcher.</hi>—A thatcher receives about 1s. 4d. a-day and victuals, or 2s. 4d. without victuals.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Slater.</hi>—Slating is meaſured by the rood of forty-two and one-fourth ſquare yards, and coſts in the workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip 12s. or 13s. a rood: In the vicinity of the ſtate quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, the ſlater will find all materials and labour for 45s. or 50s. a-rood.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Tailor.</hi>—A tailor gets in ſome places 10d; in others 1s. a-day and board.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Mole catcher.</hi>—The mole-hills are carefully ſpread in moſt parts of the county, and the fields are cleared of moles at the rate of 3d. an acre where they have not been catched before; 2d. an acre are paid the ſecond year, and a penny or three half-pence yearly thereafter.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Maid-ſervants by the year.</hi>—In ſome farmers' families, where they are hard worked, maid-ſervants receive 6l. a-year.
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:0179800900:313"/>Their ordinary wages in other families maybe about 4l. 10s. or perhaps 5l. When they do not change their ſervice, if ſtrangers in the pariſh, care is taken to vary their wages every ſix months, to prevent them from acquiring a ſettlement, to which they would be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled were they hired for a year, or were their wages to continue the ſame for that period.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>By the month.</hi>—In hay-time and harveſt, when hired for a month, they get from 16s. to 24s. and board.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>By the day.</hi>—When hired by the day in harveſt and hay-time, they receive 8d. or 10d. and victuals, or 1s. 3d. or 1s. 6d. without victuals. At other ſeaſon they are paid with 8d. 10d. or 1s. a-day. Their times of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and of leaving off work, their hours of labour and of reſt, are very various.</p>

                        <p>It is not unuſual to hear people exclaim againſt the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of luxury, and the alteration that has taken place in the mode of living in their time. The labourer lives as well now as the farmer did forty or fifty years ago; the farmer as well as the man of ſmall landed property; and ſo on: And is this in any reſpect to be regretted, or is it not much better for them all? But perſons generally cry out moſt loudly againſt the rank immediately be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath them, without recollecting that their own mode has been changed in nearly the ſame proportion as the one which they are ſo ready to condemn.<note n="*" place="bottom">Spencer's Travels.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>Fifty years ago the price of butcher-meat at Martinmas was from 1¼d. to 2d. a pound in Burton market, and eighty beaſts were ſometimes ſlaughtered in a day, and bought to be ſalted for winter proviſions. From that time, except a few at Chriſtmas and at Eaſter, no cattle were killed
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:0179800900:314"/>there till they were fattened upon the paſtures in ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. Farmers, in thoſe days, ſeldom eat any butcher-meat; they lived on bread and butter, and what other little matters the farm afforded. Now labourers gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally breakfaſt on that very ancient food pottage, with the help of a little cheeſe and bread; they dine on but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher-meat and potatoes, or pudding; and ſup on pota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toes, or pottage, or bread and cheeſe.</p>
                        <p>The bread generally eaten in the county is made from oat-meal. Water and oat-meal are kneaded together in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a paſte without any leaven; this paſte is rolled into a circular cake of about twenty inches in diameter, and is placed upon a thin flat plate of iron, called a <hi>girdle,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which a fire is put, and the cake thus baked goes by the name of <hi>clap</hi>-bread, and is to be ſeen at almoſt every table in the county. This very particular deſcription of baking cakes may appear too minute, or altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary, and it owes its place here to the requeſt of ſome perſons of rank who wiſhed to ſee it recorded ſomewhere. The meal is moſtly ground to ſuch a degree of fineneſs that a meaſure of ſixteen quarts will weigh ſixteen pounds. Farmers, labourers, and manufacturers uſually have fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen cakes made from ſixteen pounds of meal, and as many baked in a day as will ſerve their families for a month. Such of the gentry as eat this ſort of bread, moſt of them now eating bread made from wheat, have it baked much more frequently, and alſo much thinner. A labouring man will eat ſixteen pounds of meal made into bread in a fortnight; the price of ſixteen pounds of meal is variable from 1s. 6d. to 2s. 6d.; the medium is 2s. which gives 1s. a-week for each labourer for bread; his cottage and his fuel coſt at leaſt as much more. His wages for three-quarters of a-year are 9s. a-week, and 8 s. a-week for the other quarter; but making allowance for broken days, 8s. a-week may be conſidered as the full amount of
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:0179800900:315"/>the price of his labour; and indeed a good labourer may be hired by the year at that rate. Hence there will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main 6 s. a-week for the labour of the man, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of his own ſuſtenance, the ſuſtenance of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, and the cloathing of them all.</p>
                        <p>The difference in the price of proviſions in a county ſo ſmall as Weſtmoreland, cannot be very great. They are, however, ſomewhat cheaper in the north and caſt parts than they are in the ſouth parts, which are more within the reach of the markets of Lancaſter and Liver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pool. Beef in Kendall market, in the month of Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber 1793, was ſold at 3d. or 4d. a-pound, and a choice cut at 4½d.; in ſpring it often riſes to 6d. a-pound. Mutton, which in ſpring often riſes to 7d. a-pound, was ſold at 3d. 3½d. or 4d. Pork was ſold at 3d. or 4d. As all the bull calves are carried to market, veal is for the moſt part cheaper than the other kinds of butcher meat, and yet in ſpring it is ſometimes ſold as high as 5d. a-pound. Potatoes brought 1s. 4d. a buſhel, or 5s. 6d. or 6s. a-load; in ſpring they are often ſold at nearly the double of theſe prices. Oat-meal is bought in ſome places by a meaſure of ſixteen quarts, at a price which fluctuates from 1 s. 4d. to 2 s. 6d.; in others by a peck of 20 quarts, which in ſummer 1793 was worth 3s. Butter was ſold from 7d. to 9d. a-pound; in winter the price ſeldom riſes above 11d.; a ſtone of 16 lbs. of 20 ounces, coſts 11s. 6d. and a firkin of 56 lbs. neat, from 30s. to 35s. Cheeſe in the country coſts 3d. a pound, and new milk 1d. a-quart, which in Kendall is contracted for all the year at 1½ d.</p>
                        <p>A turkey coſts 3s. 4 d. or 5s. according to its ſize; a gooſe 1s. 6d or 2s. or when ſold by weight 3d. a-pound; a hen from 7d. to 10d. and a chicken from 4d. to 8d. Eggs fluctuate in their price from 2½d. to 6d. or even to 9d. a-dozen. Ducks are ſold from 1s. 4 d. to 2s. a-pair,
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:0179800900:316"/>teal at 4d. a-piece, woodcocks at 4 s. or 5s. a-brace, and pigeons from 4s. to 6s. a-dozen.</p>
                        <p>Salmon catched in the Lune is ſold from 4d. to 8 d. a-pound; that which is brought from Carliſle from 3d. to 1s 2d. Char are ſold at about 7s. a-dozen, trouts at 4d. a-pound, muſſels at 2d. or 3d. a-quart, flounders from 1d. to 6d. a piece, eels at 2d. a-pound, and rabbits, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the ſkins, at 1s. the pair.

Its exports are coarſe woollen cloth, manufactured at Kendall, ſtockings, ſlates, tanned hides, gunpowder, hoops, charcoal, hams, wool, ſheep, and cattle. Its imports are chiefly merchant goods, wheat, oats, with a little barley, cattle and ſheep.</p>

                        <p>The manufactures of Weſtmoreland are not of much greater importance than its commerce.

                        <p>Moſt beautiful ſtockings, and carpets of ſtrength and luſtre, little inferior to thoſe of Perſia, are manufactured at Lowther for behoof of the Earl of Lonſdale. A few of theſe have been ſold from 63l. to 105l.; but as they are
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:0179800900:319"/>wrought ſolely for his own uſe, or to be given in preſents to his friends, perhaps they do not enter with propriety into an enumeration of the manufactures of the county. What is now the manufactory, was originally a college, but, being only in its probationary ſtate, was diſcontinued by the late Lord Viſcount Lonſdale. The Earl of Selkirk, and the late Duke of Athol, were educated here; and an aſh-tree, planted by his Lordſhip, is ſtill pointed out.</p>

The pound conſiſts of 12, 16, 18, or 21 ounces, and the ſtone of 14, 16, or 20 pounds. There is a Wincheſter buſhel, a cuſtomary buſhel equal to three of theſe, a buſhel of two buſhels for the ſale of potatoes near Appleby, and one of two and a half for that of barley. Rye is ſold by the boll of two buſhels, and potatoes by the load of four buſhels and a half heaped, or more gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erally

                        <p>CLOVER. In many counties of England the land is ſown with graſs ſeeds, and left to lie for ſome years with a view to refreſh and enable it to bear crops of corn; but in Weſtmoreland it is ploughed and ſown with corn in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to prepare it for graſs. When it hath been cropped for three years, and it is judged that the ſoil is ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:0179800900:322"/>reduced, and that the moſs is quite deſtroyed, the land is left to itſelf to graſs over. The firſt crop of hay is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver either weighty or good in quality; the ſecond is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally very ſuperior in both theſe reſpects to the firſt, and ſo favourable are the climate and the ſoil to the growth of graſs, that the third crop is often ſo abundant as to be let for two or three pounds per acre, and of a quality ſo excellent, that in ſeveral places cattle are fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened upon it in Winter for the markets of Lancaſter and Liverpool. But even theſe beſt crops are far inferior in point of value to thoſe that would be produced by the ſame fields, were their natural aptitude to grow graſs di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to the production of clover and rye-graſs. The prejudice that prevails almoſt univerſally in Weſtmore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land againſt theſe artificial plants is a great obſtacle to the improvement of the huſbandry of the county, and muſt be overcome before the arable lands can be brought to that degree of cultivation of which they are ſuſceptible.</p>
                        <p>It is ſaid that hay made of clover and rye-graſs is much coarſer than that which is made of the natural graſſes; and that theſe artificial plants giving place to the natural ones, periſh at the end of two or three years, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ought never to be ſown at all.</p>
                        <p>The opinion is conceived to be ill founded which holds that hay made of ſown graſſes is bad in quality; long ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience and continued practice having ſhown that horſes are very fond of ſuch hay, and that when even fed upon it alone they are able to do a great deal of hard work. It can hardly be ſeriouſly aſſerted that hay made of the traſh produced ſpontaneouſly by the land the two firſt years after it has been cropped with corn is better than hay made of clover and rye-graſs. The artificial graſſes ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom or never periſh at once at the end of either the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond or third year: they diſappear gradually, making room for the natural herbage to occupy their place, which
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:0179800900:323"/>it is imagined it would be found upon trial to do with much more profit to the farmer than would have accrued to him by managing his lands in the ordinary way; for the ſuperior value of the hay the firſt two years would far more than reimburſe him for the expence of the graſs ſeeds, and he might ſtill have his favourite natural hay after theſe had died entirely out.</p>
                        <p>This is ſtated upon the ſuppoſition that the field was to be allowed to lie eight or ten years in graſs, as is the cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom at preſent. If it were to be broken up at the end of the firſt or ſecond year, it would be ſound in good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition for bearing a crop of corn, the roots of clover, it is well known, being a great improver of the ſoil: but this way of cropping the lands will enter with more propriety into that part where an alteration of the preſent courſe will be ſuggeſted.</p>
                        <p>In the year 1792, Mr Smith at Henridding in the pariſh of Burton, ſowed a cloſe containing exactly two acres and a half Lancaſhire meaſure, with 48 lbs. of red clover ſeed amongſt a crop of barley, for which the land had been ſlightly manured after fallow wheat. This field is in Lancaſhire, but being ſituated within an hundred yards of the county of Weſtmoreland, it may be mentioned here without impropriety, and it is ſelected merely becauſe the particulars reſpecting it are better known to the writer of this Report than thoſe in regard to any field of clover in the county that was the object of his ſurvey. It was mown in the month of July 1793, and it then yielded a crop of twenty-two ſingle-horſe cart-loads of hay. It was mown a ſecond time in September, and produced eighteen of the ſame cart-loads. It was depaſtured with nine ſheep from the time the laſt crop was carried off till the beginning of November, and the foggage was then tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erably good. Let the moſt ſtrenuous advocates for natural graſs, ſay whether they ever had a crop ſo valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able!</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="305" facs="tcp:0179800900:324"/>Where the land is intended to be depaſtured, the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument will apply with treble force; and the decided pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference given by cattle of all kinds to the green herbage of the artificial, over that of the natural graſs, ought to remove every doubt from the minds even of thoſe who are the moſt ſtrongly prepoſſeſſed in favour of the preſent practice.</p>
                        <p>In front of Carus Wilſon, Eſq.'s new houſe near Kirk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Lonſdale, there lies a field of ſixteen acres, which was ſown with graſs ſeeds amongſt a crop of barley in the year 1792. It was depaſtured in 1793, and maintained <hi>three times</hi> more ſtock than he would have expected it to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, had it been left to itſelf in the ordinary way. Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, the moſt prejudiced againſt ſown graſſes, ſaw and confeſſed the force of the experiment; and, it is not to be doubted, will follow an example which tends ſo materially to promote their intereſt.</p>
                        <p>The cultivation of clover is perhaps the greateſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement in the art of farming which has been diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in modern times; and it is equally matter of regret and of ſurpriſe, that what is at once ſo eaſy and ſo profit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able is not yet become univerſal, and it furniſhes a ſtrong inſtance of the difficulty with which old habits and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices are rooted out, even when ſelf-intereſt is concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their extirpation.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Turnips.</hi>—The climate and ſoil of the vallies of Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moreland are well ſuited to the cultivation of turnips, which muſt be carried on to a conſiderable extent before the agriculture of the county can be improved in any material degree. Experience has ſhown that this crop, and the mode of huſbandry uſually connected with it, are able, not only to fertiliſe particular farms, but even to, improve whole counties. The moſt profitable and the leaſt troubleſome way of diſpoſing of this crop is to fatten ſheep with it. A cuſtomary acre of turnips, if the crop
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:0179800900:325"/>is good, will feed twenty-five ſheep weighing ſixteen pounds a quarter, from 1ſt November to 1ſt April; even ſuppoſing the ſheep made no advance in theſe five months, the very encreaſe of the price of the mutton from 4d. to 5½d. or 6d. a pound, would bring a profit to the farmer as conſiderable as it is eaſily calculated. When to this there is added the value of what they would gain in point of weight, the profit, it is hoped, will appear to be ſo great as to make the deſire to grow turnips irreſiſtible, and quickly to increaſe the quantity an hundred-fold beyond what it is at preſent.</p>
                        <p>Where the land is very dry the ſheep may be penned upon a ſmall part of the field of turnips, and ſhifted to another as thoſe in the firſt part are eaten up; but if there is a field of graſs near at hand, the ſuperior im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of the ſheep will pay for the labour of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying the turnips to be eaten on that field where they will lie dry and clean, and where the turnips will be leſs trampled on and abuſed.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Rotation of Crops.</hi>—It is the general opinion of farmers in Weſtmoreland, that their lands are better ſuited for graſs than for bearing crops of corn, and they are plough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for three or four years, not with an expectation that the corn will be more profitable than the graſs, but in order to renovate them for graſs, and to deſtroy the moſs, which in a few years over-runs all their ley grounds: but there are ſome who are perſuaded, that the neat profits of the three or four years the lands are under crop, uſually exceed the profits of any other three or four years, while the ſame lands lie in graſs, and they think that their fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tility for the production of either graſs or corn would be injured by ploughing for a longer term, or after ſhorter intervals of reſt.</p>
                        <p>Whether the lands under the preſent ſyſtem are moſt profitable to the farmer when they are in corn or in graſs,
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:0179800900:326"/>it is not neceſſary now to enquire, becauſe, with all due deference to the general practice and opinion of a whole county, it is preſumed that a mode of huſbandry and a ſucceſſion of crops may be pointed out, which upon trial would be found far more profitable than thoſe at preſent followed.</p>
                        <p>The uniting what may be called the Clover and the Turnip Huſbandry is the beſt method hitherto diſcovered of keeping dry lands in a ſtate of continual fertility, and for this the light and friable ſoil of the vallies of Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moreland is well calculated. Inſtead of the common ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of oats, barley, and oats again, and then leaving the land to graſs over of itſelf, the following courſe of crops might be introduced with advantage, both to the public and the individual. When an old cloſe of good land is broken up it ſhould be ſown with oats, as is done at preſent; after the oats it ſhould be manured and ſown with turnips in drills thirty inches aſunder, ſo as to admit of being horſe-hoed; next with barley or oats, and always with graſs ſeeds at the rate of about ſixteen pounds of clover, and a Wincheſter buſhel of rye-graſs to the ſtatute acre. If it is intended to paſture the field, the graſs ſeeds can hardly be ſown too thick; if it is to be made into hay, the quantity of ſeeds above-mentioned will be found am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply ſufficient. The firſt year's crop of graſs may be mown twice, or after the firſt cutting it may be eaten by fattening cattle; or it may be eaten by ſheep till the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of June, ſaved after that and mown in Auguſt, and it will ſtill produce a valuable crop of foggage or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-math. It ſhould be depaſtured with cattle or ſheep the ſecond year, and the third year likewiſe, if it ſhall be thought proper to keep the field ſo long in graſs.</p>
                        <p>This courſe would preſerve the land in a ſtate of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual <hi>health and vigour,</hi> did it not, taking pleaſure in va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety, diſlike a too frequent repetition of the ſame crops.
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:0179800900:327"/>After ſome rounds it will be proper to encreaſe the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of clover ſeed, and at laſt to bring it ſeldomer into ſucceſſion, for if too often ſown it will be rejected entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. When this is apprehended the courſe may be varied or lengthened by the introduction of a crop of peaſe, or of drilled beans where the land is deep and moiſt, and wheat after either of theſe, or after a clean Summer-fallow, or by leaving the land ſome years longer in graſs than uſual.</p>
                        <p>When it ſhall be proved and known that potatoes are a cheap and nouriſhing food for horſes, the demand for that valuable root will become nearly as unbounded as that for turnips is; and even although they exhauſt the land, they may then be introduced into the courſe with much advantage to the farmer.</p>
                        <p>It is not pretended that the rotation of crops here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended would ſuit all the arable lands of Weſtmore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; but it is believed that, on a very large proportion of them, it might be followed with a certainty of ſucceſs. The cold, wet, ſtiff ſoils ſhould be Summer-fallowed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of being cropped with turnips; wheat ſhould be ſown after the fallow, and clover, or oats, and then clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver after the wheat; but it is impoſſible, and were it poſſible it would be improper, in a work of this general nature, to mention how all the varieties of ſoil ſhould be treated; and to deſcend to the minutiae of ploughing and ſowing, and ten thouſand little matters that continually de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the farmer's attention, and that are always varying with the weather. In theſe his own ingenuity muſt aſſiſt him, and there all his ingenuity will be neceſſary; for his art, though apparently eaſy, is attended with a thouſand difficulties.</p>

                        <p>There is room for great improvement in the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſheep, as well upon private eſtates as upon the
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:0179800900:328"/>commons; but while theſe laſt continue in their preſent deplorable ſtate, it would be in vain to attempt any altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon their ſtocks. The caſe, however, is different with ſtore farms properly ſo called, where the breed or treatment of the ſheep differs very little from that of thoſe upon commons, although there can be no reaſonable doubt of their being well adapted to the keeping a far more profitable ſort than is to be found there at preſent. There is no weight whatever in the argument which has been often uſed againſt the introduction of ſuch a breed from the ſcarcity of food and the coldneſs of the climate, the Britiſh Wool Society having proved that <q>the fineſt breeds of Spain or of England will thrive on the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt of the Cheviot hills, and that very fine-woolled breeds may be propagated on the moſt mountainous di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtricts of Scotland.</q> There are numbers of ſheep at the Feroe iſlands, which lie in latitude 63, and even in Iceland, part of which is beyond the Arctic circle; they are to be found in great abundance on every farm; and there nature ſports in a great ſuperfluity of horns, as if the ſcanty pittance of food which the animal can pick up in that bleak and frozen climate were more than ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for the ſupport of the carcaſe and the fleece.</p>
                        <p>The extenſive and valuable commons of Weſtmore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land loudly demand the interpoſition of the legiſlature in a country that boaſts of attention to its intereſt. Some immediate alteration in their ſtate, whether by diviſion or by ſale, cannot be too eagerly purſued, nor too ſtrongly inculcated; nor can it be too generally made known, that there are many wealthy people living near ſome of the beſt commons in the county, (which is a point of great importance) who do not think it worth while to avail themſelves of their right of paſturage.</p>
                        <p>Every perſon ſees the neceſſity of ſome material change with regard to the commons; and now that thinking men
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:0179800900:329"/>are turning their attention to this important ſubject, there is no doubt that ſome plan will be fallen upon by which both the public and the individual may reap the full benefit of theſe, at preſent, dreary waſtes, which are a reproach and diſgrace to the nation. But it cannot be expected that any meaſure however wiſe, or any propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal however advantageous, can meet with univerſal appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation. It will probably be reprobated by ſome whoſe prejudices it will alarm, and with whoſe little intereſts it may be ſuppoſed to claſh. Till ſomething of greater con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence be accompliſhed, the reduction of the ſtint, where ſuch is already eſtabliſhed, or the eſtabliſhment of a moderate ſtint upon commons that are perfectly free, ought not to be delayed one hour; for at preſent they are of little, if of any uſe, either to thoſe having a right of commonage, or to the nation at large.</p>
                        <p>A general incloſure-bill for the whole kingdom would ſave the expence of ſeparate applications to parliament for the diviſion of particular commons, but there are many barren and rocky commons that would not be in any wiſe benefited by incloſure; and although the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts of a few individuals ought to give way to thoſe of the community, there are numerous inſtances where both would be injured by the operation of ſuch a bill; for it would at once be ruinous to many proprietors to be oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to incloſe each his ſhare, often at an expence greater not only than the value of that ſhare, but in ſome inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces greater than the value of the fee-ſimple of that farm or eſtate in right of which he claims, and prejudicial to the public, by interrupting the ſheep-walks upon the mountainous diſtricts, which ought to be as free and open as poſſible.</p>
                        <p>The principal part of the ſtock kept upon the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons conſiſts of ſheep, either of the breed of the county, or brought from Scotland. The ewes are wintered in
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:0179800900:330"/>the incloſures, and ſent back to the commons in April; the wedder hoggrels are always wintered the firſt year on the low grounds at the expence of 2s. a head, are ſent back to the commons about the ſame time with the ewes, and remain there till they are ſold to the grazier. They may fetch at an average 11s. a piece; add to this the value of the wool, and 15s. may be about the ſum received for every wedder ſheep that arrives at the age of four years and a half.</p>
                        <p>Scotch hogs are bought at about 8s. 6d. a piece, and are kept two years upon the commons, when they may be worth 10s. 6d or 11s.; add to this the price of three fleeces of wool, and the whole ſum received for every ſheep delivered may be about 14s.; from this ſubtract the original price, two years intereſt of the money, expence of herding for the firſt two months, of thrice waſhing and clipping, of twice ſalving, the value of the riſk of bad payment from the drover or grazier, the loſs by ſtraying, and, what is often much more conſiderable, by death, and ſay what profit remains.</p>
                        <p>It has been computed that one third of all the ſheep in Weſtmoreland died in 1792. Great calamities are often exaggerated, though no doubt the loſs muſt have been prodigious when it was eſtimated ſo high.</p>
                        <p>Twenty ſhillings are reckoned an ordinary profit for keeping a Scotch beaſt a year; ſubtract from this the price of wintering on the low grounds and in the ſtraw-yard, intereſt of the coſt, value of the riſk of drovers, loſs by death from fatigue eſtimated at 2½ per cent, by diſeaſe, and now and then by one tumbling into a peat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſs, and ſay what advantage ariſes from this adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                        <p>Seven ſhillings and ſixpence are thought an ordinary profit for keeping a little Scotch beaſt on a common from May to October; make the ſame deductions as in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:0179800900:331"/>article, with the exception of the value of the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's keeping, and ſee how little remains for the rent of the land.</p>
                        <p>It is not poſſible to place this matter in a more ſtriking point of view than by repeating, that on ſeveral commons the liberty of keeping an ox, or ten ſheep, for a whole year, may be hired for <hi>ſixpence.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Improvement of Waſtes by Liming.</hi>—Great portions of many of theſe might be improved at a ſmall expence by the application of lime, which is found in moſt parts of the county, and might be cultivated with the certainty of great advantage. When ploughed, great care ought to be taken to adopt a proper ſucceſſion of crops, and to lay the lands down with graſs ſeeds in a very few years; becauſe, when exhauſted by over-cropping, they are reduced to a worſe ſtate than they were in before, and there is no way yet diſcovered of preparing lands for a repetition of a hearty doſe of lime.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>By Paring and Burning.</hi>— Many of the level moory parts might be converted into arable lands by paring and burning, which are well underſtood by ſeveral perſons in the county, and have been practiſed with more or leſs ſucceſs on ſome private eſtates.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>By Planting.</hi>— There are many thouſands of acres ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly incapable of cultivation by the plough; and, in the paper prefixed, the Biſhop of Landaff has ſhown, in a manner equally ingenious and novel, with what advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage theſe might be covered with wood. It is well known that trees flouriſh with the greateſt vigour on ſoils far more barren, and in climates much colder, than that of Weſtmoreland. There are ſtately oaks at Niagara, which, though not in a high latitude, experience a degree of cold in Winter far beyond what is ever felt in this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. On the weſtern coaſt of America, in latitude 61°, the very ſummits of the hills are covered with wood, and
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:0179800900:332"/>there is plenty of trees at Norton's Sound in latitude 64° 55″; and timber for the uſe of ſhips in the Britiſh navy has been cut even at Kamtſchatka, the very end of the earth, where the ſoil is barren in the extreme, and covered with Summer ſnow, and where the Winters are rigorous beyond the conception of an inhabitant of Europe.</p>
                        <p>That Weſtmoreland has been a wooded county, is evident from trees found in moſſes on the higheſt hills; and ſtatutes and regulations made long after the Conqueſt, ſince which time the climate has not been changed for the worſe, are full of the mention of foreſts, and chaces, and parks, and maſtage, and pannage, and vert, and veniſon, and greenhue, and regarders, and foreſters, and verderors, and an hundred other names and titles reſpecting the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the woods and the game.</p>
                        <p>The valuable plantations at Lowther-hall, the ſeat of the Earl of Lonſdale, ſhow how well calculated the ſoil and climate of Weſtmoreland ſtill are for the growth of timber, which, it cannot be queſtioned, would thrive over all the county as well now as it did five hundred years ago. The profits of planting are ſo diſtant, and ſo few perſons, looking eighty or an hundred years beyond the preſent day, are willing to ſacrifice a paltry intereſt for the ſake of a remote poſterity, that perhaps it may be neceſſary for Government to encourage by premiums what in the end would turn out ſo greatly to the advantage of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity. Theſe might be diſtributed with much propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety by the Board of Agriculture, whoſe income ſeems to be far too moderate for the ſupport of ſo important an eſtabliſhment, the objects of whoſe ſuperintendence are innumerable, and the field of whoſe operations is exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive as the iſland itſelf.</p>
                        <p>To the north of Shap lies a very extenſive common called the Scars, where between two and three thouſand
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:0179800900:333"/>acres of level white land, in a ſtate of nature, offend the eye of every traveller, and cry aloud for improvement, the means of which it contains in immenſe quantities of lime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone upon its very ſurface. It is more than twenty years ſince an act of parliament was obtained for a diviſion of this common, and that it has not been carried into execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is the more to be regretted, as, in the opinion of very judicious perſons in the neighbourhood, a large portion of it might be eaſily made as valuable as the little cloſes of Shap, which are let from 30s. to 40s. an acre.</p>
                        <p>On the ſouth of Shap lies another common called the Fells, which is, in general, incapable of cultivation by the plough, but it is not ill ſuited to the maintenance of ſheep; and the remains of the celebrated <hi>Shap-thorn,</hi> near the road to Orton, ſhow that plantations would ſucceed even on thoſe places of it which are moſt expoſed.</p>
                        <p>Near the mouth of the river Kent there is a marſh of conſiderable extent, common to Haverſham and Mill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrope, and, like all the other commons in Weſtmoreland, greatly overſtocked. It would not be difficult to bank off the ſea from this marſh, and to convert it into corn fields; but if this were thought not adviſeable, its value might be inſtantly more than doubled by the eſtabliſhment of a moderate ſtint, or ſtill farther increaſed by a diviſion.</p>
                        <p>Part of Croſby common might be eaſily converted into arable and good paſture land, and two clumps of trees, of a conſiderable ſize, prove that its worſt parts might be planted with ſucceſs.</p>
                        <p>From Croſby and Meaburn, a dry level common ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to within three miles of Appleby. It is covered with heath, and is capable of various modes of improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                        <p>The commons of Knock, Newbigging, Kirkby-Thore, and Marton, lie contiguous, and form a tract of ſeveral thouſands of acres, dry, ſoft, and improveable. A great
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:0179800900:334"/>part of theſe is covered with ſtrong brackens, and is ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior in quality to the ſoil of many farms in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood, and well ſuited to the cultivation of turnips and clover.</p>
                        <p>This ſpecimen of the commons in Weſtmoreland will, it is hoped, be deemed ſufficient; for it would be tedious and painful to enumerate them all. It is difficult to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the deſolate ſtate in which they lie, without ſurpriſe at the nation having ſo long delayed taking meaſures for their improvement. The waſtes and commons in this county, and throughout England in general, have been elegantly called <hi>a public treaſure in the hands of private perſons;</hi> it is to be hoped that the time is not very diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant when this important treaſure ſhall be opened, and its contents ſhall prove equally beneficial to the individual, and to the public at large.</p>
                        <p>It is impoſſible to look forward without emotion to that day when theſe neglected waſtes ſhall have received that degree of improvement of which they are ſuſcepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; when they ſhall wave with valuable crops of corn, bleat with profitable flocks, or be clothed with ſtately tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; when every little rill ſhall be turned out of its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural courſe to fertiliſe the neighbouring plain; and when there may be ſeen in every corner the induſtrious huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman, at once enriching himſelf and advantaging the community in a manner the moſt ſubſtantial!</p>
                        <p>Contemplating the matter in this view, who but muſt exclaim, what a noble field for exertion! What a ſource of national wealth yet in ſtore! <q>More certain than the profits of commerce, more permanent than thoſe of manufactures!</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>Such are the reflections and obſervations that occurred in a Survey of the ſtate of the ſtock and huſbandry in the county of Weſtmoreland, made in the months of October and November 1793, at the requeſt of the newly eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:0179800900:335"/>Board of Agriculture. What ſucceſs has attended the attempt to place this important matter in a juſt light, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers will judge; but it will be doing no more than juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice to admit, that no pains have been ſpared in the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of this taſk, which others might have performed with more ability, but not with greater alacrity or zeal.</p>
                        <p>It is impoſſible to conclude this Report without men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning to the Board the very flattering manner in which the perſon commiſſioned by them to make this Survey, was received by all ranks and deſcriptions of perſons in the county of Weſtmoreland. Every poſſible aid was given by the two reſpectable Members of the Board reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in the county. The other individuals who aſſiſted him are too numerous to be diſcriminated; but the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of this paper will ever remember their very polite at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention with gratitude, and his ſhort reſidence in that part of the kingdom with peculiar feelings of pleaſure and reſpect.</p>
                        <p>What gratitude is due to HIM, who firſt called the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the nation to its moſt important intereſts, and whoſe unremitted efforts are directed to promote the good of his country! How well does He deſerve, and what a ſure road has He choſen to immortal fame, that will ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive the ravages of time, and ſmile at the fleeting celebrity of martial atchievements!</p>

            <p>TO the note, page 68, the reader is deſired to add,— The reſult of this experiment was, that, in the harveſt of 1797, ſuch parts of the wheat, the ſeed of which was pickled and limed, as well as that which was pickled and not limed, was nearly free from ſmut; but that which was neither pickled nor limed, had ſmutted ears in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance, at leaſt a hundred times more than the other: it may be proper to obſerve, the ſeed was purpoſely taken with a few balls of ſmut in it.—This experiment is deciſively in favour of ſteeping in chamberlye.</p>
            <p>The following addition is alſo deſired to be made, (at the bottom of page 69.) to the paragraph on drilling, ending, "on moiſt ſoils."—We have lately found it moſt convenient to yoke two horſes to the drill, one going in each furrow, and to drill ſeven rows upon a ridge, of 80 to 84 inches wide, when the intervals are 10½ or 11 inches; and 90 inches wide, when the intervals are 12 inches.</p>
            <p>With the horſes yoked in this manner in a five-row drill, ten rows may be ſown upon ridges 10¾ feet wide, leaving a ſpace on the top of the ridge, about 14 inches wide, for one of the horſes to travel on; this is ſuppoſing the intervals 12 inches wide; but, if the intervals be 10½ inches, then the ridges may be 9¾ feet wide.—A light harrow is fixed to the drill, to cover in the ſeed.</p>
