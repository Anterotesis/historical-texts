            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>THE Subject I have here under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
is ſo Nice, and a plain
treating of it ſo Difficult, ſo Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous,
and eſpecially in me ſo
liable to the Cenſures of Prejudices on both
Sides, that it has been with ſome Heſitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that I go about it.</p>
            <p>Not that I am ſo Solicitous of whom I
pleaſe or diſpleaſe, in my handling this
Nice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Affair; for he that is ſo, can never
ſpeak with an impartial Freedom; a Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
abſolutely neceſſary to the clear ſtating
Things of doubtful Acceptation, and a
Liberty which when I ceaſe to preſerve
to my ſelf, I ſhall ceaſe to write at all.</p>
            <p>It is very hard with me in this Caſe,
more than with any other Author; in that,
whereas others are wary in what they
Write, for fear of diſpleaſing the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and irritating Men in Power; my<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Difficulty is a Clamour raiſed by them, who
without Arrogance I may<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſay, cannot
Confute me, pretending that I am too Care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to pleaſe Men in Power; in which as
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0551400400:3"/>
my Lord <hi>Rocheſter</hi> ſaid of his <hi>Whore,</hi> I
have the Scandal without the Joy, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
without the Profit of the Charge:
But as the ſame Men brought the ſame
Charge, when the other Party was in
Power, and thought it as much a Crime,
I appeal to all the World, what heed ought
to be given to their Cenſure; I only intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
this with a brief Challenge to them,
let them find any change of Principle in all
I have written, if they can; and if what I
wrote under the late Miniſtry and under
this Miniſtry, agrees, it muſt be ſome Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
elſe that has changed Principle, not me,
let the Iſſue determine it.</p>
            <p>I would be glad to pleaſe every Body;
but my Aim is to ſpeak Truth with Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty;
if it pleaſe no Body, I am not Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citous,
ſo it be but Truth and Honeſty: 
he that can ſay it is not, let him ſtand forth
and be ſeen; he that cannot contradict the
Truth I ſpeak, will have but ſmall Succeſs
in Calumniating the Honeſty with which I
ſpeak it.</p>
            <p>And yet I had not entred now upon this
Subject, but that the Writers of the Town
(according to the Uſage I have ſome
Years been treated with) laying all their
Baſtards at my Door, and almoſt every
Book being called mine, as well of one
Side as the other, I thought my ſelf a
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0551400400:4"/>
little obliged to declare my ſelf, and let
you all know my Notions of Things, with
my Name to them, that I may no longer
bear the Scandals of the preſent Filth of
the Preſs, (with Pardon for that Expreſſion.)</p>
            <p>Hitherto I have ſaid nothing on the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
nor do I purpoſe to ſay any thing but
what I will fairly own and defend; and
that I hope, may anſwer the People who
call every thing they don't like by my
Name.</p>
            <p>I am not apt to make Apologies, and I
entreat the Reader to place this Imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence
to the account of the Ages Follies,
which oblige me to it, in Order to Defend
my ſelf from a Charge ſo Unjuſt, as that
of being the Author of Books which I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
gave my ſelf the Trouble ſo much as
to read.</p>

            <head>AN
ESSAY, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>PEACE, (without other En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comiums)
it is ſufficient to ſay,
merits every Man's Approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and tho' the whole Town is
agitated and angry about it; yet
no Man will be found among us, but what
will readily own he is for PEACE.</p>
            <p>It would be happy for us all, if we
could talk of Peace with a little more of
it in our Tempers, that we could be at
Peace when we pretend to deſire Peace;
it is to me the ſtrangeſt Thing in the
World, that we are all falling together by
the Ears, and making War about Peace.
If you talk of one Man, who otherwiſe
we lik'd well enough, hang him, he is a
Rogue, he is come over, <hi>he is for Peace.</hi>
The other Side are even with us, and
they talking with this or that Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance;
who? <hi>Tom...</hi> or <hi>Jack?...</hi> Ay,
He is an Honeſt Fellow enough, a good
Natur'd Fellow enough, but he is got in
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0551400400:6"/>
with theſe furious People, he is all for
Blood, nothing but carrying on the War,
and puſhing all things to Extremities;
Death and Deſtruction are always in his
Mouth, he is Mad if you do but talk of
Peace to him.</p>
            <p>Unhappy Nation! What End can theſe
Things lead us to? Not a Publick Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
not a Coffee-houſe, not a Meeting of
Friends, not a Viſit; but like <hi>Jehu</hi> to <hi>Jeza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel,
who is on my Side?</hi> Who? Who is
for Peace? Who is for carrying on the
War? Society is converted into Cabal,
all Publick Meetings appear ſorted into
Committees, or bandyed into Sides as their
Notions of Peace or War encline them.</p>
            <p>I cannot but make one brief Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which may have ſome Philoſophy in
it; and I dare ſay it is all natural; the
Note may have its Uſes in it, which eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one may improve as they ſee fit. When
you find Men ſitting in a Publick Room,
ſay a Coffee-houſe, or Tavern, and talking
of the Publick, Two to One of my Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
before you hear a Word they ſay that
I tell you at firſt who are for Peace, and
who are for War. The Gentlemen who are
for PEACE, you hear them but at a ſmall
Diſtance, their Voices are low, their Speech
deliberate, their Words are ſoft, calm; and
ſpoken eaſie like the Subject they ſpeak of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0551400400:7"/>
The other Side that are for War, you
may hear them into the Street, or down
the Stairs, their Voices are Thunder; they
ſpeak the Word War with ſomething of
the Noiſe of War, as if they were giving
in the Field the Word of Command, or
bidding a Platoon give Fire. Again, look
in their Faces, the Men of Peace have it
in their Countenances, their Faces are co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
with Smiles, a ſort of Calm and
Smoothneſs of Temper ſits on their Brow;
they look pleaſed and ſerence, like the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
that poſſeſſes them. The Men that
are for War ſeem in a Ferment, their Eyes
ſparkle, ſomething Boiſterous appears in
their Faces, they look as uneaſie as they
talk, and the averſion they have to Peace,
ſhows it ſelf in their Countenances; ſome
croſs Lines ſeem to be drawn over their
Faces, by which they diſcover the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
they ſtand in as to the Thing that
they have in Debate.</p>
            <p>Well however, come near to theſe Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
and Argue cloſely with them, and you
ſhall find them all join in this, that Peace in
its general Acceptation is a Bleſſing, which
no Man can have a real ſtated Averſion to;
the Off-ſpring of Heaven, and an Emblem of
Eternal Bleſſedneſs; no Man can open his
M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uth againſt Peace, <hi>as ſuch;</hi> nor are the
Gentlemen I am ſpeaking of, who are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0551400400:8"/>
Peace at this Time, againſt it in this
Senſe; let no Man miſtake me, I am not
writing a Satyr againſt any Body. 'Tis the
unhappy Circumſtances of the preſent Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Temper, <hi>that I am ſpeaking of,</hi> that we
are uneaſie to one another, Differing, Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting,
Caballing, and ſometimes down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
Quarelling, <hi>and about what?</hi> Not Peace
in General, no, every one is for that; but
the Peace now to be treated of between the
Confederates and the King of <hi>France,</hi> that's
the Uneaſineſs.</p>
            <p>Nor <hi>to do every one Juſtice</hi> is the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
among us, whether we ſhall make
Peace with <hi>France</hi> or no; every Man of
Senſe, every Man of Principle, every Man
that has any knowledg of the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
of the Nation, or Concern for its
Proſperity and Happineſs, wiſhes for Peace,
no Man will ſay that he is not for Peace;
the very War is made for Peace; it is the
Condition of every Manifeſto, every De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration,
all the Alliances, all the Articles
of the Confederacies, which lay down the
Cauſes and Beginnings of the War, are full
of it. Peace, Peace; to reſtore the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility
of <hi>Europe,</hi> to reſtore the Liberty of
<hi>Europe,</hi> to reſtore the Ballance of Power
in <hi>Europe,</hi> the whole War turns upon this
Point. And to be very plain, the Juſtice,
the Honour, and the Reputation of the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0551400400:9"/>
Confederacy can be ſupported, and defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon no other Foundation, nothing elſe
can juſtifie the Allies for taking up Arms,
neither do they pretend to any other Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of it; <hi>the Word is,</hi> the Neceſſity they
are driven to, there being no other way left
them to obtain Peace. Indeed, no War is
juſt, but what is made for Peace; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but Peace can make War lawful.
So that Peace being the only thing pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to in the undertaking this War, for
any Man to ſay they do not deſire Peace,
is to ſay, they Fight as the Great <hi>Turk</hi>
does, for his Pleaſure, for Encreaſe of his
Dominions, for Conqueſt, and the extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Power; which is juſt as much to be
Defended as the Pyrates of <hi>Madagaſcar,</hi> or
as Robbing on the Highway, and no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.</p>
            <p>But
to come to the Point, the particular
Objection lies another way; it is not a
Peace in General that our People object
againſt, but the Nature and Circumſtances
of the Peace; and here we give the <hi>Peace</hi>
an <hi>Epithet,</hi> which requires ſome Enquiry
into; A GOOD PEACE, this is the
Diſtinction, this alone it is that our whole
Diſpute turns upon, and the Expoſition of
the true Meaning, or Acceptation of this
Word, is the Subject of this Undertaking.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:0551400400:10"/>
A GOOD PEACE ſay the Objectors
we are all for, but not ſuch a Peace as you
would have, or as you would make; and
this is the ſtate of the Caſe. Two Men quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relling
together in this Town, One a <hi>Weſt</hi>
Countryman, the other a <hi>North</hi> Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man;
among ſome Scurrility that paſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them, ſays <hi>Weſt</hi> to his Antagoniſt,
I am no <hi>Yorkſhireman;</hi> why, ſays <hi>North,
What have you to ſay to</hi> Yorkſhire? Are
there not a great many Honeſt Men in
<hi>Yorkſhire?</hi> I would have you know, <hi>There
are as Honeſt Men in</hi> Yorkſhire, <hi>as in any
Part of</hi> England; Ay, ay, ſays <hi>Weſt,</hi> that
may be true for ought I know; <hi>but that is
called Honeſty in</hi> Yorkſhire, <hi>which is not
Honeſty in other Places.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is ſomething like our Caſe; as one
Sort who are charg'd with being againſt
Peace juſtifie themſelves, and ſay no, we
are not againſt Peace, but are for <hi>a
Good Peace</hi> or none. So thoſe on the other
Side, who are for Peace ſay, they are for
no Peace but <hi>a Good Peace</hi> alſo. But the
Caſe will lye very much here, and indeed
only here, whether that is not called a
Good Peace by one Side, which is not
called a Good Peace by the other; and ſo
we are brought down by both Parties to
the great Enquiry, which is the Subject of
the preſent Diſcourſe, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:0551400400:11"/>
               <hi>What is to be underſtood, by a GOOD
PEACE?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In purſuing this Enquiry impartially, it
will come of courſe that we conſider the
Miſtakes which People are naturally led in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
about this Queſtion, and the various
Conſtructions which the Men of this Day
are pleaſed to put upon this Word; which
Conſtruction varies as Intereſt, Party and
Opinion leads them.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not ſpend Time to enquire how
it comes to paſs, that there are at this
time ſuch Miſtakes, and ſo many Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
upon ſo plain a Queſtion; and how a
Nation ſo clear-ſighted as we are, comes
to ſee with ſuch differing Views, put ſuch
a differing Senſe upon a Word of ſuch
Conſequence at ſuch a Time as this. For
really the unhappy Breach of Parties a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
us, and the Prejudices which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
attend thoſe Party-Diviſions, give
us but too plain a Method how to account
for them: And it muſt be, that Men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
blinded by their Paſſions, and
their Prejudices, are deprived of the clear,
and uninterruped Uſe of their Judgment,
give their Opinions with partiality, as the
ſeveral Intereſts of the Parties they eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouſe
influence their Judgments.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:0551400400:12"/>
To come at a right underſtanding of
what we call <hi>a good Peace,</hi> it ſeems neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
with plainneſs and freedom, to lay
down a little Hiſtorically the State of the
War as it reſpects <hi>Britain,</hi> and her Allies;
and this I ſhall do as plainly and briefly as
I can.</p>
            <p>After the Peace of <hi>Reſwick,</hi> for I ſhall go
back no farther; the King of <hi>France</hi> hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
recognized King <hi>William,</hi> ſettled all the
Reunions, and ſurrendred to the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates
what was agreed to be Surrendred;
<hi>Europe</hi> had a pleaſing Proſpect of a happy
and a laſting Peace; there was but one
Event which had any thing in it Fatal, or
Threatning to the Tranquility of this Part
of the World, and this was the Death of
<hi>Charles</hi> II. King of <hi>Spain</hi> without Iſſue;
which tho' it was not then happened, yet
it was probable could not be far off.
However, to prevent the Evil Conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
which ſuch an Event might bring up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Europe;</hi> and as the Preamble to the
Treaties of Partition ſays to <hi>prevent a new
War:</hi> The Two Kings of <hi>England</hi> and
<hi>France,</hi> with the States-General, entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a Convention or Treaty, for bringing
all the Claims, and Pretenſions to that Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
to a Ballance, this is the ſo much
controverted Treaty, called <hi>The Treaty of
Partition;</hi> in the Preamble to which, are
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0551400400:13"/>
the following Words relating to what I
am now treating of.</p>
            <q>Be it known to all who ſhall ſee theſe Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents,
That the moſt Serene and moſt
Mighty Prince <hi>Lewis XIV. &amp;c.</hi> And
the moſt Serene and moſt Mighty Prince
<hi>William III. &amp;c.</hi> And the States-Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> Deſiring nothing more Hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
than to ſtrengthen by New Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
the good Intelligence re-eſtabliſhed
between them, (<hi>there is keeping up the
Peace they had made</hi>) and to prevent
by Meaſures taken in Time, the Events
that might raiſe new Wars in <hi>Europe,</hi>
have to that End, <hi>&amp;c. (There's Safety
againſt future Troubles) and ſo he
goes on to the Articles of the Partiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
Vide <hi>Treaty,</hi> Page 381.</q>
            <p>After the end of this Tranſaction, <hi>Europe</hi>
was in a perfect Tranquility, I mean as to
Nations; for as to Peace at Home, God knows
we enjoy'd leſs of it than ever. But Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
healed our needleſs Breaches, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
two real Breaches upon us; and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Nation Sick, and Surfeited with the
little Peace we had; he viſited us with a
New War, and the Death of the King.</p>
            <p>The New War began purely on the
<hi>French</hi> ſide, who made himſelf Agreſſor by
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0551400400:14"/>
two Steps taken in a direct Contravention to
the Solemn Treaties he had made; tho' thoſe
Treaties were ratify'd, and exchang'd in
due Form, and ſo fairly executed, that
<hi>Europe,</hi> and eſpecially <hi>England</hi> entirely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arm'd,
laid by their Fleets, and broke their
Troops, reducing the Eſtabliſhment of
Forces to the Stint or Limitation of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
Peace.</p>
            <p>The two Steps, <hi>I ſpeak of,</hi> which the
<hi>French</hi> took to break this Peace, were (1.)
The Owning, Declaring, and Compliment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Pretender by the Stile and Titles due
to King <hi>William,</hi> as King of <hi>England, Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
and <hi>Ireland,</hi> notwithſtanding the Article
in the Treaty of <hi>Reſwick,</hi> by which he had
before acknowledg'd King <hi>William.</hi> (2.) The
other, was the Seizing and Taking Poſſeſſion
of the whole <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Monarchy, by Virtue of
a Will, or pretended Will of King <hi>Charles</hi> II.
to the Duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi> and declaring the ſaid
Duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi> King of <hi>Spain, &amp;c.</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
his Agreement and ſolemn Ratifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Treaty of Partition then in Force.</p>
            <p>Theſe things produced a War as Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal
to this Part of <hi>Europe</hi> as ever was engag'd
in; which has now been carry'd on Nine
Year and 6 Months, from <hi>May</hi> the 4<hi>th,</hi> 1701.
to <hi>Octob.</hi> the <hi>7th,</hi> 1711. Of the Succeſſes
and probable End of which I need not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large
here, it may come to be ſpoken of
again.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:0551400400:15"/>
I muſt do his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty
that Juſtice, as to ſay, I never ſaw or heard,
that in all his Manifeſtoes or Declarations
of, or concerning this War, he ever ſtoop'd
to give many Reaſons, why he took either
of the Steps, except only his own Will
and Pleaſure, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>ſo he had thought
fit to do; (viz.)</hi> We have thought fit ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to accept the ſaid Gift of the late King
<hi>Charles</hi> to Our ſaid Grandſon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>—and
we have thought fit to ſalute the ſaid Prince
(meaning the Pretender) by ſuch and ſuch
Titles, and the like.</p>
            <p>But the more his Majeſty thought fit to
take thoſe unccommon Steps, and the leſs
Reaſon he was pleaſed to give for them,
the greater and the juſter Reaſons they
were, why the Confedetates ſhould enter
again into that War which was the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
of it; and this is evidently taken
hold of in that Senſe by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and the
<hi>Dutch</hi> in their Reſpective Declarations of
War, as follows:</p>
            <p>Whereas, inſtead of giving the Satisfaction
that ought juſtly to be expected, the <hi>French</hi>
King has added thereunto (<hi>Note, that is, unto
the Seizing the</hi> Spaniſh <hi>Monarchy</hi>) a great
Affront and Indignity to US and Our King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
in taking upon him to declare the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Prince of Wales,</hi> King of <hi>England,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0551400400:16"/>
Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and has alſo influenc'd
<hi>Spain</hi> to concur in the ſame Affront and Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity;
we find Our Selves obliged for maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Publick Faith for Vindicating the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of Our Crown, and to prevent the Miſchiefs
which all <hi>Europe</hi> is threatned with, <hi>to declare
War,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I recapitulate theſe things, becauſe from
theſe Foundations will beſt be inferr'd what
ought to be eſteem'd by all the Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates,
A GOOD PEACE; which is bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it down to the Caſe before me, and of
which I ſhall ſpeak again in its Courſe.</p>
            <p>When the King of <hi>France</hi> had <hi>thought fit,</hi>
as above, to take theſe two Steps, <hi>Europe</hi>
immediately broke out into a Flame, the
People of <hi>England</hi> reſented in a particular
Manner, the Affront put upon their King, in
the King of <hi>France</hi> ſetting up a Pretender
againſt him, after he had ſolemnly own'd
his Title, and made Treaties with him as
King; and Addreſſes flow'd from all Parts
of the Kingdom to the King, expreſſing
their Deteſtation of that Treatment, and
preſſing His Majeſty to a War.</p>
            <p>The other Allies, as much reſenting the
King of <hi>France</hi>'s ſezing upon the Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy
of <hi>Spain,</hi> and ſetting up his Grandſon
<hi>Philip</hi> V. prepar'd for War alſo upon that
Account. Upon theſe mutual Grievances,
was form'd the Treaty call'd the <hi>Grand
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0551400400:17"/>
Alliance;</hi> in which the particular Demands
of the Allies, without which it is made
Unlawful for them on either Hand, to make
Peace, are particularly ſtipulated; with
this expreſs Condition alſo, <q rend="inline">"That it ſhall
not be lawful to any of the Confederates
to treat of Peace with the Enemy, without
the mutual Aſſent and Advice of the reſt of
the Confederates."</q>—And here again you
may have a ſtated Foundation for what we
ought to call <hi>a Good Peace.</hi> Nor is there in
any of theſe things, any feign'd Conſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
or forc'd Senſe, by which any one
can be led to make the Terms of Peace,
more or leſs: For this, like the Statutes of
a Nation, is the Rule to go by.—<hi>To the
Law, and to the Teſtimony,</hi> was the Word of
of Old: To the Grand Alliance, and to the
Declaration of the Reaſons of the War, is
the Word with me, and I believe will be
ſo with all Impartial Men in the World—Here
is the Cauſe of your making War;
here is your declar'd Reſolution when it
ſhall End, and 'till when it ſhall not End;
and when theſe Ends are anſwer'd, the
Cauſes, the Reaſon, and the Original Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Grand Alliance ceaſe.</p>
            <p>And here I muſt touch a very nice Point,
and which yet I ſhall do plainly, and with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect,
I ſhall be the laſt Man in <hi>Britain</hi> that
ſhall endeavour to leſſen the Duty and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0551400400:18"/>
that the People of this Nation ought
to pay to the Votes, Opinion or Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ions
of the Parliament, which is our
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rue Repreſentative, and whoſe Actions are
our own.—But ſpeaking in the Language
of the Confederacy, I ſay, with humble
Submiſſion, no Vote, no Addreſs, no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd
Opinion of the Parliament, as to
the Terms of the Peace, can alter at all the
Foundation of the War, or bind the reſt
of the Confederates beyond the Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
they are under, by Virtue of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iances
and Stipulations of Confederacy they
are already engag'd in.</p>
            <p>Thus as it is not in the Power of any of
the Confederates, legally to make Peace,
or treat of Peace, without common Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> So neither is it in the Power of
any of the Confederates to impoſe farther
Conditions upon the reſt, or to ſay we will
not make Peace, unleſs ſuch or ſuch things
be obtain'd, although thoſe things are not
expreſs'd in the ſaid Grand Alliance, which
is the only obligatory Limitation of Peace
and War.</p>
            <p>To explain my ſelf yet farther, with all
poſible Reſpect and Regard to the Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates;
if any one of the Confederates, or
the States or Parliament of their Country
ſhould Vote or Declare, That no Peace
ſhould be made with <hi>France,</hi> till ſuch or
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0551400400:19"/>
ſuch Conditions were obtain'd, were it put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the whole <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Monarchy into ſuch
or ſuch Hands as they pleaſe to name; if ſuch
Conditions are not expreſs'd in the Grand
Alliance, I humbly conceive the reſt of the
Confederates are not oblig'd by that Vote.</p>
            <p>I come ſtill nearer to the Point, for as
I hope, I ſay nothing offenſive, ſo I need
cover it with no Allegory or Similies, for I
hate Diſguiſes.—Our Parliament Voted, and
Addreſſed, and gave it as their Opinion;
and her Majeſty concurr'd with that Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
That no Peace could be Safe and
Honourable, while any Part of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi>
Monarchy remain'd in the Poſſeſſion of the
Houſe of <hi>Bourbon.</hi>—</p>
            <p>But if this is neither expreſs'd or imply'd
in the ſaid Grand Alliance, which is the
Compact and the binding Principle of the
War, I leave it to any impartial Hand to
make out, how far would theſe Votes or Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes
be binding upon the reſt of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates.</p>
            <p>This
is to me an unanſwerable Proof,
that the <hi>Grand Alliance</hi> is the Teſt, the
Foundation to judge of the Condition of
the Peace by; and whatever Treaty a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouns
to, or gives to us, all that is agreed
to be demanded by that Treaty, may be
called A GOOD PEACE, tho' it ſhould
not come up to the future Opinions of any
ſet of People whatſoever.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:0551400400:20"/>
From the Votes and Addreſſes of the
<hi>Britiſh</hi> Parliament, I come to the <hi>late Treaty,</hi>
if it be proper to call it a Treaty, of the
Preliminaries ſettled at the <hi>Hague</hi> by Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
<hi>Torcy,</hi> and the Plenipotentiaries of the
Allies.</p>
            <p>If by theſe Preliminaries, the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates
puſh'd <hi>France</hi> to a farther Length than
the Treaty of <hi>Grand Alliance</hi> had concerted,
well and good; my Anſwer is this,
<q>
                  <p>If the Confederates thought they had
found an Opportunity to gain more of
<hi>France</hi> than they had ſet as the negative
Bounds of Peace, no Body can blame
them, eſpecially if they had obtained it;
I believe every Honeſt Man wiſhes
with me, they had obtain'd it. <hi>But I will
not ſay for this,</hi> that no Peace on leſs
Conditions than thoſe <hi>Preliminaries,</hi>
provided within the limits declar'd by
the <hi>Grand Alliance,</hi> would have been
A GOOD PEACE.</p>
                  <p>As to the Objection which ſome make,
<hi>viz.</hi> That by their inſiſting on thoſe
extraordinary Advantages they loſt all
the reſt, and puſh'd the King of <hi>France</hi>
to Extremeties, which made him chooſe
to run all Riſques, rather than com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
with them; and that they might
have had as much as the <hi>Grand Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance</hi>
                     <pb n="22" facs="tcp:0551400400:21"/>
required, and as much as they
had pretended to one another to make
War for. As to this I ſay, they are none
of the Objections I am upon, nor are
they of any Uſe to the preſent Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>The
Queſtion before me is, What is the
proper Foundation of A GOOD PEACE
at this time? To which my Anſwer is, as
before, <hi>The Grand Alliance</hi> is the Teſt of <hi>a
Good Peace;</hi> yet as much more as you can,
I will never be the Complainer: But I dare
not ſay, that when what is there demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
can be obtain'd, you have any juſt Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to carry on the War to obtain more;
at leaſt, unleſs all the Confederates agree
to do ſo; for nothing beyond it can be
Obligatory upon the whole.</p>
            <p>It remains then, that all which ſhall be
ſaid farther relating to a Peace, muſt be a
Comment upon this Text.</p>
            <p>There is an Event happened ſince the
making that Alliance, which in that Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
there is no Proviſion made for; and
which, had it been foreſeen, the Allies no
doubt, would have made ſome proper Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
to have ſettled, This is the Death of the
Emperor; and this Accident may give us
Room to enquire, Whether it does not make
ſome needful Alterations in the Terms on
which we are to inſiſt for Peace?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:0551400400:22"/>
My Anſwer is plain, <hi>I wiſh ſome People
would bear with my plainneſs;</hi> I ſay it does
not: And here without Fear, or Regard to
Power, or Parties, I ſhall ſay ſome Things
which I do believe will ſtartle Man kind a
little in this Caſe; at leaſt, if we conſider
the popular Notions which ſpread among us.</p>
            <p>We have been puſh'd on, to ſet up the
taking <hi>Spain</hi> from King <hi>Philip,</hi> as the
REST or Stay of the Confederates; as
a Thing that we are all ruin'd and undone
without; and the Parliament Vote, Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs,
and Declare their Opinion, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
That <hi>no Peace can be Safe, or Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
without it.</hi> And yet I muſt tell you,</p>
            <p>There is not one Word of Recovering all
the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Monarchy, out of the Hands of
the Houſe of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> in all the Grand Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance;
ſo that none of the Confederates
are under any Obligations to go that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Length, and not make Peace with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
it.</p>
            <p>My Argument turns upon this Point
then, of which this is the Abſtract:
<q>
                  <p>A Peace may be Honourable, if made
according to the Tenour of the Grand
Alliance;</p>
                  <p>But the Recovering all the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy
from the Houſe of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> is
no part of the Tenour of the Grand
Alliance:</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="24" facs="tcp:0551400400:23"/>
Therefore a Peace may be Honourable,
tho' ſome part of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy
ſhould remain to the Houſe of
<hi>Bourbon.</hi>
                  </p>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>If in this way of Arguing, I am put to
prove the Aſſumption, (<hi>viz.</hi>) <hi>That a Peace
may be Honourable, if made according to the
Tenour of the Grand Alliance;</hi> I make it out
thus: The Grand Alliance is a Conventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of all the Allies, declaring all the Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances
for which they make War, and on
what Terms only they will make Peace.</p>
            <p>If all the Reaſons inducing the War are
anſwered, and all the Demands upon
which the War is Declar'd are obtain'd,
it can be no longer Juſt to make War;
when it is no longer Juſt to make War, it
is Juſt we ſhould make Peace; and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
is Juſt in this Caſe, is Honourable.</p>
            <p>I return to the Grand Alliance, <hi>I ſay,</hi>
There is not one Word of the Terms of
Peace, which are mentioned in the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs
of the Parliament, to be found in the
Grand Alliance.</p>
            <p>The Terms of Peace limitted by the
Grand Alliance are theſe, and none but theſe.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. An equitable and reaſonable Security to

            <p>Again, the Parliament was to have been
deſir'd if it had been found neceſſary, to

two Things, which being rightly
underſtood, will take off all that any one
may think in this is reflecting upon the late
Parliament.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. That <hi>as the Caſe ſtood then,</hi> that Vote
was agreeable to the State of Things
in the World; and to the Proſpect the
Confederates had before them, both
of the Poſſibility of that Conqueſt, and
of the Neceſſity of it.</item>
               <item>2. That <hi>as the Caſe ſtands now,</hi> it is
more than probable, that ſame Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
in the ſame Intereſt, and
with the ſame Deſigns, would have
been of another Opinion.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Alteration of Circumſtances muſt for
ever be allow'd to be a Reaſon for Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Opinion, in all Caſes in the World;
nor is it any Reproach to the Wiſdom or
Integrity of that Parliament, to ſay, That
what might be abſolutely neceſſary then,
may be otherwiſe now.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:0551400400:28"/>
I am none of them that leave my Readers
to gueſs at Caſes, or need that any one
ſhould ask, <hi>What</hi> are theſe Alterations of
Circumſtances which have happened ſince,
and which make this Difference, or whether,
and how it is more ſafe to leave part of the
<hi>Spaniſh</hi> Monarchy in the Houſe of <hi>Bourbon</hi>
now, than it was before?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Anſwer is direct,</hi> The Revolution which
has happened in the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> ſince
that time, whereby the Imperial Crown' is
fallen to the ſame Perſon to whom was
then allotted the Crown of <hi>Spain;</hi> is the
Alteration which I ſpeak of; and I cannot
but believe, that according to the Treaty
of Partition, and according to the receiv'd
Opinion of <hi>Europe,</hi> for ſome Ages, it would
never be judged Safe that the Crown of
<hi>Spain</hi> ſhould ever be permitted to be given
to the Perſon of an Emperor, any more
than of a King of <hi>France.</hi>—This is an
Opinion founded upon all the Principles of
Safety, which the Princes of <hi>Europe</hi> have
acted upon for above 70 Years paſt, (<hi>viz.</hi>)
<hi>The Balance of Power,</hi> which by ſuch a
Coalition or Conjunction of Power would
be entirely broken and diſſolved.</p>
            <p>Will any Man believe of the laſt parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament,
that they would have been of the
Opinion, to have given the whole <hi>Spaniſh</hi>
Monarchy to the Perſon of an Emperor of
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0551400400:29"/>
               <hi>Germany?</hi> Will any man ſay, that no Peace
can be <hi>Safe</hi> or <hi>Honourable,</hi> but what ſhall
put all the Dominions of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Crown
into the Hands of <hi>Charles</hi> VI.? It is not Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honourable
Account to give of his Imperial
Majeſty, to ſay it would make him too
Great for the reſt of <hi>Europe</hi> to be eaſie un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;
I think I might be allow'd to ſay the
ſame of the Queen of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I meet with an Objection here,
which ſhould be ſpoken to, (<hi>viz.)</hi> What
is this to the Purpoſe? The Parliaments
Vote is not upon <hi>who you ſhall give it to,</hi> but
who you ſhall <hi>take it from;</hi> not <hi>who ſhall</hi>
have it, but <hi>who ſhall not</hi> have it. To this
Cavil, <hi>for it is no more,</hi> I anſwer, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
do I ſay who <hi>ſhould</hi> have it, but who
<hi>ſhould not;</hi> and let this lie for thoſe to
Anſwer to whom it belongs: I know the
Queſtion is invidious and enſnaring; and
tho' I could Anſwer it, I believe, Effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and to Satisfaction, yet it is not to our
Purpoſe here, and for that Reaſon I wave it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Two Negatives</hi> lye before us; The
Houſe of <hi>Bourbon</hi> muſt not have it, ſay the
Addreſſes. The Nature of the Things ſays
<hi>Now,</hi> the Perſon you would have given
it to, muſt not have it; <hi>What then will
you do with it?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this brings me home to the Original
Queſtion, What is to be called A GOOD
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0551400400:30"/>
PEACE? As then I have thus ſtated the
Queſtion, I ſhall come to a direct An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer

               <item>1. That <hi>alone</hi> can be A GOOD PEACE,

the Balance of <hi>Europe.</hi>

this would be the Caſe of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi>

Declares in the Solemn Treaty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween

called <hi>The Second Treaty of Partition;</hi>
That that Treaty being made for the

Crown of <hi>Sqain</hi> ſhould never come to

Words;</p>
            <p>

            <p>
               <hi>Note, here,</hi> If the Allies had underſtood
that the whole <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Monarchy had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volv'd
to him as his Right, let me ask
theſe Queſtions:
<list>
                  <item>1. Why is it called SATISFACTION
FOR the Succeſſion? Why is it not
rather ſaid, 'Till he be put into POS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SESSION
of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Monarchy?
It would certainly have been expreſs'd
otherwiſe, if it had been meant, He
ſhould ever poſſeſs it <hi>as Emperor.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. Why is it call'd his Imperial Majeſty's
<hi>Pretenſion to the Succeſſion,</hi> and yet put
into the Hands of his Brother King
<hi>Charles?</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>I muſt be excus'd making two Remarks
upon this: 1. Satisfaction for the Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
plainly infers, His Imperial Majeſty
was never underſtood to be the Perſon that
ſhould ſucceed? It would never elſe have
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0551400400:34"/>
been called <hi>Satisfaction for it.</hi> This implies an
Equivalent with which he was to be ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
inſtead of it, and plainly acknowledges,
that the Confederrates never dreamt of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
an Emperor of <hi>Germany</hi> to be alſo King
of <hi>Spain.</hi> 2. Whereas it is called his Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
Majeſty's Right of Succeſſion, why,
then was it given to King <hi>Charles?</hi> It is
evident, this transferring the Crown by
Gift to King <hi>Charles</hi> III. at the ſame time
that we exploded King <hi>Charles</hi> II. deviſing
it by Gift to King <hi>Philip,</hi> was but an odd
Title, and gave ſuch a Handle to Confirm
<hi>K. Philip</hi>'s Right (his Gift being prior to the
other) as I never yet could ſee anſwer'd. But
waving that which I have formerly inſiſted
on, and which is now no more a Queſtion,
the Emperor being dead. This Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
may be drawn from it, which I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
can never be anſwer'd; That the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror
demitted his Right to his Brother,
becauſe it never could be allow'd tolerable,
nor ſo much as to be thought of, that ever
the Allies would agree, an Emperor of
<hi>Germany</hi> ſhould have it, as the very ſame
Foundation of Exorbitance which they
were then declaring and fighting againſt in
the King of <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King of <hi>France</hi> then, and the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror
finding that on both Sides, the taking
the Crown of <hi>Spain</hi> to themſelves, would
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0551400400:35"/>
not go down with the reſt of <hi>Europe,</hi> they
reſpectively put a Third Perſon in the Place.
<hi>Philip,</hi> and <hi>Charles,</hi> and both of them,
claim the Crown of <hi>Spain</hi> by Gift, neither
having any real Title.</p>
            <p>Fate now has decided the Point on one
Side, for King <hi>Charles</hi> is taken out of the
Contention, and made Emperor.—Can he
then be King of <hi>Spain?</hi> Certainly, by any
of the former Notions of <hi>Europe,</hi> he can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be ſo received.—Well, what is next?
Have we any other Branch of the Houſe of
<hi>Auſtria</hi> to make a Gift to? If we have, let
us ſee him; if we have not, what follows,
but to make ſuch a Treaty as in which the
Balance of <hi>Europe</hi> may be ſecured, and ſuch
Powers erected as may reciprocally prevent
either the Houſe of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> or <hi>Auſtria,</hi>
overrunning <hi>Europe;</hi> and this I ſhall call A
GOOD PEACE, let who will find out the
Medium to bring it to paſs.—</p>
            <p>The firſt thing I ſhall hint from this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevation,
is—This makes me eaſie, and I
believe, if conſider'd, would make us all
eaſie on the Subject of a Treaty.</p>
            <p>Let who will be the Agents, let what
will be the Propoſals, the Nature of the
thing is ſuch, no Party can ſuggeſt that we
ſhould not have a Regard to <hi>the Balance of
Europe;</hi> no Peace can be treated on, but
upon this Foot: The eſtabliſhing ſome Rule
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0551400400:36"/>
of Power, ſome Generals for the Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daries
of National Intereſt, ſuch as may li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
the Princes of <hi>Europe,</hi> and prevent fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
Encroachments one upon another.</p>
            <p>For this Reaſon, I cannot but think we
ſhould all be willing to come to talk of
theſe things—Certainly, to Treat of them,
can be of no prejudice; nor can I allow it
to be a good Argument, to ſay, That the
<hi>French</hi> always gain upon us by a Treaty.
This is to call all the Confederates Fools,
and ſay, they do not know what they
would have; that they make War for they
know not what; that they have Generals
to fight, but no States Men to treat; that
they have Hands, but no Heads; and that
all <hi>Europe</hi> are not able to maintain their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
againſt Five <hi>French</hi>-Men, Plenipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiaries.</p>
            <p>The <hi>French</hi> make Propoſals; they would
put by the Way of treating by Prelimina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
and come to a General Treaty at once;
And why ſhould we not venture them at a
Treaty? We can inſiſt upon every thing at
a General Treaty, as well as at a particular,
and can ſtand to all the neceſſary Points of
the Grand Alliance, as well there as at an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
time.</p>
            <p>The treating brings us not the nearer;
if <hi>France</hi> does not come up to reaſonable
Things, we are where we were. The
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0551400400:37"/>
War goes on, nothing is abated of the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour
of our Armies, or of the needful Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations;
the War indeed may influence
the Treaty: Thus it was at the Treaty of
<hi>Weſtphalia,</hi> which held at leaſt Eight Years;
thus it was at the Treaty of <hi>Nimeguen,</hi>
which laſted Two Campaigns, yet both at
laſt came to a Concluſion, and ſo may this
perhaps; if it does not, we are never the
farther off of Victory, nor the Enemy ever
the nearer the End they aim at.</p>
            <p>It ſeems therefore ſomething wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to me, that People ſhould be allarm'd at
a Propoſal to treat; we may treat without
a Peace, but we can never have a Peace
without treating. All that we are allarm'd
at hitherto, is the Suggeſtion or Suſpicion
of a private Treaty; to bring it then to an
open fair <hi>Publick Treaty,</hi> is the moſt effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually
way both to remove the Suſpitions
of ſuch a Treaty on one Hand, and to take
away the Pretenſions for it on the other.</p>
            <p>Some alledge a Party among us are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
Peace, are for perpetuating the War,
and have their private Ends in view, to be
purſued at the Publick Expence. I am in
hopes there are no ſuch People among us;
however, thoſe People oppoſing a Treaty,
give the beſt Argument that thoſe that
think ſo can wiſh for, to ſupport that Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legation;
it is alledged on the other Hand,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0551400400:38"/>
That <hi>Clandeſtine Negotiations</hi> are on Foot,
and thoſe that ſay ſo, fill the People with
Suſpicions, and Apprehenſions of ſuch Things
as I hope are not in any One's Head to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt.
<hi>A Treaty</hi> would effectually remove
all thoſe Jealouſies, and clear up the Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of both Parties.</p>
            <p>At a Treaty, all the Allies will be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
by their Plenipotentiaries, every Thing
will be fully, fairly and openly diſcuſs'd; if
any Member of the Confederates are eaſier,
and willinger to be impoſed upon than they
ought to be, they will be ſet to Rights in
Judgment, or over-rul'd in Vote by the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
if any Member of the Confederacy is
more rigid, or more backward, harder to
be ſatisfied with Reaſon, or forwarder to
continue the War than conſiſts with the
General Intereſt, he will be reduced to
Reaſon by the Perſwaſions, or over-rul'd
by the Voices of the other.</p>
            <p>The <hi>French</hi> are not ſo conſiderable an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy,
that we ſhould be afraid to Engage
with them any farther in the War; or ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable,
that we ſhould think it below
us <hi>to Treat;</hi> a Treaty takes off all Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
tho' they do not propoſe enough to
form <hi>a Good Peace,</hi> yet in a Treaty we may
bring them to it. I can ſee many Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
againſt their Propoſals indeed, but I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
ſee one againſt a Treaty.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:0551400400:39"/>
In a Treaty a Thouſand Things may
occur, and be ſaid, that may in the End
happily Iſſue this Great Affair in A GOOD
PEACE; as I ſaid in the beginning, I find
every one joining in their deſire to have <hi>a
good Peace,</hi> but how ſhall they obtain it
without a Treaty? A Treaty takes it out
of the Hands of thoſe you may ſuſpect, and
puts it into the Hands of the Confederates in
General; if any Conceſſions are made to
<hi>France,</hi> which you are afraid of, there they
will be diſcuſſed, there they will be examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
the Plenipotentiaries of the Allies on eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Side will be watchful, that the Diſtributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Dominions be not partial and une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
to one or to another; that every one
has Juſtice, and that no Advantage be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
more on one hand than another. The
Plenipotentiaries of all the Parties are Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trators
of every particular Intereſt reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively.</p>
            <p>Certainly
a Treaty would end all this
Strife; if the <hi>French</hi> are Sincere in their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers,
and in their Propoſals for a General
Peace, it will appear; if they are not,
they will be detected: The Securities they
will offer, will be here diſputed, the Vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity
of them determined; if they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected,
the Reaſons for rejecting them will
appear; and if we muſt carry on the War
again, the Neceſſity will appear; ſo that
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0551400400:40"/>
People will be ſatisfied with it, and the
more Chearfully bear the Expence. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
the Scandal of deſigning to perpetuate
the War will be removed, and every one
will ſee for themſelves, why the Treaty
broke off, and why the War is carryed on:
If a Peace enſues, it is not the leſs likely to
be A GOOD PEACE, for having the
whole Body of the Confederate Miniſters
conſenting to it, and coming into it.</p>
            <p>I cannot imagine upon what Foot any
one can pretend to be backward to a Treaty,
and I am the freer to put this Notion of
mine in here at this length, becauſe I
think it is the only Method to bring the
variety of Opinions now among us, to a
Point; to reconcile us to one another a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
and to eſtabliſh our private Peace, by
putting an end to the preſent Diſputes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
us; a Thing every good man wiſhes
for, and a Thing none can deny we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
want.</p>
            <p>I cannot but think thoſe People very
much miſtaken, both on one Side or other,
who oppoſe a Treaty; <hi>ſome ſay</hi> a Treaty
will be to no Purpoſe, and will but amuſe
us, and all <hi>Europe;</hi> that it is plain, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates
will inſiſt on the Surrendring all
the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Monarchy to the Houſe of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtria,</hi>
and that the <hi>French</hi> will not part with
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0551400400:41"/>
it, and therefore the War muſt go on, till
the <hi>French</hi> find themſelves in ſuch Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
as to be obliged to quit that ſweet
Morſel to ſave the reſt: That a Treaty
in the mean time is but amuſing us, and is
a particular Service to the King of <hi>France,</hi>
as it buoys up his People in hopes of a Peace,
and urges them to exert their utmoſt for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while
longer, upon a proſpect of a ſpeedy
Iſſue of all their Troubles. On the other
Hand, ſome ſay a Treaty is deſign'd only
to bring the Confederates into ſome Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
about the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Monarchy; and that
ſome appearing leſs tenacious on that Head
than others, will make them Jealous of one
another, divide them in Opinion; and
that the <hi>French</hi> have more Room in a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to lay hold of, and make Advantages
from thoſe Differences; and ſo a Treaty
may be a Means to deſtroy the good Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of the Confederates, rather than to
iſſue in <hi>a good Peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>As to the Firſt,</hi> It ſeems to have no ſtrength
of Reaſoning at all in it; 'tis begging the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,
to ſay the Confederates will inſiſt upon
the evacuating the whole <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
to the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria;</hi> it is evident,
as before the Confederates did appear en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd
at the laſt Treaty, to yield ſome
Point to <hi>France,</hi> and to allow King <hi>Philip</hi> to
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0551400400:42"/>
keep Poſſeſſion of ſome part of that Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy,
rather than continue the Deſolations
of <hi>Europe;</hi> and this, when there was a
diſtinct Branch of the Houſe of <hi>Austria</hi> to
poſſeſs the reſt; it ſeems probable they may
be enclin'd to make larger Conceſſions
now. The Conſideration of <hi>Europe</hi>'s Deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
being as ſtrong as before, and the
Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> having now but one
Head to receive the reſt; to which Head
there cannot be equal Reaſon for giving
the reſt, to what there was before; and
of which Head there may be ſo many juſt
Fears of the Danger of his poſſeſſing it—<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>The
Notion then of the Confederates be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
reſolved to inſiſt poſitively upon the
Evacuation of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Monarchy with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any Reſerve, is not well grounded,
and therefore not a juſt way of Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>As
to a Treaty being a Help to <hi>France,</hi> as
it buoys up the Spirits of his People; by ſo
much as he reaps an Advantage by that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary,
Imaginary Aid—by ſo much, if it
fails, will he ſuffer then in the Deſpair he will
find his People reduc'd to, when they ſhall
ſee thoſe Hopes vaniſh, and that their
Miſeries are like ſtill to be continued by
the Obſtinacy of their King, in hazarding
their Ruine, to preſerve not themſelves
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0551400400:43"/>
as <hi>France,</hi> but the Poſſeſſion of the whole
<hi>Spaniſh</hi> Monarchy, by which they can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
to receive little or no Benefit when it
is obtain'd, and will be expos'd to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
Deſolation in the Diſappointment.</p>
            <p>This Digreſſion brings me back to the
Notion of the Confederates upon ſuch a
Treaty, making Conceſſions to <hi>France</hi> of
ſome Part of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Monarchy—And
this the People who object, ſay, cannot
conſiſt with A GOOD PEACE.</p>
            <p>This Point muſt be clear'd up as we go,
and therefore I reſume it now; it is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
that as before, two Accidents make
the Circumſtances differ.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. That there was even at the laſt Treaty,
an apparent Willingneſs in the Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates,
to have made ſome Conceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
to King <hi>Philip,</hi> which neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
were thought to be conſiſtent with
A GOOD PEACE.</item>
               <item>2. That there is not now, as there then
was, a Branch of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi>
whom there was no Danger to <hi>Europe</hi>
in Eſtabliſhing on the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Throne,
and that therefore farther Conceſſions
perhaps may not only be found con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent
with, but may be eſſential to
A GOOD PEACE.</item>
            </list>
            <pb n="45" facs="tcp:0551400400:44"/>
            <p>It needs not that I ſhould embarraſs my
ſelf here with that enſnaring Party ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
Queſtion, What, and how much of
the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Monarchy may, and ſhould,
upon a Treaty, be given to the preſent Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſor.
But to keep to the Text, <hi>viz,</hi> The
Explanation of the General Term, <hi>A Good
Peace,</hi> I ſhall lay down ſome Heads, which
without Partiality or Reſpect to Parties in
the leaſt, but ſpeaking really, and <hi>bona fide,</hi>
with all poſſible Indifference, ſeem to me
to be natural Deductions from the preſent
State of Affairs in <hi>Europe;</hi> and by which, if
cooly conſider'd, we may come to underſtand
what is the true and genuine Meaning of
the thing we are upon, (<hi>viz.</hi>) what we
may call A GOOD PEACE.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. That if on a Treaty, <hi>France</hi> ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
entirely to evacuate the <hi>Spaniſh</hi>
Monarchy, and the Confederates
ſhould give up that Monarchy to the
Emperor, the Ballance of Power in
<hi>Europe</hi> would be entirely deſtroy'd,
and therefore ſuch a Concluſion could
not be allow'd to be A GOOD PEACE.</item>
               <item>2. That altho' ſome Part (<hi>God forbid I ſhould
ſay what part, I have nothing to do with
that</hi>) of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Monarchy ſhould
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0551400400:45"/>
be conceded to King <hi>Philip</hi> upon a
Treaty, yet ſuch Parts of it might be
alſo given to the Emperor, as might
be <hi>an equitable and reaſonable Satisfaction
to his Imperial Majeſty for his Pretenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to the</hi> Spaniſh <hi>Succeſſion,</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the very Words of the Treaty
of the Grand Alliance quoted before.</item>
               <item>3. That although ſome part of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi>
Succeſſion ſhould by a Treaty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
to King <hi>Philip</hi> V. yet ſuch fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Security MAY be given by the
King of <hi>France,</hi> and by King <hi>Philip</hi>
reſpectively, as may be ſufficient and
Satisfactory to the Queen of <hi>Great
Britain,</hi> and the States General, and
their Allies, for their Kingdoms and
Provinces, and for the Navigation and
Commerce of their Subjects.</item>
               <item>4. That ſuch Treaty as ſhall end in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
ſuch equitable and reaſonable
Satisfaction to the Empreror, and ſuch
Security to the reſt of the Allies,
may iſſue in a Firm, Laſting, Safe, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
and GOOD PEACE, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
ſome Part of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy
ſhould remain to the preſent
King <hi>Philip</hi> V.</item>
            </list>
            <pb n="47" facs="tcp:0551400400:46"/>
            <p>This, I think, may be allow'd, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to my Title, to be a full and plain
Expoſition of the Word A GOOD PEACE;
and may tell us all, what we are to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
by it. Nor may it be altogether
uſeleſs to us, in helping us to judge calmly
and coolly of the Steps that are, or ſhall be
taken towards it, either by Us, or by Our
Allies.</p>
            <p>By this we may determine, when theſe
are too forward, and yield too much to
<hi>France;</hi> or thoſe too backward or refracto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
as not to ſee when good Terms may
be obtain'd; both which will prevent the
mutual Reproaches which paſs now on
either Side, with ſo much ill Nature.</p>
            <p>I know we have ſome, who fill our Ears
with Clamours againſt our Enemies; and
anſwer all Arguments, with telling us,
that the King of <hi>France</hi> is ſincere in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing;
that he deſigns to keep no Treaty
any farther, or longer, than till he is in a
Condition to break it.—That he vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
deſign'd, from the beginning, to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nex
the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Monarchy to the Kingdom
of <hi>France,</hi> and does ſo ſtill; and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
of this, is, by their own Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
That we ſhould neither treat of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity,
or Evacuation, or any Thing
elſe; but that our only Safety conſiſts in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
the King of <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:0551400400:47"/>
To what we muſt reduce him, how,
and when it ſhall be done, and when we
ſhall be allow'd to have reduc'd him e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
they do not undertake to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine.
Indeed, theſe are Gentlemen I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
join with; and I doubt, it is ſuch as
theſe that give ſome People ſo much Ground
to ſay, That there are a Party; who are
for perpetuating the War.—I am as
willing to be Sanguine upon the War as
any Body; and if it were continued,
ſhould be as willing to be hopeful of Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs.—But
to ſay, that the King of
<hi>France</hi> cannot put us into ſuch a Caſe by
a Peace, as MAY effectually prevent him
ever annexing <hi>Spain</hi> to <hi>France,</hi> and that
this is his avow'd Deſign in this, and in
all Treaties, is ſuch a Confirmation of
what has been all along offer'd by others, <hi>viz.</hi>
that a few Years would make King <hi>Philip</hi>
as much a <hi>Spaniard</hi> and <hi>as much</hi> an Enemy to
<hi>France</hi> as any King of <hi>Spain</hi> before him, that
I wonder to hear Men of Senſe bring it for
an Argument; and a Man can hardly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frain
telling ſuch Men, that they are ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing
for our giving up <hi>Spain</hi> to King
<hi>Philip.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lewis</hi> XIV. has ſet up <hi>Philip</hi> Duke of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jou,</hi>
upon the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Throne, and has fought
hard to keep him in Poſſeſſion; in Gratitude
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0551400400:48"/>
and Duty to his Grand-father, I doubt not but
<hi>Philip</hi> V. would on all Occaſions do any thing
for his Grand-father that lay in his Power;
but if now after a Peace ſhould be made (ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing,
for Argument ſake, that Peace were to
give <hi>Spain</hi> to King <hi>Philip;</hi>) let us bring in the
King of <hi>France</hi> writing ſuch a Letter as this to
his Grandſon.</p>

Obey, reſign his Crown and Kingdom,
to the King of <hi>France,</hi> tho' he is his Grand-father,
or had been his immediate Father, or
were a thouſand times nearer, if that could
be?</p>
            <p>Would not King <hi>Philip</hi> rather write a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſive
Letter to him, acknowledging his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
in preferring him to ſo great a Dignity,
and his Kindneſs in maintaining him therein
unto a General Peace; profeſſing his Zeal
for his Majeſty's Intereſt, and his Readineſs
to hazard himſelf, and all his Kingdoms in his
Majeſties Service; But that he is now ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dear'd
to his Subjects, whoſe Fidelity has
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0551400400:49"/>
been ſo manifeſt, and they are ſo endear'd to
him that he is become the Father of his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and that he hopes his Grand-father will
not put him to ſuch an Extremity to quit
thoſe Kingdoms, and the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Nation, who
have ſpent ſo much Blood to keep him in Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion,
and ſo in ſhort Excuſe himſelf, <hi>that is,</hi>
make a Decent Refuſal.</p>
            <p>If upon this, the King of <hi>France,</hi> went about
to Invade him, Would he not ſay to him, that
his <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Subjects would by no means conſent
to his Abandoning them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that they
are reſoly'd to defend themſelves; and would
he not rather fight his Grand-father, after all
he has done for him, than quit his Poſſeſſion?
And I am ſure you will all ſay, he would be
in the right to do ſo—And what would be
the Conſequence of ſuch Fighting? but that
very King <hi>Philip</hi> joining with the Allies, and
ſeeking to them for help againſt <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if this would be ſo under his Grand-father,
let any Man tell us what it would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
be in half an Age after to his Elder
Brother, if he <hi>being King of France,</hi> ſhould
make ſuch a Demand? Would not he, <hi>Philip,</hi>
Laugh at him, and bid him do his worſt; and
in both Caſes, fly to the Confederates, <hi>viz.</hi>
to <hi>England, Holland,</hi> and to the <hi>Empire</hi> for help?</p>
            <p>This is ſo Natural and ſo unanſwerably Juſt
to ſuppoſe—That let theſe People but make
it out, that this is the King of <hi>France</hi>'s Deſign,
and that he is only making a Shew of King
<hi>Philip,</hi> but really reſolves to annex <hi>Spain</hi> to the
Kingdom of <hi>France;</hi> I ſay, let them but make
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0551400400:50"/>
this good; and they have brought on the
Stage the ſtrongeſt Reaſon that ever was yet
given, or ever will be, why all the <hi>Spaniſh</hi>
Monarchy ſhould be given to King <hi>Philip,</hi>
and I Challenge them to Anſwer it if they
can.</p>
            <p>Let any one but enſure the Confederates,
that the King of <hi>France</hi> will endeavour to
annex <hi>Spain</hi> to the Crown of <hi>France</hi> after a
Peace; I dare ſay, none of the Confederates
would ſcruple leaving King <hi>Philip</hi> upon that
Throne—But this is ſo wild a Notion, that
I think it Merits to have no more Notice
taken of it.</p>
            <p>Two things this Diſcourſe tends to: 1. To
remove that Notion, gotten among us, that
all is Loſt and Given up, if King <hi>Philip</hi>
is not entirely Depos'd and Un-king'd, and
the whole <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Monarchy taken out of his
Hands by the Confederates; a thing, I muſt
confeſs, however I acquieſce in the Opinion of
our Superiors, I never ſaw either Rational
to be ſo ſtrictly limited, or poſſible to be
brought to Practiſe; and a thing which thoſe
who adher'd to, yet tacitly own'd themſelves
wrong in, by keeping the Houſes, by ſhort
Adjournments, juſt at Hand, to alter as they ſaw
Occaſion. 2. To Allarm us, and that with great,
Reaſon too, to Conſider, Suppoſe we could take
it from King <hi>Philip;</hi> What the Danger of
giving it now to the ſame Perſon to whom
we would have given it before, will be; and
Laſtly, To Convince us all, how reaſonable
it is that the Powers of <hi>Europe</hi> ſhould in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0551400400:51"/>
Congreſs, Meet, Treat and Debate, of

thoſe Interfering Intereſts, ſome Happy Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium
may be found to Re-eſtabliſh the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility
of <hi>Europe</hi> in a GOOD PEACE.</p>
