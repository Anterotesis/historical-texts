            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>MY DEAR SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IF <hi>Adam Fitzadam</hi> preſumed to inſcribe a volume
of the WORLD to MR MOORE, I can ſee no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
why I, <hi>a Gentleman of Scotland,</hi> may not take much
the ſame liberty with MR BOSWELL.</p>
            <p>Do not imagine, Sir, becauſe this addreſs comes
in the form of a dedication, that I have been invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
the goddeſs of Flattery. Indeed I have no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
to pay your compliments: not that your diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment
is ſo nice as to reject them with indignation;
but becauſe it is my ſincere opinion that they would
do you harm. To entertain agreeable notions of one's
own character, is a great incentive to act with propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety
and ſpirit. But I ſhould be ſorry to contribute in
any degree, to your acquiring an exceſs of ſelf-ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency.</p>
            <p>To talk thus freely, is certainly a proof that I wiſh
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0296002100:3"/>
you well: and I make no doubt, Sir, but you conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
me as your very good friend; although ſome peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
—and thoſe too not deſtitute of wiſdom,—will
not ſcruple to inſinuate the contrary.</p>
            <p>Be that as it may, give me leave to thank you for
your particular kindneſs to me; and chiefly for the
profound reſpect with which you have always treated
me.</p>
            <p>I own indeed, that when I have boaſted of a glimpſe
of regard from the fineſt eyes, and moſt amiable heart
in the world; or, to diſplay my extenſive erudition,
have quoted Greek, Latin, and French ſentences, one
after another with aſtoniſhing celerity; or have got in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
my <hi>Old-hock humour,</hi> and fallen a-raving about prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and lords, knights and geniuſes, ladies of quality
and harpſichords;—you, with a peculiar comic ſmile,
have gently reminded me of the <hi>importance of a man to
himſelf,</hi> and ſlily left the room, with the witty DEAN
lying open at <gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

               <hi>P. P. clerk of this pariſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The following ODE which courts your acceptance,
is on a ſubject grave and ſolemn; and therefore may
be conſidered by many people, as not ſo well ſuited to
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0296002100:4"/>
your volatile diſpoſition. But I, Sir, who enjoy the
pleaſure of your intimate acquaintance, know that
many of your hours of retirement are devoted to
thought; and that you can as ſtrongly reliſh the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions
of a ſerious Muſe, as the moſt brilliant ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
of ſportive Fancy.</p>
            <p>As to my merit as a poet, I ſhall only ſay, that
while I am certain of YOUR approbation, I ſhall be
entirely ſatisfied: and if I can any how improve the
noble feelings of that honeſt open heart of yours, I ſhall
reckon myſelf infinitely happy.</p>
            <p>I muſt now bid you farewell, with an aſſurance,
that while you continue the man that you are, you
ſhall ever find me, with the greateſt ſincerity and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,</p>
