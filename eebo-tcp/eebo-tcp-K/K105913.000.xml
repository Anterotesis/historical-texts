            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>ADVERTISEMENT.</head>
            <p>FOR the eaſe and convenience of the Provincial Theatres, as well as to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify the Curioſity of the Reader, thoſe Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages and Songs, which were omitted in the Repreſentation, are put between inverted Commas. Scenes, which often are tedious in the Theatre, amuſe in the Cloſet; and it would, perhaps, be an experiment not much to the advantage of moſt Theatrical Productions, to reſtore, on any Stage, Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages which, without great Experience, it would be difficult to give a reaſon, why they ſhould not be reſtored.</p>
            <p>The Fable relates to Times ſo remote, that the taſk of ſupporting dialogue, in which Wit is neceſſary, and yet of not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending the manners of thoſe Times, is no eaſy one. Glory is often acquired in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion as impediments are overcome: Far be it, however, from the Author to inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate in what degree he is intitled to this kind of praiſe; that Deciſion reſts with the Public, and it cannot be in hands more equitable.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="ii" facs="tcp:0741300800:3"/>
Ambitious of deriving Fame from a ſource whence Fame has ſo often flowed, from Poetry, the Author has paid an attention to the Songs, which he hopes the Lovers of Poetry will approve. Should they really poſſeſs Excellence, it is ſtill to be expected it muſt oftcn remain unnoticed. The Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etical Beauties of the Songs in the Duenna are frequently overlooked, but they are not therefore the leſs beautiful. In ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances Poetry has here been obliged to give place to Situation and other Accidents, and pretends to no Charms.</p>
            <p>To Mr. Shield, the Author of the Muſic, every Praiſe, every Reſpect is due! The univerſal Admiration he has received on this, as well as on various former occaſions, muſt give Pleaſure to every ingenuous mind: For who can forbear being happy at the proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of a Man, whoſe Head and whoſe Heart are equally ſuperior? The NOBLE PEASANT owes much, very much of its ſucceſs to the Genius of the Muſician. The Airs not only poſſeſs Sweetneſs and Originality, but they are learned likewiſe; and, what is far to be preferred, they have Paſſion and Enthuſiaſm: The very Accompaniments are full of theſe ineſtimable Qualities. If Friendſhip be not more than partial, the firſt Song in the third Act is, in particular, in all its Parts, worthy of the greateſt Maſter Harmony ever in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired:
<pb n="iii" facs="tcp:0741300800:4"/>
and yet, to ſingle out this Song, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, is doing great injuſtice to the reſt. There is little danger, indeed, in declaring ſuch Opinions, for every one declares the ſame.</p>
            <p>To all thoſe whoſe Talents have contribut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the ſucceſs of this Opera, from the greateſt to the leaſt, the Author returns his Thanks. He forbears to recite Names, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe diſtinctions are difficult; and becauſe he cannot, without an appearance of ſeeking to flatter, mention them with all the Reſpect he wiſhes, ſhould he mention them at all.</p>
