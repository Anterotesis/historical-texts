            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                        <p>When the≈øe birds find no food in the cities, they are driven by hunger among the cattle of the neighboring pa≈øtures.

The poor animal attempts in vain to free it≈øelf from the devourers, rolling on the ground with hideous cries: but in vain; for the Vultures never quit hold, till they have effected its de≈øtruction.

Here ≈øeems to have been no training of the≈øe <hi>Thracian</hi> Hawks, but a mere ca≈øual concurrence of Hawks and ≈ømall birds, which afforded now and then an amu≈øement to the youth of the country. The thought expre≈ø≈øed on the antient gem, of little <hi>Genii</hi> engaged in the chace of Deer, a≈ø≈øi≈øted by an Eagle, may have originated from this ≈øtory.</p>
                        <p>The Poet only de≈øcribes another kind of bird-catching, in the following epigram on the fate of a Hawk:
<q>
                              <l>Praedo fuit volucrum, famulus nunc Aucupis, idem</l>

                           </q>
By the word <hi>decipit,</hi> it is plain that the Hawk was not trained; but was merely u≈øed as a ≈øtale, either to entice ≈ømall birds under a net, or to the limed twigs: the la≈øt is a method ≈øtill in u≈øe in <hi>Italy.</hi> The <hi>Italians</hi> call it <hi>Uccellare con la Civetta;</hi> for in≈øtead of a Hawk, they place a ≈ømall ≈øpecies of Owl on a pole, in the middle of a field; and ≈øurround it, at various di≈øtances, with lime-twigs.

                           <q>He is (≈øays Mr. <hi>Bartram</hi>) a fine bird when his gaiety is di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played; that is, when he ≈øpreads his tail like that of a Turkey-cock, and erects a circle of feathers round his neck like a ruff, walking very ≈øtately with an even pace, and making a noi≈øe ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like a Turkey; at which time the hunter mu≈øt fire immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately at him, or he flies away directly two or three hundred yards, before he ≈øettles on the ground. There is ≈øomething very remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in what we call their thumping; which they do with their wings, by clapping them again≈øt their ≈øides, as the hunters ≈øay. They ≈øtand upon an old fallen tree, that has lain many years on the ground, where they begin their ≈øtrokes gradually, at about two ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conds of time di≈øtant from one another, and repeat them quicker and quicker, until they make a noi≈øe like thunder at a di≈øtance; which continues, from the beginning, about a minute; then cea≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for about ≈øix or eight minutes before it begins again. The ≈øound is heard near half a mile, by which means they are di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered by the hunters, and many of them killed. I have ≈øhot many of them in this po≈øition; but never ≈øaw them thump, they mo≈øtly ≈øeeing me fir≈øt, and ≈øo left off. They commonly exerci≈øe in thumping ≈øpring and fall, at about nine or ten in the morning,
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:0591400102:123"/>
and four or five in the afternoon. Their food is chiefly ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and ≈øeeds of the country: their fle≈øh is white, and choice food. I believe they breed but once a year, in the ≈øpring, and hatch twelve or fourteen at a brood; which keep in a company till the following ≈øpring. Many have attempted to rai≈øe the young ones, and to tame them; but to no purpo≈øe. When hatched under a hen, they e≈øcape into the woods ≈øoon after they are hatched, where they either find means to ≈øub≈øi≈øt, or peri≈øh.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>The hi≈øtory of this bird is thus further illu≈øtrated by Mr. <hi>Brooke</hi> of <hi>Maryland,</hi> in <hi>North America:</hi> 
                           <q>The ruffed Grous, or Phea≈øant,<note place="margin">MR. BROOKE.</note> breeds in all parts of <hi>Maryland,</hi> ≈øome countries on the Ea≈øtern ≈øhore excepted. They lay their eggs in ne≈øts they make in the leaves, either by the ≈øide of fallen trees, or the roots of ≈øtanding ones. They lay from twelve to ≈øixteen eggs: the time of incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation is in the ≈øpring; but how long their eggs are hatching I cannot ≈øay; but probably it is three weeks, the time that a Dunghill Hen ≈øits. I have found their ne≈øts when a boy, and have endeavoured to take the old Phea≈øant, but never could ≈øucceed: ≈øhe would almo≈øt let me put my hand upon her before ≈øhe would quit her ne≈øt; then by artifice ≈øhe would draw me off from her eggs, by fluttering ju≈øt before me for a hundred paces or more; ≈øo that I have been in con≈øtant hopes of taking her. They leave their ne≈øts as ≈øoon as they are hatched; and I believe they live at fir≈øt on ants, ≈ømall worms, &amp;c. When they are a few days old, they hide them≈øelves ≈øo artfully among the leaves, that it is dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to find them: as they grow up, they feed on various berries, fruits, and grain of the country: grapes they likewi≈øe are fond of in the ≈øea≈øon; but the Phea≈øant is more particularly fond of the ivy-berry. I do not know any other animal that feeds on this berry: I know it is poi≈øon to many. Though the Phea≈øant hatches many young at a time, and often ≈øits twice a year, the great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and variety of Hawks in <hi>Maryland</hi> feeding on them, prevents their increa≈øing fa≈øt. The beating of the Phea≈øant, as we term it, is a noi≈øe chiefly made in the ≈øpring of the year by the cock-bird;
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:0591400102:124"/>
it may be di≈øtinctly heard a mile in a calm day: they ≈øwell their brea≈øts like the Powting Pigeon, and heat with their wings, which make a noi≈øe not unlike a drum in ≈øound; but the Phea≈øant ≈øhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens each ≈øounding note, till they run one into another undi≈øtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gui≈øhably, like ≈øtriking two empty bottles together.</q>

By this noi≈øe we were directed to the place where the unfortunate More-hen ≈øat, and found them upon rotten mo≈ø≈øy trees. By flapping one wing again≈øt the other they mean to call their mates; and the humming noi≈øe that en≈øues thereupon may be heard half a quarter of a league. This they do in the months of <hi>April, May, September,</hi> and <hi>October;</hi> and, which is very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, the More-hen never flaps in this manner but upon one tree. It begins at break of day, and gives over at nine o'clock in the morning, till about an hour before ≈øun-≈øet, then it flutters again, and continues ≈øo to do till night.</q>

                        <p>During winter, there is at pre≈øent a very ≈øingular way of taking the BLACK GROUS in <hi>Sibiria.</hi> In the open fore≈øts of birch, a certain number of poles are placed horizontally on forked ≈øticks: by way of allurement, ≈ømall bundles of corn are placed on them; and not remote, are ≈øet certain tall ba≈økets of a conic ≈øhape, with the broade≈øt part uppermo≈øt: within the mouth is placed a ≈ømall wheel, through which pa≈ø≈øes an axis fixed ≈øo nicely as to admit it to play very readily, and permit one ≈øide or the other, on the lea≈øt touch, to drop down, and again recover its ≈øituation. The BLACK GROUS are ≈øoon attracted by the corn on the horizontal poles; fir≈øt alight on them, and after a ≈øhort repa≈øt fly to the ba≈økets, attempt to ≈øettle on their tops, when the wheel drops ≈øideways, and they fall headlong into the trap, which is ≈øometimes found half full.</p>

                                 <q>this as remarkable a bird as any in <hi>America.</hi> They are in va≈øt numbers in all parts, and have been of great ≈øervice at particular times to our garri≈øons, in ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying them with fre≈øh meat, e≈øpecially at the out-po≈øts. A friend told me, that in the year in which <hi>Quebec</hi> was taken, the whole army was ≈øupplied with them, if they cho≈øe it. The way was this: every man took his club (for they were forbid to u≈øe their firelocks) when they <hi>flew,</hi> as it was termed, in ≈øuch quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities, that each per≈øon could kill as many as he wanted. They in general begin to fly ≈øoon after day-break, and continue till nine or ten o'clock; and again about three in the afternoon, and continue till five or ≈øix: but what is very remarkable, they always fly we≈øterly. The times of flying here are in the ≈øpring, about the latter end of <hi>February</hi> or the beginning of <hi>March,</hi> and continue every day for eight or ten days; and again in the fall, when they begin the latter end of <hi>July</hi> or the beginning of <hi>Augu≈øt.</hi> They catch va≈øt quantities of them in clap-nets, with ≈øtale pigeons. I have ≈øeen them brought to this market by ≈øacks-full. People in general are very fond of them; and I have heard many ≈øay they think them as good as our common Blue Pigeon; but I cannot agree with them by any means. They ta≈øte more like our Quee≈øt, or Wild Pigeon; but are better meat. They have another way of killing them‚ÄîThey make a hut of boughs of trees, and ≈øix ≈øtale Pigeons on the ground at a ≈ømall di≈øtance from the hut. They plant poles for the Wild Pigeons to light on when they come a <hi>≈øalting</hi> (as they term it) which they do every morning in the ≈øea≈øon, repairing to the mar≈øhes near the ≈øea-≈øide; then the per≈øons in the hut pull the ≈øtale Pigeon, when the birds will alight in va≈øt numbers on the poles, and great multitudes are ≈øhot. Sir <hi>William John≈øon</hi> told me, that he killed at one ≈øhot with a blunderbu≈øs, a hundred and twenty or thirty.
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:0591400102:146"/>
Some years pa≈øt they have not been in ≈øuch plenty as they u≈øed to be. This ≈øpring I ≈øaw them fly one morning, as I thought in great abundance; but every body was amazed how few there were; and wondered at the rea≈øon.</q>

                                 <q>I mu≈øt remark one very ≈øingular fact: that, notwith≈øtanding the whole people of a town go out a <hi>pigeoning,</hi> as they call it, they will not on ≈øome days kill a ≈øingle hen bird; and on the very next day, not a ≈øingle cock (and yet both ≈øexes always fly we≈øterly); and when this is the ca≈øe, the people are always a≈ø≈øured that there will be great plenty of them that ≈øea≈øon.

                        <p>They may be ≈øaid not only to ≈øing, but dance: for, as if excited by a ≈øort of exta≈øy at their own admirable notes, they gradually rai≈øe them≈øelves from the place where they ≈øtand, with their wings ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, drop with their head down to the ≈øame ≈øpot, and whirl round with di≈øtended wings, accompanying their melody with variety of pretty ge≈øticulations<note n="¬ß" place="bottom">Cate≈øby.</note>.

The ≈øwans will run as fa≈øt as a tolerable hor≈øe. The greater numbers are taken by the dogs, which are taught to catch them by the neck, which cau≈øes them to lo≈øe their balance, and become an ea≈øy prey. Great u≈øe is made of the plumage: the fle≈øh is eaten; and the ≈økin of the legs and feet, taken off entire, looks like ≈øhagreen, and is u≈øed for pur≈øes.

                              </note>. This ≈øpecies has ≈øeveral di≈øtinctions from the ≈øpecies which we,<note place="margin">SPECIFIC DIS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TINCTIONS.</note> in <hi>England,</hi> call the Tame Swan. In <hi>Ru≈ø≈øia</hi> this ≈øpecies more fitly clames the name, it being the kind mo≈øt commonly tamed in that empire. The Whi≈øtling Swan carries its neck quite erect: the other ≈øwims with it arched. This is far inferior in ≈øize. This has twelve ribs on a ≈øide; the MUTE <note n="‚Ä°" place="bottom">We change the name of the Tame Swan into MUTE, as the former name is equivocal, and this ≈øpecies emits-no ≈øound.</note> only eleven. But the mo≈øt remarkable is the ≈øtrange figure of the windpipe, which falls into the che≈øt, then turns back like a trumpet, and afterwards makes a ≈øecond bend to join the lungs. Thus it is enabled to utter a loud and ≈øhrill note. The other <hi>Swan,</hi> on the contrary, is the mo≈øt ≈øilent of birds; it can do nothing more than hi≈øs, which it does on receiving any provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The vocal kind emits its loud notes only when flying, or
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:0591400102:370"/>
calling: its ≈øound is, <hi>whoogh, whoogh,</hi> very loud and ≈øhrill, but not di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable, when heard far above one's head, and modulated by the winds. The natives of <hi>Iceland</hi> compare it to the notes of a violin: in fact they hear it at the end of their long and gloomy winter, when the return of the Swans announces the return of ≈øummer: every note mu≈øt be therefore melodious which pre≈øages the ≈øpeedy thaw, and the relea≈øe from their tedious confinement.</p>
                           <p>It is from this ≈øpecies alone that the antients have given the fable of the Swan being endued with the powers of melody:<note place="margin">VOCAL SWAN OF THE POETS.</note> embracing the <hi>Pythagorean</hi> doctrine, they made the body of this bird the man≈øion of the ≈øouls of departed poets: and after that, attributed to the birds the ≈øame faculty of harmony which their inmates po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed in a pre-exi≈øtent ≈øtate. The vulgar, not di≈øtingui≈øhing between ≈øweetne≈øs of numbers and melody of voice, thought that real which was only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended figuratively.

                           <p>HAVING gone through the cla≈øs of birds, let me remark, that there is the greate≈øt probability, that numbers of tho≈øe of <hi>Kamt≈øchatka</hi> are common to <hi>North America;</hi> and that they pa≈øs there the ≈øea≈øons of migration; but not having actual proof of their being found on the new continent, I am obliged to place them in the≈øe appendages to each genus.
