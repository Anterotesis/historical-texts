            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

which are moſt offenſively fetid. Towards morning they take flight, ſoaring at a vaſt height, with the gentle motion of a kite; expecting notice of their banquet by the tainted effluvia of carrion, excrements, or any filth. They have moſt ſagacious noſtrils, and ſmell their prey at a vaſt diſtance; to which they reſort from all quarters, wheeling about, and making a gradual deſcent till they reach the ground. They do not confine themſelves to dead animals, but feed on Snakes, and ſometimes on Lambs. They are very tame, and, while they are at their meals, will ſuffer a very near approach.</p>
                        <p>In the torrid zone, particularly about <hi>Carthagena,</hi> they haunt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited places, and are ſeen in numbers ſitting on the roofs of the houſes, or walking along the ſtreets with a ſluggiſh pace. In thoſe parts they are uſeful, as the IBIS in <hi>Egypt,</hi> devouring the noiſome ſubjects, which would otherwiſe, by the intolerable ſtench, render the climate ſtill more unwholeſome than it is.</p>
                        <p>When theſe birds find no food in the cities, they are driven by hunger among the cattle of the neighboring paſtures. If they ſee a beaſt with a ſore on the back, they inſtantly alight on it, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack the part affected. The poor animal attempts in vain to free itſelf from the devourers, rolling on the ground with hideous cries: but in vain; for the Vultures never quit hold, till they have effected its deſtruction. Sometimes an Eagle preſides at the banquet, and keeps theſe cowardly birds at a diſtance, until it has finiſhed its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſt.</p>

That the ſpot was much frequented by Hawks, which were wont to appear on hearing themſelves called: and would drive the little birds into the buſhes, where they were caught by the children; and that the Hawks would even ſometimes take the birds and fling them to theſe young ſportſmen; who (after finiſhing their diverſion) gratefully beſtowed on their aſſiſtants part of their prey.</q> This tale may have ſome truth at the bottom;
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:0591400102:36"/>
it being notorious that Larks, and even Partridges, will, by the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of a Hawk paſſing over them, lie ſo ſtill as to ſuffer themſelves to be taken by any paſſenger. Here ſeems to have been no training of theſe <hi>Thracian</hi> Hawks, but a mere caſual concurrence of Hawks and ſmall birds, which afforded now and then an amuſement to the youth of the country. The thought expreſſed on the antient gem, of little <hi>Genii</hi> engaged in the chace of Deer, aſſiſted by an Eagle, may have originated from this ſtory.</p>
                        <p>The Poet only deſcribes another kind of bird-catching, in the following epigram on the fate of a Hawk:
<q>

                           </q>
By the word <hi>decipit,</hi> it is plain that the Hawk was not trained; but was merely uſed as a ſtale, either to entice ſmall birds under a net, or to the limed twigs: the laſt is a method ſtill in uſe in <hi>Italy.</hi> The <hi>Italians</hi> call it <hi>Uccellare con la Civetta;</hi> for inſtead of a Hawk, they place a ſmall ſpecies of Owl on a pole, in the middle of a field; and ſurround it, at various diſtances, with lime-twigs.

They are ſeen in flocks innumerable, obſcuring at times the very ſky with their multitudes. They were eſteemed the peſt of the colonies, making moſt dreadful havock among the maize and other grain, both when new ſown, and when ripe. They are very bold, and not to be terrified with a gun; for, notwithſtanding the ſportſman makes ſlaughter in a flock, the remainder will take a ſhort flight, and ſettle again in the ſame field. The farmers ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times attempt their deſtruction, by ſteeping the maize in a decoction
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:0591400102:74"/>
of white hellebore before they plant it. The birds which eat this prepared corn are ſeized with a vertigo, and fall down; which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times drives the reſt away.

After the breeding-ſeaſon, they return with their young from their moſt diſtant quarters, in flights continuing for miles in length, blackening the very ſky, in order to make their depredations on the ripening maize.

They were not the <hi>Europeans</hi> alone, who were ſtruck with its great beauty; the natives of <hi>America,</hi> to whom it was ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar, were affected with its gemmeous appearance, and beſtowed on it titles expreſſive of its reſplendent colors. Some nations called it <hi>Ouriſſia,</hi> and <hi>Guaracyaba,</hi> or the Sun-beam; others, <hi>Guanaeygaba,</hi> or Hairs of the Sun; others again named it <hi>Huitzitzil,</hi> or <hi>Vicililin,</hi>

or the <hi>Regenerated;</hi> becauſe they believed it died annually, and was re-animated at the return of the flowers it fed on: that it ſtuck its bill into the trunk of a tree, and remained lifeleſs for ſix months; when the vital powers re-migrated, and reſtored to nature one of its moſt brilliant wonders.</p>
                        <p>It flies with a ſwiftneſs which the eye is incapable of following.<note place="margin">SWIFTNESS.</note> The motion of the wings is ſo rapid as to be imperceptible to the niceſt obſerver. Lightning is ſcarcely more tranſient than its flight, nor the glare more bright than its colors.<note place="margin">FOOD.</note> It never feeds but upon wing, ſuſpended over the flower it extracts nouriſhment from; for its only food is the honied juice lodged in the nectarium, which it ſucks through the tubes of its curious tongue. Like the Bee, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing exhauſted the honey of one flower, it wanders to the next, in ſearch of new ſweets. It admires moſt thoſe flowers which have the deepeſt tubes. Thus the female <hi>Balſamine,</hi> and the Scarlet <hi>Monarda,</hi> are particular favorites. Whoſoever ſets thoſe plants before the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow is ſure to be viſited by multitudes of theſe diminutive birds. It is a moſt entertaining ſight to ſee them ſwarming around the flowers, and trying every tube of verticillated plants, by putting their bills into every one which encircles the ſtalk. If they find that their brethren have been beforehand, and robbed the flower of the honey, they will, in rage, pluck off, and throw it on the ground.</p>
                        <p>The moſt violent paſſions animate at times their little bodies.<note place="margin">RAGE.</note> They have often dreadful conteſts, when numbers happen to diſpute poſſeſſion of the ſame flower. They will tilt againſt one another with ſuch fury, as if they meant to transfix their antagoniſts with their long bills. During the fight; they frequently purſue the conquered into the apartments of thoſe houſes whoſe windows are left open, take a turn round the room, as Flies do in <hi>England,</hi> and then ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly regain the open air. They are fearleſs of mankind; and in feeding will ſuffer people to come within two yards of them; but on a nearer approach, dart away with admirable ſwiftneſs.</p>

As ſoon as the laſt appears, the Honeyſucker flies up like lightning, beds itſelf beneath the Raven's wing, and, piercing him with his needle-like bill, till the bird is heard to croak with agony, at length tumbles to the ground dead, either from the fall or the wound.

and contrary to the general rule of nature; which makes, in all other inſtances, the ſmalleſt and moſt defenceleſs birds the moſt prolific. The reaſons of the exception in this caſe are double. The ſmallneſs of their bodies cauſes them commonly to eſcape the eyes of birds of prey; or if ſeen, their rapid flight eludes purſuit: ſo that the ſpecies is preſerved as fully as if they had been the moſt nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous breeders.</p>

In order to compoſe pictures, the <hi>Indians</hi> draw off the feathers with ſmall pincers, and with fine paſte moſt artfully join them together. They diſpoſe them with ſuch ſkill, as to give the true lights and ſhade to the performance, and imitate nature with the greateſt fidelity.

They will perſiſt in laying for a great while. They retire to ſome obſcure place to ſit, the cock, through rage at loſs of its mate, being very apt to break the eggs. The females are very affectionate to the young, and make great moan on the loſs of them.

                           <q>He is (ſays Mr. <hi>Bartram</hi>) a fine bird when his gaiety is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played; that is, when he ſpreads his tail like that of a Turkey-cock, and erects a circle of feathers round his neck like a ruff, walking very ſtately with an even pace, and making a noiſe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like a Turkey; at which time the hunter muſt fire immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately at him, or he flies away directly two or three hundred yards, before he ſettles on the ground. There is ſomething very remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in what we call their thumping; which they do with their wings, by clapping them againſt their ſides, as the hunters ſay. They ſtand upon an old fallen tree, that has lain many years on the ground, where they begin their ſtrokes gradually, at about two ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conds of time diſtant from one another, and repeat them quicker and quicker, until they make a noiſe like thunder at a diſtance; which continues, from the beginning, about a minute; then ceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for about ſix or eight minutes before it begins again. The ſound is heard near half a mile, by which means they are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered by the hunters, and many of them killed. I have ſhot many of them in this poſition; but never ſaw them thump, they moſtly ſeeing me firſt, and ſo left off. They commonly exerciſe in thumping ſpring and fall, at about nine or ten in the morning,
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:0591400102:123"/>
and four or five in the afternoon. Their food is chiefly ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and ſeeds of the country: their fleſh is white, and choice food. I believe they breed but once a year, in the ſpring, and hatch twelve or fourteen at a brood; which keep in a company till the following ſpring. Many have attempted to raiſe the young ones, and to tame them; but to no purpoſe. When hatched under a hen, they eſcape into the woods ſoon after they are hatched, where they either find means to ſubſiſt, or periſh.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>The hiſtory of this bird is thus further illuſtrated by Mr. <hi>Brooke</hi> of <hi>Maryland,</hi> in <hi>North America:</hi> 
                           <q>The ruffed Grous, or Pheaſant,<note place="margin">MR. BROOKE.</note> breeds in all parts of <hi>Maryland,</hi> ſome countries on the Eaſtern ſhore excepted. They lay their eggs in neſts they make in the leaves, either by the ſide of fallen trees, or the roots of ſtanding ones. They lay from twelve to ſixteen eggs: the time of incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation is in the ſpring; but how long their eggs are hatching I cannot ſay; but probably it is three weeks, the time that a Dunghill Hen ſits. I have found their neſts when a boy, and have endeavoured to take the old Pheaſant, but never could ſucceed: ſhe would almoſt let me put my hand upon her before ſhe would quit her neſt; then by artifice ſhe would draw me off from her eggs, by fluttering juſt before me for a hundred paces or more; ſo that I have been in conſtant hopes of taking her. They leave their neſts as ſoon as they are hatched; and I believe they live at firſt on ants, ſmall worms, &amp;c. When they are a few days old, they hide themſelves ſo artfully among the leaves, that it is dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to find them: as they grow up, they feed on various berries, fruits, and grain of the country: grapes they likewiſe are fond of in the ſeaſon; but the Pheaſant is more particularly fond of the ivy-berry. I do not know any other animal that feeds on this berry: I know it is poiſon to many. Though the Pheaſant hatches many young at a time, and often ſits twice a year, the great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and variety of Hawks in <hi>Maryland</hi> feeding on them, prevents their increaſing faſt. The beating of the Pheaſant, as we term it, is a noiſe chiefly made in the ſpring of the year by the cock-bird;
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:0591400102:124"/>
it may be diſtinctly heard a mile in a calm day: they ſwell their breaſts like the Powting Pigeon, and heat with their wings, which make a noiſe not unlike a drum in ſound; but the Pheaſant ſhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens each ſounding note, till they run one into another undiſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhably, like ſtriking two empty bottles together.</q>

                           <note place="margin">LA HONTAN.</note>In order to perfect, as far as I am able, the hiſtory of this bird, I ſhall give a quotation from Baron <hi>La Hontan's Voyages to North America,</hi> publiſhed in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> (vol. i. p. 67.) where he ſpeaks of a bird found near the lakes of <hi>Canada,</hi> which, I think, can be no other than the above-deſcribed, though the names given them diſagree.</p>

                           <hi>La Hontan</hi> ſays, <q>I went in company with ſome <hi>Canadeſe</hi> on purpoſe to ſee that fowl flap with its wings: believe me, this ſight is one of the greateſt curioſities in the world; for their flapping makes a noiſe much like a drum, for about the ſpace of a minute; then the noiſe ceaſes for half a quarter of an hour; after which it begins again. By this noiſe we were directed to the place where the unfortunate More-hen ſat, and found them upon rotten moſſy trees. By flapping one wing againſt the other they mean to call their mates; and the humming noiſe that enſues thereupon may be heard half a quarter of a league. This they do in the months of <hi>April, May, September,</hi> and <hi>October;</hi> and, which is very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, the More-hen never flaps in this manner but upon one tree. It begins at break of day, and gives over at nine o'clock in the morning, till about an hour before ſun-ſet, then it flutters again, and continues ſo to do till night.</q>

                        <p>The leſſer variety is not unknown in <hi>America.</hi> The ſort here deſcribed is found in amazing quantities, eſpecially about <hi>Hudſon's Bay,</hi> where they breed in all parts along the coaſts, make their neſts on dry ridges on the ground, and lay from nine to eleven eggs, powdered with black.</p>
                        <p>This is the only ſpecies of Grous in <hi>N. America</hi> to which Providence hath given that warm protection to its feet, evidently to ſecure them againſt the cold of their winter lodgings: and, as they are greatly ſought after by Eagles, Owls, and other birds of prey, a fine proviſion is made for their ſafety, by the change of color, which renders them not to be diſtinguiſhed from the ſnow they lie on.</p>
                        <p>Every morning they take a flight into the air directly upwards, to ſhake the ſnow from their wings and bodies. They feed in the mornings and evenings, and in the middle of the day baſk in the ſun. In the morning they call to one another with a loud note, interrupted; feeding in the intervals, and calling again.</p>
                        <p>In the beginning of <hi>October,</hi> they aſſemble in flocks of two hundred, and live much among the willows, the tops of which they eat; whence they are called <hi>Willow Partridges.</hi> About the beginning of <hi>December</hi> they appear in leſs plenty, retiring from the flats about the ſettlements on <hi>Hudſon's Bay</hi> to the mountains, where in that month the ſnow is leſs deep than in the lowlands, to feed on cranberries and other berries<note n="‡" place="bottom">Drage's Voy. <hi>i. 174.</hi>

Sometimes the hunters, when they ſee the birds likely to take a long flight, imitate the crying of a Hawk, which intimidates them ſo much, that they inſtantly ſettle. When the female is killed, the male can ſcarcely be forced from the body of its mate<note n="*" place="bottom">Faun. Groenl. <hi>p. 117.</hi>

                        <p>The uſual method of taking them is in nets made of twine, twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty feet ſquare, faſtened to four poles, and ſupported in front in a perpendicular direction with ſticks. A long line is faſtened to theſe props, the end of which is held by a perſon who lies concealed at a diſtance. Several people are then employed to drive the birds within reach of the net, which is then pulled down, and often covers at one haul fifty or ſeventy. At this time they are ſo plentiful, that ten thouſand are taken for the uſe of the ſettlement from <hi>November</hi> to the end of <hi>April.</hi> In former days, they muſt have been infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly more numerous; for Sir <hi>Thomas Button</hi> relates, that when he wintered there in 1612, he took eighteen hundred dozens of theſe and other fowl<note n="†" place="bottom">Quoted in <hi>North-weſt Fox,</hi> 228.</note>: but this is a trifle to the ſucceſs of M. <hi>Jeremie,</hi> who aſſerts, that there were eaten in one winter, between himſelf and ſeventy-nine others, ninety thouſand Grous, and twenty-five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Rabbets<note n="‡" place="bottom">Recucil de Voy. au Nord. iii. 344.</note>.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Laplanders</hi> take them by forming a hedge with the boughs of birch-trees; leaving ſmall openings at certain intervals, and hang in each a ſnare. The birds are tempted to come and feed on the buds or catkins of the birch; and whenever they endeavour to paſs through the openings they are inſtantly caught.</p>

                                 <q>I think,</q> ſays Mr. <hi>Blackburne,</hi> 
                                 <q>this as remarkable a bird as any in <hi>America.</hi> They are in vaſt numbers in all parts, and have been of great ſervice at particular times to our garriſons, in ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying them with freſh meat, eſpecially at the out-poſts. A friend told me, that in the year in which <hi>Quebec</hi> was taken, the whole army was ſupplied with them, if they choſe it. The way was this: every man took his club (for they were forbid to uſe their firelocks) when they <hi>flew,</hi> as it was termed, in ſuch quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities, that each perſon could kill as many as he wanted. They in general begin to fly ſoon after day-break, and continue till nine or ten o'clock; and again about three in the afternoon, and continue till five or ſix: but what is very remarkable, they always fly weſterly. The times of flying here are in the ſpring, about the latter end of <hi>February</hi> or the beginning of <hi>March,</hi> and continue every day for eight or ten days; and again in the fall, when they begin the latter end of <hi>July</hi> or the beginning of <hi>Auguſt.</hi> They catch vaſt quantities of them in clap-nets, with ſtale pigeons. I have ſeen them brought to this market by ſacks-full. People in general are very fond of them; and I have heard many ſay they think them as good as our common Blue Pigeon; but I cannot agree with them by any means. They taſte more like our Queeſt, or Wild Pigeon; but are better meat. They have another way of killing them—They make a hut of boughs of trees, and ſix ſtale Pigeons on the ground at a ſmall diſtance from the hut. They plant poles for the Wild Pigeons to light on when they come a <hi>ſalting</hi> (as they term it) which they do every morning in the ſeaſon, repairing to the marſhes near the ſea-ſide; then the perſons in the hut pull the ſtale Pigeon, when the birds will alight in vaſt numbers on the poles, and great multitudes are ſhot. Sir <hi>William Johnſon</hi> told me, that he killed at one ſhot with a blunderbuſs, a hundred and twenty or thirty.
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:0591400102:146"/>
Some years paſt they have not been in ſuch plenty as they uſed to be. This ſpring I ſaw them fly one morning, as I thought in great abundance; but every body was amazed how few there were; and wondered at the reaſon.</q>

                                 <q>I muſt remark one very ſingular fact: that, notwithſtanding the whole people of a town go out a <hi>pigeoning,</hi> as they call it, they will not on ſome days kill a ſingle hen bird; and on the very next day, not a ſingle cock (and yet both ſexes always fly weſterly); and when this is the caſe, the people are always aſſured that there will be great plenty of them that ſeaſon. I have been at <hi>Niagara</hi> when the centinel has given the word that the Pigeons were <hi>flying;</hi> and the whole garriſon were ready to run over one another, ſo eager were they to get freſh meat.</q>

                        <p>It is very ſingular, that, among the myriads which pay their autumnal viſit, there never is found a ſingle cock-bird.

                           <note place="margin">PLACE.</note>This ſpecies appears in <hi>New York</hi> in <hi>April:</hi> lays five white eggs, ſpotted with ruſt-color: builds in low buſhes: makes its neſt with wool, and ſome moſs, and lines it with ſmall fibres of roots: leaves the country in <hi>Auguſt:</hi> obſerves the ſame time of migration in the ſouthern provinces. Mr. <hi>Cateſby</hi> gives ſo very good an account of its manners, and ſingular ſpirit, that I beg leave to expreſs it in his own words:—<q>The courage of this little bird is ſingular. He purſues and puts to flight all kinds of birds that come near his ſtation, from the ſmalleſt to the largeſt, none eſcaping his fury; nor did I ever ſee any that dared to oppoſe him while flying, for he does not offer to attack them when ſitting. I have ſeen one of them fix on the back of an Eagle, and perſecute him ſo, that he has turned on his back into various poſtures in the air, in order to get rid of him; and at laſt was forced to alight on the top of the next tree, from whence he dared not to move, till the little Tyrant was tired, or thought fit to leave him. This is the conſtant practice of the cock, while the hen is brooding: he ſits on the top of a buſh, or ſmall tree, not far from her neſt; near which, if any ſmall birds approach, he drives them away; but the great ones, as Crows, Hawks, and Eagles, he won't ſuffer to come within a quarter of a mile of him without attacking them.

                              <note place="margin">HOW TAKEN IN ICELAND.</note>In <hi>Iceland</hi> they are an object of chace. In <hi>Auguſt</hi> they loſe their feathers to ſuch a degree as not to be able to fly. The natives, at that ſeaſon, reſort in great numbers to the places where they moſt abound; and come provided with dogs, and active and ſtrong horſes, trained to the ſport, and capable of paſſing nimbly over the boggy ſoil and marſhes. The ſwans will run as faſt as a tolerable horſe. The greater numbers are taken by the dogs, which are taught to catch them by the neck, which cauſes them to loſe their balance, and become an eaſy prey. Great uſe is made of the plumage: the fleſh is eaten; and the ſkin of the legs and feet, taken off entire, looks like ſhagreen, and is uſed for purſes. The eggs are collected in the ſpring for food<note n="*" place="bottom">Olaffen, <hi>i. 118.</hi>

                              </note>. This ſpecies has ſeveral diſtinctions from the ſpecies which we,<note place="margin">SPECIFIC DIS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TINCTIONS.</note> in <hi>England,</hi> call the Tame Swan. In <hi>Ruſſia</hi> this ſpecies more fitly clames the name, it being the kind moſt commonly tamed in that empire. The Whiſtling Swan carries its neck quite erect: the other ſwims with it arched. This is far inferior in ſize. This has twelve ribs on a ſide; the MUTE <note n="‡" place="bottom">We change the name of the Tame Swan into MUTE, as the former name is equivocal, and this ſpecies emits-no ſound.</note> only eleven. But the moſt remarkable is the ſtrange figure of the windpipe, which falls into the cheſt, then turns back like a trumpet, and afterwards makes a ſecond bend to join the lungs. Thus it is enabled to utter a loud and ſhrill note. The other <hi>Swan,</hi> on the contrary, is the moſt ſilent of birds; it can do nothing more than hiſs, which it does on receiving any provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The vocal kind emits its loud notes only when flying, or
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:0591400102:370"/>
calling: its ſound is, <hi>whoogh, whoogh,</hi> very loud and ſhrill, but not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable, when heard far above one's head, and modulated by the winds. The natives of <hi>Iceland</hi> compare it to the notes of a violin: in fact they hear it at the end of their long and gloomy winter, when the return of the Swans announces the return of ſummer: every note muſt be therefore melodious which preſages the ſpeedy thaw, and the releaſe from their tedious confinement.</p>
                           <p>It is from this ſpecies alone that the antients have given the fable of the Swan being endued with the powers of melody:<note place="margin">VOCAL SWAN OF THE POETS.</note> embracing the <hi>Pythagorean</hi> doctrine, they made the body of this bird the manſion of the ſouls of departed poets: and after that, attributed to the birds the ſame faculty of harmony which their inmates poſſeſſed in a pre-exiſtent ſtate. The vulgar, not diſtinguiſhing between ſweetneſs of numbers and melody of voice, thought that real which was only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended figuratively.

The ſportſman keeps motionleſs, and on his knees, with his gun cocked, the whole time; and never fires till he has ſeen the eyes of the Geeſe. He fires as they are going from him, then picks up another gun that lies by him, and diſcharges that. The Geeſe which he has killed, he ſets up on ſticks as if alive, to decoy others; he alſo makes artificial birds for the ſame purpoſe.

They feed upon fiſh; which they take ſometimes by plunging from a great height in the air, and ſeizing, like the GANNET: at other times, they fiſh in concert, ſwimming in flocks, and forming a large circle in the great rivers, which they gradually contract, beating the water with their wings and feet, in order to drive the fiſh into the center; which when they approach, they open their vaſt mouths, and fill their pouches with their prey, then incline their bills, to empty the bag of the water; after which they ſwim to ſhore, and eat their booty in quiet. As the pouch is capable of holding a dozen quarts of water, a gueſs may be made of the quantity of fiſhes it can contain. The <hi>French</hi> very properly call them <hi>Grand-goſiers,</hi> or <hi>Great-throats.</hi> It is ſaid that when they make their neſts in the dry deſerts, they carry the water to their young in their vaſt pouches, and that the lions and beaſts of prey come there to quench their thirſt, ſparing the young, the cauſe of this ſalutary proviſion.

They catch theſe birds with nets, in which they are entangled in the places where they reſt. They are alſo caught in ſnares, with a running nooſe hung to the end of a pole, with which the fowlers creep quietly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the birds, and fling it round their necks, and draw them up the rock. The reſt of the flock are ſo ſtupid, that, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding they ſee the fate of their companions, they remain, ſhak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their heads, on the ſame ſpot, till they are all taken.

                           <p>HAVING gone through the claſs of birds, let me remark, that there is the greateſt probability, that numbers of thoſe of <hi>Kamtſchatka</hi> are common to <hi>North America;</hi> and that they paſs there the ſeaſons of migration; but not having actual proof of their being found on the new continent, I am obliged to place them in theſe appendages to each genus.
