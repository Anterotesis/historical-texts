            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THE author of the following Eclogue, having requeſted my aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to introduce it to the world; it was with more indignation than ſurprize I was informed of your having uſed your extenſive influence over the preſs to prevent its being advertiſed in the News-papers. How are you, Sir, concerned in the Lamentation of <hi>Roſcius</hi> for his <hi>Nyky?</hi> Does your modeſty think no man entitled to the appellation of Roſcius but yourſelf? Does Nyky reſemble any nick-named fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite of yours? Or does it follow, that if you have cheriſhed an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy favourite, you muſt bear too near a reſemblance to him? <hi>Qui capit ille facit;</hi> beware of ſelf-accuſation, where others bring no charge! Or, granting you right in theſe particulars, by what right or privilege do you, Sir, ſet up for a licenſer of the preſs? That you have long ſucceſsfully uſurped that privilege, to ſwell both your fame and fortune, is well known. Not the puffs of the quacks of Bayſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water and Chelſea are ſo numerous and notorious: but by what au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority do you take upon you to ſhut up the general channel, in which writers uſher their performances to the public? If they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack either your talents or your character, <hi>in utrumque paratus,</hi> you are armed to defend yourſelf. You have, beſides your ingenuous countenance and conſcious innocence; <hi>Nil conſcire ſibi, nulla pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſcere culpa;</hi> Beſides this brazen bulwark, I ſay, you have a ready pen and a long purſe. The preſs is open to the one, and the bar is ever ready to open with the other. For a poor author, not a printer will publiſh a paragraph, not a pleader will utter a quib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. You have then every advantage in the conteſt: It is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, therefore, to endeavour to intimidate your antagoniſts by countenancing your retainers to threaten their lives! Theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timidations, let me tell you Sir, have an ugly, ſuſpicious look. They are beſides needleſs; the <hi>genus irritabile vatum</hi> want no ſuch perſonal provocations; Heaven knows, the life of a play-wright, like that of a ſpider, is in a ſtate of the moſt ſlender dependency. It is well for my rhiming friend that his hangs not on ſo ſlight a thread. He thinks, nevertheleſs, that he has reaſon to complain, as well as the publick, of your having long preferred the flimzy, tranſlated, patch'd-up and miſ-altered pieces of your favourite com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pilers, to the arduous attempts at originality of writers, who have no perſonal intereſt with the manager. In particular, he thinks
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0143501300:3"/>
the two pieces, you are projecting to get up next winter, for the emolument of your favorite in diſgrace, or to reimburſe yourſelf the money, you may have advanced him, might, for the preſent at leaſt, be laid aſide.</p>
            <p>But you will aſk me, perhaps, in turn, Sir, what right I have to interfere with the buſineſs of other people, or with yours? I will anſwer you. It is becauſe I think your buſineſs, as patentee of a theatre-royal, is not ſo entirely yours, but that the publick alſo have ſome concern in it. You, Sir, indeed have long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved as if you thought the town itſelf a purchaſed appurtenance to the theatre; but, tho' the ſcenes and machines are yours; nay, tho' you have even found means to make comedians and poets your property; it ſhould be with more caution than you practiſe, that you extend your various arts to make ſo ſcandalous a proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the publick.</p>
            <p>Again I anſwer, it is becauſe I have ſome regard for my friend, and as much for myſelf, whom you have treated as ill perhaps as you have done any other writer; while under your auſpices, ſome of the perſons ſtigmatiſed by the ſatiriſt, have frequently combined to do me the moſt eſſential injury. But <hi>nemo me impurè laceſſit.</hi> Not that I mean now to enter into particulars which may be thought to relate too much to myſelf and too little to the publick. When I ſhall have leiſure to draw a faithful portraiture of Mr. Garrick, not only from his behaviour to me in particular, but from his conduct towards poets, players and the town in general, I doubt not to convince the moſt partial of his admirers that he hath accumulated a fortune, as manager, by the meaneſt and moſt me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retricious devices, and that the theatrical props, which have long ſupported his exalted reputation, as an actor, have been raiſed on the ruins of the English ſtage.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, I leave you to amuſe yourſelf with the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing jeu d'eſprit of my friend; hoping, tho' it be a ſevere correction for the errours of your paſt favouritiſm, it may prove a ſalutary guide to you for the future. With regard to the mode of its publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I hope alſo to ſtand excuſed with the reader for thus interpoſing to defeat the ſucceſs of thoſe arts, which you ſo unfairly practiſe to prevent, from reaching the public eye, whatever is diſagreeable to your own.</p>

"The licentiouſneſs of Wycherly's muſe," ſays this modern corrector, "rendered her ſhocking to us, with all her charms: or, in other words, we could allow no charms in a tainted beauty, who brought contagion along with her." Of the play of the Plain-dealer, in particular, he intimates that it had been long excluded the theatre; becauſe, to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the preſent age, it was immoral and indecent: that on a cloſe exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, he found in it exceſſive obſcenity; that the character of Manly was rough even to outrageous brutality; and that he thought it neceſſary to work the whole materials up again, with a mixture of alloy agreeable to the rules of modern refinement!

                     <item>I. I am the author of the eclogue you mention.</item>
                     <item>II. I did not mean to throw out the <hi>moſt</hi> ſcandalous inſinuations on the character of Roſcius, nor any inſinuation <hi>more</hi> ſcandalous than his conduct. How far that has been ſo, he knows beſt, and is left to make the application.</item>
                     <item>III. An <hi>infamous</hi> paragraph I <hi>cannot</hi> write; and an <hi>anonymous</hi> one I <hi>will not</hi> write, to prejudice my greateſt enemy. As to that in queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I have not, to this hour, even ſeen it. CALUMNY I <hi>deteſt;</hi> but I think <hi>vice</hi> ſhould be expoſed to <hi>infamy;</hi> nor have I ſo much <hi>falſe delicacy</hi> as to conceive, it ſhould be treated with <hi>tenderneſs</hi> in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as it is <hi>abominable.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>IV. I have not acknowledged that I entertain a <hi>very different</hi> opinion of Roſcius; on the contrary, I declare, that I entertain a <hi>very indifferent</hi> opinion of him.</item>
                     <item>V. As to the cauſe of our diſpute, I ſhould be very ready to ſubmit it to the publick, were I egotiſt enough to think it deſerved their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention.</item>
                     <item>VI. The brother of Roſcius <hi>did perſonally wait</hi> on me, to deſire I would meet "him, the ſaid Roſcius, who would bring a friend with him; I being at liberty to do the ſame;" but as nothing of time, place, or weapon was mentioned, I did not look on this meſſage as a challenge; nor well could I, as I never heard of requiring <hi>gentleman's ſatisfaction</hi> by <hi>letter of attorney,</hi> and the profeſſed end of our meeting
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0143501300:23"/>
turned merely on a matter of buſineſs.—It is poſſible, indeed, the meſſenger, otherwiſe inſtructed, might <hi>imagine</hi> it ſuch, eſpecially as, it ſeems, his head has teemed with nothing but challenges and duels, ſince his magnanimous monomachy with one of his brother Roſcius's candle-ſnuffers.—That Roſcius himſelf, however, did not mean to ſend me a challenge, is plain, from his ſolliciting afterwards by letter, a conference in the preſence only of a common friend to both: a requeſt that would have been complied with, had not he thought proper, in a moſt ungentleman-like manner, to make a confidant, in the mean time, of a booby of a bookſeller, who had the folly and impudence to declare that he would, on <hi>his</hi> [Roſcius's] account, <hi>take an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> to do <hi>me</hi> ſome deſperate miſchief.—Leſt I ſhould be yet ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, from the purport of this laſt query, to have any fear of a perſonal encounter with the doughty Roſcius, I require only that it may be on an equal footing. I am neither ſo extravagantly fond of life, nor think myſelf ſo conſequential in it, as to fear the end of it from ſuch an antagoniſt; nor, to ſay the truth, ſhould I have any qualms of conſcience, if nothing leſs will ſatisfy him, about putting an end to ſo inſignificant a being as his: but, as "the race is not to the ſwift, nor the battle to the ſtrong," it is but right to provide againſt a miſhap. Roſcius has a large fortune, and little or no family to leave it to: I have a large family, and little or no fortune to leave it. Let Roſcius but previouſly ſettle <hi>only half</hi> his eſtate on my heirs, on condition that <hi>he</hi> deprives them of a protector, and I will meet him to-morrow, and engage at his own weapons, not only him, but his brother George into the bargain.<note n="*" place="bottom">The above pleaſantry being miſconſtrued by ſome of Roſcius's friends to the diſadvantage of the author, the latter thought himſelf under the neceſſity of ſeriouſly acquainting the former, of his being ready, as he is, at any time, to give him ſuch ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction as a gentleman, who ſuppoſes himſelf injured, has a right to require.</note>

            <p>Inſtead of <hi>candidly</hi> replying, however, to the above three queries, a very difficult taſk, indeed, to Roſcius, he cauſed the Court of King's Bench to be moved for a rule to ſhew cauſe, why leave ſhould not be given him to file an information againſt the author for a libel: which being granted of courſe, the ſame was exultingly anounced in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing paragraphs inſerted in all the news-papers:</p>
            <q>
               <p>Yeſterday morning Mr. Dunning made a motion in the Court of King's Bench, for a rule to ſhew cauſe why an information ſhould not be laid againſt the author of Love in the Suds. When the court was pleaſed to grant a rule for the firſt day of next term. The poem was read in court by the Clerk of the Crown, and afforded no ſmall diverſion when it came to that part which reflects upon a certain Chief Juſtice, who was preſent all the time.</p>
               <p>Beſides Mr. Wallace and Mr. Dunning, who are employed by a greatactor, in his proſecution of ſome deteſtable charges which have been lately urged with <hi>as much folly as wickedneſs</hi> againſt his charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Mr. Murphy and Mr. Mansfield are alſo engaged, and the cauſe now becomes a matter of much expectation with the publick.</p>
            </q>
            <p>To theſe paragraphs the author judged it neceſſary to make the following reply, in the above-mentioned Morning Chronicle; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all the reſt of the news-papers, by the indefatigable induſtry

                  <p>In reprehending the faults of other men you ſhould ever be cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious of falling into the error you condemn. In yeſterday's paper you indirectly charge me, among others, with having "urged a deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble charge with as much folly as wickedneſs againſt a certain great actor."—What other people have done I know not, nor does it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern me; but I may ſafely defy all the Lawyers in Weſtminſter-Hall fairly to deduce ſuch a charge as you hint at from the eclogue in queſtion. In this reſpect it is certainly as innocent as the great actor's Jubilee Ode! But granting it otherwiſe with any one elſe, how can you take upon you to ſay that ſuch a charge is urged <hi>fooliſhly and wickedly?</hi> Can <hi>you</hi> know it to be falſe or groundleſs? And if not, on what grounds do you charge the accuſers with <hi>folly</hi> and <hi>wickedneſs?</hi> Why does not the CANDOUR of the great actor, reply to the Queries put to him in your paper of Saturday laſt? But no; unable to juſtify himſelf at the bar of the publick, he flies for refuge to the quirks and quibbles of Weſtminſter-Hall; and even this at the latter end of a term, in order to deceive the town into a notion that the court will countenance his proſecution. Why was not his motion made ſooner, that cauſe might have been ſhewn in time, and the futility of it made immediately evident? Believe me, Sir, before an end is put to this buſineſs, the publick will be better enabled to judge on which ſide the <hi>folly and wickedneſs</hi> lies, than you appear to do at preſent.</p>
