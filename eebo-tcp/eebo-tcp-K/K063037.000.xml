            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>NO longer now in pomp of grief array'd,</l>
               <l>No longer Editha, the Captive Maid;</l>
               <l>Prepared t' examine this ſame Tragic ſtory,</l>
               <l>In my own perſon I advance before ye.</l>
               <l>My critic art at leaſt this once to try,</l>
               <l>And ſcan our Bard's defects with niceſt eye.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Yet ſome apology th' attempt may need—</l>
               <l>But by your looks embolden'd, I'll proceed.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Who, without terror, Rodolph's fury traces?</l>
               <l>Why, tho' a Dane, was he refuſed the Graces?</l>
               <l>Were ſuch the manners of thoſe Northern Climes?</l>
               <l>Why not have bent them to our gentler times?</l>
               <l>To ſeek his Miſtreſs' life!—So deſperate grown!—</l>
               <l>He ſhould have rather fled, and ſaved his own.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Surely <hi>that</hi> Albert might have ſpoke more plain.</l>
               <l>The City's Praefect—but my dying Swain.</l>
               <l>Why had he not ſome crafty ſcheme deviſed?</l>
               <l>And ventured 'mid the Daniſh camp diſguiſed?</l>
               <l>He ſhould have crept, or ſwam, or fought, or ſtrove,</l>
               <l>And hazarded his truſt—to gain his Love.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Th' affection of a Brother!—How miſplaced!</l>
               <l>And what a violence to modern Taſte!</l>
            </lg>

            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The ſimple, and the natural!—How ſtupid!</l>
               <l>I ſhould have ranſack'd all the ſtores of Cupid.</l>
               <l>Hopes, fears, doubts, jealouſies, and warm deſires,</l>
               <l>Darts, arrows, daggers, poiſon'd bowls, and fires.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Are to a Tragic Piece my powers decreed?</l>
               <l>Let it be great and Tragical indeed.</l>
               <l>Let Paſſion ceaſe the guiding rein t' obey,</l>
               <l>Let Grief be ſtrain'd to its ſublimeſt key,</l>
               <l>In frantic fury let me curſe the light,</l>
               <l>And die enchantingly, with all my might.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But egotiſms and irony apart—</l>
               <l>Say, have our Author's numbers touch'd the heart?</l>
               <l>Have they from Pity ſtole th' ingenuous ſigh?</l>
               <l>And raiſed the trembling tear in Virtue's eye?</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>This is th' unerring comment; this the teſt—</l>
               <l>And all remarks beſides—like mine—a jeſt.</l>
