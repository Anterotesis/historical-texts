            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <head type="sub">Painters and other Artiſts in the Reign of JAMES I.</head>
               <p>IT was well for the arts that King James had no diſpoſition to them:
He let them take their own courſe. Had he felt any inclination
for them, he would probably have introduced as bad a taſte as he
did into litterature. A Prince who thought puns and quibbles the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of eloquence, would have been charmed with the monkies of
Hemſkirk and the drunken boors of Oſtade. James loved his eaſe
and his pleaſures and hated novelties. He gave himſelf up to hunting
and hunted in the moſt cumbrous and inconvenient of all dreſſes, a
ruff and trowſer breeches. The nobility kept up the magnificence
they found eſtabliſhed by Queen Elizabeth, in which predominated a
want of taſte, rather than a bad one. In more ancient times the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
of the great lords, were, as I have mentioned before, built for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
and ſtrength rather than convenience. The walls thick, the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows
pierced wherever it was moſt neceſſary for them to look abroad,
inſtead of being contrived for ſymmetry or to illuminate the chambers.
To that ſtyle ſucceeded the richneſs and delicacy of the Gothic. As
this declined, before the Grecian taſte was eſtabliſhed, ſpace and vaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
ſeem to have made their whole ideas of grandeur. The palaces
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0853300502:3"/>
erected in the reign of Elizabeth by the memorable Counteſs of Shrewſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,
Elizabeth of Hardwicke, are exactly in this ſtyle. The apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
are lofty and enormous, and they knew not how to furniſh them.
Pictures, had they had good ones, would be loſt in chambers of ſuch
height: Tapeſtry, their chief moveable, was not commonly perfect
enough to be real magnificence. Fretted cielings, gracefull mouldings
of windows, and painted glaſs, the ornaments of the preceding age,
were fallen into diſuſe. Immenſe lights compoſed of bad glaſs in dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond
panes, caſt an air of poverty on their moſt coſtly apartments.
That at Hardwicke, ſtill preſerved as it was furniſhed for the reception
and empriſonment of the Queen of Scots, is a curious picture of that
age and ſtyle. Nothing can exceed the expence in the bed of ſtate, in
the hangings of the ſame chamber, and of the coverings for the tables.
The firſt is cloth of gold, cloth of ſilver, velvets of different colours,
lace, fringes and embroidery. The hangings conſiſt of figures, large
as life, repreſenting the virtues and vices, embroidered on grounds of
white and black velvet. The cloths to caſt over the tables are embroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
and emboſſed with gold, on velvets and damaſks, The only
moveables of any taſte are the cabinets and tables themſelves, carved
in oak. The chimnies are wide enough for a hall or kitchen, and over
the arras are freezes of many feet deep with miſerable relievos in ſtucco
repreſenting huntings. There and in all the great manſions of that age
is a gallery, remarkable only for its extent. That at Hardwicke is of
ſixty yards.</p>
               <p>James built no palace himſelf. Thoſe erected by the Nobles in
his reign are much like what I have been deſcribing. Audley-inn, <note n="*" place="bottom">Dugdale, writing after the days of Inigo Jones, ſays, that this houſe was not to be equalled by any fabric in this realm, excepting Hampton-court. There are prints of Audley-inn in it's grandeur by Winſtanley, who lived at Littlebury near it, where, within my memory, was his houſe, remarkable for ſeveral mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nic tricks, known by the name of WINSTANLEY's WONDERS. His plates of Audley-inn are extant, but the prints are very ſcarce. Part of the edifice was taken down about forty years ago, and a greater part, with the magnificent gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery, was demoliſhed after the deceaſe of the laſt Earl of Suffolk of that line.</note>

one of the wonders of that age, deſerved little notice but for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious
ſpace it covered. Towards the end of that monarch's reign
genius was called out and appeared. The magnificent temper or taſte
of the Duke of Buckingham led him to collect pictures, and pointed
out the ſtudy of them to Prince Charles. Rubens came over, Inigo
Jones aroſe, and architecture broke forth in all the luſtre and purity of
Rome and Athens—But before I come to that period, I muſt clear
my way by ſome account of the preceding artiſts. The firſt painter
who ſeems to have arrived after the acceſſion of James was</p>
               <p>PAUL VANSOMER,</p>
               <p>a native of Antwerp. The accounts of him are extremely deficient,
no author of the lives of painters mentioning him but Carl Vermander,
who only ſays that Vanſomer was living when he wrote, and then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided
with his brother Bernard at Amſterdam. Yet Vanſomer as a
painter of portraits was a very able maſter. The picture of the Lord
Chamberlain William Earl of Pembroke, half length at St. James's,
is an admirable portrait, and a whole length at Chatſworth of the firſt
Earl of Devonſhire in his robes, though aſcribed to Mytens, I ſhould
think was painted by the ſame hand. Mytens was much colder in his
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0853300502:6"/>
colouring and ſtiff in his drawing <note n="*" place="bottom">Mytens improved ſo much in his later portraits, that this character muſt be read with allowances; and on ſtudying more of his works, I cannot determine whether the portrait at Chatſworth is not painted by him, as conſtant tradition ſays it was. In general, the portraits by Vanſomer and Mytens, when at whole length, may be thus diſtinguiſhed; Vanſomer commonly placed his on a mat, Mytens, on a carpet.</note>. Both theſe portraits are bold and
round, and the chiaro ſcuro good. The Earl of Devonſhire is equal
to the pencil of Vandyck, and one of the fineſt ſingle figures I have
ſeen. In what year Vanſomer came to England we do not know; cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
as early as 1606, between which and 1620 he did ſeveral pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
I ſhall mention but a few, that are indubitably his, from
whence by compariſon his manner may be known.</p>
               <p>James I. at Windſor, behind him a view of Whitehall.</p>
               <p>Anne of Denmark, with a proſpect of the weſt end of St. Paul's.</p>
               <p>The ſame King at Hampton-court, armour lying by him on the
ground; better than the former. Dated 1615.</p>
               <p>His Queen in blue, with a horſe and dogs; alſo at Hampton-court.
This picture is imitated in the tapeſtry at Houghton.</p>
               <p>Three ladies, 1615, at Ditchley; Lady Morton in purple; another,
with yellow lace about her neck and a gauze ſcarf: the third in black
with a crape over her forehead.</p>
               <p>Lord Chancellor Bacon and his brother Nicholas at Gorhambury.</p>
               <p>Sir Simon Weſton, brother of Lord Treaſurer Portland, whole
length with a pike in his hand, 1608, aet. 43. This piece was in the
poſſeſſion of the Lord Chief Juſtice Raymond.</p>
               <p>Marquis of Hamilton with the white ſtaff, at Hampton-court.</p>
               <p>Vanſomer died about the age of forty-five, and was buried at St.

generally, but inaccurately, called Johnſon, was, according to Sandrart,
born in London of Flemiſh parents; but Vertue, and the author of an
Eſſay towards an Engliſh ſchool, ſay it was at Amſterdam, where the
latter aſſerts that he reſided long, the former that he came over young,
which, conſidering how late he lived, I ſhould be inclined to believe,
if Vertue did not at the ſame time pronounce that his earlieſt perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances
are his beſt: So good a ſtyle of colouring was hardly formed
here. His pictures are eaſily <note n="*" place="bottom">He ſometimes put this mark on his pictures <gap reason="symbol" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

neatneſs and ſmoothneſs. They are generally painted on board, and
except being a little ſtiff, are often ſtronglly marked with a fair charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of nature, and remarkable for a lively tranquillity in the counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances.
His draperies are ſeldom but black. I have two portraits by
him of ſingular merit; one of Mr. Leneve, maſter of the company of
merchant-taylors; the other of Sir George Villiers, father of the great
Duke of Buckingham, leſs handſome, but extremely like his ſon. One
of his hands reſts on the head of a greyhound, as fine as the animals of
Snyder.</p>
               <p>Janſen's firſt works in England are dated about 1618. He dwelt
in the Black-friars, and had much buſineſs. His price for a head was
five broad pieces. He painted too in ſmall in oil, and often copied his
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0853300502:9"/>
own works in that manner. In the family of Verney were the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traits
of Sir Robert Heath and his lady in both ſizes. At Caſhiobury
is a large piece, curious, but ſo inferior to Janſen's general manner,
that if his name were not to it, I ſhou'd doubt it's being of his hand.
It repreſents Arthur Lord Capel, who was beheaded, his Lady and
Children. Behind them is a view of the Garden at Hadham, at that
time the chief ſeat of the family. Between the years 1630 and 1640
Janſen lived much in Kent at a ſmall village called Bridge near Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hamdown,
and drew many portraits for gentlemen in the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
particularly of the families of Auger, Palmer, Hammond and
Bowyer. One of his beſt works was the picture of a Lady Bowyer,
of the family of Auger, called for her exquiſite beauty <hi>The Star in the
Eaſt.</hi> At Sherburn Caſtle in Dorſetſhire is a head of Elizabeth Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otheſley
eldeſt daughter of Henry Earl of Southampton, and wife of
William Lord Spenſer, her head richly dreſſed, and a picture in a blue
enamelled caſe at her breaſt. This picture is well coloured, tho' not
equal to another at the ſame ſeat, a half length of her mother, Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,
daughter of John Vernon, wife of Earl Henry. Her cloaths
are magnificent, and the attire of her head, ſingular, a veil turned
quite back. The face and hands are coloured with incomparable
luſtre, and equal to any thing this maſter executed. There is alſo a
half length in black ſatten of John Digby, firſt Earl of Briſtol, young
and remarkably handſome. It is aſcribed to Janſen, but is faintly
coloured, and evidently in the manner of Vandyck, whom perhaps he
imitated as well as rivalled.</p>
               <p>Janſen's fame declined <note n="*" place="bottom">At Lord Pomfret's at Eaſton was a portrait of Charles I. by Janſen.</note> on the arrival of Vandyck, and the civil war

               <p>He retired firſt to Midelburg and then to Amſterdam, where he
continued to paint and died in 1665. <note n="*" place="bottom">Sandrart, p. 314.</note> His wife's name was Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth

Ruſſel or Rouſſel of Bruges, jeweller to the Kings James and Charles

godmother. Theodore Ruſſel, an elder ſon was born in 1614, and
lived nine years with his uncle Cornelius Janſen, and afterwards with
Vandyck, whoſe pictures he copied very tolerably on ſmall pannels;
many of them are in a private apartment at Windſor, at Warwick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſtle,
and in the collection of the Ducheſs Dowager of Argyle.
Ruſſel chiefly was employed in the country in the families of the Earls

               <p>of the Hague, was an admired painter in the reigns of King James

before his coming over; his landſcape in the back grounds of his por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traits
is evidently in the ſtyle of that ſchool; and ſome of his works
have been taken for Vandyck's. The date of his arrival is not certain;
probably it was in hopes of ſucceeding Van Somer; but though he
drew ſeveral of the court, he was not formally employed as the King's
painter 'till the reign of Charles. His patent is preſerved in Rymer's

                  <note n="†" place="bottom">See Fuller and Wright's Rutlandſhire.</note> He was born at Oakham in Rutlandſhire in 1619, and about the
age of ſeven or eight, being then but eighteen inches high, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in the ſervice of the Duke of Buckingham, who reſided at Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leigh
on the Hill. Soon after the marriage of Charles I, the King and
Queen being entertained at Burleigh, little Jeffery was ſerved up to
table in a cold pye, and preſented by the Ducheſs to the Queen, who
kept him as her dwarf. From ſeven years of age 'till thirty he never
grew taller; but after thirty he ſhot up to three feet nine inches, and
there fixed. Jeffery became a conſiderable part of the entertainment
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0853300502:14"/>
of the court. Sir William Davenant wrote a poem called Jeffreidos,
on a battel between him and a <note n="*" place="bottom">The ſcene is laid at Dunkirk, and the midwiſe reſcues him from the fury of his antagoniſt.</note> turkey-cock, and in 1638 was publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a very ſmall book called The New-year's Gift, preſented at court
from the Lady Parvula to the Lord Minimus (commonly called little
Jeffery) her majeſty's ſervant, &amp;c. written by Microphilus, with a little
print of Jeffery prefixed. Before this period Jeffery was employed on
a negotiation of great importance: He was ſent to France to fetch a
midwife for the Queen, and on his return with this gentlewoman, and
her majeſty's dancing-maſter, and many rich preſents to the Queen
from her mother Mary de Medici, he was taken by the Dunkirkers. <note n="†" place="bottom">It was in 1630. Beſides the preſent he was bringing for the Queen, he loſt to the value of 2500<hi>l.</hi> that he had received in France on his own account from the Queen-mother and ladies of that court.</note>
Jeffery, thus made of conſequence, grew to think himſelf really ſo.
He had born with little temper the teazing of the courtiers and dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtics,
and had many ſquabbles with the King's gigantic porter; <note n="‡" place="bottom">A baſrelief of this dwarfand giant is to be ſeen fixed in the front of a houſe near the end of Bagnio-court on the eaſt ſide of Newgate-ſtreet. Probably it was a ſign. Oliver Cromwell too had a porter of an enormous height, whoſe ſtandard is recorded by a large O on the back of the terrace at Windſor, almoſt under the window of the gallery. This man went mad and prophecied. In Whitechapel was a ſign of him taken from a print of St. Peter.</note> at laſt
being provoked by Mr. Crofts, a young gentleman of family, a chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
enſued, and Mr. Crofts coming to the rendezvous armed only
with a ſquirt, the little creature was ſo enraged that a real duel enſued,
and the appointment being on horſeback with piſtols, to put them more
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0853300502:15"/>
on a level, Jeffery with the firſt fire ſhot his antagoniſt dead. This
happened in France whither he had attended his miſtreſs in the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.
He was again taken priſoner by a Turkiſh rover, and ſold into
Barbary. He probably did not long remain in ſlavery; for at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the civil war he was made a captain in the royal army, and
in 1644 attended the Queen to France where he remained 'till the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoration.
At laſt upon ſuſpicion of his being privy to the Popiſh plot,
he was taken up in 1682, and confined in the gate-houſe Weſtminſter,
where he ended his life in the ſixty-third year of his age.</p>
               <p>Mytens remained in great reputation 'till the arrival of Vandyck,
who being appointed the King's principal painter, the former in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt
aſked his majeſty's leave to retire to his own country; but the
King learning the cauſe of his diſſatisfaction, treated him with much
kindneſs, and told him that he could find ſufficient employment both
for him and Vandyck; Mytens conſented to ſtay, and even grew inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate,
it is probable, with his rival, for the head of <note n="*" place="bottom">In ſome of the firſt impreſſions the name of Iſaac appears in this plate, inſtead of Daniel. It was corrected afterwards.</note> Mytens is one

               <p>Whether the ſame jealouſy operated again, or real decline of buſineſs
influenced him, or any other cauſe, Mytens did not ſtay much longer in
England. We find none of his works here after the year 1630. Yet
he lived many years afterwards. Houbraken quotes a regiſter at the
Hague dated in 1656, at which time it ſays Mytens painted part of
the cieling of the town-hall there; the ſubject is, Truth writing hiſtory

of King Charles I. and King James II. it appears that there were thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
pieces of this maſter in the royal collection, chiefly hiſtoric minia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;
ſeven of them are ſtill preſerved in Queen Caroline's cloſet at
Kenſington. At the Earl of Exeter's at Burleigh is the ſtory of Venus
and Adonis, painted by Peter, and dated 1631. Vertue mentions
another, which was in Mr. Halſted's ſale in May, 1726; it repreſented
Joſeph, the Virgin, and the Child a-ſleep, eight inches wide and five
high. On it was written his name, with the termination French, P.
Olivier fecit, 1628. Another piece, a fine drawing in indian ink, was
copied by him from a picture of Raphael in the collection of King
Charles, St. John preſenting a croſs to the child, kneeling before the
Virgin. The original was ſold after the King's death to the Spaniſh
Embaſſador for 600<hi>l.</hi> Jerome Laniere bought Peter's drawing, and
ſold it for twenty guineas to Mr. John Evelyn, from whom it came to
the preſent Sir John Evelyn. The Duke of Devonſhire has the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trait

Drayton the Madonna and Child. The fineſt work of Peter Oliver in my
opinion is the head of his own wife, in the cabinet of the Ducheſs of
Portland: It is life itſelf. I doubt whether his father ever excelled this
piece. I have a head of the ſame woman drawn with black lead on
the leaf of a vellom pocket-book; on the reverſe is his own portrait
in profile; both maſterly: And in black and red chalk I have a
boy's head, larger than he generally painted, of great nature and
vivacity. At Kenſington below ſtairs is the portrait of Peter Oliver by
Hanneman, who painted the wiſe too; but I know not where the latter

It is extraordinary <note n="*" place="bottom">Sir Andrew Fountaine loſt many miniatures by a fire at White's original chocolate houſe in St. James's ſtreet, about thirty years ago, where he had hired two rooms for a repoſitory of part of his collection. Probably ſome of the works of the Olivers, of Cooper, &amp;c. were deſtroyed there.</note> that more of the works <note n="†" place="bottom">Peter Oliver etched a few ſmall hiſtories, but Vertue does not ſpecify the ſubjects.</note> of this excellent maſter
are not known, as he commonly made duplicates of his pictures, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
one of each for himſelf. On this ſubject Ruſſel the painter,
related to or connected with the Olivers, told Vertue a remarkable
ſtory. The greater part of the collection of King Charles being diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
in the troubles, among which were ſeveral of the Olivers, Charles
II. who remembered, and was deſirous of recovering them, made many
inquiries about them after the reſtoration. At laſt he was told by one
Rogers <note n="‡" place="bottom">Vertue ſays he was very great at court; it was probably Progers, well known for being employed in the King's private pleaſures. See Memoires de Grammont.</note> of Iſleworth that both the father and ſon were dead, but that
the ſon's widow was living at Iſleworth and had many of their works.
The King went very privately and unknown with Rogers to ſee them;
the widow ſhowed ſeveral finiſhed and unfiniſhed, with many of which
the King being pleaſed, aſked if ſhe would ſell them: She replied,
ſhe had a mind the King ſhould ſee them firſt, and if he did not pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe
them, ſhe ſhould think of diſpoſing of them. The King diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
himſelf, on which ſhe produced ſome more pictures which ſhe
ſeldom ſhowed. The King deſired her to ſet her price; ſhe ſaid ſhe did
not care to make a price with his majeſty, ſhe would leave it to him;
but promiſed to look over her huſband's books and let his majeſty
know what prices his father the late King had paid. The King took
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0853300502:23"/>
away what he liked, and ſent Rogers to Mrs. Oliver with the option of
1000<hi>l.</hi> or an annuity of 300<hi>l,</hi> for her life. She choſe the latter. Some
years afterwards it happened that the King's miſtreſſes having begged
all or moſt of theſe pictures, Mrs. Oliver, who was probably a prude
and apt to expreſs herſelf like a prude, ſaid, on hearing it, that if ſhe had
thought the King would have given them to ſuch whores, and ſtrum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets
and baſtards, he never ſhould have had them. This reached the
court, the poor woman's ſalary was ſtopped, and ſhe never received it
afterwards. The reſt of the limnings which the King had not taken,
fell into the hands of Mrs. Ruſſel's father.</p>
               <p>Peter Oliver, ſays Vertue, died about the year 1664, aged near 60;
but this muſt be a miſtake, as his father's drawing at Kenſington
finiſhed by the ſon is dated 1616, when by that account Peter was not
above twelve years old. From his age and the ſtory of his widow it
is more likely that he died before the reſtoration. Probably the date
1664 ſhould be 1654. He was buried with his father in the Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſryars.</p>
               <p>As in none of theſe accounts mention is made of any children of
Peter Oliver, I conclude that Iſaac Oliver, glaſs-painter, born in 1616,
was ſon of the younger brother James. Among the verſes printed by
the univerſity of Cambridge in 1638 on the death of Mr. Edward
King, Milton's Lycidas, one of the Engliſh copies is inſcribed, Iſaac
Oliver, <note n="*" place="bottom">Peck's life of Milton, p. 36.</note> who, I ſuppoſe, was the glaſs-painter, and then about the age

A few lovers of the art collected ſome diſperſed panes from ancient buildings, particularly the late Lord Cobham, who erected a gothic temple at Stowe, and filled it with arms of the old Nobility, &amp;c. About the year 1753, one Aſciotti an Italian, who had married a Flemiſh woman, brought a parcel of painted glaſs from Flanders, and ſold it for a very few guineas to the Hon. Mr. Bateman of Old Windſor. Upon that I ſent Aſciotti again to Flanders, who brought me 450 pieces, for which, including the expence of his journey, I paid him thirty-ſix guineas. His wife made more journeys for the ſame purpoſe, and ſold her cargoes to one Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, a glazier in St. Martin's-lane, who immediately raiſed the price to one, two, five guineas for a ſingle piece, and fitted up entire windows with them, and with moſaics of plain glaſs of different colours.

               <p>though of a very inferior walk in the profeſſion, deſerves to be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered
for his uncommon excellence in his way. He was ſon of Dr.
Robert Norgate, maſter of Bennet-college Cambridge, where Edward
was born. He was brought up by Nicholas Felton Biſhop of Ely who
married his mother, and who obſerving his inclination to limning and
heraldry, permitted him to indulge his genius. As he had good judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in pictures, he was ſent into Italy by the great collector, Thomas
Earl of Arundel, to purchaſe for him, but returning by Marſeilles and
by ſome accident being diſappointed of the remittances he expected,
and totally unknown there, he was obſerved by a French gentleman
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0853300502:28"/>
to walk many hours every day on the cours in a diſconſolate manner.
The gentleman inquiring into his circumſtances, told him, that percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
he was able to walk at leaſt twenty miles a day, if he would ſet
out on his journey homewards, he would furniſh him handſomely for
a footman, by which aſſiſtance Norgate arrived in his own country. <note n="*" place="bottom">Fuller's Worthies in Cambridgeſhire.</note>
Among the accounts of the Lord Harrington quoted above, is the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
entry;</p>
               <p>Paid to Edward Norgate by warrant from the council April 24,
1613, for his paynes taken to write and lymne in gold and colours
certain letters written from his majeſty to the King of Perſia, the ſum
of ten pounds.</p>
               <p>Theſe letters were undoubtedly in anſwer to thoſe brought by that
ſingular adventurer Sir Antony Shirley, embaſſador <hi>from</hi> the Sophy <hi>to</hi>
his own ſovereign.</p>
               <p>The warrant for reſtoring the uſe of the old Engliſh march, which
I have ſet forth in the Catalogue of Noble Authors, was illuminated
by this perſon; but the beſt evidence of his abilities is a curious patent
lately diſcovered. The preſent Earl of Stirling received from a relation
an old box of neglected writings, among which he found the original
commiſſion of Charles I. appointing his Lordſhip's predeceſſor Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Earl of Stirling commander in chief of Nova-Scotia with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation
of the grant of that province made by James I. In the initial
letter are the portraits of the King ſitting on the throne delivering the
patent to the Earl, and round the border repreſentations in miniature
of the cuſtoms, huntings, fiſhings and productions of the country, all
in the higheſt preſervation, and ſo admirably executed, that it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
of the pencil of Vandyck. But as I know no inſtance of that
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0853300502:29"/>
maſter having painted in this manner, I cannot doubt but it was the
work of Norgate, allowed the beſt illuminator of that age, and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
employed, ſays Fuller, to make the initial letters in the patents of
Peers and commiſſions of Embaſſadors. Fuller concludes his account
of him in theſe words; "He was an excellent herald by the title of <gap reason="blank" extent="1 word">
                     <desc> _____ </desc>
                  </gap> , <note n="*" place="bottom">It is extraordinary that Fuller, who was acquainted with him, did not know the title of his office. It appears by the warrant for the march that Norgate was Windſor-herald. He was alſo clerk of the ſignet. V. Maſters's Hiſtory of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus Chriſti Coll.

his patience in his ſickneſs (whereof I was an eye witneſs) though

</p>
               <p>SOLOMON DE CAUS,</p>
               <p>a Gaſcon, was Prince Henry's drawing-maſter. All <note n="†" place="bottom">I have learnt that the front of Wilton by Inigo Jones, was conducted by this De Caus.</note> we know of him
is that in 1612, the year of the Prince's death, he publiſhed a book,
intituled, La Perſpective ou Raiſon des ombres et miroirs, with ſeveral
engraved plates, folio. It is addreſſed from Richmond palace to Prince
Henry, after he had been, as he tells his Highneſs two or three years
in his ſervice; and another tract in folio on mechanic powers, 1628.</p>
               <p>This young Prince was a great lover of the arts, and laid the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of the collection, which his brother compleated. The medals
were purchaſed by him, and Vanderdort, in his catalogue, mentions
ſeveral ſtatues and pictures which King Charles inherited from Prince
Henry. In the appendix to Birch's life of this Prince are ſeveral let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0853300502:30"/>
from Sir Edward Conway, in one <note n="*" place="bottom">Page 486.</note> of which he mentions having
bought a picture of the Four Evangeliſts, whom he calls affectedly,
<hi>the moſt faithfull, glorious and excellent ſecretaries that ever were to tbe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
incomprehenſible Prince</hi>; deſiring Mr. Adam Newton, <hi>ſecretary to
the moſt hopefull, powerfull and glorious earthly Prince,</hi> to preſent it to his
Royal Highneſs; and in others is much talk of a negotiation in which
he was employed by the ſame Prince to engage an eminent painter of
Delft to come to England. This was <hi>Mireveldt,</hi> who had many ſolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citations
afterwards from King Charles on the ſame head; but none
ſucceeded. The printed letters are from the Harleian MSS. and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe
Mireveldt as very fantaſtic and capricious. Mr. Weſt has two
others, one from Mireveldt to Sir Edward Conway, the other from Sir
Edward, in which appears the cauſe of Mireveldt's uncertainty; he was
afraid of being ſtayed in England by authority, and ſtipulated that he
ſhould have liberty to return in three months.—In 1625 he had again
engaged to come but was prevented by the breaking out of the plague.
Mireveldt is ſaid to have painted five thouſand portraits; there
are ſome in England of his hand, as Henry Earl of Southampton at
Woburn; Sir Ralph Winwood; a fine whole length at Kimbolton of
Robert Rich Earl of Warwick, and a print of Robert Earl of Lindſey
by Vorſt 1631, was engraved from a picture of Mireveldt, but theſe por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traits
muſt have been painted when thoſe perſons followed the wars
and their buſineſs abroad.</p>

King James himſelf, who gave two thouſand pounds towards the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking,
Sir Francis Crane erected the houſe at Mortlack for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution
of the deſign; and this is confirmed by authentic evidence:
In Rymer's Foedera <note n="†" place="bottom">Vol. xviii. p. 66.</note> is an acknowledgment from King Charles in the

               <p>It is plain by this deed that the manufacture was then arrived at
great perfection. Another ſuit of hangings, executed at the ſame
place, and repreſenting the five ſenſes, was in the palace at Oatlands:

               <p>Of this perſon I find no farther record with relation to the arts, but
that he made a preſent to the King of a ſea-piece painted by Perſellis;
and was dead when Vanderdort drew up the catalogue <note n="*" place="bottom">King Charles's catalogue page 13. He went to Paris to be cut for the ſtone in the bladder in 1635, and probably died there. He was at that time engaged in a ſuit in the ſtar-chamber with Sir Robert Oſborne, an old ſervant of King James, who had mortgaged to Crane for 7500<hi>l.</hi> the Royal manor of Grafton of which he was only tenant. See Strafford papers, vol. i. p. 361. 336. 524. He was ſometime chancellor of the garter, and founded five additional Alms-knights, by his will dated in 1635.

Beſides theſe works Stone in 1629 undertook to build for the Earl
of Holland at Kenſington two piers of good Portland ſtone to hang a
pair of great wooden gates; the eſtimate of the piers (which were
deſigned by Inigo Jones, and are ſtill ſtanding at Holland-houſe tho'
removed to greater diſtance from each other) was 100<hi>l.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He built the great gate of St. Mary's church, and the ſtone gates for
the phyſic-garden at Oxford, deſigned too by Inigo, for the Earl of
Danby, by whom (as by ſome other perſons) he was employed even as
an architect. The Earl ordered Stone to deſign a houſe for him at
Cornbury, and to direct the workmen, for which he was paid 1000<hi>l.</hi>
In 1638 he built Tarthall near Buckingham-houſe for the Counteſs of
Arundel, and had paid to him at different times to pay workmen 634<hi>l.</hi>
He built the front of St. Mary's at Oxford, and executed many works
at Windſor for King Charles, particularly three cartouches to ſupport
the balcony, the ſtar and garter. The figure of the Nile on the ſtairs
at Somerſet-houſe was of his work; the other ſtatue was done by

               <p>Stone had three ſons, Henry, Nicholas, and John. The two eldeſt
were ſent to Italy to ſtudy; the youngeſt was educated at Oxford, being
deſigned for a clergyman, but in the civil war he entered into the army
on the King's ſide. During that period this John Stone publiſhed a
book on fortification, called Enchiridion, with many ſmall cuts etched
by himſelf but without his name. The King's forces being routed,
young Stone and a companion made their eſcape; the latter was taken
and hanged before his father's door in Smithfield, but Stone hid him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
in his father's houſe in Long-acre for above a twelve-month, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the knowledge, ſays Vertue, of his father, whence I ſuppoſe, he
had either offended the old man by quitting his ſtudies for arms, or the
father was too prudent to riſk the emoluments of his profeſſion by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging
in party-diſſentions. John at laſt found means of retiring to
France, where he lived ſome years, and, I conclude, applied himſelf to
the arts, as we ſhall find him after his return engaged in his father's
buſineſs. Nicholas, the ſecond ſon, was of a promiſing genius; and
while abroad modelled after the antiques ſo well, that his works have
been miſtaken for the beſt Italian maſters. Mr. Bird the ſtatuary had
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0853300502:43"/>
the Laocoon and Bernini's Apollo and Daphne in Terra cotta by this
Nicholas Stone, and Vertue ſaw a book with many of his drawings of
palaces, churches, and other buildings in Italy. He returned to Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
in 1642, and died the ſame year as his father.</p>
               <p>Henry, the eldeſt ſon, who erected the monument for his father,
mother, and brother, carried on, in conjunction with John, the buſineſs
of ſtatuary, after his father's death; though Henry addicted himſelf
chiefly to painting, and was an excellent copyiſt of Vandyck and the
Italian maſters: He is generally known by the name of <hi>Old Stone,</hi> I
ſuppoſe to diſtinguiſh him from his brother John. Henry wrote a
book, a thin folio, entituled the third part of the art of painting, taken
moſtly from the ancients. Vertue, who ſaw this book, was uncertain
whether the two former parts were compoſed by Stone, or by ſome
other author. The accounts of Nicholas Stone, ſen. which I have
quoted above, were continued by John, while he and Henry worked in
partnerſhip; among other articles are the following;</p>

               <p>who calls himſelf joyner and architect, invented the triumphal arches
erected in London for the reception of James I. They were engrav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by Kip on a few leaves in folio, a work I never ſaw but in the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary
at Chatſworth.</p>
               <p>I ſhall conclude what I have to ſay on the reign of King James, with
a brief account of a few of his medalliſts. This article is one of the
moſt deficient in Vertue's notes; he had found but very ſlight materials,
though equally inquiſitive on this head with the reſt. One muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
the ſubject of the two Simons, of whoſe works as he himſelf pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed
a moſt curious volume, I ſhall omit the mention of them in this
catalogue, only deſiring that Vertue's account of the two Simons and
Hollar, and the catalogues of the collections of King Charles, King
James and the Duke of Buckingham, may be regarded as parts of this
his great deſign. By thoſe ſpecimens one ſees how perfect he wiſhed
and laboured to make the whole.</p>
               <p>I was in hopes of compleating this article, by having recourſe to
Mr. Evelyn's Diſcourſe on Medals, but was extremely diſappointed to
ſind that in a folio volume, in which he has given the plates and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions
of a regular ſeries of our medals, he takes not the leaſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of the gravers. I ſhould not have expected that a virtuoſo ſo know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
would have contented himſelf with deſcriptions of the perſons re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented,
he who had it in his inclination, and generally in his power,
to inform poſterity of almoſt every thing they would wiſh to learn.
Had Mr. Evelyn never regretted his ignorance of the names of the
workmen of thoſe inimitable medals of the Seleucidae, of the fair
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0853300502:51"/>
coins of Auguſtus, and of the Denarii of the other Roman Emperors?
Was he ſatisfied with poſſeſſing the effigies of Tiberius, Claudius, Irene,
without wiſhing to know the names of the ingenious and more harmleſs
gravers—Why did he think poſterity would not be as curious to learn
who were the medalliſts of Charles II. James I. Mary I.? He has
omitted all names of gravers except in two or three of the plates,
and even there ſays not a word of the artiſt. For inſtance in a
medal of Charles I. p. 113, under the King's buſt are the letters
N. R. F. I cannot diſcover who this N. R. was. <note n="*" place="bottom">Unleſs it was Norbert Rotier, who arrived in the reign of Charles II. In that caſe, the medal in queſtion muſt have been executed after the Reſtoration.</note> Thomas Rawlins

that I concluded Mr. Evelyn muſt have treated of the gravers
in ſome other part of the work. I turned to the index, and to my
greater ſurprize found almoſt every thing but what I wanted. In the

               <p>In ſhort, Mr. Evelyn, who loved to know, was too fond of telling
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0853300502:52"/>
the world all he knew. <note n="*" place="bottom">Among other branches of ſcience, if one can call it ſo, Mr. Evelyn ſtudied Phyſiognomy, and found diſſimulation, boldneſs, cruelty and ambition in every touch and ſtroke of Fuller's picture of Oliver Cromwell's face, which he ſays, was the moſt reſembling portrait of the Protector. In Vandyck's Earl of Strafford, a ſteady, ſerious, and judicious countenance; and ſo in many others whoſe charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters from knowing their hiſtory he fancied he ſaw in their features. How his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vination would have been puzzled if he had been ſhown a picture of Cromwell in the contemptible appearance, which, Sir Philip Warwick ſays, he made at his firſt entry into the Houſe of Commons. Or if my Lord Strafford had continued to oppoſe the court, and had never changed ſides, would Mr. Evelyn have ſound his countenance ſo STEADY and JUDICIOUS?</note> His virtue, induſtry, ingenuity, and learning,
were remarkable; one wiſhes he had written with a little more judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment—or
perhaps it is not my intereſt to wiſh ſo; it would be more
prudent to ſhelter under his authority any part of this work that is not
much to the purpoſe.</p>
               <p>All this author ſays <note n="†" place="bottom">Page 239.</note> of our medalliſts is, that we had Symons,

of whom I can find no other account. The reader muſt therefore
accept what little is ſcattered up and down in Vertue's MSS. I have
already mentioned one or two in the preceding volume. The firſt
graver I meet in the reign of James is</p>
               <p>CHARLES ANTONY,</p>
               <p>to whom Sir Thomas Knyvet, maſter of the mint in the ſecond of that
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0853300502:53"/>
King, paid by warrant 40<hi>l.</hi> for gold and workmanſhip, for graving an

graver. <note n="*" place="bottom">I have a thin plate of ſilver larger than a crown piece, repreſenting King James on his throne. It is very neat workmanſhip, and probably by this Antony.</note> Vertue ſuppoſes this perſon made the medal in 1604 on the
peace with Spain, a medal not mentioned by Evelyn, and that he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
in office 'till 1620. Mr. Anſtis informed him of a warrant to
a brother of Charles Antony, called</p>

theſe brothers do I find any other traces.</p>
               <p>THOMAS BUSHELL</p>
               <p>was probably a medalliſt of the ſame age. In the year 1737 Mr.
Compton produced at the Antiquarian Society, as I find by their
minutes, a gold medal, larger than a crown piece; on one ſide Lord
Chancellor Bacon in his hat and robes, with this legend, Bacon Viceco.

               <p>NICHOLAS BRIOT</p>
               <p>was a native of Lorrain, and graver of the mint to the King of France,
in which kingdom he was the inventor, or at leaſt one of the firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0853300502:54"/>
of coining money by a preſs, inſtead of the former manner of
hammering. As I am ignorant myſelf in the mechanic part of this
art, and have not even the pieces quoted by Vertue, I ſhall tread very
cautiouſly, and only tranſcribe the titles of ſome memorials which he
had ſeen, and from whence I conclude a litterary controverſy was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
on in France on the ſubject of this new invention, to which, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to cuſtom, the old practicioners ſeem to have objected, as,

This Coquerel, I find by another note, was Generalis monetarius,
or Pope of the mint, into which the reformation was to be introduced.
The Luther, Briot, I ſuppoſe, miſcarried, as we ſoon afterwards find
him in the ſervice of the crown of England, where projectors were
more favorably received. From theſe circumſtances I conclude he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
in the reign of King James, though he did not make his way to
court before the acceſſion of King Charles, the patron of genius.
Briot's firſt public work was a medal of that Prince exhibited in Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyn,
with the artiſt's name and the date 1628. To all or to almoſt all
his coins and medals he put at leaſt the initial letter of his name. He
was employed both in England and Scotland. In 1631, as appears by
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0853300502:55"/>
Rymer's Foedera, tom xix. p. 287, a ſpecial commiſſion was appointed
for making trial of the experience ſkill and induſtry of Nicholas
Briot, in the coinage of money at the mint, dated June 13, 1631, at
Weſtminſter. This was the project he had attempted in France, by
inſtruments, mills and preſſes, to make better money and with leſs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
to the crown than by the way of hammering. The ſcheme was
probably approved, for in the very next year we find him coining mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
upon the regular eſtabliſhment. There is extant a parchment roll,
containing the accounts of Sir Robert Harley, Knight of the Bath,
maſter worker of his majeſty's monies of gold and ſilver within the
tower of London, in the reign of King Charles I. from November 8,
1628, to Auguſt 1, 1636. In this account, in 1632 are payments to
Briot for coining various parcels of gold and ſilver, which are followed
by this entry.</p>
               <p>"And delivered to his majeſtie in fair ſilver monies at Oatlands by
Sir Thomas Ayleſbury, viz. iij crownes, and iij half crownes of Briot's
moneys, and iij crownes, and iij half crownes, and ten ſhillings of the
monoyers making."</p>
               <p>Theſe comparative pieces were probably preſented to the King by Sir
Robert Harley, Briot's patron, to ſhow the ſuperior excellence of the
latter's method.</p>
               <p>Briot returned to France about 1642, having formed that excellent
ſcholar Thomas Simon.</p>
               <p>In a private family (the name of which he does not mention) Vertue
ſaw a peachſtone, on which was carved the head of King Charles full

<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0853300502:56"/>
removed from the ſervice of the crown, and at laſt obtaining the place
of poor Knight at Windſor, cut that curioſity to ſhow he was not ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perannuated

civil war. The latter is moſt likely, as in the Treaſury, where the plate

Diſperſion of the King's Collection, and of the Earl
of Arundel's.</head>
               <p>THE acceſſion of this Prince was the firſt aera of real taſte in
England. As his temper was not profuſe, the expence he
made in collections, and the rewards he beſtowed on men of
true genius and merit, are proofs of his judgment. He knew how
and when to beſtow. Queen Elizabeth was avaricious with pomp;
James I. laviſh with meanneſs. A prince who patronizes the arts, and
can diſtinguiſh abilities, enriches his country, and is at once generous
and an oeconomiſt. Charles had virtues to make a nation happy; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate,
if he had not thought, that he alone knew how to make them
happy, and that he alone ought to have the power of making them ſo!</p>
               <p>His character, as far as it relates to my ſubject, is thus given by
Lilly; "He had many excellent parts in nature, was an excellent
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0853300502:58"/>
horſeman, would ſhoot well at a mark, had ſingular ſkill in limning,
was a good judge of pictures, a good mathematician, not unſkillfull in
muſic, well read in divinity, excellently in hiſtory and law, he ſpoke
ſeveral languages, and writ well, good language and ſtyle." Perinchief
is ſtill more particular; "His ſoul, ſays that writer, was ſtored with a
full knowledge of the nature of things, and eaſily comprehended almoſt
all kinds of arts that either were for delight or of a public uſe; for he
was ignorant of nothing, but of what he thought it became him to be
negligent, for many parts of learning, that are for the ornament of a
private perſon, are beneath the cares of a crowned head. He was well
ſkilled in things of antiquity, could judge of medals whether they had
the number of years they pretended unto; his libraries and cabinets
were full of thoſe things on which length of time put the value of rari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
In painting he had ſo excellent a fancy, that he would ſupply the
defect of art in the workman, and ſuddenly draw thoſe lines, give thoſe
airs and lights, which experience and practice had not taught the
painter. He could judge of fortifications, and cenſure whether the
cannon were mounted to execution or no. He had an excellent ſkill
in guns, knew all that belonged to their making. The exacteſt arts of
building ſhips for the moſt neceſſary uſes of ſtrength or good ſailing,
together with all their furniture, were not unknown to him. He un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
and was pleaſed with the making of <note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. Oughtred made a horizontal inſtrument for delineating dials, for him; "Elias Allen, ſays that celebrated mathematician, having been ſworn his maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty's ſervant had a purpoſe to preſent his majeſty with ſome new-year's gift, and requeſted me to deviſe ſome pretty inſtrument for him. I anſwered that I have heard that his majeſty delighted much in the great concave dial at Whitehall; and what fitter inſtrument could he have than my horizontal, which was the very ſame repreſented in flat." Biogr. Brit. vol. 5. p. 3279. Delamain, another mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tician, made a ring dial for the King, which his majeſty valued ſo much, that, on the morning before he was beheaded, he ordered it to be given to the Duke of York, with a book ſhowing it's uſe, ib. p. 3283.</note> clocks and watches.
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0853300502:59"/>
He comprehended the art of printing. There was not any one gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
of all the three kingdoms that could compare with him in an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſality
of knowledge. He encouraged all the parts of learning, and
he delighted to talk with all kind of artiſts, and with ſo great a facility
did apprehend the myſteries of their profeſſions, that he did ſometimes
ſay, "He thought he could get his living, if neceſſitated, by any trade
he knew of, but making of hangings;" although of theſe he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
much, and was greatly delighted in them; for he brought ſome
of the moſt curious workmen from foreign parts to make them here
in England." <note n="*" place="bottom">Life of Charles I. at the end of the Icon Baſilike. edit. 1727.</note>
               </p>
               <p>With regard to his knowledge of pictures, I find the following anec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dote
from a book called the original and growth of printing by Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard
Atkyns <abbr>Eſq</abbr> "This excellent Prince, ſays that author, who was
not only aliquis in omnibus, but ſingularis in omnibus, hearing of rare
heads (painted) amongſt ſeveral other pictures brought me from Rome,
ſent Sir James Palmer to bring them to Whitehall to him, where were
preſent divers picture-drawers and painters. He aſked them all of
whoſe hand that was? ſome gueſt at it; others were of another opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
but none was poſitive. At laſt ſaid the King, This is of ſuch a
man's hand, I know it as well as if I had ſeen him draw it; but, ſaid
he, is there but one man's hand in this picture? None did diſcern
whether there was or not; but moſt concluded there was but one hand.
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0853300502:60"/>
Said the King, "I am ſure there are two hands have workt in it, for
I know the hand that drew the heads, but the hand that did the reſt I
never ſaw before." Upon this a gentleman that had been at Rome
about ten years before, affirmed that he ſaw this very picture, with the
two heads unfiniſhed at that time, and that he heard his brother (who
ſtaid there ſome years after him) ſay, that the widow of the painter
that drew it wanting money, got the beſt maſter ſhe could find to finiſh
it and make it ſaleable." This ſtory which in truth is but a blind one,
eſpecially as Mr. Atkyns does not mention even the name of the
painter of his own picture, ſeems calculated to prove a fact, of which
I have no doubt, his majeſty's knowledge of hands. The gentleman
who ſtood by and was ſo long before he recollected ſo circumſtantial
a hiſtory of the picture, was, I dare ſay, a very good courtier.</p>
               <p>The King is ſaid not only to have loved painting but to have prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed
it; it is affirmed that Rubens corrected ſome of his <note n="*" place="bottom">De Piles, in his life of Rubens, ſays, that the King's mother-in-law, Mary de' Medici deſigned well.</note> majeſty's
drawings.</p>
               <p>It was immediately after his acceſſion that Charles began to form his
collection. The crown was already in poſſeſſſion of ſome good pictures:
Henry VIII. had ſeveral. What painters had been here had added
others. Prince Henry, as I have ſaid, had begun a ſeperate collection
both of paintings and ſtatues. All theſe Charles aſſembled, and ſent
commiſſions into France and Italy to purchaſe more. Croſs <note n="†" place="bottom">Vincentio Carducci in his dialogo della pittura printed at Madrid in 1633, calls him Michael de la Crux; others ſay it was Henry Stone jun. who was ſent to Spain. When Charles was at that court, the King of Spain gave him a cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated picture by Titian called the Venus del Pardo, ſee catal. p. 103; and the Cain and Abel by John of Bologna, which King Charles afterwards beſtowed on the Duke of Buckingham, who placed it in the garden of York-houſe. See Peacham, p. 108. From Whitlocke p. 24. we have the following information. "In December the Queen was brought to bed of a ſecond daughter named Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth. To congratulate her majeſty's ſafe delivery, the Hollanders ſent hither a ſolemn ambaſſy and a noble preſent, a large piece of ambergreaſe, two fair china baſons almoſt tranſparent, a curious clock, and four rare pieces of Tintoret's and Titian's painting.

offered to ſale at court. The miniſters and nobility were not back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward

the jewels and bawbles preſented to magnificent Elizabeth. In the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue

of the court who ingratiated themſelves by offerings of pictures and
curioſities. But the nobleſt addition was made by the King himſelf:

               <p>Abraham Vanderdort, a Dutchman, had worked for the Emperor

He brought away with him a buſt of a woman modelled in wax as
large as the life, which he had begun for that monarch, but Prince
Henry was ſo ſtruck with it, that though the Emperor wrote ſeveral
times for it, the young Prince would neither part with the work nor the
workman, telling him he would give him as good entertainment as any
Emperor would—and indeed Vanderdort ſeems to have made no bad
bargain. He parted with the buſt to the Prince upon condition, that

great awe of Charles I. The King had recommended to him to take
particular care of a miniature by Gibſon, the parable of the loſt ſheep.

it, he could not find it, and hanged himſelf in deſpair. <note n="‖" place="bottom">Sanderſon's Graphice page 14.</note> After his

His majeſty was deſirous too of having ſomething of the hand of Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nini.
Vandyck drew in one piece the full face and the three quarter
face and the profile of the King, from which Bernini made a buſt,
that was conſumed or ſtolen in the fire of Whitehall. <note n="†" place="bottom">It is very uncertain what became of this buſt: Vertue from ſeveral circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, which I ſhall lay before the reader, believed it was not deſtroyed. Cooper the print-ſeller told him that he had often heard Norrice frame-maker to the court, and who ſaved ſeveral of the pictures, averr, that he was in the room where the buſt uſed to ſtand over a corner chimney, and that it was taken away before that chamber was deſtroyed. Lord Cutts who commanded the troops, was impatient to blow up that part, and yet after he had ordered the drums to beat, it was half an hour before the exploſion was begun, time enough to have ſaved the buſt, if it was not ſtolen before. Sir John Stanley, then deputy-chamberlain, was of the latter opinion. He was at dinner in Craig-court when the fire began which was about three o'clock: He immediately went to the palace, and perceived only an inconſiderable ſmoke in a garret, not in the principal building. He found Sir Chriſtopher Wren and his workmen there, and the gates all ſhut. Looking at Bernini's buſt, he begged Sir Chriſtopher to take care of That, and the ſtatues. The latter replied, "Take you care of what you are concerned in and leave the reſt to me." Sir John ſaid it was above five hours after this before the fire reached that part. Norrice afterwards dug in the ruins of that chamber but could not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the leaſt fragment of marble. The crouching Venus in the ſame apartment was known to be ſtolen, being diſcovered after a concealment of four years and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken by the crown. Vertue thought that the brazen buſt of King Charles in the paſſage near Weſtminſter-hall, was not taken from Bernini's, of which caſts are extant, but of an earlier date. In the imperial library at Vienna, ſays Dr. Edward Brown in his travels, is a head of King Charles in white marble, but this cannot be Bernini's, as Brown wrote in 1673, and the fire of Whitehall happened in 1697.</note> It was on
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0853300502:69"/>
ſeeing this picture that Bernini pronounced, as is well known, that
there was ſomething unfortunate in the countenance of Charles. The
ſame artiſt made a buſt too of Mr. Baker, who carried the picture to
Rome. The Duke of Kent's father bought the latter buſt at Sir Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Lely's ſale; it is now in the poſſeſſion of Lord Royſton, and was
reckoned preferable to that of the King. The hair is in prodigious
quantity and incomparably looſe and free; the point-band very fine.
Mr. Baker paid Bernini an hundred broad pieces for his, but for the
King's Bernini received a thouſand Roman crowns. The King was
ſo pleaſed with his own, that he deſired to have one of the Queen too;
but that was prevented by the war. <note n="*" place="bottom">In the church at Chelſea is a fine monument in a niche for the Lady Jane Cheyney; ſhe is repreſented lying on her right ſide, and leaning on a bible. This tomb was the work of Bernini, and coſt 500<hi>l.</hi>

               <p>Among the Strafford papers is an evidence of this Prince's affection
for his pictures: In a <note n="†" place="bottom">Page 130, vol. ii.</note> letter from Mr. Garrard, dated November 9,
1637, ſpeaking of two maſks that were to be exhibited that winter, he
ſays, "A great room is now <note n="‡" place="bottom">Journal of the Houſe of Commons July 16, 1645.

<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0853300502:70"/>
much money to be pulled down, and yet down it muſt when the maſks
are over."</p>
               <p>In another of December 16, the ſame perſon ſays, "Here are two
maſks intended this winter; the King is now in practicing his, which
ſhall be preſented at Twelfth-tide, moſt of the young Lords about the

               <p>The moſt capital purchaſe made by King Charles were the cartoons
of Raphael, now at Hampton-court. They had remained in Flanders
from the time that Leo X. ſent them thither to be copied in tapeſtry,
the money for the tapeſtry having never been paid. Rubens told the
King of them, and where they were, and by his means they were

               <p>The dials at Whitehall were erected by the order of Charles, while
he was Prince. Mr. Gunter drew the lines, and wrote the deſcription
and uſe of them, printed in a ſmall tract by order of King James in
1624. There were five dials; afterwards ſome were made of glaſs in a
pyramidal ſhape by Francis Hill, and placed in the ſame garden. One
or two of theſe may ſtill be extant; Vertue ſaw them at Buckingham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe

It looks as if Charles had had ſome thoughts of erecting a monument
for his father. In the lodgings of the warden of New-college Oxford
was a mauſoleum with arms, altar-tomb, columns and inſcriptions in
honour of that Prince dated 1630. It is certain King Charles had no leſs
inclination for architecture than for the other arts. The intended pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace
at Whitehall would have been the moſt truly magnificent and
beautifull fabric of any of the kind in Europe. His majeſty did not
ſend to Italy and Flanders for architects as he did for Albano and Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyck:
He had Inigo Jones. Under the direction of that genius the
King erected the houſe at Greenwich.</p>
               <p>Charles had in his ſervice another man, both architect and painter,
of whom, though excellent in neither branch, the reader will perhaps
not diſlike ſome account, as he was a remarkable perſon and is little
known.</p>
               <p>Sir Balthazar Gerbier D'ouvilly of Antwerp, was born about 1591,
came young into England, and was a retainer of the Duke of Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham
as early as 1613. In Finette's maſter of the ceremonies it is ſaid,
"Alonzo Contarini Embaſſador from Venice came to Mr. Gerbier, a
gentleman ſerving the Duke of Buckingham." Sanderſon <note n="*" place="bottom">Graphice page 15.</note> calls him
a common penman, who penſiled the dialogue (probably the decalogue)
in the Dutch church London, his firſt riſe of preferment." It is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that he ingratiated himſelf much with that favorite and attended
him into Spain, where he was even employed in the treaty of marriage,
though oſtenſibly acting only in the character of a painter. <note n="†" place="bottom">He painted ſmall figures in diſtemper. De Piles. While in Spain he drew the Infanta in miniature, which was ſent over to King James.</note> Among

               <p>Nothing can be built upon ſo vague a foundation. It is certain that
immediately after the acceſſion of King Charles, Gerbier was employed
in Flanders to negotiate privately a treaty with Spain, the very treaty
in which Rubens was commiſſioned on the part of the Infanta, and for
which end that great painter came to England. Among the Conway<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>papers
I found a very curious and long letter from Gerbier himſelf on
this occaſion, which though too prolix to inſert in the body of this
work, I ſhall affix at the end, not only as pertinent to my ſubject from
the part theſe painters had in ſo important a buſineſs, but as it is more
particular than any thing I know in print on that occaſion.</p>
               <p>Gerbier kept his ground after the death of Buckingham. In 1628
he was knighted at Hampton-court, and, as he ſays himſelf in one of
his books, was promiſed by King Charles the office of ſurveyor-general
of the works after the death of Inigo Jones.</p>
               <p>In 1637 he ſeems to have been employed in ſome other private
tranſactions of ſtate, negotiating with the Duke of Orleans, the King's
brother, who was diſcontented with the court. The Earl of Leiceſter,
Embaſſador to Paris, writes <note n="*" place="bottom">Sidney papers vol. ii, p. 528. In one of his dedications mentioned hereafter, Gerbier puts this Lord in mind of his having been in a publick employment when his Lordſhip was at Paris: and De Piles ſays that the Duke of Buckingham find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him a man of good underſtanding, recommended him to the King, who ſent him as his agent to Bruſſels.</note> to Mr. Secretary Windebank Nov. 24.
"I received a packet from Garbier to Monſieur d d [French King's
brother.]</p>

lie ſtill in times of ſuch dark and buſy complection. However, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
miſcarrying or neglected, <note n="*" place="bottom">Vertue ſays he was much hated and perſecuted by the antimonarchic party, being always loyal and faithfull to the King and his ſon, which may explain and ſoften what is ſaid above of <hi>his teſtimony being odious to any man.</hi> He bought goods at King Charles's ſale to the value of 350<hi>l.</hi>
                  </note> in 1648 he appears not only in the
character of author, but founder of an academy. In that year he pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed
a thin quarto, intituled, The interpreter of the academie for for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain
languages and all noble ſciences and exerciſes. To all fathers of
families and lovers of vertue, the firſt part, by Sir Balthazar Gerbier
Knight. Lond. French and Engliſh; with a <note n="†" place="bottom">There is another print of him, half length, by Pontius after Vandyck, in which he is ſtyled, Bruxellas Prolegatus.</note> print of his head in oval
and this motto, Heureux qui en Dieu ſe confie. It is a moſt trifling
ſuperficial rhapſody, and deſerved the ſarcaſm that Butler paſſed on ſo
incompetent <note n="‡" place="bottom">For inſtance, he tranſlates Arcadia, Orcadys.</note> an attempt: In his fictitious will of Philip Earl of Pem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broke

               <p>In 1649 he publiſhed the <note n="‖" place="bottom">So Vertue calls it; but it is probably a miſtake, Mr. Maſters being poſſeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of a tract, which is probably the ſame and correſponds exactly to Butler's words; it is intituled, The Art of Well-ſpeaking, being a lecture read gratis at Sir B.

of this projector's hiſtory.</p>

is ſet forth that he having a commiſſion to go there, ſettle and make
enquirys, he went to <hi>Cajana</hi> (Cayenne) with his family, and ſettled at
Surinam. A governor there from the Dutch had orders to ſeize upon
him and all his papers and bring him back to Holland, which they did
in a very violent manner, breaking into his houſe, killed one of his
children, endangered the lives of the reſt of his family, and narrowly
eſcaped himſelf with his life, having a piſtol charged at his breaſt if he
had reſiſted. They brought him to Holland: He complained, but got
no redreſs, the ſtates diſowning they had given any ſuch orders. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
it was juſt before the reſtoration, and knowing the obligations he
had to England, they apprehended he might give the King notice of
the advantages might be gained by a ſettlement there."</p>
               <p>This perhaps was one among the many provocations, which, meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his inclinations to France, led Charles II. into his impolitic, though
otherwiſe not wholly unjuſtifiable, war with Holland, a people too apt
even in their depreſſed ſtate, to hazard barbarous and brutal infraction
of treaties and humanity, when a glimpſe of commercial intereſt invites
it.</p>
               <p>Gerbier probably returned to England with that Prince, for the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphal
arches erected for his reception, are ſaid to have been deſigned
by Sir Balthazar.</p>
               <p>In France he publiſhed a book on fortification, and in 1662 at
London a ſmall diſcourſe on magnificent buildings, dedicated to the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0853300502:77"/>
King, in which he principally treats of ſolidity, convenience and orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and glances at ſome errors of Inigo Jones in the banquetting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe.
Here too he mentions a large room built by himſelf near the
watergate <note n="*" place="bottom">The gate itſelf was deſigned by Inigo.</note> at York-ſtairs, thirty-five feet ſquare, and ſays, that King
Charles I. being in it in 1628 at ſome repreſentation of ſcenery, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
it, and expreſſed as much ſatisfaction with it as with the ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quetting-houſe.
In the piece he propoſes to the Lords and Commons
to level the ſtreets, Fleet-bridge and Cheapſide, and erect a ſumptuous
gate at Temple-bar, of which he had preſented a draught to his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty.
Before this book is a different print of him with a ribband and
a medal, inſcribed C. R. 1653. The medal I ſuppoſe was given him
when appointed, as he ſays he was, Maſter of the Ceremonies to
Charles I.</p>
               <p>His portrait in one piece with Sir Charles Cotterel and Dobſon,
painted by the latter, is at Northumberland-houſe; Gerbier has been
miſtaken in that picture for Inigo Jones. This piece was bought for
44<hi>l.</hi> at the ſale of Betterton, the player.</p>
               <p>Gerbier's laſt piece is a ſmall manual, intituled, Counſel and Advice
to all builders, &amp;c. London 1663. A full half of this little piece is
waſted on dedications, of which there are no fewer than forty, and
which he excuſes by the example of Antonio Perez. They are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed
to the Queen-mother, Duke of York, and moſt of the principal
Nobility and Courtiers. The laſt is to his own diſciple Captain Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam
Wind. There is a heap of a kind of various knowledge even in
theſe dedications, and ſome curious things, as well as in the book itſelf,
particularly the prices of work and of all materials for building at that
time. In one place he ridicules the heads of lions, which are creeping
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0853300502:78"/>
through the pilaſters on the houſes in Great Queen-ſtreet built by
Webb, the ſcholar of Inigo Jones.</p>
               <p>Hempſted-marſhal, the ſeat of Lord Craven, ſince deſtroyed by fire,
was the laſt production of Gerbier. He gave the deſigns for it, and died
there in 1667 while it was <note n="*" place="bottom">The foundation was laid in 1662.</note> building, and was buried in the chancel
of that church. The houſe was finiſhed under the direction of Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain

Gerbier, his admonitions and diſputes with his three daughters, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired
into the Engliſh nunnery at Paris, 1646.</p>
               <p>The late Prince of Wales hearing of a capital picture by Vandyck
in Holland, to which various names of Engliſh families were given, as
Sir Balthazar Arundel, Sir Melchior Arundel, Sir Balthazar Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,
or Sheffield, the laſt of which gained moſt credit from a reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
in the arms, his Royal Highneſs gave a commiſſion to purchaſe
it, and it was brought to Leiceſter-houſe. It appeared that a celebrated
piece, for which Lord Burlington had bid 500<hi>l.</hi> at Lord Radnor's ſale,
and which Mr. Scawen <note n="†" place="bottom">It was again expoſed at Mr. Scawen's ſale, but bought in, and has ſince been purchaſed by Sampſon Gideon.</note> bought at a ſtill greater price was the ſame
with this picture, but not ſo large nor containing ſo many figures.
Mr. Scawen's had always paſſed for a miſtreſs and children of the Duke
of Buckingham; but Vertue diſcovered on that of the Prince of Wales
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:0853300502:79"/>
an almoſt effaced inſcription, written by Vandyck's own hand, with
theſe words remaining, La famille de Balthazar—Chevalier; and he
ſhowed the Prince that the arms on a flower-pot were the ſame with
thoſe on two different prints of Gerbier, and alluſive to his name, viz.
a chevron between three garbs or ſheafs. There is a group of children
on the right hand, very inferior to the reſt of the compoſition, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
not by Vandyck. The little girl leaning on the mother's knee
was originally painted by Rubens in a ſeparate piece, formerly belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to Richardſon the painter, ſince that to General Skelton and Capt.
William Hamilton, and now in the collection of the Lord Viſcount
Spenſer. It is finer than the large picture—but it is time to return to
King Charles.</p>
               <p>The academy erected by Gerbier was probably imitated from one
eſtabliſhed by Charles I. in the eleventh year of his reign and called
Muſeum Minervae. The patent of erection is ſtill extant in the office
of the rolls. None but who could prove themſelves gentlemen were
to be admitted to education there, where they were to be inſtructed in
arts and ſciences, foreign languages, mathematics, painting, architec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
riding, fortification, antiquities and the ſcience of medals. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors
were appointed, and Sir Francis Kingſton, <note n="*" place="bottom">Sir Francis Kingſton, who ſtyled himſelf Corporis Armiger, printed in 1635 a tranſlation into Latin verſe of Chaucer's Troilus and Creſſida.</note> in whoſe houſe in
Covent-garden the academy was held, was named regent. There is a
ſmall account of the deſign of this academy, with it's rules and orders,
printed in 1636. <note n="†" place="bottom">At the end of the little edition of Buſbequius's Epiſtles printed at Oxford 1660, is the grant of a coat of arms to the regent and profeſſors of the Muſeum Minervae from Sir John Burroughs the herald, dated 1635, which arms are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed to the rules and orders of that eſtabliſhment printed 1636. Previous to it's being ſet on foot, a committee had been appointed in the Houſe of Lords, conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Duke of Buckingham and others, for taking into conſideration the ſtate of the public ſchools and method of education. What progreſs was made by this committee is not known, but probably the Muſeum Minervae owed it's riſe to it.</note> But it fell to the ground with the reſt of the King's
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0853300502:80"/>
plans and attempts—and ſo great was the inveteracy to him, that it
ſeems to have become part of the religion of the time to war on the
arts, becauſe they had been countenanced at court. The parliament
began to ſell the pictures at York-houſe ſo early as 1645, but leſt the
neceſſity of their affairs ſhould not be thought ſufficient juſtification,
they coloured it over with a piece of fanatic bigotry that was perfectly
ridiculous; paſſing the following votes among others July 23. <note n="*" place="bottom">Journal of the Commons.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Ordered, that all ſuch pictures and ſtatues there (York-houſe) as are
without any ſuperſtition, ſhall be forthwith ſold, for the benefit of Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
and the North.</p>
               <p>Ordered, that all ſuch pictures there, as have the repreſentation of
the ſecond perſon in trinity upon them, ſhall be forthwith burnt.</p>
               <p>Ordered, that all ſuch pictures there, as have the repreſentation of
the Virgin Mary upon them, ſhall be forthwith burnt.</p>
               <p>This was a worthy contraſt to Archbiſhop Laud, who made a ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber-buſineſs
of a man who broke ſome painted glaſs in the cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dral
at Saliſbury. The cauſe of liberty was then, and is always, the
only cauſe that can excuſe a civil war: yet if Laud had not doated on
trifles, and the preſbyterians been ſqueamiſh about them, I queſtion
whether the nobler motives would have had ſufficient influence to ſave
us from arbitrary power. They are the ſlighteſt objects that make the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0853300502:81"/>
deepeſt impreſſion on the people. They ſeldom fight for a liberty of
doing what they have a right to do, but becauſe they are prohibited or
enjoined ſome folly that they have or have not a mind to do. One co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical
inſtance of the humour of thoſe times I find in Aubrey's hiſtory
of Surrey; <note n="*" place="bottom">Vol. ii, page 30.</note> one Bleeſe was hired for half-a-crown a day to break the
painted glaſs windows of the church of Croydon. The man probably
took care not to be too expeditious in the deſtruction.</p>
               <p>Immediately after the death <note n="†" place="bottom">I cannot help inſerting a ſhort remark here, though foreign to the purpoſe. The very day after the execution of the King, was paſſed this vote, "Ordered, That the Lord Grey be deſired, out of Haberdaſher's-hall, to diſpoſe of one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pounds for the ſervice of the commonwealth, <hi>as he ſhall think fit</hi>: and that the committee at Haberdaſher's-hall be required forthwith to pay the ſame to the ſaid Lord Grey for that purpoſe." This order is ſo covertly worded, without any particular application, at the ſame time that the ſum is ſo ſmall for any public ſervice, that joined to the circumſtance of time and the known zeal of the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter, I cannot doubt but this was intended for the reward of the executioner. Mr. Weſt has an authentic account of the execution, in which it is ſaid, that Richard Brandon, the executioner, having ſound in the King's pocket an orange ſtuck with cloves, was offered 20 ſhillings for it; which he refuſed, but ſold it for ten on his way home.</note> of the King, ſeveral votes were paſſed
for ſale of his goods, pictures, ſtatues, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Feb. 20, 1648. It was referred to the committee of the navy to raiſe
money by ſale of the crown, jewels, hangings, and other goods of the
late King.</p>
               <p>Two days after, Cromwell, who, as ſoon as he was poſſeſſed of the
ſole power, ſtopped any farther <note n="‡" place="bottom">Ludlow prevented the ſale of Hampton-court, for which he was much blamed by ſome of his friends. V. Biogr. Brit. vol. 5. p. 3024.</note> diſperſion of the royal collection, and
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:0853300502:82"/>
who even in this trifling inſtance gave an indication of his views, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
from the council of ſtate, that divers goods belonging to the
ſtate were in danger of being embezzled; which notification was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
followed by this order;</p>
               <p>That the care of the public library at St. James's and of the ſtatues
and pictures there, be committed to the council of ſtate, to be preſerved
by them.</p>
               <p>However, in the enſuing month, <note n="*" place="bottom">March 23, 1648.</note> the houſe proceeded to vote, that
the perſonal eſtate <note n="†" place="bottom">Somerſet-houſe had a narrow eſcape during that luſt of deſtruction, of which an account is preſerved in a very ſcarce tract, intituled, "An Eſſay on the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of God in the harmony of the times that preceded Chriſt, and how they met in him, written in French by John D'Eſpagne miniſter of the goſpel [who died in 1650] and now publiſhed in Engliſh by his executor Henry Browne, London, 1662, octavo." In the preface the editor tells us, "that the author preached at the French church in Durham-houſe, where his ſermons were followed by many of the nobility and gentry. That demoliſhed, he ſays, it pleaſed God to touch the hearts of the nobility to procure us an order of the Houſe of Peers to exerciſe our devotions at Somerſet-houſe-chapel, which was the cauſe, not only of driving away the Anabaptiſts, Quakers and other ſects, that had got in there, but alſo hindered the pulling down of Somerſet-houſe, there having been twice an order from the late uſurped powers for ſelling the ſaid houſe; but we prevailed ſo, that we ſtill got order to exempt the chapel from being ſold, which broke the deſign of thoſe that had bought the ſaid houſe, who thought for their improvement to have made a ſtreet from the garden thro' the ground the chapel ſtands on, and ſo up the back yard to the great ſtreet of the Strand by pulling down the ſaid chapel."</note> of the late King, Queen and Prince ſhould be inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toried,
appraiſed and ſold, except ſuch parcels of them as ſhould be
thought fit to be reſerved for the uſe of the ſtate; and it was referred
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:0853300502:83"/>
to the council of ſtate to conſider and direct, what parcels of the goods
and perſonal eſtates aforeſaid were fit to be reſerved for the uſe of the
ſtate. Certain commiſſioners were at the ſame time appointed to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventory,
ſecure and appraiſe the ſaid goods, and others, <hi>not members of
the houſe,</hi> were appointed to make ſale of the ſaid eſtates to the beſt va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue.
The receipts were to go towards ſatisfying the debts and ſervants
of the King, Queen and Prince, provided ſuch ſervants had not been
delinquents; the reſt to be applied to public uſes; the firſt thirty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
pounds to be appropriated to the navy. This vote in which they
ſeem to have acted honeſtly, not allowing their own members to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
in the ſale, was the cauſe that the collection fell into a variety
of low hands, and were diſperſed among the painters and officers of
the late King's houſhold, where many of them remained on ſale with
low prices affixed. The principal pieces were rated more highly, and
ſome of them were even ſold above their valuation.</p>
               <p>Ireton on the 2d of June 1648 reported the act for ſale, and mention
is made of ſome propoſition of Captain Myldmay concerning the pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
and ſtatues, to be referred to the council of ſtate. This propoſal
it ſeems had been accepted but was revoked. Probably this perſon
might be an agent of Cromwell to prevent the diſperſion. Cromwell
had greater matters to attend to; the ſale proceeded. Two years after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
viz. in October and November 1650, the journals ſpeak of ſums
of money received from the ſale of the King's goods, and of various
applications of the money towards diſcharge of his debts. From that
time I find no farther mention of the collection in the records.</p>
               <p>With regard to the jewels, the parliament immediately after the
King's death ordered the crown and ſceptres, &amp;c. to be locked up.
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:0853300502:84"/>
The Queen had already ſold ſeveral jewels abroad to raiſe money and
buy arms, Some had been ſold in foreign countries early in the King's
reign, particularly what was called the ineſtimable collar of rubies; <note n="*" place="bottom">There is a long warrant in Rymer directing the delivery of this collar, there termed <hi>the great collar of ballaſt rubies,</hi> and ſundry other valuable jewels, to the Duke of Buckingham and Earl of Holland to be diſpoſed of by them beyond the ſeas, according to private orders which they had received from his majeſty. The whole piece is curious, and mentions the danger there might be to the keepers of thoſe jewels to let them go out of their hands, <hi>as they were of great value, and had long contynued as it were in a continual diſcent for many years togeather with the crowne of England.</hi> Foedera vol. xviii, p. 236.

medal of him in Evelyn. His George, diamond and ſeales, which
Charles at his execution deſtined to his ſucceſſor, the parliament voted
ſhould not be ſo delivered. A pearl which he always wore in his ear,
as may be ſeen in his portrait on horſeback by Vandyck, was taken out
after his death, and is in the collection of the Ducheſs of Portland, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted

was given to the Earl of Portland by King William. <note n="†" place="bottom">Tavernier book iv. chap. 17. mentions having a diamond on which were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graved the arms of Charles I.

The ſtory, as he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated it before, in book ii. chap. 10. was, that Reville having told the Sophy that he had commanded a company of guards in the ſervice of Charles, and being aſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed why he came into Perſia, replied, that it was to diſſipate the chagrin he felt on his maſter being put to death, and that ſince that time he cou'd not endure to live in Chriſtendom. The Sophy fell into a rage, and aſked Reville, how it was poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, if he was captain of the King's guards, that he and all his men ſhou'd not have ſhed the laſt drop of their blood in defence of their Prince? Reville was thrown into priſon and remained there 22 days, and eſcaped at laſt by the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of the Sophy's eunuchs.—Had all Charles's ſoldiers been as loyal as the Perſian Monarch thought it their duty to be, we might now have the glory of being as faithfull ſlaves as the Aſiatics.</note>

A catalogue of the pictures, ſtatues, goods, tapeſtries and jewels,
with the ſeveral prices at which they were valued and ſold, was diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
ſome years ago in Moorfields, and fell into the hands of the late
Sir John Stanley, who permitted Mr. Vicechamberlain Cook, Mr. Fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fax
and Mr. Kent to take copies, from one of which Vertue obtained
a tranſcript. The particulars are too numerous to inſert here. The

pages at the beginning relating to the plate and jewels were wanting,
and other pages here and there were miſſing. Large quantities were
undoubtedly ſecreted and embezzled, and part remained unſold by the
acceſſion of Cromwell, who lived both at Whitehall and Hampton-court.
All other furniture from all the King's palaces was brought
up and expoſed to ſale; there are ſpecified particularly Denmark or So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſet-houſe,

to have amounted to a far greater ſum than an hundred and eighteen
thouſand pounds. <note n="*" place="bottom">R.

               <p>The ſale continued to Auguſt 9, 1653. The prices were fixed, but
if more was offered, the higheſt bidder purchaſed; this happened in
ſome inſtances, not in many. Part of the goods were ſold by inch of
candle. The buyers, called contractors, ſigned a writing for the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
ſums. If they diſliked the bargain, they were at liberty to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
from the agreement on paying one fourth of the ſum ſtipu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated.

Among the contractors appears Mr. John Leigh, who on Auguſt 1,

the Lady Cromwell goods to the amount of two hundred pounds
more. But no ſooner was Cromwell in poſſeſſion of the ſole power,
than he not only prevented any farther ſale, but even detained from
the purchaſers much of what they had contracted for. This appears
by a <note n="*" place="bottom">Copied by Vertue from a paper in poſſeſſion of Mr. Martin.</note> petition, addreſſed, after the protector's death, to the council of

the ſaid goods, they having been great ſufferers by the late General
Cromwell's detaining thereof; and the petitioners, &amp;c."</p>
               <p>The goods ſpecified are hangings, and ſtatues in the garden at

               <p>Whence Charles had his ſtatues we learn from Peacham; "The
King alſo, ſays he, ever ſince his coming to the crown hath amply
teſtified a royal liking of ancient ſtatues, by cauſing a whole army of

Digby Knight." <note n="*" place="bottom">Compleat Gentleman, 107.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Some of the moſt capital pictures were purchaſed by the King of
Spain, which arriving there while the Embaſſadors of Charles II. were
at that court, they were deſired, by an odd kind of delicacy, to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw,
they ſuppoſing that this diſmiſſion was owing to an account re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
at the ſame time of Cromwell's victory over the Marquis of
Argyle; "but, ſays Lord Clarendon, <note n="†" place="bottom">In his life p. 119. fol. edit.</note> they knew afterwards that the
true cauſe of this impatience to get rid of them, was that their miniſter
in England, having purchaſed many of the King's pictures and rich
furniture, had ſent them to the Groyne; from whence they were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
to arrive about that time at Madrid; which they thought could
not decently be brought to the palace while the ambaſſadors remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at the court."</p>
               <p>After the reſtoration endeavours were uſed to reaſſemble the ſpoils.
A commiſſion was iſſued out to examine Hugh Peters concerning the
diſpoſal of the pictures, jewels, &amp;c. that had belonged to the royal fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
but without effect, by the obſtinacy or ignorance of Peters, who
would not or could not give the deſired ſatisfaction. <note n="‡" place="bottom">See General Dict. vol. ii. p. 384.</note> Some of the pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
had been purchaſed by Gerard Reyntz, <note n="‖" place="bottom">They are engraved in Reyntz's gallery.</note> a Dutch collector, after
whoſe death they were bought of his widow by the ſtates and preſented

to Charles II. One only picture [the King on horſeback by Vandyck]
was recovered by a proceſs at law from Remèe or Remigius Van
Leemput, a painter then in England, who had bought it at the ſale.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding the havoc that had been made, it is plain from the
catalogue of the collection of James II. that the crown ſtill poſſeſſed a
great number of valuable pictures, but the fire of Whitehall deſtroyed
almoſt all that the rage of civil war had ſpared. Some valuable pieces
indeed were carried to Liſbon from Somerſet-houſe by the Queen
Dowager, when ſhe returned to Portugal. The then Lord Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain,
it is ſaid, put a ſtop to their embarkation, 'till mollified by the
preſent of one of them that he admired.</p>
               <p>The royal library eſcaped better: This was founded by James I. It
contained the collection belonging to the crown, among which were ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
fine editions on vellom, ſent as preſents from abroad, on the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoration
of learning, to Henry VII. Henry VIII. and Queen Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth;
the library of the Lord Lumley, purchaſed by James for Prince
Henry, the collection of Caſaubon bought of his widow, and ſome cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
MSS. brought from Conſtantinople by Sir Thomas Roe. Theſe
books have been given to the Britiſh Muſeum by his late majeſty. To
this library Prince Henry had added a large number of coins, medals,
cameos and intaglias, the Dactyliotheca of Gorlaeus. Mr. Young, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brarian
to Charles I. <note n="*" place="bottom">In this library, ſays Perinchief, was kept a collection of his, of the excellent ſayings of authors, written by his own hand, and in his youth, preſented to his father King James. Life of Charles p. 219.</note> was removed by the council of ſtate in 1649, at
which time an account of the books and coins was taken; of the latter
there were 1200, of which 400 only remained at the reſtoration.
Among the Duke of Ormond's letters is one dated April 2, 1649,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:0853300502:91"/>
where he ſays, "All the rarities in the King's library at St. James's
are vaniſhed." Yet it is evident many remained, for in June 1659 a
Vote paſſed "that the Lord Whitlocke be deſired and authorized to
take upon him the care and cuſtody of the library at James-houſe, and
of all the books, manuſcripts and medals, that are in or belonging to
the ſaid library, that the ſame be ſafely kept and preſerved, and to
recover all ſuch as have been embezzled or taken out of the ſame."
Charles II. after his return ordered Aſhmole <note n="*" place="bottom">Memoires of El. Aſhmole prefixed to his Berkſhire; p. 10. 24.</note> to draw up an account
of the medals that were left, and placed them in the cloſet of Henry

The King taking the part of a prieſt, who pretended that his majeſty had a right to a rectory which the Earl challenged as his, Arundel ſaid to Charles, "Sir, this rectory was an appendent to a manour of mine, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till my grandfather unfortunately loſt both his life and ſeventeen lordſhips more, for the love he bore to your grandmother."

Living much within himſelf, but in all the ſtate of the ancient
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:0853300502:92"/>
nobility, his chief amuſement was his collection, the very ruins of
which are ornaments now to ſeveral principal cabinets. He was the
firſt who profeſſedly began to collect in this country, and led the way
to Prince Henry, King Charles, and the Duke of Buckingham. "I
cannot, ſays Peacham, <note n="*" place="bottom">Compleat Gentleman p. 107.</note> but with much reverence mention the every

for his high birth and place; to whoſe <note n="†" place="bottom">In one of R. Symondes's pocket-books in the muſeum is a character not quite ſo favourable of the Earl. "Mai, ſays he, rimunerò perſona. Era molto generoſo e libero a foraſtieri per guadagnare fama, ed in quella coſa ſpendea libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramente." There are alſo the following hints. "Old Earle fece rubare pezzo di quel quadro di Veroneſe a Padova, but it was ſpoiled, ſays Mr. Jer. Lanier. Laſt Earl Thomas, molto lodato di Jer.

and galleries of Arundel-houſe about twenty <note n="‡" place="bottom">This was printed in 1634.</note> years ago, and hath
ever ſince continued to tranſplant old Greece into England." The
perſon chiefly employed by the Earl in theſe reſearches was Mr. Petty.
It appears from Sir Thomas Roe's letters, who had a commiſſion of the
like nature from the Duke of Buckingham, <note n="‖" place="bottom">"Neither am I, ſays the Duke, ſo fond of antiquity, as you rightly conjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to court it in a deformed or miſhapen ſtone." Page 534.</note> that no man was ever

all things that may obtain his ends." Mr. Petty returning with his
collection from Samos, narrowly eſcaped with his life in a great ſtorm,
but loſt all his curioſities, and was impriſoned for a ſpy, but obtaining
his liberty purſued his ſearches.</p>
               <p>Many curious pieces of painting and antiquities, eſpecially medals,
the Earl bought of Henry Vanderborcht a painter of Bruſſels, who
lived at Frankendal, and whoſe ſon Henry, Lord Arundel finding at
Frankfort, ſent to Mr. Petty then collecting for him in Italy, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
kept in his ſervice as long as he lived. Vanderborcht the
younger was both painter and graver; he drew many of the Arunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian
curioſities, and etched ſeveral things both in that and the royal
collection. A book of his drawings from the former, containing 567
pieces, is preſerved at Paris, and is deſcribed in the catalogue of L'oran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerie
p. 199. After the death of the Earl, the younger Henry entered
into the ſervice of the Prince of Wales, afterwards Charles II. and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved

Hollar at Prague and brought him over, where the latter engraved a
great number of plates from pictures, drawings and curioſities in the
Arundelian collection. There is a ſet of ſmall prints by Hollar, views

Evelyn, that one who could not deſign a little, would never make an
honeſt man." A fooliſh obſervation enough, and which, if he had
not left better proofs, would give one as little opinion of the judgment
of the ſpeaker, as it does of that of the relator. The Earl ſeems to
have had in his ſervice another painter, one Harriſon, now only known
to us by a chronologic diary, in which he records particulars relating
to old Parr, whom Lord Arundel had a curioſity to ſee. <note n="§" place="bottom">See Peck's collection of divers curious hiſtoric 1 pieces, ſubjoined to his lives of Cromwell and Milton.

He replied, "I did penance when I was an hundred years old."</note>

cameo, the marriage of Cupid and Pſyche, which I ſhould not
ſcruple to pronounce the fineſt remain of antique ſculpture in that
kind. The coins and medals came into the poſſeſſion of Thomas
Earl of Winchelſea, and in 1696 were ſold by his executors to Mr.
Thomas Hall. Arundel-houſe was pulled down in 1678. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder

Earl had deſigned too to have a large picture, like that at Wilton, of
himſelf and family: Vandyck actually made the deſign, but by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervention
of the troubles it was executed only in ſmall by Ph. Frutiers

                  <note n="*" place="bottom">This extract is chiefly made from Felibien. vol. iii. p. 404. from Deſcamps, p. 297. and Sandrart.</note> His father was doctor of laws and ſenator of Antwerp, which he
quitted on the troubles of that country and retired with his family to
Cologn, where on the feaſt of St. Peter and Paul his wife was delivered
of Rubens in 1577. Great care was taken of his education; he learned
and ſpoke Latin in perfection. When Antwerp was reduced by the
arms of Philip, Rubens the father returned to his native country.
The ſon was grown up, and was well made. The Counteſs of Lalain
took him for her page, but he had too elevated a diſpoſition to throw
away his talents on ſo diſſipated a way of life. He quitted that ſervice,
and his father being dead, his mother conſented to let him purſue his
paſſion for painting. Toby Verhaeſt, a landſcape-painter, and Adam
Van Oort were his firſt maſters, and then Otho Venius, under whom
he imbibed (one of his leaſt merits) a taſte for allegory. The perplexed
and ſilly emblems of Venius are well known. Rubens with nobler ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity
is perhaps leſs juſt in his. One may call ſome of his pictures
<hi>a toleration of all religions.</hi> In one of the compartments of the Luxem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh
gallery, a cardinal introduces Mercury to Mary de' Medici, and
Hymen ſupports her train at the ſacrament of marriage, before an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar
on which are the images of God the Father and Chriſt. <note n="†" place="bottom">See more on this ſubject at the end of Mr. Spence's Polymetis.</note> At the
age of twenty-three Rubens ſet out for Italy, and entered into the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of Vincent Gonzaga Duke of Mantua. One day while he was at
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:0853300502:101"/>
that court, and was painting the ſtory of Turnus and Aeneas, intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to warm his imagination by the rapture of poetry, he repeated
with energy thoſe lines of Virgil. <note n="*" place="bottom">No wonder his emulation was raiſed at Mantua, where the works of Homer were treated by Raphael and Julio Romano.</note>
                  <q>Ille etiam patriis agmen ciet, &amp;c.</q>
The Duke who over heard him and entered the chamber, was ſurpriz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to find the mind of his painter cultivated with a variety of gracefull
litterature. Rubens was named Envoy to Spain, and carried magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
preſents to the favorite Duke of Lerma; exerting at that court his
political and elegant talents with a dignity and propriety that raiſed
the latter without debaſing the former. He converſed little with the
painters of that country except Velaſquez, with whom he continued a
correſpondence of letters.</p>
               <p>The fame of the young painter reached Don John of Braganza, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
King of Portugal, who invited him to Villa Vicioſa. Rubens
ſet out with ſuch a train, that the Duke apprehended the expence of
entertaining ſo pompous a viſitor, and wrote to ſtop his journey, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying
the excuſe with a preſent of fifty piſtoles. The painter
refuſed the preſent, ſaid he had not propoſed to paint, but to paſs a
week at Villa Vicioſa, and had brought a thouſand piſtoles that he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to ſpend there.</p>
               <p>Returned to Mantua, the Duke ſent him to Rome to copy the
works of the great maſters. There he ſtudied them, not what they
had ſtudied, the ancients; Rubens was too careleſs of the antique as
Pouſſin copied it too ſervilely. The former ſeemed never to have ſeen
a ſtatue, the latter nothing elſe. The reputation of Titian and Paul
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:0853300502:102"/>
Veroneſe drew Rubens to Venice; there he was in his element, in the
empire of colours. There he learned to imitate nature; at Rome he
had miſſed the art of improving on it. If he has not the ſimplicity of
Titian, he has far more than Paul Veroneſe. The buildings with
which he has enriched the back grounds of his compoſitions, do not
yield to thoſe of the latter; his landſcapes are at leaſt equal to thoſe of
the former. Seldom as he practiced it, Rubens was never greater
than in landſcape; the tumble of his rocks and trees, the deep ſhadows
in his glades and glooms, the watery ſunſhine, and dewy verdure, ſhow
a variety of genius, which are not to be found in the inimitable but
uniform glow of Claud Lorrain.</p>
               <p>Rubens was much worſe employed at Genoa, where he drew moſt
of their palaces, and cauſed them to be engraved in two volumes.
How could a genius like his overlook the ruins of Rome, the deſigns
of Raphael and Michael Angelo, and the reſtorers of ancient architec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
at Venice, and waſte his time on the very moderate beauties that
he found at Genoa, where their greateſt art lay in crowding magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
into a narrow and almoſt uſeleſs ſituation? where moſt of their
palaces can only be ſeen from a ſedan chair!</p>
               <p>His mother's illneſs drew him back to Antwerp, where the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duke
Albert detained him, and where he married his firſt wife Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth
Brants. He built a palace and painted it within and without.
His cabinet or rotunda was enriched with antique vaſes, ſtatues, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals
and pictures. The Duke of Buckingham ſaw and coveted it. Le
Blond, whom I have mentioned in the life of Holbein, negotiated the
bargain, to which Rubens conſented with regret. The favorite, who
was bent on the purchaſe, gave, it is ſaid, ten thouſand pounds for what
had not coſt above a thouſand.</p>

                  <pb n="90" facs="tcp:0853300502:103"/>
In Flanders he executed many great works, which created him as
many enemies. They affected to aſcribe to the ſcholars whom he had
formed or been forced to take to aſſiſt him, as Jordaens, Van Uden,
Snyder, and Wildens, the merits of the maſter—but the greater the
talents of the aſſiſtants, the higher the genius of the maſter. Do able
painters work under an indifferent one? Abraham Janſſens challenged
Rubens to a trial of their art; Rubens replied he would engage with
him, when Janſſens had proved himſelf worthy to be his competitor.
A more friendly offer was rejected by him with equal wit. A chymiſt
tendered him a ſhare of his laboratory and of his hopes of the philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher's
ſtone. Rubens carried the viſionary into his painting room, and
told him his offer was dated twenty years too late, "for ſo long it is,
ſaid he, ſince I found the art of making gold with my pallet and pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils."</p>
               <p>From Antwerp he was called to Paris by Mary de' Medici, and
painted the oſtenſible hiſtory of her life in the Luxemburgh. <note n="*" place="bottom">It is ſaid that ſhe deſigned he ſhould fill another gallery with the ſtory of Henry IV. her huſband, and that he had begun ſeveral of the compartments, but the troubles of that Princeſs prevented the execution.

her ſome leſſons in drawing. If the prodigious number of large pieces
painted by Rubens were not teſtimonies of the abundance and facility
of his genius, this gallery alone, compleated in three years, would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate
it. As ſoon as it was finiſhed, he returned to Antwerp,
where his various talents were ſo conſpicuous, that he was pitched upon
to negotiate a treaty of peace between Spain and England. The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanta

himſelf ſo much with the Conde-Due D'olivarez, that beſides many
valuable preſents, he had a brevet for himſelf and his ſon of ſecretary
of the Privy-council, and was diſmiſſed with a ſecret commiſſion to
King Charles, as I have mentioned before, in which he had the honour
of ſucceeding.</p>
               <p>Neither Charles nor Rubens overlooked in the Embaſſador the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents
of the Painter. The King engaged him to paint the cieling of
the Banquetting-houſe. The deſign is the apotheoſis of King James,
for whom, when once deified, there ſeems to have been no farther
thought of erecting a monument. The original ſketch for the middle
compartment is preſerved at Houghton: It had belonged to Sir God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey
Kneller, who often ſtudied it, as is evident by Sir Godfrey's ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
ſketch, at Houghton too, for the great equeſtrian picture of King
William at Hampton-court, though in the larger piece he ſeems to
have forgot that he ever had ſtudied the former deſign. Sir Godfrey
had heard that Jordaens aſſiſted Rubens in the execution; if true,
ſome of the compartments muſt have been painted in Holland and
ſent over hither, for I do not find that Jordaens was ever in England.
Rubens received three thouſand pounds for his work. The building

are two; one, the Aſſumption of the Virgin, painted for the Earl
of Arundel while Rubens was in England, and with which he was ſo
pleaſed himſelf, that he afterwards made a large picture from it for a
convent at Antwerp. The other contains four children, Chriſt, an
Angel, St. John, and a girl repreſenting the church. This picture
which is far ſuperior to the foregoing, and very fine, is ſaid in the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue
to be allowed to be the beſt picture in England of Rubens; an
hyperbole indeed. <note n="†" place="bottom">See Kennedy's account of Wilton, p. 76. 79.</note> At the Earl of Pomfret's at Eaſton was a portrait
of Lodowic Duke of Richmond and Lenox. At Houghton is that
maſterly piece, Mary Magdalen anointing the feet of Chriſt; and a
large cartoon of Meleager and Atalanta. There too are three pieces
in three different ſtyles, in each of which he excelled, a landſcape; and
ſatyrs; and lions. Animals, eſpecially of the ſavage kind, he painted
beyond any maſter that ever lived. In his ſatyrs, though highly co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured
and with characteriſtic countenances, he wanted poetic imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
They do not ſeem a ſeperate ſpecies, but a compound of the
human and animal, in which each part is kept too diſtinct. His fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male
ſatyrs are ſcarce more indelicate than his women; one would
think that, like Swift, he did not intend that Yahoos ſhould be too diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criminate
from human nature; though what the ſatyrist drew from
ſpleen, flowed in the painter from an honeſt love of fleſh and blood.

this piece Rubens has borrowed the head of an old man from the
cripple in one of the cartoons, of which I have ſaid he gave informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

Wimbleton is a fine portrait of Cardinal Howard. At Burleigh is an
Ebony Cabinet the front and Sides of which are painted by Rubens;
at one End are his three Wives, highly coloured.</p>
               <p>I do not find how long Rubens ſtayed in England, probably not
above a year. He died of the gout in his own country in 1640. A

Duke of Newcaſtle, whoſe managed horſes he drew from the life, from
whence were engraved the cuts that adorn that Peer's book of horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip.
Several of the original pictures ſtill remain in the hall at

admired for painting flowers in ſmall, and for her needleworks in ſilk.
Vandyck was firſt placed with Van Balen, who had ſtudied at Rome,
and painted figures both in large and ſmall; but the fame of Rubens
drew away to a nobler ſchool the young congenial artiſt. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs
of the diſciple ſpeedily raiſed him to the glory of aſſiſting in the
works from which he learned. Fame that always ſuppoſes jealouſy is

Vandyck to apply himſelf chiefly to portraits. I ſhall ſhow that jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy,

the maſter. If Rubens gave the advice in queſtion, he gave it with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;

three hiſtories, and the famous portrait of the latter's wife, ſet out for
Italy, and made his firſt reſidence at Genoa. From thence he went to
Venice, which one may call the metropolis of the Flemiſh painters,
who ſeem ſo naturally addicted to colouring, that even in Italy they
ſee only with Flemiſh eyes. Vandyck imbibed ſo deeply the tints of
Titian, that he is allowed to approach nearer to the carnations of that
maſter even than Rubens; Sir Anthony had more delicacy than the
latter, but like him never reached the grace and dignity of the antique.
He ſeldom even arrived at beauty. His Madonnas are homely; his
ladies ſo little flattered, that one is ſurprized he had ſo much cuſtom.
He has left us to wonder that the famous Counteſs of Carliſle could be
thought ſo charming; and had not Waller been a better painter, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſſa
would make little impreſſion now. One excellence he had,
which no portrait-painter ever attained except Sir Godfrey Kneller;
the hands are often the fineſt part of his pictures.</p>
               <p>He went to Rome and lived ſplendidly, avoiding the low converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his countrymen, and diſtinguiſhed by the appellation of the
<hi>Pittore Cavaliereſco.</hi> It was at Rome he drew that capital portrait of
Cardinal Bentivoglio, who having been Nuncio in Flanders, had a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality
for their artiſts, and as he celebrated their hiſtory with his pen,
was in return almoſt immortalized by one of their beſt pencils.</p>
               <p>Vandyck, while at Rome, received an invitation to Palermo, and
went thither. There he painted Prince Philibert of Savoy, the Vice-Roy,
and a paintreſs of ſome name, <note n="*" place="bottom">At the Lord Spenſer's at Wimbledon is a good portrait of Sophoniſba An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſciola playing on a harpſichord, painted by herſelf, and an old woman attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her; on the picture is written, Juſſu Patris.

he returned to Genoa, where he had gained the higheſt reputation,
and where he has left many conſiderable works.</p>
               <p>He went back to Antwerp, and practiced both hiſtory and portrait.
Of the former kind were many applauded Altar-pieces; in the latter,
were particularly the heads of his cotemporary artiſts. He drew them
in Chiaro ſcuro on ſmall pannels, thirty-five of which are in the collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Counteſs of Cardigan at Whitehall. Admirable is the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
of attitudes and airs of heads; but in thoſe pieces he meaned to
ſurpaſs as well as record. The whole collection has been thrice
publiſhed; the firſt edition by Vanden Enden contains fourſcore plates;
the ſecond by Giles Hendrix, one hundred; the laſt by Verduſſen,
who effaced the names and letters of the original engravers. Some of
the plates were etched by Vandyck himſelf. I ſay nothing of the
numbers of prints from his other works.</p>
               <p>Hearing of the favour King Charles ſhowed to the arts, Vandyck
came to England, and lodged with his friend Geldorp, a painter,
hoping to be introduced to the King; it is extraordinary he was not.
He went away chagrined; but his majeſty ſoon learning what a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
had been within his reach, ordered Sir Kenelm Digby, who had
ſat to Vandyck, to invite him over. He came, and was lodged among
the King's artiſts at Black-fryars, which Felibien, according to the
dignity of ignorance which the French affect, calls <hi>L'Hotel de Blaifore.</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Vol. iii, page 445.</note>
Thither the King went often by water, and viewed his performances
with ſingular delight, frequently ſitting to him himſelf, and beſpeaking
pictures of the Queen, his children and his courtiers, and conferring the

was ſoon attended by the grant of an annuity of 200<hi>l.</hi> a year for life.
The patent is preſerved in the rolls, and dated 1633, in which he is

               <p>Of the various portraits by Vandyck of King Charles, the principal
are, a whole length in the coronation robes at Hampton-court; <note n="†" place="bottom">In the ſame palace are whole lengths of James I. his Queen, the Queen of Bohemia, and Prince Henry, copied by Vandyck from painters of the preceding reign. Prince Henry's is in armour, in which Vandyck excelled, has an amiable countenance, and is a fine picture.</note> the
head has been engraved by Vertue among the Kings of England. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in armour on a dun horſe at Blenheim. <note n="‡" place="bottom">This was in the royal collection, was ſold in the civil war, and was bought by the Duke of Marlborough from Munich.</note> A whole length in armour
at Houghton. Another, a large piece at the Duke of Grafton's, in which
the King (a moſt gracefull figure) in white ſattin, with his hat on, is juſt
deſcended from his horſe; at a diſtance, a view of the Iſle of Wight.
The <note n="‖" place="bottom">This is the picture that was recovered from Remèe.</note> King in armour on a white horſe, Monſ. de St. Antoine, <note n="§" place="bottom">He had been a chief equerry to Prince Henry, and led a mourning horſe at his funeral. See Birch's life of that Prince, append. 527.</note> his
equerry, holding his helmet. The head of the latter is fine; the King's
is probably not an original. This and the following are at each end of
the gallery at Kenſington. The King and Queen ſitting, Prince Charles,

very young ſtanding at his knee; the Duke of York, an infant, on hers. <note n="*" place="bottom">This picture has been heightened to make it match it's oppoſite.</note>
At Turin is another whole length of the King, in a large piece of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitecture.
At Somerſet-houſe, the King and Queen, half lengths,
holding a crown of laurel between them. At Windſor is a beautifull
half length of the Queen in white. Many portraits of her pretend to
be by Vandyck, but none are ſo lovely as this. He two or three times
drew Prince Charles in armour ſtanding. At Kenſington in one piece
are Prince Charles, Prince James, and the Princeſs Mary; lately en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graved
by Strange. In the ſame palace is one of his fineſt works;
George Villiers, the ſecond Duke of Buckingham, and Lord Francis
his brother, when children. Nothing can exceed the nature, luſtre,
and delicacy of this ſweet picture. At Houghton are two young
daughters of the Lord Wharton, admirable too, but rather inferior to
the foregoing. In Lord Orford's collection are ſeveral principal works <note n="†" place="bottom">See a particular deſcription of theſe pictures in the Aedes Walpolianae.</note>
of this maſter. The holy family with a dance of Angels; it belonged
to King Charles, is a capital picture, but has it's faults. Inigo Jones,
a head; Rubens's wife in black ſattin; Henry Danvers Earl of Danby
whole length, in the robes of the garter; and a half length of Sir
Thomas Chaloner, governor of Prince Henry. Beſides theſe my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
bought of the laſt Duke the whole collection of the Wharton fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily:
There were twelve whole lengths, the two girls, ſix half lengths,
and two more by Sir Peter Lely; he paid an hundred pounds each for
the whole lengths and the double picture, and fifty pounds each for
the half lengths. Moſt of them were carried to Houghton, but ſome
not ſuiting the places, were brought back, and ſold for a trifle after
the death of my father. Thoſe that remain, are, King Charles, the
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:0853300502:115"/>
Queen, very indifferent, Sir Thomas Wharton: Of the half lengths,
Laud, a celebrated but not very fine picture; Sir Chriſtopher Wandeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,
Lady Wharton, Mrs. Wharton, Mrs. Wenman and the Lely's. <note n="*" place="bottom">The reſt were, Lord Wharton, bought by Lord Royſton; Lady Wharton in white, Lady Cheſterfield, ditto; Counteſs of Worceſter in blue; Lady Rich in black, very handſome, on whoſe death Waller wrote a poem; Mrs. Smith in blue, a homely woman, but a fine picture, now mine; Lady Carliſle, bought by Mr. Weſt; Arthur Goodwin, father of Mrs. Smith, one of the beſt, given by my father to the late Duke of Devonſhire; and two portraits of Prince Rupert, whole and half lengths; both very poor performances. Some of the whole lengths were engraved by Van Gunſt.</note>

               <p>At Cornbury, the ſeat of the Earls of Clarendon in Oxfordſhire, was
a noble collection of portraits of the principal perſons in the reign of
King Charles, many of which were drawn by Vandyck. The collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
has ſince been divided between the Ducheſs of Queenſberry, Lady
Hyde and Lady Mary Forbes, the heireſſes of the family. Several
others of his works are at the Earl of Denbigh's and at Lord Spenſer's
at Althrop. Among the latter, a celebrated double whole length of
the firſt Duke of Bedford and the famous Lord Digby, afterwards
Earl of Briſtol. The whole figure of the latter is good, and both the
heads fine; the body of Bedford is flat, nor is this one of his capital
works. Here too is a good picture of Daedalus and Icarus; half
lengths; a fine ſurly impatience in the young man, and his body well
coloured. The Duke of Devonſhire has ſome good pictures by him;
at Chiſwick is the well known <note n="†" place="bottom">Lord Burlington gave 1000<hi>l.</hi> for this picture at Paris, and had another of Luca Jordano into the bargain.</note> Beliſarius, though very doubtfull if by
the hand of Vandyck. The expreſſive figure of the young ſoldier re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deems this picture from the condemnation it would deſerve by the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:0853300502:116"/>
figure being ſo mean and inconſiderable. The Duke has Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyck's
travelling pocket-book in which are ſeveral sketches, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
from Titian, and of Sophoniſba Anguiſciola, mentioned above.</p>
               <p>At Holkham is a large equeſtrian picture of a Count D'Aremberg;
both the rider and horſe are in his beſt manner; and at Earl Cowper's
a large piece of John Count of Naſſau and his family, lately engraved
by Baron.</p>
               <p>Mr. Skinner, with the collection of the late Mr. Thomas Walker,
has a fine little picture of the Lady Venetia Digby, wife of Sir Kenelm;
though only a model for the large one at Windſor; it is exquiſitely fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed.
She is repreſented as treading on Envy and Malice, and is
unhurt by a ſerpent that twines round her arm. This galant compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is a little explained in the new life of Lord Clarendon, who men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
Sir Kenelm's marriage with a Lady, "though of an extraordinary
beauty, of as extraordinary fame." <note n="*" place="bottom">There is an elegy and epitaph on this Lady in Randolph's poems, page 28, in which her beauty is exceedingly commended. She was daughter and co-heireſs of Sir Edward Stanley, grandſon of Edward Earl of Derby, by the Lady Lucy Percy, daughter of Thomas Earl of Northumberland. Lady Venetia was found dead in her bed. Sir Kenelm erected for her a monument of black marble with her buſt in copper gilt, and a lofty epitaph, in Chriſt-church without Newgate; but it was deſtroyed in the fire of London. Lodge's peerage of Ireland. vol. iv, p. 89. There are two copper buſts of the Lady Venetia extant at Mr. Wright's at Gothurſt in Buckinghamſhire, with ſeveral portraits of the family of Digby. The houſe belonged to Sir Kenelm, and was purchaſed by Sir Nathan Wright.</note> Mr. Walker's collection was
chiefly choſen for him by a ſet of virtuoſi called Vandyck's or the club
of St. Luke, and it is plain from the pictures they recommended, that
they underſtood what they profeſſed. There was another large piece
of Sir Kenelm, his lady and two children, in the collection of the Earl
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:0853300502:117"/>
of Oxford; and a fine half length of Sir Kenelm alone is at Kenſington.
Vandyck painted too for the King a twelfth Roman Emperor, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
the ſet of Titian, in the room of one which was ſpoiled and left
at Mantua. They coſt the King 100<hi>l.</hi> a piece, and after his death
were bought by the Spaniſh Embaſſador, the firſt purchaſer of thoſe
effects. As the King's collection was embezzled or taken by his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants

with Harriſon (poſſibly the perſon mentioned p. 75.) the King's em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broiderer
by Somerſet-houſe, and of Murray his taylor he bought a
half figure of a Venus. <note n="*" place="bottom">Theſe and many other notices are taken from the Pocket-books of Richard Symonds of Black-Notley in Eſſex, gent. who was born at Okehampton, and was in the army of King Charles during the civil war, writing memoires of battles, actions, motions, and promotions of officers from time to time in ſmall pocket-books; and through the ſeveral counties he paſſed, memorandums of churches, monuments, painted windows, arms, inſcriptions, &amp;c. 'till January 1, 1648, when he left London, and travelled, firſt to Paris, and then to Rome and Venice (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways continuing his memoires) where he ſtayed 'till his return to England in 1652. Eight or ten of theſe books were in the Harleian library, two in that of Dr. Meade, and two or three in the herald's office, where is the pedigree of his family with his picture (probably) in red wax from a ſeal, engraved by T. Simon, his nameſake, but no relation.</note> The Flemings gave any price for the works
of Vandyck from that collection. Sir Peter Lely, as may be ſeen in
his catalogue, had ſeveral capital ones.</p>
               <p>But it is at the Earl of Pembroke's at Wilton that Vandyck is on
his throne. The great Salon is entirely furniſhed by his hand. There
is that principal picture of Earl Philip and his family, which though
damaged, would ſerve alone as a ſchool of this maſter. Yet with great
admiration of him I cannot but obſerve how ſhort he falls of his model

Cornaro at Northumberland-houſe! How happily is the diſpoſition of
a religious act choſen to throw expreſſion into a groupe of portraits!
It is ſaid that the Earl of Pembroke had obtained leave to have a piece
of the whole royal family by the ſame hand as a companion to his
own.</p>
               <p>At Leiceſter-houſe is a double portrait, bought by the late Prince of
Wales of Mr. Bagnols. It repreſents two of the wits of that time, T.
Carew, of the privy-chamber to Charles I. and a poet, and Henry
Killigrew. They had a remarkable diſpute before Mrs. Cecilia Crofts,
ſiſter of the Lord Crofts, to which Vertue ſuppoſed this picture allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
as in a play called the Wanderer, was a ſong againſt jealouſy,
written on the ſame occaſion.</p>

opinion of this maſter. It is of the Earl of Strafford and his ſecretary,
at the Marquis of Rockingham's at Wentworth-houſe in Yorkſhire.
I can forgive him any inſipid portraits of perhaps inſipid people, when
he ſhowed himſelf capable of conceiving and tranſmitting the idea of
the greateſt man of the age. There is another of theſe pictures at
Blenheim, but infinitely inferior.</p>
               <p>In the cathedral of Gloceſter are two cumbent figures of an alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
and his wife, evidently wrought from a deſign of Vandyck. It
is great pity the ſculptor is not known, ſo ſucceſsfully has he executed
the manner of the painter. The figures, even in that taſteleſs attitude,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:0853300502:119"/>
are eaſy and gracefull, and the draperies have a peculiar freedom. <note n="*" place="bottom">Sanderſon, a quaint writer, uſes a phraſe, which, though affected, is expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive; He ſays "Vandyck was the firſt painter, who e're put ladies dreſs into a careleſs romance."

               </p>
               <p>Vandyck had 40<hi>l.</hi> for a half, and 60<hi>l.</hi> for a whole length; a more
rational proportion than that of our preſent painters, who receive an
equal price for the moſt inſignificant part of the picture.</p>
               <p>He was indefatigable, <note n="†" place="bottom">This is evident by the number of his works, for though he was not above forty-two when he died, they are not exceeded by thoſe of Rubens.</note> and keeping a great table, often detained
the perſons who ſat to him, to dinner, for an opportunity of ſtudying
their countenances, and of retouching their pictures again in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon.
Sir Peter Lely told Mrs. Beale, that Laniere aſſured him he had
ſat ſeven entire days to him morning and evening, and that, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
Vandyck would not once let him look at the picture, 'till he

the King to invite him to England a ſecond time. <note n="‡" place="bottom">It is at the ſeat of the Lord Chancellor Henley at the Grange in Hampſhire.</note>

much wondered at, that he (Vandyck) ſhould openly keep a miſtreſs of
his (Mrs. Lemon) in the houſe and yet ſuffer Porter to keep her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany."
This was Endymion Porter, of the bedchamber to King Charles,
of whom and his family there was a large piece by Vandyck at Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham-houſe. <note n="†" place="bottom">See a liſt of Vandyck's works in Le Comte's cabinet des ſingularitez d' ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitecture, peinture, &amp;c. vol. i, p. 282.

               <p>He was much addicted to his pleaſures and expence; I have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
how well he lived. He was fond of muſick and generous to
muſicians. His luxurious and ſedentary life brought on the gout, and
hurt his fortune. He ſought to repair it, not like his maſter by the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boratory
of his painting room, but by that real folly, the purſuit of the
Philoſopher's ſtone, in which perhaps he was encouraged by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
or advice of his friend Sir Kenelm Digby. Towards the end of
his life the King beſtowed on him for a wife, Mary the daughter of the
unfortunate Lord Gowry, which if meaned as a ſignal honour, might
be calculated too to depreſs the diſgraced family by connecting them
with the blood of a painter. It is certain that the alliance does not ſeem
to have attached Vandyck more ſtrongly to the King; whether he had
any diſguſts infuſed into him by his new wife, or whether ambitious,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:0853300502:121"/>
as I have hinted, of vying with the glory of his maſter in the Luxem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg,
Sir Antony ſoon after his marriage ſet out for Paris, in hopes, of
being employed there in ſome public work. He was diſappointed <note n="*" place="bottom">He was not totally unemployed there Sir Richard Lyttelton has two ſmall pictures in chiaro ſcuro, evidently deſigned for altar-pieces, and repreſenting Anne of Auſtria and ſome monkiſh ſaint.</note>
—their own Pouſſin was then deſervedly the favorite at that court.
Vandyck returned to England, and in the ſame humour of executing
ſome public work, and that in competition with his maſter. He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to the King by Sir Kenelm Digby to paint the walls of the ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quetting-houſe,
of which the cieling was already adorned by Rubens,
with the hiſtory and proceſſion of the order of the garter. The propoſal
ſtruck the King's taſte, and by a ſmall ſketch <note n="†" place="bottom">Now at the Lord Chancellor Henley's at the Grange in Hampſhire.</note> in chiaro ſcuro for the
proceſſion, in which, though very faint, ſome portraits are diſtinguiſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
it looks as if it had been accepted, though ſome ſay it was rejected,
on the extravagant price demanded by Vandyck: I would not ſpecify
the ſum, it is ſo improbable, if I did not find it repeated in Fenton's
notes on Waller. It was fourſcore thouſand pounds! The civil war
prevented farther thoughts of it, as the death of Vandyck would have
interrupted the execution, at leaſt the completion of it. He died in
Black-fryars December 9, 1641, and was buried on the 11th in St.
Paul's near the tomb of John of Gaunt.</p>
               <p>By Maria Ruthven his wife, he left one daughter married to Mr.
Stepney, a gentleman who rode in the horſe-guards on their firſt
eſtabliſhment by Charles II. Their grandſon Mr. Stepney was Envoy
to ſeveral courts, and is known by his poems publiſhed in the collection
of the works of our minor poets. Sir John Stepney, another deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:0853300502:122"/>
died on the road from Bath to Wales in 1748. Lady Vandyck
the widow was married again to Richard Pryſe ſon of Sir John Pryſe
of Newton-Aberbecham in Montgomeryſhire Knight. Richard, who
was created a Baronet Auguſt 9, 1641, was firſt married to Heſther,
daughter of Sir Hugh Middleton; by Vandyck's widow he had no
iſſue. <note n="*" place="bottom">Vertue aſcertained theſe matches by books in the college os arms.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Beſides his legitimate children Vandyck had a natural daughter
called Maria Tereſa, to whom, as appears by his will in Doctor's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
he left four thouſand pounds, then in the hands of his ſiſter
Suſannah Vandyck in a convent at Antwerp, whom he appoints truſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee
for that daughter. To his ſiſter Iſabella he bequeaths 250 guild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
yearly; and in caſe his daughter Maria Tereſa die unmarried, he
entails 4000<hi>l.</hi> on another ſiſter, married to Mr. Derick, and her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.
To his wife Mary and his newborn daughter Juſtiniana Anna
he gives all his goods, effects and monies, due to him in England from
King Charles, the Nobility, and all other perſons whatever, to be equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
divided between them. His executors are his wife, Mr. Aurelius
de Meghan, and Katherine Cowley, to which Katherine he leaves the
care of his daughter to be brought up, allowing ten pounds per ann.
'till ſhe is eighteen years of age. Other legacies he gives to his exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors
and truſtees for their trouble, and three pounds each to the poor
of St. Paul's and St. Anne's Black-friar's, and to each of his ſervants
male and female.</p>
               <p>The war prevented the punctual execution of his will, the probate
of which was not made 'till 1663, when the heirs and executors from
abroad and at home aſſembled to ſettle the accounts and recover what
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:0853300502:123"/>
debts they could—but with little effect. In 1668, and in 1703, the
heirs, with Mr. Carbonnel who had married the daughter of Vandyck's
daughter, made farther inſpections into his affairs and demands on his
creditors, but what was the iſſue does not appear.</p>
               <p>Lady Lempſter, mother of the laſt Earl of Pomfret, who was at

others, and was in repute even by this artificial practice; <note n="†" place="bottom">This muſt not be ſuppoſed to include his portraits, for which he certainly would have had no cuſtom, if the perſons had been obliged to ſit to two different men.

               <p>was another painter in the reign of Charles I. whom I only mention
with other obſolete names to lead inquirers to farther diſcoveries. All
I find of him is a note from one of the pocket-books of R. Symonds

               <p>B. VAN BASSEN</p>
               <p>of Antwerp, was a very neat painter of architecture. In the private
apartment below ſtairs at Kenſington are two pictures by him; in one
are repreſented Charles I. and his Queen at dinner; in the other the
King and Queen of Bohemia, diſtinguiſhed by their initial letters F.
and E. The Ducheſs of Portland has a magnificent <note n="*" place="bottom">Lord Oxford paid three hundred and ten pounds for it.</note> cabinet of ebony,
bought by her father the Earl of Oxford from the Arundelian collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
at Tart-hall. On each of the drawers is a ſmall hiſtory by Polen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg,
and pieces of architecture in the manner of Steenwyck by this
Van Baſſen, who muſt not be confounded with the Italian Baſſans, nor
with the Baſſanos, who were muſicians to Charles, and of which name
there was alſo a herald-painter. The firſt Baſſano, who came hither in

the reign of Queen Elizabeth and was related to the Italian painters of
that name, ſettled in Eſſex and purchaſed an eſtate, which was ſold in
1714 by the male deſcendent. In the manſion was a portrait of the
muſician, holding a baſs-viol. It is now at Narford in Norfolk, the
ſeat of the late Sir Andrew Fountain.</p>
               <p>CORNELIUS POLENBURG</p>
               <p>the ſweet painter of little landſcapes and figures, was born at Utrecht
in 1586, and educated under Bloemart, whom he ſoon quitted to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel
to Italy, as he abandoned, ſay our books, the manner of Elſheimer
to ſtudy Raphael—but it is impoſſible to ſay where they find Raphael
in Polenburg. The latter formed a ſtyle entirely new, and though
preferable to the Flemiſh, unlike any Italian, except in having adorned
his landſcapes with ruins. There is a varniſhed ſmoothneſs and finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in his pictures that makes them always pleaſing, though ſimple
and too nearly reſembling one another. The Roman Cardinals were
charmed with the neatneſs of his works; ſo was the great Duke, but
could not retain him. He returned to Utrecht and pleaſed Rubens
who had ſeveral of his performances. King Charles invited him to
London, where he lived in Archer-ſtreet next door to Geldorp, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
painted the figures in Steenwyck's perſpectives. There is a
very curious picture at Earl Poulet's at Hinton St. George, repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
an inſide view of Theobald's, with figures of the King, Queen, and
the two Earls of Pembroke and Montgomery, William and Philip.
This piece is probably of Steenwyck, and the figures, <note n="*" place="bottom">In King Charles's catalogue are mentioned the portraits of his majeſty, and of the children of the King of Bohemia, by Polenburg: and in King James's are eight pieces by him.</note> which are co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied

The works of Polenburg are very ſcarce; <note n="*" place="bottom">There are ſixteen mentioned in the catalogue of James II.</note> his ſcholar, John de Lis of
Breda, imitated his manner ſo exactly, that his pieces are often taken
for the hand of his maſter. The beſt picture in England of the latter
is at the Viſcount Midleton's. I have his own and his wife's portrait
by him in ſmall ovals on copper; they were my father's. The wife is
ſtiff and Dutch; his own is inimitable: Though worked up to the
tender ſmoothneſs of enamel, it has the greateſt freedom of pencil, the
happieſt delivery of nature.</p>
               <p>Charles could not prevail on Polenburg to fix here: He returned to
Utrecht and died there in 1660, at the age of ſeventy-four.</p>
               <p>HENRY STEENWYCK</p>
               <p>was ſon <note n="†" place="bottom">Deſcamps has proved that it is a miſtake to call the ſon Nicholas, as San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drart and others have done. See p. 384.</note> of the famous painter of architecture, and learned that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of his father. I find no particulars of the time of his arrival here,
or when he died. It is certain he worked for King Charles. <note n="‡" place="bottom">In King James's catalogue are recorded ten of his works.</note> The
ground to the portrait of that Prince, in the royal palace at Turin,
I believe, was painted by him. <note n="‖" place="bottom">In France are the portraits of Charles and his Queen by him, about a ſoot high, in one piece, with a front of a royal palace in the back ground. Deſcamps ſays this picture is more carefully laboured than any work of Vandyck, and equal to the moſt valuable of Mieris. p. 385. I believe the fine piece of architecture at Houghton is by the hand of Steenwyck, the father. By the ſon was a capital picture of St. Peter in priſon, which at Streater's ſale in 1711 ſold for 25<hi>l.</hi> It was afterwards in Dr. Meade's collection, who ſold it to the late Prince of Wales.</note> In a MS. catalogue of King Charles's
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:0853300502:130"/>
collection is mentioned a perſpective by Steenwyck, with the King and
Queen, in little, by Belcamp: In the ſame catalogue is recorded a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
book of perſpectives by Steenwyck, which on the ſale of the King's
goods ſold for no more than two pounds ten Shillings. Steenwyck's
name and the date 1629 are on the picture of Frobenius at Kenſington,
which he altered for King Charles. It is the portrait of the ſon, that
is among the heads of painters by Vandyck. His ſon Nicholas was
in England alſo, painted for King Charles, and probably died here.</p>
               <p>JOHN TORRENTIUS</p>
               <p>of Amſterdam, is known to have been here, not by his works, but
on the authority of Schrevelius, in his hiſtory of Arlem, from whom
Deſcamps took his account. Torrentius, ſays the latter, painted admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
in ſmall, but his ſubjects were not calculated to procure him ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
avowed admirers. He painted from the lectures of Petronius and
Aretine, had the confidence to dogmatize on the ſame ſubjects, and
practiced at leaſt what he preached. To profligacy he added impiety,
'till the magiſtrates thought proper to put a ſtop to his boldneſs. He
underwent the queſtion, and was condemned to an impriſonment of
twenty years; but obtained his liberty by the interceſſion of ſome men
of quality, and particularly of the Engliſh Embaſſador—what the
name of the latter was we are not told. Torrentius came over to
England, but giving more ſcandal than ſatisfaction, he returned to
Amſterdam, and remained there concealed 'till his death in 1640, aged

               <p>KEIRINCX,</p>
               <p>called here Carings, was employed by King Charles to draw views;
his works are mentioned in the royal catalogue, particularly proſpects

Ruſſel, a youth, and Knight of the Bath in the robes of the order,
with a dwarf aged thirty-two. It is painted with great brightneſs and

               <p>GEORGE JAMESONE <note n="*" place="bottom">The materials of this article were communicated by Mr. John Jamiſone, wine-merchant in Leith, who has another portrait of this painter by himſelf, 12 inches by 10.</note>
               </p>
               <p>was the Vandyck of Scotland, to which title he had a double preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
not only having ſurpaſſed his countrymen as a portrait-painter,
but from his works being ſometimes attributed to Sir Antony, who
was his fellow-ſcholar; both having ſtudied under Rubens at Ant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werp.</p>
               <p>Jameſone was ſon of Andrew Jameſone, an architect, and was born
at Aberdeen in 1586. At what age he went abroad, or how long he
continued there, is not known. After his return, he applied with inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatigable
induſtry to portrait in oil, tho' he ſometimes practiced in mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niature,
and in hiſtory and landſcape too. His largeſt portraits <note n="†" place="bottom">His earlieſt works are chiefly on board, afterwards on a fine linen cloth, ſmoothly primed with a proper tone to help the harmony of his ſhadows. His beſt works were from 1630 to his death.</note>

in delicacy and ſoftneſs, with a clear and beautifull colouring, his
ſhades not charged, but helped by varniſh, with little appearance of
the pencil. There is a print of him, his wife Iſabella Toſh and a

his deſcendent, in 1728, and now in the poſſeſſion of Mr. John

portraits of the family, painted by George; particularly another of
himſelf in his ſchool, with ſketches both of hiſtory and landſcape, and
with portraits of Charles 1ſt. his Queen, Jameſone's wife, and four
others of his works from the life.</p>
               <p>When King Charles viſited Scotland in 1633, the magiſtrates of
Edinburgh, knowing his majeſty's taſte, employed Jameſone to make
drawings of the Scottiſh monarchs, with which the King was ſo much
pleaſed, that inquiring for the painter, he ſat to him and rewarded him
with a diamond ring from his own finger.</p>
               <p>It is obſervable that Jameſone always drew himſelf with his hat on,
either in imitation of his maſter Rubens, or on having been indulged
in that liberty by the King when he ſat to him.</p>
               <p>Though moſt of the conſiderable families in Scotland are poſſeſſed
of works by this maſter, the greateſt collection of them is at Tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,
the ſeat of the Earl of Breadalbane; Sir Colin Campbell of
Glenorchy, his Lordſhip's anceſtor, having been the chief and earlieſt
patron of Jameſone, who had attended that gentleman on his travels.
From a MS. on vellom, containing the genealogy of the houſe of
Glenorchy, begun in 1598, are taken the following extracts, written
in 1635, page 52;</p>
               <p>"Item, The ſaid Sir Coline Campbell (8th. Laird of Glenorchy)
gave unto George Jameſone, painter in Edinburgh, for King Robert
and King David Bruyſſes, Kings of Scotland, and Charles the 1ſt King
of Great Brittane France and Ireland, and his Majeſties Quein, and for
nine more of the Queins of Scotland their portraits, quhilks are ſet up
in the hall of Ballock [now Taymouth] the ſum of tua hundreth thrie

               <p>
                  <pb n="118" facs="tcp:0853300502:135"/>
"Mair the ſaid Sir Coline gave to the ſaid George Jameſone for
the Knight of Lockow's Lady, and the firſt Counteſs of Argylle, and
ſix of the Ladys of Glenurquhay their portraits, and the ſaid Sir Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line
his own portrait, quhilks are ſet up in the chalmer of Deaſs of Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock,
ane hundreth four ſcoire punds."</p>
               <p>Memorandum. In the ſame year 1635 the ſaid George Jameſone
painted a large genealogical tree of the family of Glenorchy, 8 feet
long and 5 broad, containing in miniature the portraits of Sir Duncan
Campbell of Lockow, of Archibald Campbell his eldeſt ſon, firſt Earl
of Argylle, and of Sir Coline Campbell his ſecond ſon, firſt Laird of
Glenorchy, together with the portraits of eight ſucceſſive Knights,
Lairds of Glenorchy, with the branches of their inter-marriages, and
of thoſe of their ſons and daughters, beautifully illuminated. At the
bottom of which tree the following words are painted on a ſcroll;
"The genealogie of the Hous of Glenurquhie, whereof is deſcendit
ſundrie nobill and worthie houſes, 1635, <gap reason="symbol" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>〈☐〉</desc>
                  </gap>ameſone faciebat."</p>
               <p>Beſides the foregoing, Lord Breadalbane has at Taymouth, by the
ſame hand, eleven portraits of Lords and Ladies of the firſt families
in Scotland, painted in 1636 and 1637.</p>
               <p>From the extract above, it appears that Jameſone received no more
for each of thoſe heads than twenty pounds Scots, or one pound thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
ſhillings and four-pence Engliſh: Yet it is proved by their pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick
records that he died poſſeſſed of an eaſy fortune, which he left
to his three daughters, two of whom were honorably married. One
of them, named Mary, diſtinguiſhed herſelf by admirable needlework,
a piece of which uſed to be exhibited on feſtivals in the Church of St.
Nicholas at Aberdeen. Her deſcendent Mr. Thomſon of Portlethem
has an original picture of her father by himſelf. Three ſmall portraits
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:0853300502:136"/>
of the houſe of Haddington are in the poſſeſſion of Thomas Hamilton
Eſq. of Fala.</p>
               <p>Many of Jameſone's works are in both colleges of Aberdeen. The
Sibyls there, it is ſaid, he drew from living beauties of that city. Mr.
Baird of Auchmedden in Aberdeenſhire has in one piece three young
Ladies, couſins, of the houſes of Argyle, Errol and Kinnoul, their
ages, ſix, ſeven and eight, as marked on the ſide of the picture. The
ſame Gentleman has a ſmall whole length of William Earl of Pem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broke,
by ſome aſcribed to Vandyck. At Mr. Lindſay's of Worme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton
in Fife is a double half length of two boys, of that family, play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with a dog, their ages five and three, 1636.</p>
               <p>There is a perſpective view of Edinburgh by Jameſone, with a
Neptune on the fore ground.</p>
               <p>Having finiſhed a fine whole length of Charles I. he expected the
magiſtrates of Aberdeen would purchaſe it for their hall, but they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
him too inconſiderable a price, he ſold it to a gentleman in the
north of England.</p>
               <p>Jameſone had many ſcholars, particularly Michael Wright, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
in the third Volume of theſe Anecdotes. His own portrait is
in the Florentine chamber of Painters.</p>
               <p>Though Jameſone is little known in England, his character as well
as his works were greatly eſteemed in his own country. Arthur John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton,
the Poet, addreſſed to him an elegant Epigram on the picture of
the Marchioneſs of Huntley, which may be ſeen in the works of that
author printed at Middleburgh in 1642. The portrait itſelf is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
in the collection of the Duke of Gordon; and in the Newton-college
of Aberdeen is the picture of Doctor Johnſton himſelf by the
ſame hand. A Latin Elegy compoſed by David Wedderburn was
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:0853300502:137"/>
printed on his death, which happened in 1644 at Edinburgh, where
he was interred in the church-yard by the Gray-friars, but without any
monument.</p>
               <p>By his will, written with his own hand in July 1641, and breathing
a ſpirit of much piety and benevolence, he provides kindly for his wife
and children, and leaves many legacies to his relations and friends,
particularly to Lord Rothes the King's picture from head to foot, and
Mary with Martha in one piece: to William Murray he gives the
medals in his coffer, makes a handſome proviſion for his natural
daughter, and beſtows liberally on the poor. That he ſhould be in a
condition to do all this, ſeems extraordinary, his prices having been
ſo moderate; for enumerating the debts due to him, he charges Lady
Haddington for a whole length of her huſband, and Lady Selon's of
the ſame dimenſions, frames and all, but three hundred marks; and
Lord Maxwell for his own picture and his Lady's, to their knees, one
hundred marks; both ſums of Scots money.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jamiſone <note n="*" place="bottom">So the name is now written, not Jameſone.</note> has likewiſe a memorandum written and ſigned by
this Painter, mentioning a MS. in his poſſeſſion, "containing two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
leaves of parchment of excellent write adorned with diverſe hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorys

<note n="*" place="bottom">R. Symonds ſays he learned moſt of Old Cleyn.</note> to Sir Robert Peake, whom I have mentioned, a painter and
dealer in pictures. Under him, though no excellent performer, but
by the advantage of copying ſome pictures of Titian and Vandyck,
Dobſon profited ſo much, that a picture he had drawn being expoſed
in the window of a ſhop on Snow-hill, Vandyck paſſing by was ſtruck
with it, and inquiring for the author, found him at work in a poor
garret, from whence he took him and recommended him to the King.
On the death of Vandyck, Dobſon was appointed Serjeant-painter,
and groom of the privy-chamber, and attended the King to Oxford,
and lodged in the high-ſtreet almoſt over againſt St. Mary's church in
a houſe where ſome of his works remained 'till of late years. At Oxford
his Majeſty, Prince Rupert, and ſeveral of the Nobility <note n="†" place="bottom">The author of the Abregè de la Vie des plus fameux Peintres ſays, that Dobſon being overwhelmed with buſineſs thought of a lucky way to check it. It was, obliging perſons who ſat to him to pay half the price down; and that he was the firſt who uſed this practice. By the ſwarms of portraits that are left on the hands of his ſucceſſors, this method is either neglected, or has very little effect!</note> ſat to him;
but the declenſion of the King's affairs proved fatal to Dobſon; he
loved his pleaſures, and not having had time to enrich himſelf, was
involved in debts and thrown into priſon, from whence he was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
by one Mr. Vaughan of the Exchequer, whoſe picture he drew
and thought it the beſt of his portraits. He enjoyed this releaſe but a
ſhort time; dying at the age of thirty-ſix, he was buried at St. Martin's
October 28, 1646. A ſhort life, in which he had promiſed much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence.
His pictures are thought the beſt imitations of Vandyck;
they are undoubtedly very faithfull tranſcripts of nature. He painted
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:0853300502:140"/>
hiſtory as well as portrait; and even the latter generally containing
more than a ſingle figure, riſe almoſt above that denomination.</p>
               <p>Of the firſt ſort, is the Decollation of St. John at Wilton. It is in a
good ſtyle, but the colouring is raw. The idea of St. John is ſaid
to have been taken from the face of Prince Rupert. At Chatſworth
is a very particular picture, ſaid to be General Monke, his child, and
his miſtreſs, whom he took againſt the conſent of her huſband. The
man in armour, undoubtedly reſembles Monke, but the whole piece has
the air of a holy family; nor is there any other tradition of any miſtreſs
of Monke, but the famous <note n="*" place="bottom">See an account of her in Lord Clarendon's hiſtory of his life, in Ludlow's memoires, and in the collection of ſtate poems, vol. i. p. 38.</note> Anne Clarges whom he afterwards mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried,
and who, ſome ſay, was a milliner. There are many inſtances of
painters who have deified their miſtreſſes, but the character of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
Mary was never more proſtituted, than if aſſumed by Anne Clar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.

Dobſon of the woman caught in adultery, with ſeveral figures; the

Cowley. At Chippenham, in Cambridgeſhire, formerly the ſeat of

houſe is another family piece of Sir Thomas Brown, author of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gio
Medici, his wife, two ſons and as many daughters. Mr. Willett,
merchant in Thames-ſtreet, has a ſmall family-piece of Dr. Hibbard,
phyſician, his wife and five children. The father and mother are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
well painted. A little boy leans on the father's knee, evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
borrowed from the well-known attitude by Rubens of Sir B.
Gerbier's daughter. Two children on the right-hand were certainly
added afterwards, and are much inferior to the reſt. The dates were
probably inſerted at the ſame time. A whole length of Sir William
Compton is in the poſſeſſion of the family. At the Lord Byron's is
the portrait of Sir Charles Lucas; and at Drayton in Northampton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,
Henry Mordaunt Earl of Peterborough in armour with a page
holding his horſe, and an angel giving him his helmet. <note n="*" place="bottom">The laſt circumſtance may relate to his preſervation in the Civil War, in which he was wounded, and made his eſcape when taken priſoner with Duke Hamilton and Lord Holland. This picture has great merit.</note> A head of
the Marquis of Montroſe was taken for the hand of Vandyck: in a
corner in ſtone colour is a ſtatue of peace, on the other ſide, his helmet.
At Mr. Skinner's (Mr. Walker's collection) is a large piece of Prince
Charles in armour, drawn about 1638, Mr. Windham, a youth, hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his helmet; at bottom are arms and trophies. I have mentioned
a fine head of Vanderdort at Houghton. Dobſon's wife, by him, is
on the ſtairs of the Aſhmolean muſeum at Oxford; and his own head
is at Earl Paulett's; the hands were added long ſince by Gibſon, as he

               <p>GERARD HONTHORST,</p>
               <p>The favorite painter of the Queen of Bohemia, was born in 1592 at
Utrecht, and inſtructed in painting by Bloemart, but he compleated his
ſtudies at Rome, where he ſtayed ſeveral years, and painted many
things for Prince Juſtiniani, and other works, excelling particularly in
night-pieces and candlelights. On his return he married well, and
having a fair character, was remarkable for the number of his diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples

the ſame time, who each payed him an hundred florins yearly. But
his greateſt honour was inſtructing the Queen of Bohemia and her
children, <note n="*" place="bottom">At Caſhiobury, Lord Eſſex's, is a large picture of the Queen of Bohemia and her children by Honthorſt. The elder ſons are killing monſters that repreſent Envy, &amp;c. The King of Bohemia, like Jupiter, with the Queen again, like Juuo, are in the clouds.

One of them is at Kenſington, Tobit and the Angel in water-colours, but now quite ſpoiled. In Lovelace's Lucaſta is a poem on Princeſs Loyſa drawing, p. 17.

of his life was employed in the ſervice of the Prince of Orange, whoſe
houſes at the Hague, Hounſlaerdyck and Reſwick were adorned by
his pencil with poetic hiſtories. At the laſt of the three he painted a
chamber with the habits, animals and productions of various countries,
and received 8000 florins for his labour. He died at the Hague in
1660. Deſcamps in his ſecond volume ſays, that Honthorſt brought
to England Joachim Sandrart, his ſcholar, and that the king beſpoke
many pictures of him; and that for the Earl of Arundel he copied
from Holbein, Henry 8th, Sir T. More, Eraſmus, and ſeveral others;
and that he left England and went to Venice in 1627. I find no
other authority for this account: not one work of Sandrart is mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in K. Charles's collection; and what is more concluſive againſt his
having been in England, he takes not the leaſt notice of it himſelf in
the life of Honthorſt, tho' he relates his maſter's journey to England
and his works here, and calls himſelf one of his diſciples.</p>
               <p>JOHN VAN BELCAMP</p>
               <p>was employed under Vanderdort as a copyer of the King's <note n="*" place="bottom">One was of the Queen in ſmall in a piece of perſpective, ſold at the diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the collection.</note> pictures,
and was reckoned to ſucceed. The whole length of Edward IV. in his
night-gown and ſlippers, (the face in profile) which hangs over the
chimney in the anti-chamber at St. James's, was painted by Belcamp,
the face probably taken from the ancient original. In the catalogue
of James II. are mentioned pictures of Edward III. the Black Prince,
Anne of Denmark, Louis XIII. and of a large ſtag; Edward III. and
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:0853300502:148"/>
the Black Prince are ſtill in an anti-room at St. James's, and that of
the King of France is perhaps the portrait now at Hampton-court.
At Drayton, the ſeat of the Lady Elizabeth Germain in Northamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonſhire,
are whole lengths of Henry 7th. and 8th. copied by Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camp
from the large picture of Holbein, which was burned at White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall.
When King Charles ſecretly withdrew from that palace, in the

Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyck was ſaid to be in love with her, but was ſo ungalant as to diſpute with her on the price of her picture, which he threatened to ſell if ſhe would not give him what he demanded. See a letter of Lord Conway to Lord Wentworth in a collection publiſhed by Dodſley in two volumes 1754. vol. i. p. 136. It was thought the Lord Cottington would have married her, but that ſhe was in love with Carey Raleigh, Sir Walter's ſon, mentioned in the text. At laſt ſhe married Poliander Kirkhoven Lord of Helmfleet in Holland, and died April 9, 1677.

At Wimpole in Cambridgeſhire the ſeat of the Earl of Oxford, which
had been Sir Henry Pickering's and before him the ſeat of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts,
were copies by Belcamp of ſeveral Engliſh heads, remarkable
perſons in the reigns of Henry 8th. Elizabeth, James, and Charles 1ſt.
but they were all ſold and diſperſed with the reſt of the Harleian col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection.</p>
               <p>Belcamp was added by a vote of the Commons June 2, 1649, to the
number of truſtees for the ſale of the King's goods; and the directions
for the ſale in 1650 are witneſſed by him. In one of the pocket-books
of R. Symonds he is ſaid to be lately dead in 1653.</p>

               <p>a native of Piſa, was diſciple of Aurelio Lomi his half brother. After
diſtinguiſhing himſelf at Florence, Rome and Genoa, he went to Savoy,
and from thence paſſing into France, was invited over by King Charles,
who gave him lodgings and a conſiderable ſalary, and employed him
in his palaces, particularly at Greenwich, in painting cielings. Nine
pieces, which were in that palace, were ſold after the King's death for
600<hi>l.</hi> and are now the ornaments of the hall at Marlborough-houſe.

He worked too for Villiers <note n="*" place="bottom">In that Duke's collection are mentioned two pictures by him of a Magdalen and the holy family. See the catalogue publiſhed by Bathoe.</note> Duke of Buckingham, at York-houſe.
A ceiling from thence was ſince at the houſe of Sheffield Duke of
Buckingham in St. James's park. It repreſented the nine muſes in a
large circle. He painted too the family of Villiers, and a large picture
for him eight feet wide by five high, of a Magdalen lying in a grotto
contemplating a ſkull. At Hampton-court is his Joſeph and Potiphar's
wife; he drew other things for the King and preſented him with a
book of drawings. Of Lot and his daughters there is a print after
him, in which he is called by miſtake Civis Romanus, engraved by
Lucas Voſterman. He made ſeveral attempts at portrait painting,
but with little ſucceſs, and after reſiding here about twelve years, died
at the age of eighty-four, and was buried under the altar in the chapel

               <p>arrived here in 1641, a little before the death of Vandyck, of whoſe
manner he was a lucky imitator, and had the honour of having ſome of
his pictures paſs for that maſter's. He left England in 1649, ſaying,
"He would never ſtay in a country where they cut off their King's
head and were not aſhamed of the action." It had been more ſenſible
to ſay, he would not ſtay where they cut off the head of a King that
rewarded painters, and defaced and ſold his collection. One John
Weeſop, probably his ſon, was buried in St. Martin's in 1652.

               <p>has been mentioned in the former volume. Though ſerjeant painter to
Charles I. He may more properly be called a retainer to the arts than
a profeſſor. His life is to be collected rather from office-books than
from his works or his reputation. Yet he was not ignorant. I have
two ſketches of heads drawn by him with a pen, that are maſterly.
Vertue ſaw many more in the hands of Murray the painter who was
ſcholar of a ſon or nephew of De Critz, who, according to Murray,
painted bravely ſcenes for maſks. Among thoſe drawings was a ſketch

That of Sir Philip Sidney is the ſame with Lord Cheſterfield's and under was written, <hi>at Mr. De Critz's</hi>—ſtrong evidences of this being a genuine picture.</note> Sir Philip Sidney, then at the houſe of De Critz,

a middle piece for a cieling, which on the diſperſion of the King's
effects was ſold for 20<hi>l.</hi> In 1657 he painted the portrait of ſerjeant
Maynard with a paper in his hand. In a book belonging to the board
of works was a payment to John De Critz for repairing pictures of
Palma and the Caeſars of Titian. This was in 1632. Among the
annuities and fees payable out of the cuſtoms in the port of London
in that reign was a payment to John De Critz his majeſty's ſerjeant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>painter,
for his annuity at 40<hi>l.</hi> a year due to him for one year ended
at Michaelmas 1633. And in a wardrobe account, loſt in the fire in

England in the reign of King Charles, and for ſome time worked un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

he became the favorite painter of Mary Princeſs of Orange. There is
a picture of her and the Prince in armour at Lord Strafford's at Went<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth-caſtle,

father was Archbiſhop of York, and he a jeſuit. He was ſuppoſed a
wit, and believed himſelf a politician. His works are ridiculous, and
his greateſt ſucceſs was a little miſchief in making converts. <note n="*" place="bottom">On the Lady Newburgh being converted to popery, Lord Conway writes thus to the Earl of Strafford, "The King did uſe ſuch words of Wat. Montagu and Sir Tobie Matthew, that the fright made Wat keep his chamber longer than his ſickneſs would have detained him; and Don Tobiah was in ſuch perplexity that I find he will make a very ill man to be a martyr; but now the dog doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain wag his tail." Strafford papers vol. ii. p. 125. It ſeems in this buſineſs Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thews was unjuſtly accuſed; the converſion had been made by the Ducheſs of Buckingham and Signor Con, the Spaniſh reſident, p. 128.</note> The
famous Counteſs of Carliſle, as meddling as Matthews, and as affected,
was the object of his adoration. He drew a character of her, <note n="†" place="bottom">See this character prefixed to his letters.</note> which
commends her ſo impertinently, that with ſcarce ſtraining, it might paſs
for a ſatire. For inſtance, he ſays, "She has as much ſenſe and grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
for the actions of friendſhip as ſo extreme a beauty will give her
leave to entertain; and that although ſhe began to be civil to people at
firſt, ſhe would rather ſhow what ſhe could do, than let her nature con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
in it, and that ſhe never conſidered merit in others but in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
as they had any to her. That ſhe affected particularity ſo much,
that you might fear to be leſs valued by her for obliging her; that ſhe
had little religion, was paſſionate, could ſuffer no condition but plenty

and glory, was fickle, and gay only out of contradiction becauſe her
phyſicians had told her ſhe was inclined to melancholy"—with a heap
of ſuch nonſenſe—in ſhort, I believe, no proud beauty was ever ſo well
flattered to her own contentment. Mr. Garrard, maſter of the charter-houſe,
a man of more ſenſe and more plain ſenſe than Matthews, has
drawn this Lady's character in fewer words, and upon the whole not
very unlike Sir Toby's picture; "My lady Carliſle will be reſpected

poſſible on the manners of the ſeveral ages, I did not unwillingly adopt
Vertue's miſtake, if it is one. Whoever deſires to know more of this

and Lucretia copied from Titian. Another, the feaſt of Bacchus, was
delivered to him by the King's own hands, to be copied in tapeſtry at
the manufacture in Mortlack. He had lodgings in the tennis-court at
Whitehall, and is often mentioned as a domeſtic ſervant. <note n="†" place="bottom">He was chancellor of the garter, and married Katherine eldeſt daughter of William Lord Powys, widow of Sir Robert Vaughan, and was father of Roger Palmer Earl of Caſtlemain, huſband of the Ducheſs of Cleveland.</note> He was the
perſon ſent to Richard Atkyns for the picture in which the King diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed

him 'till I had diſpatched the performers in oil. He was born at
Roſtock and retained in the ſervice of Chriſtian IV. King of Denmark,
but the excellence of his genius prompted him to the ſearch of better
models than he found in that northern climate. He travelled to Italy
and ſtayed there four years; it was at Rome, I ſuppoſe, he learned thoſe
beautifull groteſques, in which he afterwards ſhone. At Venice he
became known to Sir Henry Wotton, and Sir Robert Anſtruther re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended
him to Prince Charles. He arrived while the Prince was
in Spain, but notwithſtanding was graciouſly received by King James,
who mentions that circumſtance in a Latin letter that he wrote to the
King of Denmark, deſiring leave to detain Cleyn in England, though
with a permiſſion to return firſt to Copenhagen and finiſh a work he
had begun there, and promiſing to pay the expence of his journey.
The letter is preſerved by Fuller. <note n="*" place="bottom">In his Worthies of Surrey, p. 77.</note> The requeſt was granted, and
Cleyn returned to London at the end of the ſummer. The King had

in Indian ink about ſix inches ſquare, which Vertue ſaw, he is called,

he painted in freſco. Bolſover in Nottinghamſhire, Stone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>park
in Northamptonſhire, and Carew-houſe at Parſon's-green (ſince
Lord Peterborough's) were ornamented by him. There is ſtill extant
a beautifull chamber adorned by him at Holland-houſe, with a cieling
in groteſque, and ſmall compartments on the chimnies, in the ſtyle and
not unworthy, of Parmegiano. Two chairs, carved and gilt, with large
ſhells for backs, belonging to the ſame room, were undoubtedly from
his deſigns; and are evidences of his taſte. A letter <note n="†" place="bottom">Strafford papers.</note> from Lord
Cottington to Lord Strafford, deſcribing the former's houſe at Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth,
mentions Cleyn, though not by name. "There is a certain large
low room made under the building with a fountain in it, and other rare
deviſes, and the open gallery is all painted by the hand of a ſecond
Titian. Aug. 1629." In King Charles's catalogue is mention of four
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:0853300502:172"/>
patterns for the great ſeal, drawings <note n="*" place="bottom">I am informed that ſome drawings by Cleyn are in the poſſeſſion of the Earl of Moray in Scotland.</note> on blue paper by Cleyn. He
made deſigns for various artiſts; particularly for ſeveral of Hollar's
plates to Virgil and Aeſop: for theſe he received fifty ſhillings a piece.
There are two ſmall books of foliages from his drawings; one contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſix ſmall ſlips with animals in groteſque; the other, in five ſlips, of
the ſenſes; and the initial letters of his name F. C. inv. 1646. And
two books for carvers, goldſmiths, &amp;c. containing 25 plates. It is
however uncertain whether theſe and a few other plates of the ſame
kind are not by his ſon, who had the ſame chriſtian name, and imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
his father's manner. Such is a title-page to Lacrymae Muſarum,
elegies on the Lord Haſtings, who died in 1650, the day before he
was to have been married. Alſo, ſeven plates of the liberal arts, about
four or five inches ſquare, prettily deſigned and neatly etched. On a
ſmall print of the father, etched by the ſon, Mr. Evelyn wrote, "A
moſt pious man, father of two ſons, who were incomparable painters
in miniature; all died in London." By the regiſter of Mortlack it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
that he had three ſons; Francis born in 1625, who died and was
buried at Covent-garden October 21, 1650. Charles and John; and
two daughters, Sarah and Magdalen. He had another daughter, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
born in London, and called Penelope. Vertue ſaw a miniature,
like Cooper's manner, but not ſo well, of Dorothea, youngeſt daughter
of Richard Cromwell, act. 4, 1668, with theſe letters, P. C. which he
thought ſignified Penelope Cleyn. <note n="†" place="bottom">At Burleigh is a head of Cecil Lord Roos, 1677, with the ſame letters.</note> In the catalogue of plates and

a painter who died at Mortlack in 1718 had a picture of Cleyn and
his wife and ſeveral of his deſigns for tapeſtries, all which came to Mr.
Crawley of <hi>Hempſted</hi> Hertfordſhire. Richard Symonds in one of his
pocket-books mentions another piece of Cleyn and his family by can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlelight,
and a copy by the ſon of a ſacrifice from Raphael, which was
in the royal collection, and a drawing on coloured paper. At Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſington
I have lately found a picture which I do not doubt is of Cleyn's
hand. It repreſents Chriſt and Mary in a chamber, the walls and
windows of which are painted in groteſque. Different rooms are ſeen
through the doors, in one I ſuppoſe is Martha employed in the buſineſs
of the family. There is merit in this piece, particularly in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective
and groteſques, the latter of which, and the figures in the
manner of the Venetian ſchool, make me not heſitate to aſcribe it to
this maſter.</p>
               <p>JOHN HOSKINS.</p>
               <p>For the life of this valuable maſter I find fewer <note n="†" place="bottom">There is not even a portrait of him extant.</note> materials, than of
almoſt any man in the liſt who arrived to ſo much excellence. Vertue
knew no more of him than what was contained in Graham's Engliſh
School, where we are only told "that he was bred a face-painter in oil,
but afterwards taking to miniature, far exceeded what he did before;
that he drew King Charles, his Queen and moſt of the court, and had
two conſiderable diſciples, Alexander and Samuel Cooper, the latter of
whom became much the more eminent limner." Hoſkins, though
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:0853300502:174"/>
ſurpaſſed by his ſcholar, the younger Cooper, was a very good painter;
there is great truth and nature in his heads; but the carnations are too
bricky, and want a degradation and variety of tints. I have a head of
ſerjeant Maynard by him, boldly painted and in a manly ſtyle, though
not without theſe faults; and another good one of Lord Falkland,
more deſcriptive of his patriot melancholy than the common prints; it
was in the collection of Dr. Meade. <note n="*" place="bottom">At Burleigh is a portrait of David Cecil, ſon of John 4th. Earl of Exeter by Frances, daughter of the Earl of Rutland; it is dated 1644; and another of Sir Edward Cecil, afterwards Viſcount Wimbledon.</note> There is indeed one <note n="†" place="bottom">Since the firſt edition of this book I have ſeen another at Burleigh, ſcarce inferior.

Hoſkins that may be called perfect; it is a head of a man, rather
young, in the gown of a maſter of arts, and a red ſatten waſtecoat.
The clearneſs of the colouring is equal to either Oliver; the diſhevelled
hair touched with exquiſite freedom. It is in the poſſeſſion of Mr.

Charles are mentioned two drawings by Hoſkins for the great ſeal.
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:0853300502:175"/>
Colonel Sothby has a head of Sir Benjamin Rudyard by him, and a

               <p>ALEXANDER COOPER</p>
               <p>was nephew of Hoſkins, and with his brother Samuel, of whom an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
will be given in the enſuing volume, was inſtructed in water-colours
by their uncle. Alexander painted landſcapes in this manner
as well as portraits. At Burleigh is the Story of Acteon and Diana
by him. He went abroad, reſided ſome time at Amſterdam, and at
laſt entered into the ſervice of Queen Chriſtina.</p>
               <p>ANNE CARLISLE,</p>
               <p>a paintreſs, admired for her copies (it is not ſaid whether in oil or mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niature)
from Italian maſters. Graham <note n="*" place="bottom">Engliſh School.</note> ſays, ſhe was in ſuch favour
with King Charles, that he preſented her and Vandyck with as much
ultramarine at one time as coſt him above five hundred pounds. If her
ſhare was near equal, I ſhould ſuppoſe ſhe painted in oil. It would be
a very long time before the worth of 200<hi>l.</hi> in ultramarine could be
employed in miniatures. Vertue mentions her teaching a lady to paint,
whoſe picture ſhe drew ſtanding behind her own; herſelf was ſitting
with a book of drawings in her lap; and he adds, that many pieces
painted by her were in the poſſeſſion of a widow Lady Cotterel. Mrs.
Carliſle died about 1680.

               <p>
                  <pb n="150" facs="tcp:0853300502:176"/>JOHN PETITOT</p>
               <p>was patronized by the two monarchs, who of late years have given the
nobleſt encouragement to artiſts, Charles 1ſt. and Louis 14th. He
deſerved their protection as a genius, and has never been equalled in
enamel. Zincke alone has once or twice, and but once or twice, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
works that might ſtand in competition with any ſingle per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of Petitot.</p>
               <p>The latter was born at Geneva in 1607; his father, a ſculptor and
architect, having paſſed part of his life in Italy, had retired to
that city. The ſon was deſigned for a jeweller, and having frequent
occaſion to make uſe of enamel, he attained ſuch a tone of colour, that
Bordier, who afterwards became his brother-in-law, conceived, that if
Petitot would apply himſelf to portrait, he might carry the art to great
perfection. Though both wanted ſeveral colours, which they knew
not how to prepare for the fire, their attempts had great ſucceſs. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titot
executed the heads and hands, Bordier, the hair, draperies and
grounds.</p>
               <p>In this intercourſe of ſocial labour, the two friends ſet out for Italy.
As painters, the treaſures of the art were open to them; as enamellers,
they improved too by frequenting the beſt chymiſts of that country;
but it was in England that they were ſo fortunate as to learn the
choiceſt ſecrets in the branch to which they had devoted themſelves.
Sir Theodore Mayern, firſt phyſician to Charles, and a great chymiſt,
communicated to them the proceſs of the principal colours which
ought to be employed in enamel, and which ſurpaſſed the famous vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trifications
of Venice and Limoges.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="151" facs="tcp:0853300502:177"/>
Mayern introduced Petitot to the King, who knighted and gave
him an apartment in Whitehall. The French author of the Abregè
de la Vie des plus fameux Peintres, whom I copy, and am ſorry to
criticize while I am indebted to him, ſays, that Vandyck ſeeing ſome
deſigns of Petitot at the King's goldſmith's, and informing himſelf of
the author, adviſed him to quit the profeſſion of jeweller, and apply
himſelf to painting portraits in enamel. But the biographer had told
us that that ſtep was already taken; and ſurely had not been aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned
during a long ſtay in Italy. What the ſame writer adds, that
Vandyck gave him inſtructions, when Petitot copied the works of
that maſter, and that his copies from Vandyck are his beſt performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
is much more agreeable to probability and fact. The magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
whole length of Rachel de Rouvigny Counteſs of Southampton,
in the collection of the Duke of Devonſhire, is painted from the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
in oil by Vandyck, in the poſſeſſion of Lord Hardwicke, and is
indubitably the moſt capital work in enamel in the world; it is nine
inches three quarters high, by five inches and three quarters wide; and
though the enamel is not perfect in ſome trifling parts, the execution
is the boldeſt and the colouring the moſt rich and beautifull that can
be imagined. It is dated 1642. His Grace has a head of the Duke
of Buckingham by the ſame hand; with the painter's name and the
date 1640; conſequently a copy performed <note n="*" place="bottom">It is evidently copied from the Duke's portrait in his family-piece by Hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorſt at Kenſington.</note> after the Duke's death.
In the ſame collection is a portrait of a middle-aged man in armour, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed
in a caſe of tortoiſhel, the perſon unknown, but inferior to none
I have ſeen of this maſter. The Ducheſs of Portland has another of
the Duke of Buckingham, exactly the ſame as the preceding; Charles
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:0853300502:178"/>
firſt and his Queen, and the Lady Morton, governeſs of the royal
children, who is celebrated by Waller. I have a fine head of Charles
1ſt. in armour, for which he probably ſat, as it is not like any I have
ſeen by Vandyck; James 2d. when Duke of York, freely painted,
though highly finiſhed, and I ſuppoſe done in France; a very large
and capital one of his ſiſter Henrietta Ducheſs of Orleans, exquiſitely
laboured; a very ſmall, but fine head of Anne of Auſtria; another of
Madame de Monteſpan; and a few more of leſs note, but all of them
touched in that minute and delicate ſtyle, into which he afterwards
fell in France, and which, though more laboured, has leſs merit in
richneſs of tints, than his Engliſh works. Vanderdort mentions a
carving by Petitot from Titian's Lucretia, in which way I find no
other account of his attempts, though, as his father was a ſculptor, he
probably had given his ſon ſome inſtructions.</p>
               <p>The tragic death of his royal protector was a dreadful ſtroke, ſays
his biographer, to Petitot, who attended the exiled family to Paris. I
queſtion, as ſo few Engliſh portraits appear by his hand, and none
that I know later than 1642, whether the Civil War did not early
drive him back to France; but Bordier undoubtedly remained here
ſometime longer, having been employed by the parliament to paint a
memorial of the battle of Naſeby, which they preſented to Fairfax
their victorious general. This ſingular curioſity is now in my poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
purchaſed from the Muſeum of Thoreſby, who <note n="*" place="bottom">I have the receipt of the executors of Fairfax to Thoreſby, who paid 185<hi>l.</hi> for his purchaſes. He has, at the end of his Ducatus Leodienſis, in the account of his own Muſeum, given a more minute deſcription of theſe enamels.</note> bought it, with
other rarities, from the executors of Fairfax. It conſiſts of two round
plates each but an inch and half diameter, and originally ſerved, I
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:0853300502:179"/>
ſuppoſe, for the top and bottom of a watch, ſuch enamelled plates
being frequent to old watches inſtead of cryſtals. On the outſide of
that which I take for the bottom, is a repreſentation of the Houſe of
Commons, as exhibited on their ſeals by Simon. Nothing can be
more perfect than theſe diminutive figures; of many even the counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
are diſtinguiſhable. On the other piece, within, is delineated
the battle of Naſeby; on the outſide is Fairfax himſelf on his cheſtnut
horſe, men engaging at a diſtance. The figure and horſe are copied
from Vandyck, but with a freedom, and richneſs of colouring, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
ſurpaſſing that great maſter. Under the horſe, one reads P. B.
fecit. This is the ſingle work which can with certainty be allotted to
Bordier alone, and which demonſtrates how unjuſtly his fame has been
abſorbed in the renown of his brother-in-law. Charles 2d. during
his abode in that kingdom took great notice of Petitot; and introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
him to Louis, who, when the reſtoration happened, retained Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titot
in his own ſervice, gave him a penſion and lodged him in the
Louvre. Small portraits of that monarch by this great enameller, are
extremely common, and of the two Queens, his mother and wife.</p>
               <p>In 1651 he married Margaret Cuper; the celebrated Drelincourt
performed the ceremony at Charenton; for Petitot was a zealous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant,
and dreading the conſequences of the revocation of the edict
of Nantes in 1685, he begged permiſſion of the King to retire to Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neva.
Louis, who did not care to part with ſo favorite a painter,
and who perhaps thought that an enameller's religion was not compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
of ſterner ſtuff, than the great Turenne's, eluded his demand; and
at laſt being preſſed with repeated memorials, ſent Petitot to Fort-l'eveque,
and Boſſuet to convert him. The ſubtle apoſtle, who had
woven ſuch a texure of devotion and ambition, that the latter was
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:0853300502:180"/>
ſcarce diſtinguiſhable from the former, had the mortification of not
ſucceeding, and Petitot's chagrin bringing on a fever, he at laſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
his liberty, now almoſt arrived at the age of fourſcore, which
makes it probable that his converſion rather than his pencil had been
the foundation of detaining him. He no ſooner was free, than he
eſcaped with his wife to Geneva in 1685. His children, who dreaded
the King's wrath, remained at Paris, and throwing themſelves at his
feet, implored his protection. His Majeſty, ſays my author, receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them with great goodneſs, and told them, he willingly forgave an
old man, who had a whim of being buried with his fathers.—I do not
doubt but this is given, and paſſed at the time, for a bonmot—but a
very flat witticiſm cannot depreciate the glory of a confeſſor, who has
ſuffered impriſonment, reſiſted eloquence, and ſacrificed the emolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of court-favour to the uprightneſs of his conſcience. Petitot
did not wiſh to be buried with his fathers, but to die in their religion.</p>
               <p>Returned to his country, the good old man continued his darling
profeſſion. The King and Queen of Poland deſired to be painted by
his hand, and ſent their portraits to be copied by him in enamel, but
the meſſenger finding him departed, proceeded to Geneva, where he
executed them with all the vigour of his early pencil. The Queen
was repreſented ſitting on a trophy, and holding the picture of the
King. For this piece he received an hundred Louis d'or's.</p>
               <p>So great was the concourſe to viſit him, that he was obliged to
quit Geneva and retire to Veray, a little town in the canton of Berne,
where as he was painting his wife, an illneſs ſeized and carried him off
in a day, in 1691, at the age of fourſcore and four. He had had ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venteen
children; one of his daughters, a widow, was living in 1752.
My portrait of Charles 1ſt. came from one of his ſons, who was a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:0853300502:181"/>
in our ſervice. Of the reſt, one only attached himſelf to his father's
art and practiced in London, his father often ſending him his works
for models. This ſon painted in miniature too, and left deſcendents,
who are ſettled at Dublin.</p>
               <p>It is idle to write a panegyric on the greateſt man in any vocation.
That rank diſpenſes with encomiums, as they are never wanted but
where they may be conteſted. Petitot generally uſed plates of gold
or ſilver, ſeldom copper. In the dawn of his reputation he received
twenty guineas for a picture, which price he afterwards raiſed to forty.
His cuſtom was to have a painter to draw the likeneſs in oil, from
which he made his ſketches, and then finiſhed them from the life.
Thoſe of Louis he copied from the beſt pictures of him, but generally
obtained one or two ſittings for the completion. His biographer
ſays, that he often added <note n="*" place="bottom">He ſpecifies one at Paris of Michel L'aſne, the engraver, a large oval with hands, of which one reſts on his breaſt.</note> hands to his portraits; I have ſeen but one
ſuch, the whole length of Lady Southampton; and that at Loretto
there is of his work an incomparable picture of the Virgin. A collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
at Paris poſſeſſes more than thirty of this great maſter's perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances,
particularly the portraits of Meſdames de la Valiere, Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſpan,
Fontanges &amp;c. Another has thoſe of the famous Counteſs
d'Olonne, the Ducheſs of Bouillon, and other ladies of the court. Van
Gunſt engraved after Petitot the portrait of Chevreau.</p>
               <p>Of Bordier, we have no fuller account than this incidental mention
of him; yet I have ſhown that his is no trifling claim to a principal
place among thoſe artiſts whoſe works we have moſt reaſon to boaſt.
I wiſh this clue may lead to farther diſcoveries concerning him!</p>

I come now to other artiſts in the reign of Charles; and firſt of
ſtatuaries.</p>
               <p>ANDREW KEARNE</p>
               <p>a German, was brother of Nicholas Stone the elder, for whom he
worked. Kearne too carved many ſtatues for Sir Juſtinian Iſham, at
his houſe near Northampton. At Somerſet-ſtairs he carved the River<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>god
which anſwered to the Nile, made by Stone, and a lioneſs on the
water-gate of York-ſtairs. For the Counteſs of Mulgrave a Venus
and Apollo of Portland ſtone, ſix feet high, for each of which he had
ſeven pounds. He died in England, and left a ſon that was alive
ſince 1700.</p>
               <p>JOHN SCHURMAN</p>
               <p>born at Emden, was another of Stone's workmen, and afterwards ſet
up for himſelf. He was employed by Sir John Baſkerville; made two
ſhepherds ſitting for Sir John Davers of Chelſea; a marble ſtatue of
Sir T. Lucy, for his tomb in Warwickſhire, for which he was paid
eighteen pounds, and fifty ſhillings for poliſhing and glazing; the ſame
for a ſtatue on <note n="*" place="bottom">This tomb of Douglas Lord Belhaven is in the church of the abbey of Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rood-houſe.</note> Lord Belhaven's tomb; a little boy on the ſame monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
two ſphinxes for Sir John Davers; and Hercules and Antaeus
for that gentleman's garden, at the rate of ſixteen pounds.</p>
               <p>EDWARD PIERCE</p>
               <p>father and ſon, are mentioned here together, though the father was a

painter chiefly in the reign of the firſt Charles, the ſon a ſtatuary who
worked moſtly under the ſecond Charles, but each may be allotted to
either period. The father painted hiſtory, landſcape <note n="*" place="bottom">James II. had one of his hand. See the catalogue.</note> and architecture;
but the greater part of his works conſiſting of altar-pieces and cielings
of churches were deſtroyed in the fire of London. One of his cielings
was in the church of Covent-garden. For ſome time he worked
under Vandyck, and ſeveral of his performances are at the Duke of
Rutland's at Belvoir. A book of freeze-work in eight leaves, etched
in 1640, was I ſuppoſe by the hand of the father; as to him muſt be
referred an entry in an office-book, where he is mentioned for paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and gilding frames of pictures at Somerſet-houſe at two ſhillings
the foot, Feb. 17, 1636. He alſo agrees to paint and gild the chimney
piece in the croſs-gallery there for eight pounds. Dobſon drew his pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
He died a few years after the reſtoration and was buried at
Stamford. He had three ſons, who all, ſays Graham, <note n="†" place="bottom">Engliſh School.</note> became famous
in their different ways. One was John Pierce, a painter; of the third,
I find no account of his profeſſion; the other was Edward the ſtatuary
and architect. He made the ſtatues of Sir Thomas Greſham, of Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
III. at the Royal-exchange, and of Sir William Walworth at Fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monger's-hall;
a marble buſt of Thomas Evans, maſter of, and a
great benefactor to, the company of painters in 1687: The buſt is in
their hall: a model of the head of Milton, which Vertue had, the
buſt of Sir Chriſtopher Wren in the picture-gallery at Oxford, and a
buſt of Cromwell ſold at an auction in 1714. He much aſſiſted Sir
Chriſtopher in many of his deſigns, and built the church of St. Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
under his direction. Edward Pierce too carved the four dragons
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:0853300502:185"/>
on the monument, at fifty pounds each. The whole coſt of that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumn,
excluſive of the dragons, and of the baſrelief which is not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
in the account, appears by the ſurvey of Hooke, Leybourn
and others, to have amounted to 8000<hi>l.</hi> A rich vaſe at Hampton-court
is another of the works of Pierce. He lived and died at his
houſe the corner of Surrey-ſtreet in the Strand, and was buried at St.
Mary's le Savoy, in 1698.</p>
               <p>HUBERT LE SOEUR,</p>

he is mentioned for carving the frames of the pictures in the croſs-gallery

Foy broke open the treaſury, and carried away all theſe valuable

was made with the Earl-marſhal, Sir Francis Windebank, and Sir

were gilt, for Vianen complained that by the expence of the work, and
the treble-gilding, he was a great loſer, and deſired to be conſidered.
The deſigns themſelves were thought ſo admirable, as to be preſerved
in the royal collection. King Charles had beſides four plates chaſed

were the gift of Archbiſhop Laud, and were buried for ſecurity in the

a new medalliſt was employed on the few works executed for the King
during the remainder of his life; his name was</p>
               <p>THOMAS RAWLINS.</p>
               <p>The firſt work by which he was known to the public was of a nature
very foreign from his profeſſion; in 1640 he wrote a play called The
Rebellion. <note n="*" place="bottom">See Langbaine, p. 117. Subjoined to a book called Goodfriday, being me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations on that day, printed in 1648, is a collection of poems called Calanthe; by T.

either a patron or relation of Rawlins, or one cannot conceive why he
ſhould have gone back twenty one years to commemorate an obſcure
perſon, ſo little connected with the ſingular events of the period when
it was ſtruck. This medal was in the collection of Sir Hans Sloane,
and is now in the muſeum, as was and is, an oval piece of gold of
Charles II. the reverſe a ſhip; better workmanſhip than the preceding.
There is but one piece more certainly known for his, a caſt in lead,
thus inſcribed, Rob. Bolles de Scampton in com. Lincol. Baronet;
under the ſhoulder T. Rawlins F. 1665. There might be and probably
were other works of his hand, to which in prudence he did not ſet his
name. Such is the bold medalion of Archbiſhop Laud, ſtruck in
1644. He was employed by the crown 'till 1670, when he died.
There is a print of his wife, with this inſcription; Dorothea Narbona

The laſt artiſt that I have to produce of this period, but the
greateſt in his profeſſion that has appeared in theſe kingdoms, and
ſo great, that in that reign of arts we ſcarce know the name of
another architect, was</p>
               <p>INIGO JONES,</p>
               <p>who, if a table of fame like that in the Tatler, were to be formed for
men of real and indiſputable genius in every country, would ſave Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
from the diſgrace of not having her repreſentative among the arts.
She adopted Holbein and Vandyck, ſhe borrowed Rubens, ſhe produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
Inigo Jones. Vitruvius drew up his Grammar, Palladio ſhowed
him the practice, Rome diſplayed a theatre worthy of his emulation,
and King Charles was ready to encourage, employ, and reward his
talents. This is the hiſtory of Inigo Jones as a genius. The particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
of his life have been often written, and therefore I ſhall run them
over very briefly; adding ſome leſs known minutiae [which, I fear,
are the characteriſtics of theſe volumes] and ſome catalogue of his
works.</p>
               <p>He was born about 1572, the ſon of a cloth-worker, and by the
moſt probable accounts, bound apprentice to a joiner, but even in that
obſcure ſituation, the brightneſs of his capacity burſt forth ſo ſtrongly,
that he was taken notice of by one of the great Lords at court; ſome
ſay, it was the Earl of Arundel; the greater <note n="*" place="bottom">Among whom is Loyd in his Memoires, p. 577.</note> number that it was Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam
Earl of Pembroke; though againſt that opinion there is, at leaſt,
a negative evidence, which I ſhall mention preſently. By one of theſe
Lords, Inigo was ſent to Italy to ſtudy landſcape-painting, to which
his inclination then pointed, and for which that he had a talent, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears

by a ſmall piece preſerved at Chiſwick: the colouring is very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different,
but the trees freely and maſterly imagined. He was no
ſooner at Rome, than he found himſelf in his ſphere. He felt that
nature had not formed him to decorate cabinets, but deſign palaces.
He dropped the pencil, and conceived Whitehall. In the ſtate of
Venice he ſaw the works of Palladio, and learned how beautifully taſte
may be exerted on a leſs theatre than the capital of an empire. How
his abilities diſtinguiſhed themſelves in a ſpot where they certainly had
no opportunity to act, <note n="*" place="bottom">Though no building at Venice is attributed to Inigo, the palace and a front of a church at Leghorn are ſaid to be deſigned by him.</note> we are not told, though it would not be the
leaſt curious part of his hiſtory; certain it is, that on the ſtrength of
his reputation at Venice, Chriſtian IV. invited him to Denmark and
appointed him his architect; but on what buildings he was employed
in that country we are yet to learn. James I. found him at Copen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hagen,
and Queen Anne took him in the quality of her architect to
Scotland. He ſerved Prince Henry in the ſame capacity, and the
place of ſurveyor-general of the works was granted to him in reverſion.
On the death of that Prince, with whom at leaſt all his lamented qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
did not die, Jones travelled once more to Italy, and aſſiſted by
ripeneſs of judgment perfected his taſte. To the interval between
thoſe voyages I ſhould be inclined to aſſign thoſe buildings of Inigo,
which are leſs pure, and border too much upon that baſtard ſtyle,
which one calls <hi>King James's Gothic.</hi> Inigo's deſigns of that period are
not Gothic, but have a littleneſs of parts and a weight of ornaments,
with which the revival of the Grecian taſte was encumbered, and
which he ſhook of in his grander deſigns. The ſurveyor's place fell
and he returned to England, and as if architecture was not all he had
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:0853300502:197"/>
learned at Rome, with an air of Roman diſintereſtedneſs he gave up
the profits of his office, which he found extremely in debt, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
on the comptroller and paymaſter to imitate his example, 'till
the whole arrears were cleared.</p>
               <p>In the reign of James I find a payment by a warrant from the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
to Inigo Jones, Thomas Baldwin, William Portington and George
Weale, officers of his majeſty's works, for certain ſcaffolds and other
works by them made, by the command of the Lord Chamberlain,
againſt the arraignment of the Earl of Somerſet and the Counteſs his
Lady. The expence was twenty pounds.</p>
               <p>In the Foedera <note n="*" place="bottom">Vol. xviii, p. 97. See alſo in the Strafford papers ſome letters of Mr. Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rard which contain an account of proceedings under that commiſſion, by virtue of which twenty newly erected houſes in St. Martin's-lane were pulled down.</note> is a commiſſion to the Earl of Arundel, Inigo Jones
and ſeveral others, to prevent building on new foundations within two
miles of London and palace of Weſtminſter.</p>
               <p>In 1620 he was employed in a manner very unworthy of his genius.
King James ſet him upon diſcovering, that is, gueſſing, who were the
founders of Stone-henge. His ideas were all romanized; conſequently
his partiality to his favorite people, which ought rather to have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
him from charging them with that maſs of barbarous clumſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
made him conclude it a Roman Temple. It is remarkable that
whoever has treated of that monument, has beſtowed it on whatever
claſs of antiquity he was peculiarly fond of; and there is not a heap of
ſtones in theſe Northern countries, from which nothing can be proved,
but has been made to depoſe in favour of ſome of theſe fantaſtic hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſes.
Where there was ſo much room for viſion, the Phoenicians
could not avoid coming in for their ſhare of the foundation; and for
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:0853300502:198"/>
Mr. Toland's part, he diſcovered a little ſtone-henge in Ireland, built
by the Druideſs Gealcopa, (who does not know the Druideſs Gealcopa?)
who lived at Iniſoen in the county of Donnegal. <note n="*" place="bottom">See a ſummary of this controverſy in the life of Inigo Jones in the Biogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia Britannica.</note>
               </p>
               <p>In the ſame year Jones was appointed one of the commiſſioners for
the repair of St. Paul's, but which was not commenced 'till the year
1633, when Laud, then Biſhop of London, laid the firſt ſtone and
Inigo the fourth. In the reſtoration of that cathedral he made two capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
faults. He firſt renewed the ſides with very bad Gothic, and then
added a Roman portico, magnificent and beautifull indeed, but which
had no affinity with the ancient parts that remained, and made his own
Gothic appear ten times heavier. He committed the ſame error at
Wincheſter, thruſting a ſcreen in the Roman or Grecian taſte into the
middle of that cathedral. Jones indeed was by no means ſucceſsfull
when he attempted Gothic. The chapel of Lincoln's-inn has none of
the characteriſtics of that architecture. The cloyſter beneath ſeems
oppreſſed by the weight of the building above. <note n="†" place="bottom">In Dugdale's Origines Judiciales, p. 34, is an account of the building of that chapel from a deſign of Inigo. The firſt propoſal of building it was in 1609, but it was retarded 'till about 1617. The charge was eſtimated at two thouſand pounds. It was finiſhed in five years, and conſecrated on Aſcenſion-day 1623 by the Biſhop of London, Dr. Donne preaching the ſermon.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The authors of the life of Jones place the erection of the banquet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting-houſe
in the reign of King Charles; but, as I have ſhown from
the accounts of Nicholas Stone, it was begun in 1619, and finiſhed in
two years—a ſmall part of the pile, deſigned for the palace of our
Kings; but ſo compleat in itſelf, that it ſtands a model of the moſt
pure and beautifull taſte. Several plates of the intended palace of
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:0853300502:199"/>
Whitehall have been given, but, I believe, from no finiſhed deſign.
The four great ſheets are evidently made up from general hints, nor
could ſuch a ſource of invention and taſte, as the mind of Inigo, ever
produce ſo much ſameneſs. The ſtrange kind of cherubims on the
towers at the end are propoſterous ornaments, and whether of Inigo or
not, bear no relation to the reſt. The great towers in the front are
too near, and evidently borrowed from what he had ſeen in Gothic,
not in Roman buildings. The circular court is a pictureſque thought,
but without meaning or utility. The whole fabric however was ſo
glorious an idea, that one forgets for a moment, in the regret for it's
not being executed, the confirmation of our liberties obtained by a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy
ſcene that paſſed before the windows of that very banquet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting-houſe.</p>
               <p>In 1623 he was employed at Somerſet-houſe, where a chapel was to
be fitted up for the Infanta, the intended bride of the Prince. <note n="*" place="bottom">Sir H. Bourgchier in a letter to archbiſhop Uſher, dated July 14, 1623, ſays, "The new chapel for the Inſanta goes on in building." There was another chapel erected for her at St. James's, of which Don Carlos Colonna laid the firſt ſtone. V. Ruſhworth.</note> The

deſigned, and the water-gate, were erected afterwards on the deſigns
of Inigo; as was the gate at York-ſtairs.</p>
               <p>Upon the acceſſion of Charles he was continued in his poſts under
both King and Queen. His fee as ſurveyor was eight ſhillings and
four-pence per day, with an allowance of forty-ſix pounds a year for
houſe-rent, beſides a clerk, and incidental expences. What greater re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
he had are not upon record. Conſidering the havoc made in

the ſmalleſt notices.</p>

During the proſperous ſtate of the King's affairs, the pleaſures of the
court were carried on with much taſte and magnificence. Poetry,
painting, muſic, and architecture, were all called in to make them ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
amuſements; and I have no doubt but the celebrated feſtivals
of Louis XIV. were copied from the ſhows exhibited at Whitehall, in
it's time the moſt polite court in Europe. Ben Johnſon was the lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reat;
Inigo Jones, the inventor of the decorations; Laniere and Fera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boſco
compoſed the ſimphonies; the King, the Queen, and the young
nobility danced in the interludes. We have accounts of many of theſe
entertainments, called maſques: They had been introduced by Anne
of Denmark. I ſhall mention thoſe in which Jones was concerned.</p>
               <p>Hymenaei, or ſolemnities of maſque and barriers, performed on the
twelfth-night 1606, upon occaſion of the marriage of Robert Earl of
Eſſex, and the Lady Frances daughter of the Earl of Suffolk; at court;
by Ben Johnſon. Maſter Alphonſo Feraboſco ſung; maſter Thomas
Giles made and taught the dances.</p>
               <p>Tethys's feſtival, a maſque, preſented on the creation of Henry
Prince of Wales, June 5, 1610. The words by S. Daniel, the ſcenery
contrived and deſcribed by maſter Inigo Jones. This was called the
Queen's wake. Several of the Lords and Ladies acted in it. Daniel
owns that the machinery, and contrivance and ornaments of the ſcenes
made the moſt conſpicuous part of the entertainment.</p>
               <p>February 16, 1613, a maſque at Whitehall on the nuptials of the
Palſgrave and the Princeſs Elizabeth, invented and faſhioned by our
kingdom's moſt artfull and ingenious architect Inigo Jones; digeſted
and written by the ingenious poet, George Chapman. <note n="*" place="bottom">Chapman was an intimate friend of Jones, and in 1616 dedicated his tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Muſaeus "To the moſt generally ingenious and learned architect of his time, Inigo Jones, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> ſurveyor of his majeſty's works." See Wood's Athenac p. 591. Jones made the monument for Chapman in the church-yard of St. Gyles.</note>

gives the higheſt commendation of Inigo's part in this perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance.</p>
               <p>Lord Burlington had a folio of the deſigns for theſe ſolemnities, by
Inigo's own hand, conſiſting of habits, maſks, ſcenes, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The harmony of theſe triumphs was a little interrupted by a war
that broke out between the compoſers, Inigo and Ben; in which who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
was the aggreſſor, the turbulent temper of Johnſon took care to
be moſt in the wrong. Nothing exceeds the groſsneſs of the language
that he poured out, except the badneſs of the verſes that were the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hicle.
There he fully exerted all that brutal abuſe which his cotem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poraries
were willing to think wit, becauſe they were afraid of it; and
which only ſerves to ſhew the arrogance of the man, who preſumed to
ſatirize Jones and rival Shakeſpeare. With the latter indeed he had
not the ſmalleſt pretenſions to be compared, except in having ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
writ abſolute nonſenſe. Johnſon tranſlated the ancients, Shake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeare
transfuſed their very ſoul into his writings.</p>
               <p>Another perſon who ſeems to have born much reſentment to Jones
was Philip Earl of Pembroke; <note n="*" place="bottom">R. Symondes calls him, the bawling coward.</note> in the Harleian library was an edition
of Stone-henge which formerly belonged to that Earl, and the margins
of which were full of ſtrange notes writ by him, not on the work, but
on the author or any thing elſe. I have ſuch another common-place
book, if one may call it ſo, of Earl Philip, the life of Sir Thomas
More. In the Stonehenge are memorandums, jokes, witticiſms and
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:0853300502:203"/>
abuſe on ſeveral perſons, particularly on Cromwell and his daughters,
and on Inigo, whom his Lordſhip calls, Iniquity Jones; and ſays, he
had 16000<hi>l.</hi> a year for keeping the King's houſes in repair. This
might be exaggerated, but a little ſupplies the want I have mentioned
of any record of the rewards beſtowed on ſo great a man. It is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable
that the Earl who does not ſpare reflections on his architect,
never objects to him his having been maintained in Italy by Earl Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam;
nor does Webb in his preface to the Stone-henge, though he
ſpeaks of Inigo's being in Italy, ſay a word of any patron that ſent him
thither. Earl Philip's reſentment to Jones was probably occaſioned
by ſome diſagreement while the latter was employed at Wilton. There
he built that noble front, and a grotto at the end of the water. Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton
is one of the principal objects in a hiſtory of the arts, and Belles
Lettres. Sir Philip Sidney wrote his Arcadia there for his ſiſter;
Vandyck drew many of the race, Holbein and Inigo Jones imagined
the buildings, Earl Thomas compleated the collection of pictures and
aſſembled that throng of ſtatues, and the laſt Earl Henry has ſhown
by a bridge deſigned by himſelf, that had Jones never lived, Wilton
might yet have been a villa worthy of ancient Rome.</p>
               <p>The works of Inigo are not ſcarce, though ſome that bear his name
were productions of his ſcholars: ſome indeed neither of the one nor
the other. Albins in Eſſex, I ſhould attribute to the laſt claſs, though
always aſcribed to Inigo. If he had any hand in it, it muſt have been
during his firſt profeſſion, and before he had ſeen any good buildings.
The houſe is handſome, has large rooms and rich cielings, but all en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
of the King James's Gothic. Piſhiobury in Hertfordſhire is ſaid
to have been built by him for Sir Walter Mildmay. At Woburn is
a grotto-chamber, and ſome other ſmall parts by him, as there is of
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:0853300502:204"/>
his hand at Thorney-abbey, and a ſummer-houſe at Lord Barrington's
in Berkſhire. The middle part of each end of the quadrangle at St.
John's Oxford is aſcribed to him. The ſupporters of the royal arms
are ſtrangly crouded in over the niches; but I have ſeen inſtances of his
over-doing ornament. Charlton-houſe in Kent is another of his ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
works; but ſome critics have thought that only the great gate at
the entrance and the colonades may be of his hand. The cabinet at
Whitehall for the King's pictures was built by him, but we have no
drawing of it. At St. James's he deſigned the Queen's chapel. Surge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on's-hall
is one of his beſt works; and of the moſt admired, the
arcade of Covent-garden and the church; two ſtructures, of which I
want taſte to ſee the beauties: In the arcade there is nothing remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able;
the pilaſters, are as errant and homely ſtripes as any plaiſterer
would make. The barn-roof over the portico of the church ſtrikes my
eyes with as little idea of dignity or beauty <note n="*" place="bottom">In juſtice to Inigo one muſt own, that the defect is not in the architect but in the order—who ever ſaw a beautifull Tuſcan building? would the Romans have choſen that order for a temple? Mr. Onſlow, the late ſpeaker, told me an anecdote that corroborates my opinion of this building. When the Earl of Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſord ſent for Inigo, he told him he wanted a chapel for the pariſhioners of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent-garden, but added, he wou'd not go to any conſiderable expence; in ſhort, ſaid he, I wou'd not have it much better than a barn—well! then, replied Jones, you ſhall have the handſomeſt barn in England.</note> as it could do if it covered
nothing but a barn. The expence of building that church was 4500<hi>l.</hi>
Ambreſbury in Wiltſhire was deſigned by him, but executed by his
ſcholar Webb, who married a couſin-german of Jones. Chevening is
another houſe aſcribed to him, but doubtfull; Gunnerſbury near Brent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford
was certainly his; the portico is too large, and engroſſes the whole
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:0853300502:205"/>
front except a ſingle window at each end. The ſtair-caſe and ſalon are
noble, but deſtroy the reſt of the houſe; the other chambers are ſmall,
and crouded by vaſt chimney-pieces, placed with an Italian negligence
in any corner of the room. Lindſey-houſe <note n="*" place="bottom">Jones was one of the firſt that obſerved the ſame gradual diminution of pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſters as in pillars. Lindſey-houſe owes it's chief grace to this ſingularity.</note> in Lincoln's-inn-fields
has a chaſter front, but is not better diſpoſed for the apartments. In
1618 a ſpecial commiſſion was iſſued to the Lord Chancellor, the Earls
of Worceſter, Pembroke, Arundel, and others, to plant, and reduce to
uniformity Lincoln's inn-fields, <note n="†" place="bottom">That ſquare is laid out with a regard to ſo trifling a circumſtance, as to be of the exact dimenſions of one of the pyramids. This would have been admired in thoſe ages, when the keep at Kenelworth-caſtle was erected in the form of a horſe-fetter, and the Eſcurial in the ſhape of St. Laurence's gridiron.</note> as it ſhall be drawn by way of map
or ground-plot, by Inigo Jones, ſurveyor general of the works. Cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhill,
in Berkſhire, the ſeat of Sir Matthew Pleydell, built in 1650,
and Cobham-hall in Kent, were his; He was employed to rebuild
Caſtle-Aſhby, and finiſhed one front, but the civil war interrupted his
progreſs, there and at Stoke-park in Northamptonſhire. Shaftſbury-houſe,
now the London-lying-in hoſpital, on the eaſt ſide of Alderſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate-ſtreet,
is a beautifull front; at Wing, ſeven miles from his preſent
ſeat at Ethorp, in Buckinghamſhire, Sir William Stanhope pulled
down a houſe built by Inigo. The front to the garden of Hinton St.
George in Somerſetſhire, the ſeat of Earl Poulet; and the front of
Brympton, formerly the manſion of Sir Philip Sydenham, were from
deſigns of Jones; as Chilham-caſtle, and the tower of the church at
Staines, where Inigo ſometime lived, are ſaid to be. So is a very cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
work, if really by him, as I know no other performance of his in
that kind, a bridge at Gwydder in Wales, on the eſtate of the Duke of
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:0853300502:206"/>
Ancaſter. Some alterations and additions he made at Sion. At
Oatlands remains a gate of the old palace, but removed to a little diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
and repaired, with the addition of an inſcription, by the preſent
Earl of Lincoln. The Grange, the ſeat of the Lord Chancellor
Henley in Hampſhire, is entirely of this maſter. It is not a large
houſe, but by far one of the beſt proofs of his taſte. The hall which
opens to a ſmall veſtibule with a cupola, and the ſtaircaſe adjoining,
are beautifull models of the pureſt and moſt claſſic antiquity. The
gate of Beaufort-garden at Chelſea, deſigned by Jones, was purchaſed
by Lord Burlington and tranſported to Chiſwick, where in a temple
are ſome wooden ſeats with lions and other animals for arms, not of
his moſt delicate imagination, brought from Tart-hall. He drew a
plan for a palace at Newmarket, but not that wretched hovel that
ſtands there at preſent. The laſt, and one of the moſt beautifull of
his works, that I ſhall mention, is the Queen's houſe at Greenwich.
The firſt idea of the hoſpital is ſaid to have been taken by Webb from
his papers. The reſt of his deſigns, and his ſmaller works, as chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
and cielings, &amp;c. may be ſeen in the editions of Kent, Ware, Var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
and Campbell.</p>
               <p>Dr. Clarke of Oxford had Jones's Palladio with his own notes and
obſervations in Italian, which the doctor bequeathed to Worceſter col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege.
The Duke of Devonſhire has another with the notes in Latin.
Lord Burlington had a Vitruvius noted by him in the ſame manner.
The ſame Lord had his head by Dobſon. At Houghton, it is by
Vandyck. Hollar engraved one of them. Villamena made a print of
him while he was in Italy. Among the Straſſord papers there is a
letter from Lord Cottington to the Lord deputy ſending him a memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
from Inigo, relating to the procurement of marble from Ireland.</p>

Inigo taſted early of the misfortunes of his maſter: He was not
only a favorite <note n="*" place="bottom">In Vanderdort's catalogue is mention of a picture of Stenwyck bought by Inigo for the King, p. 15, and of a waxen picture of Henry VIII. and a drawing of Prince Henry preſented by him, p. 75.</note> but a Roman catholic. In 1646 he paid 545<hi>l.</hi> for
his delinquency and ſequeſtration. Whether it was before or after
this fine I know not, that he and Stone buried their joint ſtock of ready
money in Scotland-yard; but an order being publiſhed to encourage
the informers of ſuch concealments, and four perſons being privy to
the ſpot where the money was hid, it was taken up and reburied in
Lambeth-marſh.</p>
               <p>Grief, misfortunes. and age, terminated his life. He died at Somer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet-houſe
July 21, 1651, and on the 26th of the ſame month was bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried

               <p>who, we are told by the author of the Engliſh School, was a great en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courager
of painting and a good performer in flowers; ſome of his
works were at the Duke of Leeds's at Wimbleton; and it was ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
that he received inſtructions from Baptiſt Gaſpars, whom he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in his ſervice. The General's ſon John Lambert painted por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traits.
There is a medal of the General by Simon.</p>
               <p>ROBERT WALKER,</p>
               <p>a portrait-painter, cotemporary with Vandyck, but moſt remarkable
for being the principal painter employed by <note n="*" place="bottom">There is a capital half length of General Moncke at the Counteſs of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trath's Twickenham park. I do not know the painter, but probably it was Walker.</note> Cromwell, whoſe picture

he drew more than once. One of thoſe portraits repreſented him with
a gold chain about his neck, to which was appendent a gold medal
with three crowns, the arms of Sweden and a pearl; ſent to him by
Chriſtina in return for his picture by Cooper, on which Milton wrote
a Latin epigram. This head by Walker is in the poſſeſſion of Lord
Mountford at Horſeth in Cambridgeſhire, and was given to the late
Lord by Mr. Commiſſary Greaves, who found it in an Inn in that
County. <note n="*" place="bottom">Another is at the Earl of Eſſex's at Caſhiobury.</note> Another piece contained Cromwell and Lambert together:
This was in Lord Bradford's collection. A third was purchaſed for
the Great Duke, whoſe agent having orders to procure one, and meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with this in the hands of a female relation of the protector, offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to purchaſe it; but being refuſed, and continuing his ſollicitation,
to put him off, ſhe aſked 500<hi>l.</hi>—and was paid it. It was on one of
theſe portraits that Elſum wrote his epigram, which is no better than

ten pounds for the portrait of Mr. Thomas Knight's wife to the
knees; that ſhe ſat thrice to him, four or five hours at a time. That
for two half lengths of philoſophers, which he drew from poor old
men, he had ten pounds each in 1652; that he paid twenty five
pounds for the Venus putting on her ſmock (by Titian) which was the
King's, and valued it at ſixty-pounds, as he was told by Mrs. Board<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,

               <p>Walker had for ſome time an apartment in Arundel-houſe and died

This man had formerly been ſervant of Maſcall and had married his

of bleſſed memory, having bene, divers yeares ſince, informed of the
great prejudice and daily loſſe which his loveing ſubjects did ſuſteyne,
by the uſe of private and unwarranted farthing tokens of lead, braſſe
and other mettale, which divers vintners, victuallers, tapſters, chaund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,
bakers and other inferior tradeſmen, were then wont to obtrude
and putt upon their chapmen and cuſtomers in the buying and ſelling

the inconvenience and loſſe that theſe tokens brought with them to the
poorer ſort of people, the uſe of them was not without ſome wrong to
his royall prerogative, which ought not only to authorize all ſorts of
coyne, but whatſoever elſe in the nature of coyne ſhould ſerve as the

luy tout ordre ne ſçavoit que dire, mais craignant que l' Engleterre

pour m'aſſeurer de ſon integritté de ſon Zelle, et ſincere intention.
En un mot pour faire cognoiſtre que les ordres euſſent eſtes pluſtoſt

juſques a ce que Don Diego vienne, non ſeulement d'un acomodement
entre l'Eſpagne et l'Engletere, mais auſſi pour l'Aleſmagne et

a faire tout debvoir, mais qu'il neſtoiſt poſſible d'avancer l'affaire ſens
que de la part d'Eſpagne, l'on ne viſt des teſmoignages eficatieux, ſur

Il a promis qu'il feroiſt toutte diligence, et ſur ce ay eſté obligé
d'attendre de ces premieres nouvelles, par advis de Monſ. Carleton.
J'ay faict entendre au dict Rub. la ligue que le roy de France pretend
de faire avecq les Princes catholiques d'Aleſmagne. L'argent quelle

Le S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Rubens a veu lettres eſcriptes de France a l'Infante et Marquis
Spignola leſquelles ſont dreſſées par le Cardinal de Richelieu, diſant
lors que Monſ. de Montagu parloit au Duc de Savoye touchant les
affaires de la France, et l'Engleterre, que l'Ambaſſadeur de France la

               <p>Le Cardinal de Richelieu aiant ombrage du voiage de Meſſias, ſe
diſant en France que c'eſt pour traitter avecq l'Engleterre, il a faict
promtement eſcripre une lettre a Artſen, ſi toſt que l'armée des eſtats
aſſiegeroient une plaſſe de l'ennemy que la France leur fera tenir cinq
cents mille livres, eſperant par ce moien et par les 60/m livres qu'ils ont
fourny au roy de Dennemarque d'apportter lenpeſchement a l'acom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modement
des affaires entre l'Eſpagne et l'Engleterre, ceſt un argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

               <p>Les Lettres de Paris du 25 font mention d'une ſoulevation qu'il y a
