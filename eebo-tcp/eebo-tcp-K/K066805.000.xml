            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <head>THE ARGUMENT OF THE ODE</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>SAUL,</hi> for his Diſobedience to Heaven, is afflicted
with the Fiend of <hi>MELANCHOLY, p. 5. DAVID</hi> is ſent for, to cure him
by the Power of Muſic, <hi>p. 6.</hi> He comes, attended with a Choir of
Shepherds; and, as the means of diſpelling <hi>SAUL's</hi> Deſpair, he
ſings the Creation of the World, and the happy Eſtate of our firſt
Parents in Paradiſe, <hi>ib. to 9. SAUL</hi> is moved by the
Repreſentation; but expoſtulates with DAVID, "why, when others are happy,
He ſhould be miſerable" <hi>p. 10. DAVID,</hi> to convince him that Guilt
is the Source of Miſery, ſings the Fall of Man, and his Expulſion from
Paradiſe, <hi>ib.</hi> This alarms the Monarch's Pride; and inſtead of
reclaiming, provokes him to Reſentment and Rage, <hi>p. 11. DAVID,</hi>
ſuperior to his Threats, awakens his Conſcience, and terrifies him, by
ſinging the Fate and Puniſhment of Guilt, in the Deſtruction of the
rebellious Tribe of <hi>CHORAH</hi> by an Earthquake, and of the guilty World
by the general <pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0964200100:4"/> Deluge, <hi>p. 11, 12, 13. SAUL,</hi>
ſtruck with Horror, attempts to kill himſelf, <hi>p. 14.</hi> But being
prevented by his Friends, <hi>DAVID</hi> ſooths his Anguiſh, by invoking
Repentance and divine Mercy to compoſe his Paſſions, <hi>p. 14. SAUL</hi>
relents into virtuous Sorrow, <hi>p. 15.</hi> But his Deſpair returning,
<hi>DAVID</hi> calls on his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendant Choir to raiſe a more ſublime and
affecting Strain, <hi>p. 16.</hi> This hath its Effect; and <hi>SAUL</hi> melts
into Tears of Penitence, <hi>ib. DAVID</hi> now comforts him with the Return of
the divine Favour, <hi>p. 17.</hi> To baniſh the Remains of Pride, he then
ſings his own Happineſs in the humble Station of a Shepherd, <hi>ib.</hi>
Still farther to compoſe the Monarch's Griefs, by a Strain of ſoft Muſic
he throws him into a gentle Slumber; invoking celeſtial viſions to
tranſport him to the Regions of the Bleſſed, and change his Anguiſh
into Joy, <hi>p. 18.</hi> The deſired Effects appear in his Countenance: The
Fiend departs: And <hi>SAUL</hi> awakes in perfect Tranquillity, <hi>p. 18.
DAVID</hi> then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes with a Song of Triumph on the Powers of Harmony, and
the ſeraphic Hymn that attended her, as the Miniſter of Heaven, on the
Creation of the World, <hi>p. 19.</hi>

<hi>Race</hi> of <hi>Man,</hi> will be moſt effectually inveſtigated, as to
its <hi>Origin</hi> and <hi>Progreſs,</hi> by viewing Man in his

Art have caſt their Veil over the human Mind, its various Powers throw
themſelves out, and all its Workings preſent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves inſtantly, and
without Diſguiſe.</p>
            <p>It may be affirmed with Truth, that, for Want of begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning our
Inquiries at this early and neglected Period, and by viewing Man under his
State of <hi>Civilization</hi> only, many curious and intereſting Queſtions
have been left involved in Darkneſs, which might have been clearly unfolded

            <head>SECT. III. Of Muſic, Dance, and Poem, in the ſavage
State.</head>
            <p>BY examining ſavage Life, where untaught Nature rules, we find
that the <hi>agreeable Paſſions</hi> of Love, Pity, Hope, Joy, and
Exultation, no leſs than their <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries</hi> of Hate, Revenge, Fear,
Sorrow, and Deſpair, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing the human Heart by their mighty Force,
are thrown out by the three Powers of <hi>Action, Voice,</hi> and
<hi>articulate Sounds.</hi> The <hi>Brute</hi> Creatures expreſs their
Paſſions by the two firſt of Theſe; ſome by <hi>Action,</hi> ſome
by <hi>Voice,</hi> and ſome by <hi>both</hi> united: Beyond theſe,
<hi>Man</hi> has the added Power of <hi>articulate Speech:</hi> The ſame
Force of <hi>Aſſociation</hi> and <hi>Fancy</hi> which gives him <hi>higher
Degrees</hi> and a <hi>wider Variety</hi> of <hi>Paſſion,</hi> gives riſe
to this <hi>additional Power</hi> of expreſſing thoſe Paſſions which
he feels.</p>
            <p>Among the <hi>Savages</hi> who are in the <hi>loweſt Scale</hi> of
the human Kind, theſe ſeveral Modes of expreſſing their Paſſions
are found altogether ſuited to their wretched State. Their
<hi>Geſtures</hi> are <hi>uncouth</hi> and <hi>horrid:</hi> Their
<hi>Voice</hi> is thrown out in <hi>Howls</hi> and <hi>Roarings:</hi> Their
<hi>Language</hi> is like the <hi>Gabbling of Geeſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if we aſcend a Step or two higher in the Scale of ſavage
Life, we ſhall find this <hi>Chaos</hi> of <hi>Geſture, Voice,</hi> and
<hi>Speech,</hi> riſing into an agreeable <hi>Order</hi> and
<hi>Proportion.</hi> The natural Love of a <hi>meaſured Melody,</hi> which
Time and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience produce, throws the <hi>Voice</hi> into <hi>Song,</hi> the
<hi>Geſture</hi> into <hi>Dance,</hi> the <hi>Speech</hi> into
<hi>Verſe</hi> or <hi>Numbers.</hi> The Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of muſical
<hi>Inſtruments</hi> comes of Courſe: They are <pb n="28" facs="tcp:0964200100:27"/> but
<hi>Imitations</hi> of the human Voice, or of other natural Sounds, produced
gradually by frequent Trial and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment.</p>
            <p>Such is the Generation and natural Alliance of theſe three
<hi>Siſter-Graces, Muſic, Dance,</hi> and <hi>Poem,</hi> which we find
moving Hand in Hand among the ſavage Tribes of every Climate.</p>
            <p>For the Truth of the Fact, we may appeal to moſt of the Travellers
who deſcribe the Scenes of uncultivated Nature: All theſe agree in telling
us, that <hi>Melody, Dance,</hi> and <hi>Song,</hi> make up the ruling
Paſtime, adorn the Feaſts, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Religion, fix the Manners,
ſtrengthen the Policy, and even form the future Paradiſe, of ſavage Man.
That having few Wants, and conſequently much Leiſure, the barbarous Tribes
addict themſelves to theſe aſſuring Arts with a wonderful Degree of
Paſſion, unleſs where their Manners are corrupted by an incidental
Commerce with the Off-ſcum of civilized Nations. By theſe attractive and
powerful Arts they celebrate their public Solemnities; by theſe they lament
their private and public Calamities, the Death of Friends, or the Loſs of
Warriors: By theſe united, they expreſs their Joy on their Marriages,
Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſts, Huntings, Victories; praiſe the great Actions of their Gods and
Heroes; excite each other to War and brave Exploits, or to ſuffer Death and
Torments with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaken Conſtancy.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the Circumſtances moſt <hi>common</hi> to the
ſavage Tribes: Beſides theſe, there are many <hi>peculiar</hi> Modes,
which ariſe from their different Climates, Situations, Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, Manners.
Among ſome Tribes the <hi>joyous</hi> Paſſions, <pb n="29" facs="tcp:0964200100:28"/>
among ſome the <hi>gentle,</hi> among others the <hi>ferocious,</hi>
pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominate and take Place. To give all the Varieties of theſe ſavage and
feſtal Solemnities, were an endleſs Labour. Let the following Account
ſuffice, as a general Image of the reſt; which is ſingled out, not only
becauſe it is the moſt circumſtantial; but likewiſe for the particular
Relation which it will be found to bear to a following Part of this
Inquiry.</p>
            <p>The IROQUOIS, HURONS, and ſome leſs conſiderable Tribes, are
free and independent Savages, who inhabit the northern Continent of AMERICA;
and extend their Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlements from the Back of the <hi>Britiſh Colonies</hi>
to the Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the <hi>Great Lakes,</hi> along the Skirts of LOUISIANA, and
down the River OHIO, towards the MISSISIPI, and the Gulph of FLORIDA. Father

               </note> gives the following Deſcription of their
feſtal Solemnities; which it is neceſſary to tranſcribe at large, in
order to give an adequate Idea of their Manners and Character.</p>
            <q> 
               <p> "On the appointed Day, early in the Morning, they prepare the
Feaſt in the <hi>Council-Cabbin,</hi> and there they diſpoſe all Things
for the Aſſembly.—In the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, a public Crier goes through the
Village, and gives Notice that the <hi>Kettle</hi> is hung on in ſuch a
Cabbin: The common People, and even the Chiefs, bring with them their
<hi>little Kettle.</hi> It doth not appear, that there is any Diſtinction of
Ranks among them, except that the <hi>old Men</hi> occupy the foremoſt Matts.
The IRO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>QUOISE <hi>Women</hi> aſſiſt not, that I know of, at theſe Kind
of Feaſts; nor are they invited. The <hi>Children,</hi> and 
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0964200100:29"/> 
                  <hi>young Men,</hi> who are not as yet choſen into the
Body of Warriors, mount upon the Scaffolds which are placed over the Matts, and
even upon the Roof of the Cabbin itſelf, and look down through the Hole at
which the Smoke goes out."</p> 
               <p> "While the Aſſembly is forming, He who makes the Feaſt, or He
in whoſe Name it is made, <hi>ſings alone.</hi>—The Deſign of this
is to entertain the Company, on ſuch Things as have Relation to the Subject
on which they aſſemble. Theſe <hi>Songs,</hi> for the moſt Part, are
fill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the <hi>Fables</hi> of <hi>ancient Times,</hi> the <hi>heroic
Deeds</hi> of their <hi>Nation</hi>; and are compoſed in an <hi>antiquated
Style</hi>; ſo old, that often they underſtand not what they ſay. The
Singer hath ſometimes an Aſſiſtant, who relieves him when he is
fatigued: For they ſing with all their Force."</p> 
               <p> "The Speaker then opens the Scene, by aſking in Form, if all who
are invited are come. He then names the Perſon who makes the Feaſt, he
declares the Occaſion on which it is made, and enters into a particular
Detail of all that is in the Kettle. At every thing which he names, the whole
Choir replies by a repeated Shout of Approbation."</p> 
               <p> "The Speaker then gives an Account of every thing, which it is of
Importance that the Public ſhould know. For theſe <hi>Song-Feaſts,</hi>
being made on all <hi>weighty Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions</hi> which regard the
<hi>Village</hi> or the <hi>Nation</hi>; this is the proper Time for public
Affairs, as that of renewing a <hi>Name,</hi> hearing <hi>Ambaſſadors,</hi>
or <hi>proclaiming War</hi> by <hi>Song.</hi>"</p> 
               <p>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:0964200100:30"/> "When the Orator hath done ſpeaking,
ſometimes they begin to eat before they ſing, that they may have the better
Spirits: Sometimes they ſing before they eat: If the Feaſt is to continue
for the whole Day, the Kettle is in Part empty'd in the Morning, and in Part
reſerved for the Evening; and in the Intervals they <hi>ſing</hi> and
<hi>dance.</hi>"</p> 
               <p> "The Maſter of the Feaſt touches nothing. He buſies himſelf
only in ſeeing that the Company be ſerved, or in ſerving them himſelf;
naming aloud the Pieces which he deſtines and preſents to each. The beſt
Morſels are given, by Way of Preference, to thoſe whom he chuſeth to
diſtinguiſh."</p> 
               <p> "After the Repaſt, the Maſter of the Feaſt begins the
<hi>Athonront,</hi> a <hi>Song and Dance</hi> peculiar to the <hi>Men.</hi>
They relieve each other, by beginning with thoſe of <hi>moſt
Conſideration,</hi> and paſſing gradually down to the
<hi>Young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt.</hi> They have that Civility and Attention to each other, that
every one waits till another of ſuperior Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity enters the Liſts, and
takes the Lead."</p> 
               <p> "The <hi>Ancients</hi> and Men of Dignity often do no more than
<hi>riſe</hi> from their Seats; and content themſelves, while they
<hi>ſing,</hi> with making ſome <hi>Inflexions</hi> with their Head,
Shoulders, and Knees, in order to <hi>accompany</hi> and <hi>ſuſtain</hi>
their <hi>Song.</hi> Others ſomewhat leſs grave, take a few Steps, and walk
along the Cabin around the Fires. Every one hath his particular <hi>Song</hi>;
that is, an <hi>Air,</hi> to which he <hi>adjuſts</hi> a very few
<hi>Words,</hi> which he repeats as often as he pleaſeth. I have obſerved,
that they even <hi>retrench</hi> 
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:0964200100:31"/> or <hi>ſtrike off</hi>
ſome <hi>Syllables</hi> from their Words, as if they were <hi>Verſes,</hi>
or <hi>meaſured</hi> Words, but <hi>without Rhyme.</hi>"</p> 
               <p> "He who means to dance, begins by riſing from his Matt; and the
whole Company anſwers him by a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Shout of Approbation: As he
paſſeth along before every Fire, they who ſit on each Side <hi>beat</hi>
the <hi>Meaſure</hi> or <hi>Cadence</hi> of his <hi>Song</hi> by a
correſpondent Motion of the Head; and by throwing out continual Shouts which
they redouble at certain Times, where the Meaſure de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands it, with ſo much
Truth, that they never err; and with ſuch a Delicacy of Ear, as the
<hi>French,</hi> who are moſt practiſed in their Cuſtoms, cannot attain
to. When he paſſeth to a ſecond Fire, They of the firſt take Breath:
They of the more diſtant Fires are likewiſe ſilent: But the <hi>Time</hi>
is always <hi>beat</hi> by thoſe before whoſe Fire he ſings and dances.
The Song concludes by a general <hi>Ehoue!</hi> of the whole Choir; which is a
ſecond Shout of Approbation."</p> 
               <p> "The <hi>young</hi> Men have their <hi>Songs</hi> of a more
<hi>lively,</hi> and their <hi>Dances</hi> of a more <hi>vigorous</hi> Caſt;
ſuch as are ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to their Age. When the Dance is much animated, they
dance two or three together, each at his own Fire: Nor does this Mixture ever
occaſion any Confuſion."</p> 
               <p> "Among theſe Dances, <hi>ſome</hi> are no more than a
<hi>ſimple</hi> and <hi>noble</hi> Manner of <hi>marching</hi> up to an
<hi>Enemy</hi>; and of <hi>facing Danger</hi> with <hi>Intrepidity</hi> and
<hi>Gaiety</hi> of Mind."</p> 
               <p> "A ſecond Sort of Dance, but ſtill of the ſame Kind, is that
of the <hi>Pantomimes:</hi> Which conſiſts in repreſenting an Action in
the Manner in which it paſſed, or ſuch as they conceive it to have been.
Many of thoſe who have <pb n="33" facs="tcp:0964200100:32"/> lived among the IROQUOIS, have
aſſured me, that after a Chief of War hath circumſtantially recounted, at
his Return, all that had paſſed in the Expeditions he had undertaken, and
the Battles he had fought, they who are preſent at the Recital often riſe
on the ſudden to dance, and repreſent thoſe Actions with great Vivacity,
as if they had been preſent: And all this, without any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious Concert or
Preparation."</p> 
               <p> "In their <hi>Songs</hi> they <hi>praiſe</hi> not only their
<hi>Gods</hi> and <hi>Heroes,</hi> but they likewiſe praiſe
<hi>themſelves:</hi> In this they are not ſparing: and are even
<hi>prodigal</hi> in their <hi>Praiſe</hi> of <hi>others,</hi> whom they
think <hi>worthy</hi> of it. He who is thus applauded, anſwers by a ſhout
of Thanks, as ſoon as he hears himſelf named."</p> 
               <p> "They are ſtill quicker at <hi>rallying</hi> each other; and
ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to a Wonder in This. He who dances, takes whomſoever he pleaſeth
by the Hand, and brings him forth into the midſt of the Aſſembly: to
which he yields without Reſiſtance. Meanwhile the <hi>Dancer</hi>
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues to <hi>ſing</hi>; and ſometimes in his <hi>Song,</hi> and
ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in the <hi>Intervals,</hi> he throws his <hi>Sarcaſms</hi> on
the Patient, who hears him without Reply.—At every <hi>Bon Mot,</hi> loud
<hi>Peals</hi> of <hi>Laughter</hi> ariſe along the <hi>Galleries,</hi> who
<hi>animate</hi> this <hi>Sport,</hi> and often oblige the Patient to cover his
Head in his Mantle."</p> 
               <p> "They have another Kind of <hi>Dance,</hi> in which the whole
<hi>Choir</hi> dances: and this is common both to Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. As this is
very different from the preceeding ones, they do not uſe it in their
<hi>Song-Feaſts.</hi> Their Pretenders <pb n="34" facs="tcp:0964200100:33"/> to Magic<note n="c" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Charlatans,</hi>—a Word with which we have none
preciſely correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in our Language: It ſignifies here, one who is a
Pretender to <hi>Mede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine</hi> by the Arts of <hi>Magic.</hi>
                  </note> often
ordain it as an <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> for the <hi>healing</hi> of
the <hi>Sick:</hi> it is alſo one of their Modes of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vination.</hi> It
is likewiſe practiſed, at Times, as a mere Exerciſe of
<hi>Pleaſure,</hi> at the Feaſts and Solemnities of the Village. The Manner
is as follows. Notice is given early in the Morning through all the Cabins, for
the Performance of this Ceremony: Every Cabin de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes a certain Number, either
of Men or Women, who dreſs themſelves in all their Finery, that they may go
and perform their Part. They all appear at the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Hour (which is
proclaimed by a public Crier) either in the Council-Cabin, or ſome other
Place deſtined for the Purpoſe. In the middle of the Place or Cabin they
build a little Scaffold; and on this they raiſe a ſmall Seat for the
<hi>Singers</hi> who are to <hi>accompany</hi> and <hi>animate</hi> the
<hi>Dance.</hi> One holds in his Hand a <hi>Tambour</hi> or little
<hi>Drum,</hi> the other a <hi>Tortoiſe Shell.</hi> While theſe ſing, and
accompany their Song with the Sound of their Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments (which is farther
Strengthened by the Spectators, who beat with little Sticks upon the
<hi>Kettles</hi> that are before them) they who dance, go round in a circular
Movement; but without taking Hands, as they do in Europe. Each Dancer makes
various Motions with his Feet and Hands, as he pleaſeth: And though all the
Movements are different, according to the Whim and Caprice of their
Imagination, none of them ever loſe the <hi>Time.</hi> They who are moſt
expert in varying their <pb n="35" facs="tcp:0964200100:34"/> Poſtures, and throwing
themſelves into Action, are reckoned to excel the reſt. The Dance is
compoſed of ſeveral <hi>Returns:</hi> Each <hi>Return</hi> laſts till the
Dancers are out of Breath; and after a ſhort Interval of <hi>Repoſe,</hi>
they begin <hi>another.</hi> Nothing can be more animated than theſe
Movements: To ſee them, one would ſay, they were a Troop of furious and
frantic People. What muſt fatigue them ſtill more is, that not only by
their Move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment but likewiſe with their Voice, they follow the Sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and
their Inſtruments to the End of each <hi>Return</hi>; which is always
cloſed by a general and loud <hi>Oueh!</hi> which is a Shout of Approbation,
implying that the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn</hi> hath been well performed."</p> 
               <p> "Athough I have not ſpoken particularly of any Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions but
thoſe of the IROQUOIS and HURONS, yet I may truly ſay, that I have
deſcribed, at the ſame Time, <hi>all</hi> the other barbarous Nations of

though there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to be a great Difference between the <hi>Monarchic</hi>
and <hi>Oligarchic</hi> State, yet the Genius of their ſavage Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy is
every where the ſame: We find the ſame Turn for public Affairs, the ſame
Method of conducting them, the ſame Uſe of ſecret and ſolemn

fond of theſe Feaſts even to Diſtraction. They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue them whole Days

            <head>SECT. IV. Of the natural Conſequences of a ſuppoſed
Civilization.</head>
            <p>WHILE theſe free and warlike Savages continue in their preſent
<hi>unlettered</hi> State of Ignorance and Simplicity, no material Improvements
in their <hi>Song-Feaſts</hi> can ariſe. But let us ſuppoſe that the
Uſe of <hi>Letters</hi> ſhould come among them, and, as a Cauſe or
Conſequence of <hi>Civilization,</hi> be cultivated with that Spirit which is
natural to a free and active People; and many notable Conſequences would
appear. Let us conſider the moſt probable and ſtriking among theſe
natural Effects.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Their Idea of <hi>Muſic,</hi> in its moſt
<hi>inlarged</hi> Senſe, would comprehend the three Circumſtances of
<hi>Melody, Dance,</hi> and <hi>Song.</hi> For theſe three, as we have
ſeen, being na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally conjoined, becauſe naturally producing each other,
would not <hi>ſeparately</hi> command the Attention of ſuch a People at
their public Feſtivals. Therefore <hi>Inſtrumental Melody,</hi> without
<hi>Song,</hi> would be little attended to, and of <hi>no Eſteem</hi>;
becauſe it would want all thoſe Attractions which muſt ariſe from the
correſpondent <hi>Dance</hi> and <hi>Song.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:0964200100:36"/>2. In the early Periods of ſuch a
Commonwealth, the <hi>Chiefs</hi> or <hi>Legiſlators</hi> would often be the
<hi>principal Muſicians.</hi> The two Characters would commonly coaleſce;
for we find, that, among the ſavage Tribes, the <hi>Chiefs</hi> are they who
moſt ſignalize themſelves by <hi>Dance</hi> and <hi>Song</hi>; and that
their <hi>Songs</hi> rowl principally on the <hi>great Actions</hi> and
<hi>Events</hi> which concern their <hi>own Nation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Hence, their moſt ancient <hi>Gods</hi> would naturally
be ſtyled <hi>Singers</hi> and <hi>Dancers.</hi> For the moſt ancient
<hi>Gods</hi> of civilized Pagan Countries, are generally their early
<hi>Legiſlators,</hi> who taught their People the firſt Arts of Life.
Theſe deceaſed Legiſlators, therefore, when advanced to the Rank of Gods,
would naturally be delivered down to Poſterity with the ſame Attributes and
Qualities by which they had diſtinguiſhed themſelves in Life: And it
ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, from the laſt Article, that theſe Qualities would naturally be
thoſe of <hi>Dance</hi> and <hi>Song.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Meaſured Periods, or in other Words, <hi>Rythm,
Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,</hi> and <hi>Verſe,</hi> would naturally ariſe. For meaſured
Cadence, or <hi>Time,</hi> is an eſſential Part of Melody, into which the
human Ear naturally falls. And as the ſame Force of Ear would lead the Action
or Dance to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpond with the Melody, ſo the Words or Song muſt, on a
like Principle, keep Pace with <hi>Both.</hi> Among the <hi>ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage
Americans</hi> we ſee the firſt Rudiments of poetic Numbers, emerging from
this Source. For 
<q rend="inline">"as the Means of adjuſting the Words to the Air or
Melody, they ſometimes ſtrike off Syllables from their Words."</q> And
ſuch is the natural Generation of <hi>Rythm</hi> and <hi>Verſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. Their earlieſt <hi>Hiſtories</hi> would be written in
<hi>Verſe.</hi> For we ſee, that among the ſavage Tribes, the Actions of 
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0964200100:37"/> their Heroes and Gods, and the great Events of their
Nation, make a principal Part of their Songs. When<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, therefore, the Uſe
of Letters ſhould come among ſuch a People, theſe <hi>ancient Songs</hi>
would naturally be <hi>firſt recorded,</hi> for the Information and Uſe of
future Times.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Their moſt ancient <hi>Maxims, Exhortations,
Proverbs,</hi> or <hi>Laws,</hi> would probably be written in Verſe. For
theſe would naturally make a Part of their <hi>Songs</hi> of Celebration, and
would by Degrees be <hi>ſelected</hi> from thence, would in Time become the
<hi>Standard</hi> of <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Wrong,</hi> and as ſuch, be
treaſured up and appealed to by the improving Tribe.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Their <hi>religious Rites</hi> would naturally be performed
or accompany'd by <hi>Dance</hi> and <hi>Song.</hi> For it appears from Fact
that the great Actions of their Gods and Heroes are the moſt general Subject
of the ſavage Dance and Song; and the common End of Pagan Rites hath ever
been, to praiſe the Gods of the Country, and by theſe Means (as well as by
Sacrifice) to appeaſe their Wrath, or ſecure their Favour.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Their <hi>earlieſt Oracles</hi> would probably be
delivered in <hi>Verſe,</hi> and <hi>ſung</hi> by the Prieſt or
Prieſteſs of the ſuppoſed God. For theſe <hi>Oracles,</hi> being
ſuppoſed to be <hi>inſpired</hi> by a deceaſed <hi>Chief</hi> (now a
<hi>Deity)</hi> who had himſelf delivered his Exhortations in this
<hi>enthuſiaſtic Manner</hi>; and being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed to a Tribe among
whom this Mode of Inſtruction univerſally prevailed, no other Vehicle but
that of <hi>Verſe</hi> and <hi>Song</hi> could at firſt gain theſe
<hi>Oracles</hi> either <hi>Credit</hi> or <hi>Reception.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="9">9. Their <hi>Melody</hi> would be <hi>ſimple</hi>; and
derive a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Part of its Power from its <hi>Rythm</hi> or
<hi>Meaſure,</hi> without <pb n="39" facs="tcp:0964200100:38"/> any Mixture of <hi>artificial
Compoſition.</hi> Firſt, becauſe this Kind would be moſt ſuited to
the <hi>Powers</hi> of the barbarous <hi>Legiſlators</hi> or <hi>Bards,</hi>
at once <hi>Compoſers</hi> and <hi>Performers,</hi> among whom nothing
artificial or refined could as yet take Place. Secondly, becauſe this
<hi>Simplicity</hi> of Manner would be beſt adapted to the Capacity of the
ſurrounding People, incapable, in this early Period, to be attracted or moved
by any thing but what <hi>Nature</hi> dictates.</p>
            <p n="10">10. The Force of this ſimple Melody would be much
increaſed by the Power of early <hi>Aſſociation</hi> and continued
<hi>Habit.</hi> For this, by <hi>appropriating</hi> certain <hi>Sounds</hi> to
certain <hi>Subjects,</hi> would raiſe their Melody into a Kind of natural
and expreſſive Language of the Paſſions.</p>
            <p n="11">11. Their <hi>Songs</hi> would be of a <hi>legiſlative</hi>
Caſt; and being drawn chiefly from the Fables or Hiſtory of their own
Country, would contain the eſſential Parts of their <hi>religious,
moral,</hi> and <hi>political</hi> Syſtems. For we have ſeen above, that
the <hi>Celebration</hi> of their deceaſed Heroes would of Courſe grow into
a <hi>religious</hi> Act: That the <hi>Exhortations</hi> and <hi>Maxims</hi>
intermixed with theſe Celebrations, and found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the <hi>Example</hi> of
their <hi>Heroe-Gods,</hi> would naturally become the <hi>Standard</hi> of
<hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Wrong</hi>; that is, the Foundation of <hi>private
Morals</hi> and <hi>public Law:</hi> And thus, the whole Fabric of their
<hi>Religion, Morals,</hi> and <hi>Polity,</hi> would naturally ariſe from,
and be included in their <hi>Songs,</hi> during their Progreſs from ſavage
to civilized Life.</p>
            <p n="12">12. MUSIC, in the extended Senſe of the Word (that is,
including Melody, Dance, and Song) would make an eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential and principal
Part in the <hi>Education</hi> of their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. For the important Principles
of their <hi>Religion, Morals,</hi> and <hi>Polity,</hi> being delivered and
inculcated in their <pb n="40" facs="tcp:0964200100:39"/> 
               <hi>Songs,</hi> no other Method could
be deviſed, which would ſo ſtrongly impreſs the youthful Mind with the
<hi>approved Principles</hi> of <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Action.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="13">13. MUSIC therefore (in this extended Senſe) muſt gain a
great and <hi>univerſal Power</hi> over the minds and Actions of ſuch a
People. For through the Force of early and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued <hi>Habit,</hi> together
with the irreſiſtible Contagion of general <hi>Example,</hi> while every
thing pleaſing, great, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant, was conveyed through this Medium, and
through this only, ſuch ſtrong Impreſſions would ſtrike themſelves
into the growing Mind, as would give it its ruling Colour through Life, and
ſuch as no future Incidents could eaſily weaken or efface.</p>
            <p n="14">14. In the Courſe of Time, and the Progreſs of Polity and
Arts, a <hi>Separation</hi> of the ſeveral Parts or Branches of Muſic (in
its extended Senſe) would naturally ariſe. Till a certain Period of
Civilization, Letters, and Art, the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Kinds would of courſe lie
confuſed, in a Sort of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſtinguiſhed Maſs, and be mingled in the
ſame Compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as Inclination, Enthuſiaſm, or other Incidents might
impel. But repeated Trial and Experiment would natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally produce a more
artificial Manner; and thus, by De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, the ſeveral Kinds of Poem would
aſſume their legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate Forms.</p>
            <p n="15">15. If their warlike Character continued, the <hi>Dance</hi>
would naturally <hi>ſeparate</hi> from the <hi>Song</hi>; and would itſelf
become a <hi>diſtinct Exerciſe</hi> or <hi>Art,</hi> for the ſake of
increaſing their Strength and Agility of Body, as the Means of ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
them invincible in War. For the Dance or Action of their Song-Feaſts, being
only ſecondary, and merely an Appendage to the Song, would not be of a
Character ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently <pb n="41" facs="tcp:0964200100:40"/> ſevere for the fierce and
ſtubborn Contention of thoſe who were deſtined to the immediate Toils of
warlike Service.</p>
            <p n="16">16. After a certain Period of Civilization, the complex
Character of <hi>Legiſlator</hi> and <hi>Bard</hi> would <hi>ſeparate,</hi>
or be ſeldom united. For as the Society grew more populous, and the
increaſing Arts of Life increaſed the Labours and Cares of Government, the
<hi>muſical Art</hi> (in its extended Senſe) would of courſe be delegated
by the civil Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, to ſuch Men of Genius and Worth, as might apply
it to its proper Ends, the Inſtruction and Welfare of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>
            <p n="17">17. <hi>Hymns</hi> or <hi>Odes</hi> would be compoſed, and
<hi>Sung</hi> by their Compoſers at their feſtal Solemnities. For theſe,
in their ſimple State, are but a Kind of rapturous Exclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Joy,
Grief, Triumph, or Exultation, in Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of ſome great or
diſaſtrous Action, known, alluded to, or expreſſed: A Species of
Compoſition which naturally ariſeth from the ſavage Song-Feaſt.</p>
            <p n="18">18. The <hi>Epic Poem</hi> would naturally ariſe, and be
ſung by its Compoſers at their public Solemnities. For it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
above<note n="d" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>Article 5.</bibl>
               </note>, that their
earlieſt Hiſtories would be writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in Verſe, and make a Part of their
public Song-Feaſts. Now the <hi>Epic Poem</hi> is but a Kind of <hi>fabulous
Hiſtory,</hi> rowling chiefly on the great Actions of ancient Gods and
Heroes, and artificially compoſed under certain Limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations with Reſpect
to its <hi>Manner,</hi> for the Ends of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, Admiration, and
Inſtruction.</p>
            <p n="19">19. From an <hi>Union</hi> of theſe two, a certain rude
Outline of <hi>Tragedy</hi> would naturally ariſe. We may ſee the firſt
Seeds or Principles of this Poem, in the Conduct of the ſavage
<hi>Song-Feaſt.</hi> A <hi>Chief ſings</hi> ſome great Action of a 
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0964200100:41"/> God or Heroe: The ſurrounding <hi>Choir anſwer</hi>
him at In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervals, by Shouts of Sympathy or concurrent Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation.</p>
            <p n="20">20. In Proceſs of Time, this barbarous Scene would improve
into a more perfect Form: Inſtead of <hi>relating,</hi> they would probably
repreſent, by Action and Song united, thoſe great or terrible Atchievements
which their Heroes had performed. For of this, too, we finds the Seeds or
Principles in the ſavage State. 
<q rend="inline">"After a Chief of War hath recounted the Battles he
had fought, they who are preſent will often riſe up to dance, and
repreſent thoſe Actions with great Vivacity."</q> If to this we add the
uſual Exclamations of the ſurrounding Choir, we here behold the firſt
<hi>rude Form of ſavage Tragedy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="21">21. If the <hi>Choir</hi> ſhould be
<hi>eſtabliſhed</hi> by general Uſe, and ſhould animate the Solemnity
by <hi>Dance</hi> as well as <hi>Song</hi>; the <hi>Melody, Dance,</hi> and
<hi>Song</hi> would of courſe <hi>regulate</hi> each other, and the
<hi>Ode</hi> or <hi>Song</hi> would fall into <hi>Stanzas</hi> of ſome
<hi>particular Kind.</hi> This appears from the third Article.</p>
            <p n="22">22. Another Conſequence of an <hi>eſtabliſhed
Choir</hi> would be an unvaried Adherence to the <hi>Unities</hi> of
<hi>Place</hi> and <hi>Time.</hi> For a numerous Choir, maintaining their
Station through the whole Performance, muſt give ſo forcible a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction
to the Senſes, of the <hi>Sameneſs</hi> of <hi>Place,</hi> and
<hi>Short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> of <hi>Time,</hi> that any Deviation from this apparent
Unity muſt ſhock the Imagination with an Improbability too groſs to be
endured.</p>
            <p n="23">23. Not only the Part of the tragic <hi>Choir,</hi> but the
<hi>Epiſode</hi> or <hi>interlocutory</hi> Part would be alſo
<hi>ſung.</hi> For as the <hi>Ode</hi> and <hi>Epic</hi> would be
<hi>ſung</hi> from the earlieſt Periods; ſo when they became
<hi>united,</hi> and by that Union formed the <pb n="43" facs="tcp:0964200100:42"/> tragic
Species, they of Courſe maintained the ſame Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendage of <hi>Melody,</hi>
which Nature and Cuſtom had already given them.</p>
            <p n="24">24. While the Nation held its <hi>fierce</hi> and
<hi>warlike</hi> Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, the <hi>tragic</hi> Repreſentations would
chiefly turn on Subjects <hi>diſtreſsful</hi> or <hi>terrible.</hi> For
thus they would ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate each other to <hi>Victory</hi> and <hi>Revenge,</hi>
by a Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of what their <hi>Friends</hi> had <hi>done</hi> and
<hi>ſuffered.</hi> Theſe Subjects would likewiſe be moſt accommodated
to the natural Taſte of the poetic Chiefs of ſuch a People; whoſe
Atchievements muſt produce and abound with Events of Diſtreſs and Terror.
They alſo would be beſt ſuited to the Genius and Ends of their State and
Polity: For as the leading View of ſuch a fierce and warlike People muſt be
to deſtroy Pity and Fear; ſo this would moſt effectually be done, by
making themſelves familiar with diſtreſsful and terrible
Repreſentations. The gentle Paſſions, and leſs affecting Actions, which
might fill the Spectacles of a mild and peaceful Nation, would be inſipid to
the Taſte, and incompatible with the Character, of ſuch a warlike
People.</p>
            <p n="25">25. As their Tragedy would be intended as a <hi>viſible
Repreſentation</hi> of their ancient Gods and Heroes, ſo it would be
natural for them to invent ſome Means of <hi>ſtrengthening</hi> the
<hi>Voice,</hi> and <hi>aggrandiſing</hi> the <hi>Viſage</hi> and
<hi>Perſon,</hi> as the means of compleating the Reſemblance: For in all
Savage Countries, the <hi>talleſt</hi> and <hi>ſtrongeſt</hi> Men are
generally ſelected as their <hi>Chiefs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="26">26. As their Tragic <hi>Poets</hi> would be <hi>Singers,</hi>
ſo they would be <hi>Actors,</hi> and perform ſome capital Part in their
own Pieces for the Stage. For we ſee theſe different Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters are
naturally united in the ſavage State: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <pb n="44" facs="tcp:0964200100:43"/> till
ſome extraordinary Change in Manners and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples ſhould enſue, this
<hi>Union</hi> would of Courſe continue.</p>
            <p n="27">27. <hi>Muſical Conteſts</hi> would be admitted as
<hi>public Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes</hi> in ſuch a State. For we have ſeen, that the
impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Articles of Religion, Morals, and Polity, would natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally make a
Part of their public Songs: therefore public Conteſts of this Kind would be
regarded as the beſt and ſureſt Means of raiſing an Emulation of a
moſt uſeful Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and of ſtrengthening the State, by inforcing all the
fundamental Principles of Society in the moſt ſtriking and effectual
Manner.</p>
            <p n="28">28. The Profeſſion of <hi>Bard</hi> or
<hi>Muſician</hi> would be held as very honourable, and of high Eſteem. For
he would be veſted with a Kind of <hi>public Character:</hi> and if not an
original Legiſlator, yet ſtill he would be regarded as a
<hi>ſubordinate</hi> and <hi>uſeful Servant</hi> of the <hi>State.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="29">29. <hi>Odes,</hi> or <hi>Hymns,</hi> would naturally make a
Part of their <hi>domeſtic Entertainments:</hi> and the <hi>Chiefs</hi> would
be proud to ſignalize themſelves by their Skill in <hi>Melody</hi> and
<hi>Song.</hi> For their Songs being enriched with all the great and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
Subjects relative to the public State; nothing could be more ſuitable to a
high Station in the Commonwealth, than a Proficiency in this ſublime and
legiſlative Art.</p>
            <p n="30">30. When <hi>Muſic</hi> had attained to this State of
relative Perfection, it would be regarded as a <hi>neceſſary
Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment.</hi> And if any Man, or Society of Men, were unacquainted
with the Practice and Power of Muſic, their Ignorance in this Art would be
regarded as a capital De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect: For it would imply a Deficiency in the three
great leading Articles of Education, <hi>Religion, Morals,</hi> and
<hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="31">
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:0964200100:44"/>31. The Genius of their <hi>Muſic</hi>
would <hi>vary</hi> along with their <hi>Manners:</hi> For Manners being the
leading and moſt eſſential Quality of Man; All his other Taſtes and
Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirements naturally correſpond with <hi>Theſe</hi>; and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate
themſelves to his Manners, as to their chief and original Cauſe.</p>
            <p n="32">32. As a Change of Manners muſt influence their Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic,
ſo, by a reciprocal Action, a Change in their Muſic muſt influence
Manners: For we have ſeen, that Muſic was the <hi>eſtabliſhed
Vehicle</hi> of all the great Principles of Education: Therefore a Change in
Muſic muſt tend to bring on a Change in <hi>Theſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="33">33. A Provident Community of Principles, uncommonly ſevere,
would probably fix both the Subjects and Move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Song and Dance, by Law:
This would ariſe from their Knowledge of the mutual Influence of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and
Muſic on each other.</p>
            <p n="34">34. In a Society of more libertine and relaxed Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
the Corruption of Muſic would naturally ariſe, along with the Corruption of
Manners; for the Reaſons now aſſigned: and the Muſicians, Bards, or
Poets, would be the immediate Inſtruments of this Corruption. For being
educated in a corrupt State they would be apt to debaſe their Art to vile and
immoral Purpoſes, as the means of gaining that Applauſe which would be the
natural Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of their Ambition.</p>
            <p n="35">35. In Conſequence of this Corruption, a gradual and total
<hi>Separation</hi> of the <hi>Bard's</hi> or <hi>Muſician's</hi> complex
Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter would enſue. For the <hi>Chief</hi> would now no longer pride
himſelf on the Character of <hi>Poet</hi> or Performer; nor the <hi>Man</hi>
of <hi>Genius</hi> and <hi>Worth</hi> deſcend to the Profeſſion 
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0964200100:45" rendition="simple:additions"/> of <hi>Lyriſt, Singer,</hi> or <hi>Actor:</hi>
Becauſe theſe Profeſſions, which had formerly been the Means of
inculcating every thing laudable and great, would now (when perverted to the
contrary Purpoſes) be diſdained by the Wiſe and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous.</p>
            <p n="36">36. Hence the Power, the Utility and Dignity of
<hi>Muſic</hi> would ſink into a general Corruption and Contempt. This
Conſequence is ſo plain, as to need no Illuſtration.</p>

ariſe in ancient GREECE. In the Courſe of this Review, which will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the Riſe, Progreſs, Power, Perfection, Separation, and Corruption, of their
<hi>Melody, Dance,</hi> and <hi>Song,</hi> we may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps be fortunate enough,
on the Principles here given, to fix ſome Things which have been held
doubtful, to unfold others which have hitherto been confeſſedly
unaccountable, and to reſolve others into their proper and evident Cauſes,
which have been attributed to ſuch Cauſes as never had Exiſtence.</p>
            <p n="1">1. "Their Idea of <hi>Muſic,</hi> in its moſt inlarged
Senſe, comprehended the three Circumſtances of <hi>Melody, Dance,</hi> and
<hi>Song.</hi>"—This appears from the concurrent Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony 
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0964200100:46"/> of many ancient Authors: The following one from the
<hi>Alcibiades</hi> of PLATO may alone be a ſufficient Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. 
<q rend="inline">"<hi>Socr.</hi> Tell me firſt, what Art is that,

from the circumſtantial Account which ATHENAEUS gives of the old ARCADIAN
<hi>Muſic</hi>; which, in its general Acceptation, included <hi>Melody,
Dance,</hi> and <hi>Song</hi>

               </note>. It appears,
then, that this Combination or Union of theſe three <hi>Siſter-Graces</hi>
aroſe naturally in ancient GREECE, from an Improvement of the
<hi>ſavage</hi> State into a certain Degree of <hi>Civilization.</hi> They
needed no <hi>Art</hi> to joyn them: For as they <hi>naturally</hi> produce
each other, and are naturally conjoyned in the ſavage and uncultivated State,
this Union would of Courſe continue, till ſome vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Change in Manners
or Principles ſhould break that Union which Nature had
eſtabliſhed.—It appears no leſs evidently from ancient Writers,
that what we call <hi>Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Muſic,</hi> that is, the Melody of
Inſtruments, unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company'd by Dance or Song, was a Thing never held in
Eſteem till the later Periods of Antiquity, in which a general Separation
took Place. This will appear more at large hereafter. PLATO calls
Inſtrumental Muſic

of their Lyres and Songs meant no more, than by a metaphorical Expreſſion

producing <hi>Order</hi> from <hi>Confuſion.</hi> Thus PLUTARCH tells us,
that 
<q rend="inline">"the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients repreſented the Statues of the Gods

that the <hi>Song</hi> and <hi>Lyre</hi> (as ſoon as the Lyre was invented)
muſt be the natural Means or Inſtruments of Civilization, by conveying the
Legiſlator's Precepts to the ſurrounding People. For we have ſeen that,

firſt Sight ſeems altogether foreign to their Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, hath not as yet
been accounted for. We now ſee the true and natural Origin of theſe
Appellations. For the moſt ancient Gods, among the civilized <hi>Greeks,</hi>
were their early Legiſlators, who taught the ſavage Tribes the firſt Arts
of Life. Theſe deceaſed Legiſlators, therefore, when ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced to the
Rank of Gods, were naturally delivered down <pb n="50" facs="tcp:0964200100:49"/> to
Poſterity, with the ſame Attributes or Qualities by which they
diſtinguiſhed themſelves in Life: and it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from a View of the
<hi>Chiefs</hi> of the ſavage Tribes, that theſe Qualities would naturally
be thoſe of <hi>Dance</hi> and <hi>Song.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. "Meaſured Periods, or, in other Words, Rythm, Numbers,
and Verſe, did naturally ariſe." The general Reaſon is aſſigned in
the fourth Article of the laſt Section; and needs not to be repeated here.
But as ſome particular Conſequences ariſe from this Foundation, relative
to the moſt ancient <hi>Hiſtory, Laws,</hi> and <hi>Oracles,</hi> theſe
will deſerve a ſeparate Conſideration.</p>
            <p n="5">5. "Their earlieſt Hiſtories were written in Verſe."
This Fact is indiſputable; but ſeems not, as yet, to have been reſolved
into its true Cauſe. STRABO informs us, that, "The Poetic Form firſt
appeared: They who imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated it, dropped the Meaſure: Such were CADMUS the
<hi>Mileſian,</hi> PHERECYDES and HECATAEUS<note n="t" place="bottom">

<hi>Greek</hi> Hiſtorians who writ in <hi>Proſe.</hi> Another learned
Ancient confirms this Account; and ſays, 
<q rend="inline">"In theſe early Times, ſo general was the
Inclination to Rythm and Numbers, that all Inſtruction was given in Verſe:
There was neither <hi>Hiſtory</hi> nor <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> nor any Action

<hi>hiſtorical Verſe</hi> to <hi>Proſe,</hi> but the Records of all
Nations unite in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming it. The oldeſt Compoſitions among the ARABS

Paſſage: 
<q rend="inline">"Meaſure belongs <hi>naturally</hi> to Poetry, as
its Province is the Deſcription and <hi>Language</hi> of the

Diſcourſe) uſed Meaſure and Verſe, rather than Proſe<note n="b" place="bottom">
                     <bibl>LONGIN. <hi>de Metr.</hi>

                  </note>."</q> It can hardly
be neceſſary to obſerve, that the celebrated Critic, in this Paſſage,
gives a mere <hi>Affirmation</hi> inſtead of an <hi>Argument.</hi> He ſays,
indeed, <pb n="52" facs="tcp:0964200100:51"/> 
               <q rend="inline">"that the Language of the Paſſions, and Fiction,

ſeek. It were to be wiſhed, that in many Parts of his Writings, he had not
given us more Inſtances of his fine Taſte, than his Power of
Reaſoning.</p>
            <p>A learned Modern of our own Nation hath try'd his Talent in this
curious Queſtion. 
<q rend="inline">"They (the Ancients) thought, it would ſeem, that
Language was the firſt Tamer of Men; and took its Origin to have been
cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain rude accidental Sounds, which that naked Company of ſcrambling

firſt they uttered theſe Sounds in a <hi>much higher Note</hi> than we do
our Words now; occaſioned, <hi>perhaps,</hi> by their falling on them under
ſome Paſſion, Fear, Wonder, or Pain; and then uſing the ſame Sound,
either when the Object or Accident re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred, or when they wanted to deſcribe
it by what they felt from its Preſence. <hi>Neither</hi> the
<hi>Syllables</hi> nor the <hi>Tone</hi> could be <hi>aſcertained:</hi> but
when prompted by the Return of the Paſſion, under which they invented them,

<q rend="inline">"Before HERODOTUS, even Hiſtory was not written

            <p>As this is the moſt plauſible Reaſon that hath as yet been
aſſigned for this myſterious Fact, it will deſerve a particular
Conſideration. The Cauſe aſſigned ſeems, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to reſt on no
probable Foundation, for the following Reaſons.</p>
            <p>Firſt, becauſe it ſeems to take for granted the Exiſtence of
the very Thing which it is ſaid to have produced. If we ſuppoſe Rythm,
Numbers, and Verſe, to exiſt and be in general Uſe, they would
undoubtedly become the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Means of Memory and Record among a barbarous
Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. But to <hi>invent</hi> the Vehicle of <hi>Rythm,</hi> from a
<hi>Foreſight</hi> 
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:0964200100:53"/> of its being the beſt Inſtrument
of Memory, without any prior Impulſe from unaſſiſted Nature, ſeems
altogether in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compatible with the general Character of the ſavage Tribes: For
in the Period of ſavage Manners, the Power of <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract
Reaſoning</hi> is always <hi>weak,</hi> and is often found to have <hi>no
Place.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again: The <hi>Univerſality</hi> of the Fact adds greatly to the
Improbability of the Cauſe aſſigned. Though we ſhould ſuppoſe it
poſſible or probable, that one ſavage Chief might by Dint of Reaſon
ſtrike out this new method of recording Hiſtory; yet that <hi>All</hi>
ſavage Chiefs, in every known Age and Climate, ſhould <hi>unite</hi> in the
<hi>ſame</hi> Contrivance, is highly improbable. If one of more exalted
Capacity de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered his Stories in Verſe, <hi>another</hi> of inferior Reach
and Invention would naturally give them to Poſterity in plain Proſe: Nay,
the acknowledged Difficulty of <hi>Verſification</hi> would naturally make
the <hi>proſaic</hi> Manner the more <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> though leſs
effectual Method of the two. Now, the contrary to this is acknowledged to be
true, even by thoſe who contend for the Truth and Sufficiency of the Cauſe
aſſigned. The <hi>Univerſality</hi> of the Fact is allowed by All. Such
an univerſal Coincidence, therefore, muſt ſpring from ſome other
Cauſe, ſuch as ariſeth unalterably from Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and takes Place among
the ſavage Tribes in an univerſal and unvaried Manner.</p>
            <p>Farther: If the ancient Songs, prior to proſe in every Nation, had
been <hi>coolly compoſed,</hi> for the Sake of <hi>Tradition</hi> and
<hi>Information only,</hi> they would have been <hi>circumſtantial</hi> and
<hi>preciſe:</hi> Whereas the contrary appears in their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction: They
are generally <hi>vague</hi> and <hi>enthuſiaſtic</hi>; and 
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0964200100:54"/> bear all the Marks of being the genuine Effects of
ſavage <hi>Paſſion</hi> and <hi>Enthuſiaſm.</hi> So far are they from
containing any regular <hi>Series</hi> of Facts, that Facts are often
<hi>hinted</hi> only; while the mere <hi>Celebration</hi> of the Heroe forms
the chief Weight and <hi>Burthen</hi> of the <hi>Song.</hi>

            <p>Laſtly, the univerſal Connexion of the <hi>old Poetry</hi> with
<hi>Melody,</hi> and the unvary'd Cuſtom of <hi>ſinging it,</hi> amounts to
the ſtrongeſt Proof, that the mere End of <hi>Memory</hi> and
<hi>Tradition</hi> could not be its original Cauſe. For had the ſole
Intention of the Song been that of <hi>Record only,</hi> a <hi>mere
Recitation</hi> of the Verſes would have anſwered the ſame Purpoſe. And
we may affirm it to be a <hi>moral Impoſſibility</hi> that an univerſal
Union of Verſe and Melody could have taken Place on this Foundation.</p>
            <p>Since, therefore, the Cauſe hitherto aſſigned ſeems
alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether inadequate to the Effect; can we reaſonably enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a Doubt,
in reſolving it into that Principle which we have already found univerſally
predominant in ſavage Life? I mean, the natural Paſſion for
<hi>Melody</hi> and <hi>Dance,</hi> which neceſſarily throws the
accompanying <hi>Song</hi> into a <hi>correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Rythm.</hi> Hence, the
Uſe of Rythm and Verſe muſt naturally ariſe in GREECE (as in every
other Country emerging from Barbarity) becauſe Melody, Dance, and Song, made
a principal Employment of their ſavage State. And hence, their earlieſt
Hiſtories muſt of courſe be writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in Verſe; becauſe the Actions of
their Gods and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roes made a principal Part of their Songs; and therefore,
when the Uſe of Letters came among them, theſe ancient Songs were naturally
<hi>firſt</hi> recorded, that is, they became <pb n="56" facs="tcp:0964200100:55"/> their
earlieſt <hi>Hiſtories,</hi> for the Information and Uſe of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
Times.</p>
            <p>As this Cauſe, when viewed in itſelf, ſeems amply and clearly
to account for the Effect, ſo it will receive farther Confirmation, if we
conſider how naturally it removes all thoſe Objections which load the
Opinion here controvert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. For it neither requires nor ſuppoſeth any Power
of <hi>abſtract Reaſoning</hi> among the <hi>ſavage</hi> Tribes, but is
the mere Effect of <hi>Paſſion</hi> and uncultivated Nature. Its
Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſality, therefore, becomes highly probable; becauſe the Principles
of ſavage Nature (making Allowance for the Difference of Soil and Climate)
are every where the ſame. The <hi>Genius</hi> of the ancient Songs of every
Nation adds new Degrees of Evidence: For they are generally irregular and
enthuſiaſtic; and therefore the genuine Productions of <hi>unlettered
Enthuſiaſm.</hi> Laſtly, their univerſal Connexion with
<hi>Melody,</hi> and the unvary'd Practice of <hi>ſinging</hi> them, comes up
to a full and direct Proof, of the Reality of the Cauſe now aſſigned.</p>
            <p>It muſt not be diſguiſed, that the moſt learned VOSSIUS was
ſo ſtruck with the Difficulty of accounting for this Appearance, that he
thinks it beſt to deny the Fact.

were of Courſe the <hi>firſt</hi> things <hi>written</hi> or
<hi>recorded.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>With reſpect to the Inſtance alledged by the learned Critic, of
the Writings of MOSES, and the Practice of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient EGYPT, this, when properly
explained, will confirm the Truth of the Cauſe here given. MOSES, we know,
was learned in all the Wiſdom of the <hi>Egyptians:</hi> EGYPT was, in his
Time, become a <hi>poliſhed Nation</hi>; and therefore, according to the
natural Courſe of Things (as will appear below) <hi>Proſe</hi> had been
introduced before the Time of MOSES, as it was afterwards in GREECE by
HECATAEUS and others. As to the intermixed Songs in the Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of MOSES, it
is now a Point agreed among the Learned, that they are written in
<hi>Meaſure</hi>; and correſpond in all Reſpects with the Principle here
delivered. And that <hi>Song</hi> was the oldeſt Form of Compoſition in
EGYPT, we learn clearly from two ancient Writers: The Firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms us, that

The natural Cauſe of this Fact hath been aſſigned in the Article which
correſponds with this. The ancients knew <pb n="60" facs="tcp:0964200100:59" rendition="simple:additions"/> and
confeſſed the Fact, but were ſo entirely ignorant of the true Cauſe,
that they <hi>laboured</hi> more in this Point, than even in accounting for the
Riſe of <hi>poetic Hiſtory</hi> and <hi>Laws.</hi> This will appear from
PLUTARCH, who hath written a Diſcourſe on the following Queſtion, 
<q rend="inline">"Why the PYTHIA no longer gives her Oracles in
Verſe?"</q> Now, before he aſſigned the Cauſes why this Practice of
<hi>Oracular Verſe</hi> had <hi>ceaſed,</hi> it was natural that he
ſhould inquire how it firſt <hi>began:</hi> And the Cauſes (if ſuch
they may be called) which he aſſigns, are theſe.</p>
            <p>Firſt, 
<q rend="inline">"The ancient Times produced a Race of Men, who had
naturally, and from <hi>bodily Temperament,</hi> a ſtronger Turn for
Poetry."</q> Secondly, 
<q rend="inline">"There was a Time, when, inſtead of the Art of
Writing, Men uſed Metre, Verſe, or Songs; adapting Hiſtory, and other the
weightieſt Subjects, to Poetry and Muſic." "Thus they celebrated the Gods;
and told their Fables in Verſe, ſome through the Force of <hi>Genius,</hi>
and others by the Power of <hi>Cuſtom.</hi>" "Therefore the God permitted the
Application of Verſe and Song to his Oracles, and would not drive the Muſes
from his Tripod."</q> Thirdly, 
<q rend="inline">"The Utility of Poetry is in nothing more
conſpicuous, than in its Aſſiſtance to the <hi>Memory,</hi> by the
Means of Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. The Ancients had great Need of This, beyond the Moderns,
becauſe the Oracles referred to Perſons, Things, and Places, which were

thoſe Intervals and Progreſſions of Sound which are agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the

            <p>As to the <hi>Enharmonic</hi> Kind, it is confeſſedly

notorious, and ſtrikes ſo ſtrongly on the Senſes, that the Bigots to

which, although an <hi>Italian</hi> CAS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TRATO (who hath laboured at this

            <p>The <hi>Chromatic</hi> ſeems, at firſt View, to be more

and introduced the <hi>Refinements</hi> of the <hi>Chromatic.</hi> Now this is
an abſolute Contradiction to All that we underſtand concerning the Nature
of theſe two Kinds. For, as the <hi>Diatonic,</hi> which proceeds by whole 
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0964200100:66"/> Tones, is more ſimple than the <hi>Chromatic,</hi> which
proceeds by <hi>Half-Tones</hi>; ſo This, in its Turn, is more ſimple than
the <hi>Enharmonic,</hi> which is ſaid to have proceeded by
<hi>Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-Tones:</hi> All which is in direct Contradiction to the Tenor of
the <hi>Spartan</hi> Decree.</p>
            <p>Secondly, with Regard to the various <hi>Modes</hi> of ancient
Melody, we are often as much in the dark. We read of no leſs than fifteen,
introduced at different Periods; but the Commentators on the ancient Writers
upon this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, are at Variance with each other, concerning the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and
Uſe of theſe different Modes. Some are of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that the Difference lay
in the Degree of <hi>Gravity</hi> or <hi>Acuteneſs</hi> only: Others
maintain, that the Mode ſignified the <hi>Rythm,</hi> or <hi>Meaſure:</hi>
Others again, that the Eſſence of the <hi>Mode</hi> conſiſted in a
<hi>different Species</hi> of <hi>Diapaſon.</hi> There is Reaſon to
believe, that the Word was uſed at va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Times, and by different Writers,
in all theſe Senſes, and that each of theſe Authors may be right in his
Turn. From the Deſcription of an Inſtrument given by ATHE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NAEUS it appears,
that by <hi>Mode</hi> was ſometimes meant <hi>Gravity</hi> or
<hi>Acuteneſs</hi> of Sound: For he tells us, that the Muſician had three
Lyres placed on a moveable Tripod which turned on an Axis; and that by whirling
it round with his Foot, he could inſtantly play in three various Modes<note n="u" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>L. xiv.</bibl>
               </note>. That <hi>Mode</hi> was ſometimes
uſed for <hi>Meaſure,</hi> ſeems evident, becauſe in a Fragment of an
ancient Author cited by ATHENAEUS, we read that a <hi>Hymn</hi> was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in
the <hi>Lydian Mode</hi>
               <note n="w" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>Ibid.</bibl>
               </note>;
which can only mean, the <hi>Phrygian</hi> or <hi>Dorian Meaſure.</hi> And as
<hi>Mode</hi> was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to Numbers, ſo was it likewiſe to
<hi>Dance:</hi> The <hi>Ionici Motus,</hi> which ancient Writers ſpeak of,
are a clear <pb n="66" facs="tcp:0964200100:67"/> Proof of This. That <hi>Mode</hi> was uſed
in the third of theſe Acceptations, as a particular <hi>Species</hi> of
<hi>Diapaſon,</hi> hath been made clear by a late Writer, in a judicious and
accurate Treatiſe<note n="x" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>By Sir FR. EYLES
STILES.</bibl>
               </note>. Thus by the promiſcuous Uſe of the Word Mode,
ſignifying either <hi>Pitch, Meaſure,</hi> or <hi>Species</hi> of
<hi>Diapaſon,</hi> it hath come to paſs, that ſome times the
Signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the Word is <hi>clear,</hi> at others it is only
<hi>probable,</hi> often it is <hi>obſcure</hi> and <hi>doubtful.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, to complete our Ignorance of the particular Nature of their
Melody, the Conſtruction of their Muſical Inſtruments is unknown. We only
know, that the Chords of the Lyre were augmented gradually from <hi>four</hi>
to <hi>forty:</hi> but whether the Strings aſcended by Quarter-Notes,
Half-Notes, whole Notes, or by larger Intervals, of all this we know nothing
certain. Our Ignorance of their Pipes or Flutes is not leſs remarkable.
Commentators and Critics ring Changes on their ſingle, double, oblique,
right-handed, and left-handed Flutes; but what was their preciſe Make, Tone,
Compaſs, or Powers, theſe Gentlemen cannot, with any Certainty, inform us.
The learned ISAAC VOSSIUS is one of the warmeſt Champions for the Excellence
of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Inſtruments: but whoever reads him without Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality, will find
all his Endeavours amount to no more than what is here affirmed<note n="y" place="bottom">

            <p>Since, therefore, the particular Nature and Conſtruction of the
ancient Melody is utterly unknown to us; we muſt have Recourſe to
collateral Proofs, drawn from Facts which were connected with this unknown
Melody; and from Theſe we may, I think, indirectly arrive ſo far at a
Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of its <hi>general</hi> Character, as to conclude with Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, 
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:0964200100:68"/> that in the <hi>early</hi> Periods (in which

of the <hi>Melody</hi> was that of <hi>Simplicity</hi>; and that it derived a

            </p>
            <p>Simplicity was its ruling Character; becauſe we find that

<hi>Muſic,</hi> which we read of in ancient GREECE, aroſe within this

either of a great Variety, or a multifarious Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination of Sounds; a ſtrong
Probability ariſeth from its very Nature, that <hi>Counterpoint,</hi> or an
artificial Compoſition in <hi>various Parts,</hi> was altogether unknown. It
appears to me (from many Paſſages of ancient Authors compared together, but
too long to inſert here) that the Ancients ſung and played firſt in
Uniſons, Octaves, and Fifteenths; then in Thirds and Tenths; and in the later
Periods in Fourths and Fifths, as appears from PLUTARCH; though in ARISTOTLE's
Time, it is evident, theſe laſt were not <pb n="66" facs="tcp:0964200100:69"/>

practiſed. It is likewiſe evident, that in the later Periods, the
<hi>inſtrumental Accompanyment</hi> was different from the <hi>Song</hi>; yet
this only in the Way of <hi>Diviſion</hi> upon the <hi>fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental
Notes.</hi> Farther than theſe Methods of <hi>redoubling</hi> or
<hi>dividing</hi> the ſame Melody, I find nothing like Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition in
<hi>various Parts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Oh the contrary, there are many Reaſons which may convince us,
that nothing like the modern <hi>Counterpoint</hi> was known to the Ancients.
The Silence of all their Muſical Writers collected by MEIBOMIUS, on this
great Article, is a Proof ſufficient that they were ignorant of it. Their
Diviſions of the muſical Art are preciſe and ſyſtema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical; and
therefore, if this had made a Part of it, as its Rules muſt have been more
complex than thoſe of any other Branch, beyond all Doubt, they would have
been diſtinctly treated of.</p>
            <p>The ſame Conſequence ſeems clearly to ariſe from a
Paſſage in ARISTOTLE, who ſays, that 
<q rend="inline">"it is much eaſier to keep the <hi>Time</hi> in
Muſic, when a Number ſing toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, than when a ſingle Voice only
ſings<note n="d" place="bottom">

of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other; but in direct Contradiction to the Truth, if we ſuppoſe them
to ſing in Counterpoint; becauſe, here, the various Parts have a Tendency
to confound each other.</p>
            <p>Their Ignorance of Counterpoint appears farther from hence, that no
Difference is remarked between the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions for the <hi>Flute</hi> and
thoſe for the <hi>Lyre,</hi> with Reſpect to the <hi>Multiplicity</hi> of
<hi>Parts.</hi> One Inſtrument they uſed, which had two Strings to every
Note, and theſe two were tuned in <hi>thirds</hi> to each other: This
Inſtrument was called <pb n="69" facs="tcp:0964200100:72"/> the <hi>Magadis</hi>; and even
this diſtant Approach towards playing in Counterpoint was regarded as a Thing
ſo ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular, that to play in <hi>thirds</hi> was called

Performance had been uſed more complex than this, it muſt have been noted
as a Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance ſtill more ſingular.</p>
            <p>It appears farther, that in HOMER's Hymn to MER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CURY, the Poet
repreſents APOLLO as holding his Lyre in one Hand, and playing with a
<hi>Plectrum</hi> with the other. In an ancient Sculpture which repreſents
the Deification of HOMER, ſome of the Figures which dance, are at the ſame
Time playing on the Lyre, which they hold with one Hand, and ſtrike with the
other. Thus too, when SOPHOCLES played on the Lyre, and at the ſame Time led
the Dance<note n="e" place="bottom">

were in Uſe in the Time of VIRGIL.—'Tis certain, that on the firſt
rude Formation of Inſtruments, the <hi>Plectrum</hi> would give the more
clear and effectual Stroke: As Inſtruments grew more more delicate, the
<hi>Finger</hi> would come into Uſe. This (as will appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, Art. 33.)
explains the Foundation of the <hi>Spartan</hi> Conduct.</note>. Now, all
theſe Circumſtances center in the Proof of this, that the Melody which they
played was <hi>ſingle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We may farther obſerve, that their muſical <hi>Notation</hi>
(ſo far as it is ſuppoſed to be underſtood) generally implies a 
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:0964200100:73"/> ſingle, and that a very inartificial Species of
Compoſition. Nay, the Letters which compoſed their muſical Notation
ſeem very inadequately to expreſs even a <hi>ſingle</hi> Part, did not
the <hi>Meaſure</hi> of the <hi>Verſe</hi> in ſome Degree fix that of the
<hi>Melody.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Add to all theſe Arguments this farther Confirmation, that their
Poets (who were generally at the ſame Time Warriours, Prieſts, or
Stateſmen) not only compoſed the Melody to their own Verſes, but, in the
early Periods, played and ſung them at their Feſtivals: And that People of
all Ages and Degrees were commonly able to bear a Part in the Chorus, both in
public and private Entertainments. All theſe concurrent Circumſtances
center in one ſufficient and ſatisfactory Proof, that their Melody was not
only <hi>ſingle,</hi> but of the moſt <hi>ſimple Conſtruction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One Kind of <hi>Addition</hi> did undoubtedly in many Inſtances
take Place: I mean that of the <hi>Tympanum,</hi> the <hi>Siſtrum,</hi> or
the <hi>Cymbal</hi> added as an unvaried <hi>Groundwork,</hi> and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated
to the Meaſure of the <hi>ruling Melody:</hi> But this was no more than the
modern <hi>Drum</hi> added to the <hi>Fife</hi> or <hi>Trumpet,</hi> the
<hi>Tabor</hi> to the <hi>Pipe,</hi> or the <hi>Drone</hi> to the
<hi>Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pipe:</hi> A Kind of Addition which we find in the Muſic of almoſt
every barbarous Country.</p>
            <p>Since therefore it appears, that the Force of the ancient
<hi>Greek</hi> Melody conſiſted neither in its <hi>Compaſs,</hi> its
<hi>Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolicity</hi> of <hi>Parts,</hi> nor its <hi>artificial</hi>
Conſtruction; let us now proceed to conſider the only Circumſtance from
which its chief Power could ariſe, I mean, its <hi>Rythm</hi> or
<hi>Meaſure.</hi> That this was its real Source, may be evident from the
following Conſiderations.</p>
            <p>Firſt, The <hi>Greek</hi> Language was admirably fitted for a
various and powerful <hi>Rythm</hi> or <hi>Meaſure,</hi> by its Variety of 
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:0964200100:74"/> 
               <hi>Feet</hi>; which, when thrown into all their different
Combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, formed ſuch a Variety of <hi>Numbers,</hi> as gave Room for an
equal and correſpondent Variety of <hi>Meaſure</hi> in the annexed
<hi>Melody,</hi> beyond any other Language in the known World. When, therefore,
ſuch a Language offered itſelf as an Aſſiſtant to the Muſician's
Art, it was altogether natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral that he ſhould accommodate his Melody to the
peculiar and happy Genius of his Native Tongue.</p>
            <p>Secondly, ſuch a Melody as this, marked by ſtrong Changes and
Varieties of Meaſure, muſt have greater Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects than the moſt
extenſive or moſt artificial Melody when unaſſiſted by it. This
argument is well purſued by the learned ISAAC VOSSIUS: I ſhall therefore
give it in his own Words; the rather, becauſe it is the moſt judicious and
philoſophic Paſſage in his whole Work; and contains as it were the
<hi>Kernel</hi> of a large Tract; a conſiderable Part of which, it muſt be
owned, may juſtly be thrown aſide as <hi>Huſk</hi> and
<hi>Shell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p> 
               <q rend="inline">"Wherefore, I cannot enough wonder at thoſe who in
the preſent and paſt Age have written on Muſic; that while they
diligently explained other Things, they ſhould either have ſaid nothing on
<hi>Rythm,</hi> or elſe written in ſuch a Manner, as to prove themſelves
ignorant of its Nature. They confine themſelves entirely to
<hi>Counter-point,</hi> neglecting that which is principal in Melody.—For certainly, as neither an <hi>Unit</hi> can produce <hi>Number,</hi> nor a
<hi>ſingle Word</hi> make <hi>Senſe</hi>; ſo neither can any <hi>ſingle
Sound,</hi> ſeparately conſidered, have any <hi>Power:</hi> Or if it hath,
it muſt be very inconſiderable. For what Effect in moving the Paſſions
can ariſe from the Colliſion of Stones or Wood, or even from the ſtriking
of one String, <pb n="72" facs="tcp:0964200100:75"/> if <hi>Numbers</hi> and <hi>Rythm</hi> be
wanting, and we hear nothing but a mere Sound<note n="g" place="bottom">The
learned Writer is miſtaken in this Paragraph. The mere Sound of
<hi>Thunder</hi> excites <hi>Fear</hi>; other Sounds excite <hi>Sorrow</hi>;
others <hi>Joy.</hi> See the next Article.</note>? Or if we compound various
Sounds, and theſe be even harmonic and concordant, not even This will produce
any Effect. Such an Harmony of Sounds may pleaſe the Ear; but the Pleaſure
will only be ſuch, as if Words were (agreeably) ſpoken, which are either
unmeaning or not underſtood. That the Soul may be affected, it is
neceſſary that the Sound ſhould imply, or bring before us, ſomething
which we can comprehend. That Sounds, therefore, may have their full Effect,
the Melody muſt be animated by ſuch Move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as contain in themſelves
the <hi>Repreſentations</hi> or <hi>Images</hi> of thoſe Things which we
mean to <hi>expreſs</hi> or <hi>imitate</hi> by Song: And This if we can do,
we may be ſure to command the Paſſions of the Soul. But that we may
indeed catch and call forth theſe <hi>Images,</hi> we muſt employ that
Variety of Muſical <hi>Feet,</hi> in which are ſo fully contained all the
ſeveral Kinds of Movements, that no Affection can be conceived, which they do
not moſt exactly expreſs. For the Expreſſion of light and voluble
Motions, as of the Dances of <hi>Satyrs,</hi> the <hi>Pyrrichius</hi> and
<hi>Tribrachys</hi> are proper: The <hi>grave</hi> and <hi>ſlow</hi> are
expreſſed by the <hi>Spondee</hi> and <hi>Moloſſus:</hi> Whatever is
<hi>ſoft</hi> and <hi>tender,</hi> the <hi>Trochee,</hi> and ſometimes the
<hi>Amphibrachys</hi> will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe, which itſelf moves with a broken and
effeminate Pace. The <hi>Iambic</hi> is fierce and <hi>vehement</hi>; and the
<hi>Anapaeſt</hi> nearly of the ſame Nature, as it imitates violent and
warlike Motions. If we mean to expreſs what is <hi>chearful</hi> and
<hi>joyous,</hi> we muſt employ the <hi>Dactyl,</hi> whoſe 
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:0964200100:76"/> Movements are of a correſpondent Nature. Whatever is
<hi>hard</hi> and <hi>rugged,</hi> the <hi>Antiſpaſt</hi> will happily
deſcribe. If we require Numbers that may expreſs <hi>Fury</hi> and
<hi>Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> not only the <hi>Anapaeſt</hi> is at Hand, but, what is
ſtill more powerful, the <hi>Paeon quartus.</hi>—Of theſe various
Meaſures, artificially combined, did the ancient <hi>Greek</hi> and
<hi>Roman</hi> Muſic conſiſt: And while this flouriſhed, ſo long did
Muſic maintain its Empire over the Paſſions<note n="h" place="bottom">

72.</bibl>
                  </note>".</q> Thus the learned VOSSIUS: Whoſe Admiration of the
Rythm of the ancient Melody leads him into ſome falſe Concluſions, as
will appear below. In the mean Time, this general Exhibition of the Genius of
the Greek <hi>Numbers</hi> may ſtand as a farther accumulative Proof, that
the Power of the ancient <hi>Melody,</hi> which was univerſally accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated
to this <hi>Variety</hi> of <hi>expreſſive Numbers,</hi> lay chiefly in its
<hi>Rythm</hi> or <hi>Meaſure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly, theſe Arguments are much confirmed by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
Teſtimony of PLUTARCH; who, ſpeaking of the Variations which the Genius of
ancient Muſic had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone in the Progreſs of Time, ſays, 
<q rend="inline">"If we compare An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity with the preſent Times,

he regards as one of the Corruptions of Melody; he gives an Account of the

by the Power of <hi>early Aſſociation</hi> and <hi>continued Habit.</hi>
For This, by appropriating certain Sounds to certain Subjects, raiſed their
Melody into a Kind of natural and expreſſive Language of the
Paſſions."—In the firſt rude Eſſays towards an expreſſive
Melody in bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous Countries, certain imperfect Modes of Sound muſt of
Courſe be applied, as being expreſſive of certain Subjects, or
Paſſions. The ſucceeding Generation will be naturally bred up to a like
Application of the ſame Sounds. Hence theſe Modes of Melody, though
<hi>imperfect</hi> in Expreſſion, being impreſſed on <hi>infant
Minds</hi> with all the Force of an early Application, muſt acquire a Power
over <hi>Theſe,</hi> which unaccuſtomed Minds can never feel. Thus certain
Sounds being appropriated by Uſe, and having become the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Indications
of Grief, Terror, Joy, Pity, Rage, or any other Paſſion, will naturally
excite their reſpective Affections among thoſe who have adopted them; while
a Hearer from another Country, whoſe Aſſociations and Habits are
different, will be <hi>little,</hi> or, if at all, perhaps very 
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:0964200100:78"/> 
               <hi>differently</hi> affected by them. LAFITAU's Account
of the Muſic of the <hi>Iroquois</hi> is a clear Confirmation of this Truth: 
<q rend="inline">"The Muſic and Dance of the Americans have
ſomething in them extremely <hi>barbarous,</hi> which at firſt
<hi>diſguſts:</hi> We grow <hi>reconciled</hi> to them <hi>by Degrees,</hi>
and in the <hi>End</hi> partake of them with <hi>Pleaſure.</hi> As to the
Savages themſelves, they are <hi>fond</hi> of them even to
<hi>Diſtraction</hi>

                     <bibl>See above, Sect.

                  </note>."</q> What we are told of the <hi>Swiſs</hi> Song gives
additional Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation to this Principle. This Song, which to foreign Ears is
uncouth and barbarous, hath ſuch an Effect on the Natives of SWITZERLAND,
among whom it is generally taught and impreſſed on the infant Mind, that it
is forbid to be ſung among their Regiments hired in the Service of other
Nations, leſt it ſhould tempt them to deſert, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to their own
Country. The <hi>Jews, Chineſe, Germans, French, Italians,</hi> have all
ſome peculiar Appropriations of a ſimilar Nature, which gives their native
Muſic a general Power, which no other Muſic can ever obtain. Among
ourſelves, the Sound of <hi>Bells, Drums, Organs, Trumpets,</hi> have all an
Appropriation of the ſame Nature: And a Highlander has the ſame
<hi>warlike</hi> Ideas annexed to the Sound of a <hi>Bagpipe</hi> (an
Inſtrument which an <hi>Engliſhman</hi> derides) as the
<hi>Engliſhman</hi> has to that of a <hi>Trumpet</hi> or a <hi>Fife.</hi>
MELODY therefore is to be conſidered as a <hi>relative</hi> thing, founded in
the particular Aſſociations and Habits of each People; and by Cuſtom
(like Language) annexed to their Sentiments and Paſſions: Thus it becomes
the natural Vehicle of theſe Sentiments and Paſſions; but a Vehicle,
which can never extend farther than to Thoſe, upon whom ſuch particular
Impreſſions have been made. This, added to the Power of <hi>Rythm,</hi>
affords a natural Solution to the <pb n="76" facs="tcp:0964200100:79"/> Difficulties raiſed
concerning the Power of the <hi>Greek</hi> Melody: For as it was taught and
impreſſed on the infant Mind by early and continued Application (as will
imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately appear) ſo it naturally acquired the Power of a
<hi>Language</hi> of the <hi>Paſſions,</hi> which with Reſpect to other
Nations, if it now exiſted, it would not poſſeſs.</p>
            <p>There is a collateral Argument often urged in Favour of the
artificial Excellence of the ancient <hi>Greek Melody</hi>; and drawn from what
we know of the Elegance and Perfection of ancient <hi>Greek Sculpture.</hi> But
the Weakneſs of this Argument will appear from the Principles here given; the
Effects of the two Arts being by no means <hi>parallel,</hi> but rather
contrary to each other. The <hi>Excellence</hi> of <hi>Sculp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> is the
Effect of repeated Experience, which refers itſelf to the Works of Nature, as
to its Archetype: And the Pleaſure ariſing from the Contemplation of this
Art conſiſts in ſeeing the Perfection of the Imitation; and is the
Reſult of a fine Taſte, founded on a correct Judgment. But the
<hi>Force</hi> of <hi>Melody</hi> on the Paſſions depends not on its
artificial Conſtruction or Elegance, but ſolely on its being adapted to the
Feelings, Paſſions, and Conceptions of the Hearer, be they juſt or
falſe, poliſhed or barbarous. Hence we ſhall find, that the
<hi>Force</hi> of the two Arts will be generally in an <hi>inverſe
Proportion.</hi> For the <hi>Attention</hi> to <hi>Sculpture,</hi> being
founded on a <hi>reflex Act</hi> of the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, will always
increaſe with increaſing Taſte and Knowledge: But the <hi>Power</hi> of
<hi>Melody,</hi> being founded in <hi>Paſſion,</hi> will <hi>there</hi> be
moſt general and ſtrong, where Fear, Joy, Wonder, Terror, and
Aſtoniſhment, are moſt eaſily and moſt frequently excited: And it is
certain, theſe natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Paſſions are not ſo common in a State highly
poliſhed, as in that of Barbarity or ſimple Civilization. 'Tis granted 
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:0964200100:80"/> indeed, nay inſiſted on, that the ancient Melody grew
more artificial in the later Periods: But the ſame Authors who inform us of

and barbarous Times; that this Power continued longeſt in that Society which
continued longeſt in Barbarity, I mean the Commonwealth of SPARTA; and that
as it grew more artificial, it degenerated every where into a mere Amuſement,
and loſt its Influence on the Paſſions and the Mind.</p>

            <p>HOMER appears next in the Order of Time: And in his unrivaled Songs
we find the <hi>Religion, Polities,</hi> and <hi>Manners</hi> of ancient GREECE
diſplayed with all the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances of Truth, becauſe delivered with all
their <hi>Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections.</hi> During the early Periods of Civilization, the 
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:0964200100:82"/> 
               <hi>legiſlative</hi> Art is always of an

the People be fierce and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like (as were the Tribes of GREECE) Strength,
Courage, Agility, and Cunning, are the ruling Virtues. Hence it follows, that
the Pictures both of <hi>Gods</hi> and <hi>Men</hi> will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord to this
Principle in ſuch a Period: And hence many of the Fables of HOMER himſelf
were of a Caſt ſo different from the Spirit of <hi>improved

            <p>And here, while we acknowledge HOMER as the ſupreme Painter of

Principles of his Time; critical Juſtice de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, that we take off ſome of
thoſe falſe Colourings of Praiſe, which both Ancients and Moderns have
laviſhed on him, in Regard to the Excellence of the <hi>Morals</hi> which he
taught. HORACE, it is well known, hath ſet him above the old Philoſophers,
as a Teacher of all Virtue<note n="t" place="bottom">

               </note>.
PLUTARCH, in his Life of HOMER, hath advanced the ſame Poſitions: But
whoever will examine his Poems with an impartial Eye, will find a very
deficient Plan of Morals prevailing through them. There is not the leaſt
Veſtige or Appearance of thoſe abſtract general Principles of moral
Excellence or Blame, which take Place in the more refined <pb n="80" facs="tcp:0964200100:83"/>
Periods of ſocial and poliſhed Life: His Gods and Heroes fight and plunder,
kill and raviſh, boaſt and lye; are generous, fierce, prodigal, rapacious,
cruel, or unrelenting, without much Controul from <hi>moral Ideas</hi> within,
or from a <hi>refined legiſlative Art</hi> without.</p>
            <p>It is remarkable that PLUTARCH, after labouring in vain through many
Pages, to prove that the Principles of all the Virtues are to be found in
HOMER, is forced at length to conclude; 
<q rend="inline">"It is true, indeed, that <hi>bad</hi> Actions and
Principles are intermixed and deſcribed in the ſame Manner; which was
neceſſary, for the Introduction of the Sublime and Wonderful: But this only

that neither the <hi>good</hi> nor the <hi>bad</hi> is actually recommended by

as eaſily <hi>elect</hi> the <hi>bad,</hi> and <hi>reject</hi> the
<hi>good:</hi> That HO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MER was a compleat <hi>natural Painter</hi> of the Ways

            <p>The Inconſiſtency of a late learned Writer on this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject is
too glaring to paſs unnoticed. He juſtly criticiſeth VIRGIL, as being
ſhackled by the refined Manners of his Times, and the political Forms of his
Country. With equal Truth he diſplays the free Vein of Nature, which runs
through HOMER's Poems. 
<q rend="inline">"The natural <hi>Greek,</hi> in HOMER's Days,

painted what he ſaw, and believed, and painted truly. The Fault lay in the

Legiſlation, which had but half-civilized Mankind.</p>
            <p>Our great <hi>Tranſlator</hi> of HOMER hath often departed from

            <p>The next great <hi>legiſlative Bard</hi> whom I ſhall now
men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was PINDAR. At the Period when He flouriſhed, the Fortune and Glory
of GREECE were riſing to their Meridian: The <hi>legiſlative</hi> Arts had
now obtained a higher Degree of <hi>Perfection:</hi> And accordingly we find,
in his ſublime <hi>Songs,</hi> the fulleſt and moſt perfect Union of
ſalutary Principles, thrown out in Maxims religious, political, and moral. No
Vices or Imperfections, either of Gods or Men, are there applauded or
palliated; nor ever recited, but to be condemned: All Actions are praiſed or
cenſured, according to their Influence on the public Happineſs. The Intent
of theſe <hi>Songs,</hi> ſung by their Author at their moſt ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral and
renowned Feſtivals, was to inſpire his Countrymen with the Love of Glory
and of Virtue. To this great End, he animated them, not only by the Example and
Praiſe of the Victors in the <hi>Olympic Games</hi>; but aſcended into
paſt Times, and drew from thence the ſhining Acts of Gods and Heroes, who
had diſtinguiſhed themſelves by Valour, Arts, or Virtues.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:0964200100:86"/>And here, in Juſtice to this great Poet we
muſt obſerve, that PINDAR's Songs, conſidered in this
<hi>legiſlative</hi> View, afford an eaſy and internal Solution of a
Difficulty which hath at all Times embarraſſed his Commentators and
Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics; who have ever cenſured his ſeeming Irregularities and ſudden
Flights, from the <hi>declared Heroe</hi> of his Poem, to <hi>Gods</hi> and
<hi>deceaſed Chieftains.</hi> But on the Principle here given, it appears,
that the Heroe of the Day was but the <hi>occaſional</hi> and
<hi>incidental</hi> Subject of his Ode. The main Intent was the Praiſe of his
Country's Gods and Heroes, who had ſignalized themſelves by Actions
beneficent and great. When therefore he ſeems to <hi>wander</hi> into the
Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration of <hi>their</hi> Names, he is indeed <hi>ſeverely true</hi> to
the <hi>leading Subject</hi> of his <hi>Song.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The very Objection itſelf, as it is urged by ſome of PINDAR's
Critics, leads us to the Solution here given. A French Writer thus
expreſſeth it. 
<q rend="inline">"He is not always content with praiſing the
<hi>Country</hi> of his <hi>Heroe</hi>; he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds to celebrate the <hi>great
Men</hi> which it had <hi>produced,</hi> and then it is that he <hi>wanders

il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious Catalogue of legiſlative Bards: And their Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, though
very different in their Style and Manner, yet all unite in holding forth the
leading Principles of the Greek Religion, Polity, and Morals.</p>
            <p>ESCHYLUS, who ſtands firſt in Order of Time, partakes much of
the rude Genius of the early Periods. His Imagery and Sentiments are great; his
Style rugged and abrupt; and of a Caſt ſo totally different from that of
HOMER, that it is aſtoniſhing to hear the Critics, one after another,
affirming that HOMER was his Model<note n="a" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>See this Point
conſidered below, Art. 20.</bibl>
               </note>. His Writings preſent to us all
the Characters of a ſublime, original, and uncultivated Genius, which
ſcorned any other Tutoreſs than <hi>Nature.</hi> He was Himſelf a great
Warriours; <pb n="85" facs="tcp:0964200100:88"/> and his warlike Genius threw itſelf out, in
Subjects that were grand and terrible. Hence his Tragic Songs abound with the
moſt gloomy and tremendous Exploits of the Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian Heroes, ſtriking the
Soul with Admiration, Aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and Terror.</p>
            <p>SOPHOCLES appeared next; of a more ſedate and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered Majeſty:
He improved on ESCHYLUS both in <hi>Plan</hi> and <hi>Morals.</hi> For the
<hi>legiſlative Arts</hi> were now advancing at ATHENS with great Rapidity.
No Wonder, therefore, that the Diſciple conquered his Maſter; when he had
the improving Senſe of his Country to elevate and inlarge his Genius. But
ſtill the Gods and Heroes of GREECE were the conſtant Subject of his
Song.</p>
            <p>EURIPIDES, conſidered in the legiſlative View, was on a Level
with his Maſters with Reſpect to the Subject of his Tragedies (for theſe
were always drawn from the <hi>Grecian Gods</hi> or <hi>Heroes)</hi> but
poſſeſſed himſelf of the Advantage which the ſtill improving State
of his Country gave him. For <hi>Philoſophy</hi> was now in its Aſcendant:
The <hi>Poet</hi> was the <hi>Diſciple</hi> of an eminent <hi>Sage:</hi>
Hence the Genius of EURIPIDES carried the legiſlative Power of Song to its
laſt Perfection; and threw itſelf out, in ſuch a Variety of Maxims,
<hi>political</hi> and <hi>moral,</hi> as far outwent the Art of his
Predeceſſors.</p>
            <p>Such then, through the various Ages of ancient GREECE, was the
legiſlative Genius of their <hi>Songs</hi>; which, in their ſeveral
Periods, contained the leading Principles of their <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, Morals,</hi>
and <hi>Polity</hi>; and thus became the natural and proper Object of the

            <p>Such was the Nature of ancient <hi>Muſic</hi> when applied to
Education; and not a mere Proficiency in the <hi>playing</hi> or
<hi>ſinging</hi> Art, as it hath been generally miſunderſtood, and
ignorantly ridiculed by many Moderns. Hence it was, <pb n="87" facs="tcp:0964200100:90"/> that
their greateſt Captains and Stateſmen ſtudied Muſic, as an
eſſential Part of Education. Thus PERICLES was taught by DAMON, who was

proceeds to a particular Detail of Fables proper and improper in the Work of
Education, pointing out what ought to be admitted or rejected. In another
Dialogue, he ſpeaks again of the Remains of this Method of Inſtruction,
which were found among the wiſer Sort, even in his own Times; although in
general (as will appear below<note n="l" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>Art. 34,

               </note>) <hi>Muſic</hi> was then totally <hi>corrupted.</hi> 
               <q rend="inline">"The Parents commit their Children to the Care of
Maſters; and are more <pb n="88" facs="tcp:0964200100:91"/> ſollicitous about their
<hi>Morals,</hi> than their Proficiency in <hi>Learning,</hi> or
<hi>playing</hi> on the <hi>Lyre.</hi> As ſoon as they have attained a

<hi>Forefathers</hi> renowned for <hi>great Actions,</hi> that the Boys may be
fired with an <hi>Emulation</hi> to <hi>imitate</hi> their <hi>Virtues.</hi>
The Muſic-Maſters are above all things careful to give them Habits of
Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Temperance, and to ſee that they commit no unworthy Action. As
ſoon as they have learnt to play on the Lyre, the Maſter proceeds to
inſtruct them in the <hi>Songs</hi> of the moſt famous <hi>Poets:</hi>
Theſe they <hi>ſing</hi> to the Lyre; and the Preceptors endeavour to bring
their Boys to a Love of the Rythms and Numbers; that by this Diſcipline they
may be more <hi>mild, modeſt,</hi> and <hi>orderly</hi> in their

            </p>
            <p>Suitable to this Method of Education is PLATO's Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection in his

            </p>
            <p>In the ſame Place he aſſigns a particular Reaſon for this

which ought to be inſtilled by the Poet and Muſician, on the Principles of
a wiſe Legiſlator.</p>
            <p>As theſe Authorities are clear and deciſive, we may here
properly obviate an Error of the excellent MONTESQUIEU, ariſing from his
Miſapprehenſion of the true Nature and Extent of ancient Muſic. He, with
moſt other Writers, ſuppoſeth it to have conſiſted (according to the
modern Acceptation of the Word) in the ſingle Circumſtance of
<hi>Melody.</hi> In Conſequence of this, when he comes to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire why the
ancient <hi>Greeks</hi> applied Muſic ſo univerſally in the Education of
their Children, he ſays, 
<q rend="inline">"As they were a warlike People, and therefore in
Danger of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generating into a ſavage Ferocity of Manners, they em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
Muſic, as the beſt Means of ſoftening their Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers into a milder
Character; and this, becauſe Muſic, of all the Pleaſures of Senſe, has
the leaſt Tendency to corrupt the Soul<note n="p" place="bottom">
                     <bibl>
                        <hi>L'Eſprit des Loix,</hi> l. iv. c.
8.</bibl>
                  </note>."</q> And ſo far, indeed, is true, that the ancient Greeks
did conſider this, as one of the ſalutary Effects ariſing from the
Application of Muſic<note n="q" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>PLATO <hi>de Rep.</hi> l.
iii.</bibl>
               </note>. But we now find, that the Matter lay much deeper: That
Muſic, in its ancient Senſe, implied not only <hi>Melody</hi> but
<hi>Verſe</hi> or <hi>Song:</hi> That it was the <hi>eſtabliſhed
Vehicle</hi> of all the leading Principles of their <hi>Religion, Morals,</hi>
and <hi>Polity</hi>; and therefore was the natural and moſt important
Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Means in the Education of their Children.</p>
            <p>The learned DACIER falls into the ſame Error, with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to
the wonderful Efficacy of <hi>Muſic,</hi> in the <hi>Education</hi> of the
<hi>Arcadians,</hi> and the fatal Want of it among the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants 
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:0964200100:93"/> habitants of CYNAETHE, as the fact is recorded by
POLY<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BIUS and ATHENAEUS. 
<q rend="inline">"If (ſays the Critic) PO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LYBIUS ſpeaks thus of
<hi>Muſic,</hi> and if he accuſeth EPHORUS of having advanced a thing
unworthy of him, in ſaying that this Art was invented to deceive Mankind;
what may we not ſay of <hi>Tragedy,</hi> of which <hi>Muſic</hi> is but a
<hi>ſmall Ornament,</hi> and which as far ſurpaſſeth <hi>Muſic,</hi>

evidently ſuppoſeth that the ancient <hi>Muſic,</hi> which wrought ſuch
Wonders in the Education of the <hi>Arcadians,</hi> was no more than mere
<hi>Melody</hi> or <hi>unmeaning Sound.</hi> But the Account which both
PO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LYBIUS and ATHENAEUS give of the muſical Education of the
<hi>Arcadians,</hi> confirms all that hath been here advanced; and proves, that
it conſiſted in the Application of the united Powers of <hi>Dance,
Melody,</hi> and <hi>Song.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The moſt learned VOSSIUS proceeds on the ſame Miſtake in his
firſt Book <hi>De Natura Artium:</hi> And continues under the Influence of
this fundamental Error, through his whole Diſſertation on <hi>Muſic.</hi>
As it may ſeem unaccount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, how ſo capital a Miſtake ſhould creep
into the Writings of theſe great Authors, let me here obſerve, as an
Apology for them all, that ARISTOTLE, and ſome ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Writers, ſpeak
of <hi>Muſic</hi> as an Art <hi>diſtinct</hi> from <hi>Poetry</hi>

               </note>: It was therefore
natural enough for theſe Writers to draw their Ideas of ancient Muſic from
the great Maſter-Critic of GREECE. How it came to paſs, that ARISTOTLE
ſhould ſpeak of theſe Arts as <hi>two,</hi> which the elder Writers
conſidered as <hi>one,</hi> will clearly appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low <pb n="91" facs="tcp:0964200100:94"/>

            <p n="13">13. "MUSIC, in its inlarged Senſe, acquired a
<hi>great</hi> and <hi>general Power</hi> over the Minds and Actions of the
ancient <hi>Greeks.</hi>" It is preſumed, that we have now gained an
Aſcent, from whence this Truth will appear evident and indiſputable; though
it hath long been regarded by many, as an incredible Paradox.—How, or
whence, ſuch an univerſal Paſſion for Muſic ſhould have ariſen in
GREECE; or, after it had ariſen, how it gained ſuch a general
Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment in the important Article of Education; or, after it was thus
eſtabliſhed, how it could work ſuch mighty Effects upon the Mind,
ſuppoſing it to conſiſt only in mere Melody;—are Queſtions
which wiſe Men have aſked, and Bigots to Antiquity have weakly anſwered:
For the common Reply hath been, that their <hi>Muſic</hi> (meaning their
<hi>Melody)</hi> was of a kind ſo much ſuperior to ours, that all its
wonderful Effects followed from its more exalted Nature.—On the contrary,
it appears, that as to its par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Conſtruction, we are ignorant of it:
That we have no preciſe or practicable Idea of their <hi>Genera,</hi> their
<hi>Modes</hi>; nor the <hi>Make,</hi> nor <hi>Power</hi> of their
<hi>Inſtruments:</hi> But that by collateral Arguments we can prove, that
their <hi>Melody</hi> was ſomething altogether <hi>ſimple</hi> and
<hi>inartificial</hi>; ſuch as Stateſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, Warriours, and Bards, occupied
in other Purſuits, could compoſe; and ſuch as high and low, Children and
Men buſied in other concerns of Life, could learn and practiſe. That hence
we are led to believe, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever <pb n="92" facs="tcp:0964200100:95" rendition="simple:additions"/> ever Effects
aroſe from the mere <hi>Melody,</hi> aroſe from its <hi>Rythm</hi> or
<hi>Meaſure,</hi> heightened by early <hi>Aſſociation</hi> and continued
<hi>Habit</hi>; by which it became a kind of natural <hi>Language</hi> of the
Paſſions. It appears farther, that <hi>Melody</hi> formed but a
<hi>Part</hi> of the ancient <hi>Muſic</hi>; and that its moſt important
and eſſential Branch was that of <hi>Verſe</hi> or <hi>Song.</hi> But for
a clear and full View of the Origin and Union of their <hi>Melody</hi> and
<hi>Song,</hi> it was neceſſary to go back, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin our Inquiries at the
early Period of ſavage Life, in which all the Seeds and Principles of
civilized Society ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in their native and uncultivated State. This Method
of Inveſtigation hath opened to us an involved and clouded Subject. Hence it
appears, that <hi>Melody, Dance,</hi> and <hi>Song,</hi> naturally aroſe in
<hi>Union</hi>; that <hi>Meaſure, Rythm,</hi> and <hi>Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,</hi> were the
certain Conſequence: That in the earlieſt Times of GREECE, the Characters
of <hi>Legiſlator</hi> and <hi>Bard</hi> did often and naturally
<hi>coaleſce:</hi> That hence their earlieſt Hiſtories, Laws, and
Oracles, were of courſe written in Verſe; that their religious Rites were
naturally, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out poſitive Appointment, performed or accompanied by
Melody, Dance, and Song: That through the ſeveral im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving Periods of Time,
their Songs were more and more of a true legiſlative Caſt; that they
included all the great Actions of their Gods and Heroes, and that in theſe
were contained the leading Principles of their Religion, Morals, and Polity:
That <hi>Muſic,</hi> in this its inlarged Senſe, bore an eſſential and
principal Part in the Education of their Children; being the pleaſing and
powerful Vehicle, by which all the important Precepts of Life were inſtilled
into their tender Minds.—Thus naturally <hi>Muſic</hi> aroſe, and was
<hi>powerfully eſtabliſhed</hi> in ancient GREECE: And from this 
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:0964200100:96"/> View of its Nature and eſtabliſhment, its <hi>general
Influence</hi> muſt unavoidably follow: 
<q rend="inline">"For through the Force of early and continued Habit,
together with the irreſiſtible Contagion of public Example maintained by
the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Practice of the whole Community, who had received the ſame
Impreſſions in their infant State; and while every thing pleaſing, great,
and important, was conveyed through this Medium; ſuch ſtrong
Aſſociations did ſtrike themſelves into the Tribes of GREECE, as
natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally produced the moſt laſting Effects, and ſuch as no future
Incidents of Life could eaſily weaken or efface."</q>
            </p>
            <p>On theſe principles we may naturally explain ſome of the
recorded Effects of ancient Muſic, which according to the common
Interpretation of the Word, have been liable to the Deriſion of modern
Critics.</p>
            <p>We read, that ſuch was the Power of ancient Muſic, that when
AGAMEMNON went to TROY, the deſigning EGIS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THUS could not debauch
CLITEMNESTRA, till he had decoyed away the <hi>Muſician</hi> that was
retained in the Palace. This Account, if we underſtand by <hi>Muſic</hi> no
more than <hi>Melody,</hi> hath much the Air of Hyperbole and Fable. But if we
regard the <hi>Muſician</hi> as what indeed he was, the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſer of
<hi>religious</hi> and <hi>moral</hi> Principles, and that he urged the great
Duty of conjugal Fidelity with the united Powers of poetic Eloquence and Song;
and urged them to one whoſe Education had made her ſuſceptible of ſuch
Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, the fabulous Appearances diſſolve; and we ſee, that no
other Method could have been deviſed, ſo effectual for the Preſervation
of a weak Woman's Virtue.</p>
            <p>Again; we are told, that certain young Men heated with Wine, had
agreed to aſſault the Doors of a modeſt <pb n="94" facs="tcp:0964200100:97"/> Woman, and
abuſe her as a Proſtitute: but that an able Muſician coming paſt, he
ſung and played to them in the <hi>Dorian</hi> Mode; on which they were
ſtruck with Shame, and deſiſted from their Enterprize<note n="x" place="bottom">This Story is ridiculed in the <hi>Memoirs</hi> of MARTINUS
SCRIBLERUS: And the Ridicule is founded on an entire Miſapprehenſion, or
Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repreſentation, of the true nature of <hi>ancient</hi> MUSIC.</note>.
This, to modern Comprehenſion, hath ſtill more the Air of Fable: But when
the Fact is well explained, the Ridicule vaniſheth with the Myſtery. For
every <hi>different Subject</hi> had a <hi>diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Mode</hi> annexed to it.
This appears at large from PLATO. 
<q rend="inline">"You muſt adapt the Mode to the Subject and Words,
not theſe to the Mode or Harmony: On theſe Matters we will farther
deliberate with DAMON, what Feet or Meaſures are fitteſt to expreſs

therefore, that when the Hiſtorian tells us, that the Muſician conquered
the young Debauchees by an Application of the <hi>Dorian</hi> Mode, he means to
ſignify, that the Melody was accompanied by a <hi>poetic Exhortation</hi>
ſuited to the Numbers; and this could be no other than a Leſſon of
<hi>Modeſty</hi> and <hi>Temperance</hi>; which being conveyed by the
pleaſing Vehicle of Melody and Song, addreſſed to thoſe who by the
Tenor of their Education muſt feel its Force, and given by one whoſe

<pb n="95" facs="tcp:0964200100:98"/> of its deſigned Effects, unleſs their Intemperance had

            <p>There are other recorded Effects of ancient Muſic of a ſimilar
Nature, which it is not neceſſary to produce here, becauſe they may all
be accounted for on the ſame Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple. With Reſpect to the traditionary
Influence of this Art on wild Beaſts, Stocks, and Stones, as it came down
from the ignorant and fabulous Times, ſo nothing can be juſtly concluded
from it, but the Force of Muſic over the Minds of uninſtructed and
wondering Barbarians.</p>
            <p>Thus the boaſted Power of the ancient <hi>Greek Muſic</hi>
ſeems naturally and fully accounted for. And in Confirmation of this
Solution, we may finally appeal to the ſavage Tribes with whom this Inquiry
began. For by Means parallel in moſt other Reſpects, ſave only in the

               </note>. And that this was the real Generation of the

where, having ſpoken of the three conſtituent Parts of a compleat
<hi>Choir</hi> (Melody, Dance, and Song) he proceeds to deduce from theſe the
Origin of the <hi>Gymnaſtic</hi> Art. 
<q rend="inline">"Is not this the leading Principle of the
<hi>Gymnaſtic</hi> Art, that every Creature is born with a natural
Inclination to leap or bound? But Man, being endowed with a Senſe of

<hi>Greeks</hi> to the End of public and warlike Service, is generally known:
However, if it needs a Proof, another Paſſage of the ſame Author will
ſufficiently confirm it. 
<q rend="inline">"After theſe Inſtructions (in <hi>Muſic</hi>)
the Parents ſend their Sons to the Maſters of the <hi>Gymnaſtic</hi>

            </p>
            <p>We trace the Foundation and Progreſs of the <hi>Gymnaſtic</hi>
Art no leſs clearly in LUCIAN's Account. 
<q rend="inline">"The <hi>Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans,</hi> having received this Art
(of Dancing) from CAS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TOR and POLLUX, went <hi>dancing</hi> to <hi>Battle,</hi>
to the Sound of Flutes: Their Application to Muſic did not leſſen their
Attention to Arms: For a Muſician ſat in the midſt of the Aſſembly,
and played on the Flute, beating Time with his Foot; while they regularly
followed the Meaſure, in a Variety of warlike Poſtures<note n="d" place="bottom">

                  </note>."</q>
            </p>
            <p>To confirm theſe Evidences, we may add another In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of a
warlike <hi>Dance,</hi> which approacheth neareſt to the Eſtabliſhment of
the <hi>Gymnaſtic</hi> Exerciſe, of any record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Antiquity. XENOPHON,
in his "Expedition of CYRUS," deſcribes one of theſe Dances in the
following Manner. 
<q rend="inline">"The <hi>Feaſt</hi> being ended, the
<hi>Libations</hi> made, and the <hi>Hymn</hi> ſung, two <hi>Thracians,</hi>
completely armed, began to dance to the Sound of the Flute: After
ſkir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhing for ſome time with their Swords, one of them (as wounded)
fell down, on which the <hi>Paphlagonians</hi> ſet up a loud Cry. The
Conqueror having ſtripped his Adverſary, departed, ſinging his
Victory."</q>—Here we ſee a near Approach to the Forms of the
<hi>Gymnaſtic</hi> Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe in their moſt eſſential Circumſtances,
yet the original Form of the <hi>Dance</hi> remains.</p>
            <p>Thus the Origin of the <hi>Gymnaſtic</hi> Arts is clearly
un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folded, as being no more than a Part of the ſavage <hi>Song-Feaſt</hi>; 
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:0964200100:101"/> 
               <hi>Feaſt</hi>; but ſeparated from thence for the
Ends of war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Service. For Want of this Information, the learned VOSSIUS,
among other Authors, ſtiles the <hi>Dance</hi> a Branch of the
<hi>Gymnaſtic,</hi> inſtead of regarding the <hi>Gymnaſtic</hi> as the
Offspring of the <hi>Dance</hi>

            <p>Here we may farther obſerve, that this View of the
<hi>Gymnaſtic,</hi> conſidered as having been originally a Branch of the
<hi>Muſical</hi> Art, clears up a Difficulty with which every other Account
of it is encumbered. Thus a late Writer ſays, 
<q rend="inline">"The Exerciſe of <hi>leaping</hi> in the

<hi>Pythian</hi> Airs, as PAUSA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NIAS informs us. Whence this Cuſtom was
derived, I cannot ſay: And the Reaſon aſſigned for it by that Author,
which is certainly not the true one, may induce us to think, that in this
Matter the Ancients were as ignorant as we<note n="f" place="bottom">

the Principle here given, the Cuſtom accounts for itſelf. In the firſt

made a <hi>Part</hi> of them: This <hi>Part</hi> had been diſuſed (by

did ariſe. In the early Periods they lay confuſed; and were mingled in the
ſame Compoſition, as Inclination, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſm, or other Incidents might
impel."—This Fact is manifeſt enough, from the Catalogue already given
of the Writings of the moſt ancient Bards of GREECE; for 
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:0964200100:104"/> by this it appears, that they ranged at large through
the Fields of Poetry and <hi>Song,</hi> without giving any preciſe or
legitimate Form to their Compoſitions; which ſeem moſt generally to have
been a rapturous Mixture of <hi>Hymn, Hiſtory, Fable,</hi> and
<hi>Mythology,</hi> thrown out by the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſtic Bard in legiſlative

according to the Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies or Capacity of his ſurrounding Audience.—<q rend="inline">"But repeated Trial and Experiment produced a more
artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Manner; and thus by Degrees, the ſeveral Kinds of Poem
aſſumed their legitimate Forms."</q>—For the Truth of this, we refer
to the following Articles.</p>
            <p n="17">17. "HYMNS or <hi>Odes</hi> were compoſed, and
<hi>ſung</hi> by their Compoſers at their feſtal Solemnities." This
Species of Song hath, in the Way of Preheminence, and beyond any other, gained
the Title of <hi>lyric Poetry.</hi> Nor can we won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at this, if we
conſider, that from its Nature it muſt have ariſen firſt, muſt have
been firſt moulded into Form, and muſt, from its peculiar Genius, continue
united with <hi>Melody</hi> longer and more univerſally than any other. It
aroſe firſt, becauſe it was natural for the ſavage Mind, to throw
itſelf out in ſudden Exclamations of Grief or Joy, Love, Revenge, or
Anguiſh, before it could find Means or Leiſure to recite at large the
Occaſions of theſe powerful Feelings: It muſt be firſt moulded into
Form, becauſe its Extent is the ſmalleſt, and its Plan moſt ſimple:
It muſt continue united with <hi>Melody</hi> longer and more univerſally
than any other Species, becauſe the very Eſſence of its Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject is that
which the other Kinds only catch incidentally, I mean, the ſudden Shocks and
Emotions of the Soul; which are found to be the powerful Bands of Nature, by 
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:0964200100:105"/> which <hi>Melody</hi> and <hi>Song</hi> are moſt
cloſely bound toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>PLUTARCH confirms this Reaſoning concerning the <hi>Priority</hi>
of the <hi>hymnal</hi> Species; and ſays, that 
<q rend="inline">"Muſic was <hi>firſt</hi> uſed in religious
Ceremonies, being employed in the <hi>Praiſes</hi> of the <hi>Gods</hi>; and

the ſeveral ſucceſſive Periods, ALCAEUS, STESICHORUS, TYRTAEUS, and
others, compoſed and ſung their <hi>Odes</hi> at the public Feſtivals.
The ſublime PINDAR was not more celebrated for his mighty Strains, than for
his powerful Performance of them at the <hi>Olympic Games:</hi> Nay, ſo high
was his Fame in this Regard, that he had a golden Chair appropriated to him in
the Temple of DELPHI, where he poured forth the Torrent of his Songs, which
were attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to, and revered as Oracles iſſuing from the Inſpiration of
the God.</p>

Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers at their feſtal Solemnities."—When the firſt Fire of

found Time to <hi>relate</hi> at large thoſe Actions which in its firſt

<hi>narrative</hi> Species. The Exploits of BAC<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CHUS, the Rape of PROSERPINE,

theſe remote Ages is ſo dark and fabulous, that nothing can with Certainty
be collected from them. But the very Structure of HOMER's Poem carries in
itſelf ſuch an internal Evidence, as turns the Scale againſt the
Hiſtorian's Conjecture. If we conſider the Nature of the human Mind, we
ſhall be led to believe, that the <hi>Epic</hi> Poem muſt have received a
<hi>gradual</hi> Improvement through that long though unknown Tract of Time,

Penetration even to comprehend in all its Variety and Art; which the
thoughtful, the literate, the poliſhed VIRGIL attempted to rival, and only
proved his utter In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability by his Attempt; which ſucceeding Poets have made
their Model, yet none have ever equalled or approached, ſave only the
all-comprehending Mind of the ſublime MILTON;—that ſuch a Plan as
This, which required the higheſt Efforts of an improved Underſtanding,
opened and ſtrengthened by a Succeſſion of preceding Examples, ſhould
at once emerge in all the Extent of Art, in the midſt of rude and unformed
Fables, ſung at Feſtivals as vague Enthuſiaſm might
inſpire;—this is an Opinion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to all our Notices concerning
the Progreſs of the Powers of the human Mind. We may as rationally
ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that St. PAUL's was the firſt built Temple, its <hi>Organ</hi>
the firſt muſical Inſtrument, the LAOCOON and his Sons the firſt

<hi>Audience,</hi> fired to Enthuſiaſm, and already prepared by a
correſpondent Education, would naturally <pb n="106" facs="tcp:0964200100:109"/> break forth
into the Raptures of a <hi>choral Song.</hi>—This Progreſſion of
Poetry is ſo natural, that it is Matter of Aſtoniſhment to hear the
learned at all Times aſcribing the Riſe of Tragedy to Cauſes merely
accidental; and confining it to the ſingle Adventure of THESPIS and his
Route, ſinging the Praiſes of BACCHUS at a <hi>caſual</hi> Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. Thus
DACIER, among others, affirms roundly, that 
<q rend="inline">"The firſt dramatic Perſon which THESPIS
<hi>invented,</hi> was only <hi>deſigned</hi> to give Reſpite to the Choir;
and what he recited was no more than an Appendage to Tragedy<note n="w" place="bottom">

In the ſame Manner the ſenſible and learned BRUMOY delivers at large the

the Nature of Things to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, when <hi>Letters</hi> had given Accents
to the Rapture of the ſurrounding Audience, and moulded the Ode into Form,
that this natural Union ſhould not be upheld. Though, therefore, the firſt
Riſe and Progreſs of the tragic Species in GREECE were hid in Darkneſs,
through a Want of recording Hiſtory, yet, from a Similarity of Cauſes and
Effects which we find among the barbarous Nations of AMERICA, we might fairly

            <p>It appears, therefore, that Tragedy had a much earlier and deeper

            </p>
            <p>At the ſame Time it is manifeſt, that THESPIS added
<hi>ſomething</hi> to the rude and ſavage Form of Tragedy, as it exiſted
in <hi>his</hi> Age. 'Tis probable that He was the <hi>firſt Declaimer</hi>

                  <p>The moſt learned BENTLEY fell into the common Syſtem, with
Regard to the Riſe of Tragedy: Attempting to prove, that THESPIS was its
<hi>Inventor.</hi> Thus, for Want of the true <hi>Data,</hi> and from an
Unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with Man in his ſavage State, this great Critic hath thrown
out a Chain of Errors: While, if he had been led up to the true Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of

                  <p>Mr. BOYLE, in his Examination of BENTLEY's Diſſertation,

inſiſts, that Tragedy is more ancient than THESPIS, on the Authority of
PLATO and LAERTIUS: But he falls again into the vulgar Track, in affirming,
that till the Time of THESPIS, the <hi>Epiſode</hi> had no Exiſtence, but

that dramatic <hi>Action</hi> is but another Mode of <hi>Narration</hi>; and
that even the <hi>Narration</hi> of the ſavage Tribes is found to have ſuch

when the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventive Genius of ESCHYLUS advanced the Art one Step higher; and by
adding a <hi>ſecond Perſon</hi> to the Drama, brought in the Uſe of
<hi>Dialogue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here, for the Sake of Truth, we muſt again depart from the general
Body of Critics; moſt of whom, from ARIS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TOTLE down to our own Times, unite
in ſuppoſing rhat ESCHYLUS was only a caſual Imitator of HOMER, and drew
the Idea of all his Tragedies from the ILIAD. A noble Critic of our own Country
hath affirmed this in the feweſt and ſtrongeſt Terms; and ſays, that 
<q rend="inline">"There was no more left for Tragedy to do after him
(HOMER) than to erect a Stage, and draw his Dialogues and Characters into
Scenes<note n="i" place="bottom">

            </p>
            <p>It may be deemed preſumptuous, perhaps, to queſtion a Point
wherein the great Maſter-Critic of GREECE hath himſelf decided. But let us
remember, that the Days are now paſt, when it was held a Point of Honour, to
<hi>ſwear</hi> to the <hi>Opinions</hi> of a <hi>Maſter.</hi> ARISTOTLE is
often ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable, generally judicious, yet ſometimes perhaps miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken,
even in his Judgment of Men and Things relative to his own Country. He was more
eſpecially capable of being miſled by the common Opinion in this Point; in
which neither He nor any of his Countrymen could be ſufficiently informed,
for Want of a competent Knowledge of the Genius and Character of ſavage
Manners.</p>
            <p>That ESCHYLUS was not a mere Imitator of HOMER, that he was a great
and original Poet, who exalted his Art one Degree beyond his Predeceſſors
in his own Country, ſeems <pb n="111" facs="tcp:0964200100:114"/> a Point which collateral
Arguments ſtrongly confirm. We are informed, in general Terms, that there
were no leſs than fifteen tragic Poets who writ before him: And the
Probability is much ſtronger, that he ſhould draw his Improvement from the
<hi>ſcenic</hi> Repreſentations already eſtabliſhed, in which he found
one dramatic Perſon and an accompanying <hi>Choir,</hi> which, in all
Probability, ſtood in the Place of a ſecond Perſon, and often
ſuſtained a Kind of Dialogue with the principal Interlocutor<note n="k" place="bottom">This Opinion receives a ſtrong Confirmation from the following
Circumſtance, that in the <hi>Greek Tragedies</hi> which have come down to
us, whenever there is a <hi>ſingle Interlocutor</hi> on the Stage, the
<hi>Choir</hi> frequently maintains a <hi>Dialogue</hi> with him.</note>; than
that he ſhould have Recourſe to HOMER's Poems, in which no dramatic
Repreſentation was to be found.</p>
            <p>To this Argument may be added another, drawn from the Style and
Manner of ESCHYLUS, ſo different from that of HOMER. For HOMER is equal,
large, flowing, and harmonious: ESCHYLUS is uneven, conciſe, abrupt, and
rugged: The one leads you through the grand but gentle Declivities of Hill and
Dale; the other carries you over a continued Chain of Rocks and Precipices. Now
if HOMER had been the Model of ESCHYLUS, ſome <hi>Similarity</hi> of
<hi>Manner</hi> would probably have enſued.</p>
            <p>A third and ſtill ſtronger Proof ariſes from the eſſential
Difference of their Subjects, both in Extent and Nature: In Extent, becauſe
the one is of <hi>long,</hi> the other of ſhort Duration: In Nature,
becauſe HOMER's Poems are chiefly employed in the Exhibition of
<hi>Character</hi> and <hi>Manners</hi>; thoſe of ESCHYLUS in the
Repreſentation of <hi>Terror</hi> and <hi>Diſtreſs.</hi> Had he been that
mere Imitator of HOMER which the Critics have adjudged him, and had nothing to 
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:0964200100:115"/> do but to erect a Stage, and to draw HOMER's Dialogues
into Scenes, he would have been content to have taken <hi>his</hi> Subjects
from the <hi>Iliad,</hi> and, according to HORACE's ſober Rule, have never
ventured beyond the Siege of <hi>Troy</hi>
               <note n="l" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>RECTIUS ILIACOS, &amp;c.</bibl>
               </note>. He would have
brought upon the Stage the Anger of ACHILLES, the Battle of PARIS and MENELAUS,
the Part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of HECTOR and ANDROMACHE, the Feats of DIO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MEDE; and would have
contraſted the <hi>ſtrength</hi> of AJAX with the <hi>Cunning</hi> of
ULYSSES. Nothing of all this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears: On the contrary, his <hi>Subjects</hi>
and <hi>Manner</hi> are equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>his own</hi>; and <hi>both</hi> of a
Genius oppoſite to thoſe of HOMER.</p>
            <p>What PLUTARCH ſays of HOMER, though brought for the contrary
Purpoſe, tends to confirm all that is here ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced. 
<q rend="inline">"Even Tragedy took its Riſe from HOMER: For his
Poems comprehend every thing that is <hi>ſublime</hi> and <hi>great</hi>

                  </note>."</q> This, you
will ſay, is a very inſufficient Reaſon, becauſe the Critic forgets the
<hi>pathetic</hi> and the <hi>terrible,</hi> which were the eſſential
Conſtituents of the Greek Tragedy. But mark the Sequel; which is ſtill more
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary. 
<q rend="inline">"Neither do they (HOMER's Poems) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Deſcriptions of thoſe <hi>atrocious Actions</hi> which have been feigned by
the later Tragedians, ſuch as <hi>Inceſt,</hi> and the <hi>Murder</hi> of

PLUTARCH is labouring to prove, that the <hi>Greek</hi> Tragedy was
<hi>drawn</hi> from HOMER, he proves, that HOMER's Poems were
<hi>deſtitute</hi> of that which was of the <hi>Eſſence</hi> of the
<hi>Greek</hi> Tragedy.</p>

Queſtion in its true Light. 
<q rend="inline">"In the <hi>Iliad</hi> (ſaith he) there is nothing

<hi>Iliad</hi> hath very few of the eſſential Characteriſtics of
<hi>Tragedy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We may fairly conclude, then, that the Improvement which Tragedy
received from ESCHYLUS was not <hi>caſual,</hi> but the Reſult of a
<hi>natural Progreſſion:</hi> That he drew not from HOMER's Poems, as a

            <p>What followed is well known: SOPHOCLES added a <hi>third</hi>

of Nature: It was a natural and ſenſible Improvement; for the plain
Reaſon of <hi>preventing Giddineſs,</hi> which ariſeth from running round
in the ſame Circle.</p>
            <p>Let us attend, therefore, to its Conſequences. As each
<hi>Dance</hi> or <hi>Return</hi> was marked by its peculiar
<hi>Meaſure,</hi> this of Courſe fixed both the <hi>Melody</hi> and poetic
<hi>Numbers</hi> of the accompanying Song: And as they likewiſe ſung during
the <hi>Interval</hi> of Reſt, we ſee, that from this eaſy Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
on the ſavage Song-Feaſt, the <hi>Strophe, Antiſtrophe,</hi> and
<hi>Epode,</hi> naturally aroſe.</p>
            <p n="22">22. "Another Conſequence of the eſtabliſhed
<hi>Choir</hi> was a ſtrict and unvaried Adherence to the <hi>Unities</hi> of
<hi>Place</hi> and <hi>Time.</hi>" This Effect is ſo manifeſt as to need
little Illuſtration. A numerous <hi>Choir,</hi> maintaining their Station
through the whole Performance, gave ſo forcible a Conviction to the Senſes,
of the <hi>Sameneſs</hi> of <hi>Place,</hi> and the <hi>Shortneſs</hi> of
<hi>Time,</hi> that any Deviation from this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent Unity muſt have
ſhocked the Imagination with an Improbability too groſs to be indured.
Notwithſtanding all the Panegyrics of the Critics, therefore, upon the Greek
Tragedians on Account of theſe <hi>Unities</hi>; it is evident, 
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:0964200100:118"/> they aroſe in the rudeſt Periods; and were continued
through the more poliſhed Ages, on the ſame Principle of untaught Nature
and eſtabliſhed Cuſtom.</p>
            <p n="23">23. "Not only the Part of the tragic <hi>Choir,</hi> but the
<hi>Epiſode,</hi> or <hi>interlocutory</hi> Part, was alſo <hi>Sung.</hi>"
The moſt ſenſible of the Critics have ever regarded this as a
Circumſtance equally unnatural and unaccountable. Thus DACIER ſpeaks. 
<q rend="inline">"It muſt be owned, that we cannot well comprehend,
how Muſic <hi>(Melody)</hi> could ever be conſidered as in any Reſpect
making a Part of Tragedy: For if there be any thing in the World that is at
Variance with <hi>tragic Action,</hi> it is <hi>Song</hi>

The learned Critic is ſo ſhocked with this ſuppoſed Union, in
Appearance ſo unnatural, that upon the whole he queſtions its Exiſtence;
and is of Opinion, that when ARISTOTLE ſpeaks of <hi>Muſic,</hi> as being

united Voice of Antiquity, which univerſally admits the Fact, though its
Origin was never accounted for. But how naturally this union took Place in
ancient Tragedy, we now clearly diſcover, by inveſtigating the Riſe and
Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of this Poem from the ſavage State. For it appears, that the
<hi>Epic</hi> and <hi>Ode</hi> were both ſung from the earlieſt Periods;
and therefore, when they became <hi>united,</hi> and by that Union formed the
tragic Species, they of Courſe maintained the ſame Appendage of
<hi>Melody,</hi> which Nature and Cuſtom had already given them.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Abbé du</hi> Bos endeavours to prove, indeed, that
the <hi>Song</hi> which was employed in the <hi>Epiſode</hi> of ancient
Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy <pb n="116" facs="tcp:0964200100:119"/> was no more than a Kind of <hi>regulated</hi>

               </note>. But his Inquiries are
partial; for he goes no higher than to the Practice of the <hi>Romans:</hi> And
it is probable, from ſeveral Circumſtances, that in the late Period when
the <hi>Romans</hi> borrowed their Muſic from, the <hi>Greeks,</hi> the
Tragic <hi>Song</hi> had been brought down from a <hi>meaſured Melody</hi> to
a kind of <hi>regulated Declamation.</hi> Thus, TULLY mentions the <hi>Cantus
Subobſcurus</hi>; and again ſaith, 
<q rend="inline">"Delicatiores ſunt falſae Voculae quam certae et

the <hi>Abbé,</hi> ſeem to imply that the tragic <hi>Song</hi> was
little more than a meaſured Recitation; yet this will by no means prove, that
a more full and direct Song had not been uſed in Tragedy thro' the more early
Periods. In the Courſe of this Diſſertation, the Practice of
<hi>ſinging</hi> Tragedy hath been traced from its firſt Riſe in ſavage
Manners; which at once deſtroys the <hi>Improbability</hi> of the Cuſtom,
and proves that it was even founded in Nature; a Circumſtance, of which the
<hi>Abbé</hi> had not the leaſt Suſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion. This Foundation being
laid, we cannot but liſten attentively to what the early Writers of GREECE
tell us on this Subject: Now theſe unite in informing us, that the
<hi>Epiſode</hi> of Tragedy was <hi>Sung</hi>; and even name the

Inſtance here, ſimilar to what we now treat of: ARISTOTLE informs us, that

In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roads into the ancient Practice; and now <hi>recited</hi> thoſe

ſuffice to ſay, that if ARISTOTLE meant to aſſign this <hi>moral
End,</hi> as the <hi>Cauſe</hi> why Tragedy aſſumed this Form in ancient
GREECE, and adopted Subjects of <hi>Diſtreſs</hi> and <hi>Terror,</hi> He
ſeems to have taken That for a <hi>Cauſe,</hi> which was a <hi>natural
Effect</hi> of the ruling <hi>Manners</hi> of the <hi>Greek</hi> Republics. The
Reaſons which ſupport the general Truth, already given in the
correſpondent Article, will hold their Force when applied here. For thus the
<hi>Greeks</hi> animat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed each other to <hi>Victory</hi> and <hi>Revenge,</hi>
by a Repreſentation of what their Friends had <hi>done</hi> and
<hi>ſuffered.</hi> Theſe Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects would likewiſe be moſt accommodated
to the natural Taſte of the poetic Chiefs of ſuch a People; whoſe
<hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievements</hi> produced and abounded with Events of
<hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs</hi> and <hi>Terror.</hi> Such then was the natural Origin
and Adoption of theſe Subjects in the <hi>Greek Tragedy:</hi> But after they
were eſtabliſhed on this Foundation, 'tis proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that the Stateſmen
encouraged and applied them to the <hi>Ends</hi> of Policy. For as the leading
View of a fierce and warlike People muſt be to <hi>deſtroy Pity</hi> and
<hi>Fear</hi>; ſo This would moſt effectually be done, by making
themſelves familiar with diſtreſsful and terrible Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations.
Under theſe Reſtrictions, the Opinion of ARISTOTLE may have a Foundation in
Nature: Farther than this; and as applied to any People whoſe End is not
<hi>War</hi> and <hi>Conqueſt,</hi> it carries the Appearance of a refined
Idea, which hath no Foundation in Nature. The grand ſcenic Repreſentations
of the <hi>Peruvians</hi> and <hi>Chineſe</hi> (as <pb n="119" facs="tcp:0964200100:122"/>

whoſe leading Object was <hi>Peace,</hi> are known to be of a quite contrary

            <p n="25">25. "Their Tragedy being deſigned as a viſible
Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of their ancient Gods and Heroes, they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented a Method of
ſtrengthening the Voice, and ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grandizing the Viſage and Perſon, as the
Means of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleating the Reſemblance." It is generally known, that the old
<hi>Grecian Gods</hi> were ſuppoſed to be of a Stature <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding</hi>
that of <hi>ordinary</hi> Men: And the true Reaſon of that Opinion was,
becauſe in the early Ages they (like every other barbarous People<note n="e" place="bottom">

               </note>) ſelected
the <hi>talleſt</hi> and <hi>ſtrongeſt</hi> Men for their
<hi>Chiefs:</hi> Which Chiefs in Courſe of Time became their <hi>Gods.</hi>
Hence the <hi>Buſkin</hi> and <hi>Maſque</hi> had their natural Birth: For

            <p>By thus tracing the <hi>Buſkin</hi> and <hi>Maſque</hi> to their
true Origin, we ſhall now be able to give a Reaſon for a Fact, which hath
hitherto been regarded as merely the Effect of Whim and Caprice. THESPIS and

exhibited his Exploits, and ſung his Praiſes to their Countrymen: Their

ſo they were <hi>Actors,</hi> and generally performed ſome capital Part, in
their own Pieces for the Stage." This Fact hath gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally been held
extraordinary and unaccountable: And hath been reſolved, it ſeems, by
ſome Talkers on this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, into the <hi>Want</hi> of <hi>Actors</hi> in
the <hi>early</hi> Periods. We now clearly diſcover a contrary Cauſe: The

GREECE. SOPHOCLES was the firſt on Record who quitted this honourable Employ:
And He, only becauſe his Voice was unequal to the Vaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the

            <p>So much concerning the Riſe and Progreſs of the

Contentions of ſavage Chieftains, as to create a ſtrong Probability of the
Truth of the Tradition. This we know, however, that Muſical Conteſts made
an eſſential Part of theſe magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Exhibitions; and that PINDAR
ſung his Odes, and was often <hi>crowned</hi> as <hi>Victor</hi> in theſe
public Conteſts.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Iſthmian</hi> and <hi>Nemean</hi> Games, having been
inſtituted in later Periods, when a Separation of the Dance had been already
made, and conſequently the <hi>Gymnaſtic</hi> Arts already eſtabliſhed,
we cannot properly draw any Concluſions from Theſe, relative to the
preſent Queſtion.</p>
            <p>The <hi>tragic Conteſts,</hi> which followed on the Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of that Species of Poetry, are too well known to need any particular
Delineation. Let it ſuffice, that we have traced them up to their firſt
rude Form and Origin, in the muſical Conteſt at DELPHI, as deſcribed by

were re-eſtabliſhed in their more improved State by CIMON, when that
General brought the Remains of THESEUS to ATHENS. The three great tragic Bards,
ESCHYLUS, SOPHOCLES, and EURIPIDES, all <hi>contended</hi> and were
<hi>crowned</hi> by turns.</p>
            <p>This general Eſtabliſhment of muſical Conteſts, which hath
been ſo often held trifling and unaccountable, appears 
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:0964200100:127" rendition="simple:additions"/> now to have been founded in true Policy and
Wiſdom. 
<q rend="inline">"For as the leading Articles of their Religion,

if not an original Legiſlator, was at leaſt a ſubordinate and uſeful
Servant of the State: And as the Utility of his Profeſſion was ſuch as

            <q>"The People (of ATHENS) did not in former Times controul the Laws,
but willingly obeyed them. I mean thoſe Laws which were made concerning
Muſic. For Muſic was then preciſely diſtinguiſhed into its ſeveral
Kinds: One was appropriated to the Supplication and Praiſes of the Gods:
Theſe were called <hi>Hymns.</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Species was the lamenting or
pathetic: A third was the <hi>Paean</hi> or Song of Triumph: A fourth was the

                  <bibl>See Art.
6.</bibl>
               </note>. In Theſe and other Subjects eſtabliſhed by Law, it was
not allowed to uſe one Kind of Melody inſtead of another: Each Kind had its
par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Appropriation. The Power of deciding on Theſe, and of condemning
in Caſe of Diſobedience, was not committed to the Hiſſes and fooliſh
Clamours of the Multitude, as is now the Practice: Neither was the Liberty of
intemperate Praiſe allowed to a noiſy Croud: This Deciſion was left to
Men diſtinguiſhed by their Senſe and Knowledge; and a general Silence was
maintained, till they had heard the Concluſion of the Work. The young Men,
their Governors, and all the People, were obedient to the Motions of a Wand.
While this good Order was maintained, the Multitude 
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:0964200100:134" rendition="simple:additions"/> willingly obeyed, nor dared to decide any thing
in a tumultuous Manner. But in Courſe of Time, the Poets themſelves were
acceſſary to a fatal Change in Muſic: They wanted not Genius; but had no
Regard to what was juſt and legitimate; running into Extravagance, and too
much indulging the Vein of Pleaſure. Hence they confounded all the ſeveral
Kinds together; affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that <hi>mere Taſte</hi> and <hi>Pleaſure,</hi>
whether it were that of a <hi>good</hi> or a <hi>wicked</hi> Man, was the only
<hi>Criterion</hi> of <hi>Muſic.</hi> In Conſequence of this, they
compoſed their <hi>Poems</hi> on the ſame Principle; and thus rendered the
<hi>Multitude</hi> ſo <hi>bold</hi> and <hi>daring</hi> againſt the
<hi>eſtabliſhed Muſic,</hi> that they aſſumed to themſelves the
ſole Right of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciding on it. Hence the Theatres began to be in Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roar,
where formerly Silence had reigned: And thus the Privilege of <hi>judging</hi>
fell from the <hi>Rulers</hi> of the State to the <hi>Dregs</hi> of the People.
Had this Authority been aſſumed by the <hi>liberal</hi> Part of the City,
no great Harm had followed: But now, from this <hi>corrupt Change</hi> in
<hi>Muſic,</hi> a <hi>general Licentiouſneſs</hi> of <hi>Opinion</hi>
hath enſued.—The Conſequence of this hath been, that we no longer are
diſpoſed to obey the Magiſtrate: Hence too, that other Evil flows, that
we deſpiſe the Authority and Precepts of our Parents, and the Advice and
Wiſdom of Old Age. And as we are riſing towards the Extreme of this
Corruption, we now refuſe Obedience to the Laws: And to fill up the Meaſure

ſee a particular Delineation of the Progreſs of this Evil, which PLATO here
deſcribes in general Terms.</p>
            <p>Let us conclude this Article with the Explanation of Subjects which
hath not hitherto been clearly treated of, for want of a juſt Idea of the
ancient <hi>Greek Muſic.</hi> The learned VOSSIUS thus expreſſeth
himſelf: 
<q rend="inline">"It is a doubtful Point, whether we ſhould ſay,
that on a Change of Muſic, a Change of Manners enſues; or that a Change of
Manners produceth a Change in Muſic: The firſt was DAMON's Opinion which
PLATO follows: But CICERO leans to the latter Syſtem<note n="m" place="bottom">
                     <bibl>VOSSIUS.</bibl>
                  </note>."</q> On this Paſſage it is
neceſſary firſt to obſerve, that both VOSSIUS and CICERO uſe the Word
<hi>Muſic</hi> in its <hi>modern</hi> Acceptation, as implying mere
<hi>Melody.</hi> No Wonder, therefore, if they had but an imperfect
Comprehenſion of PLATO's Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Secondly, On the Principles delivered in
this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertation, it will appear, that PLATO was of both theſe
Opinions, 
<q rend="inline">"That Manners influenced Muſic, and Muſic
influenced Manners."</q> In the Paſſage which VOSSIUS refers to, where the
Opinion of DAMON is delivered, PLATO ſpeaks of a Change in Muſic as
influencing the Manners of a Commonwealth: This Change he regards, as opening a
Door for Confuſion and Novelty in an Affair of public Conſequence;
ſimilar to a Neglect of Reverence to old Men, Parents, or Magiſtrates, or
any other ancient and approved Cuſtoms that were connected with the public
Welfare: and in this Reſpect, the Influence of the Greek 
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:0964200100:136" rendition="simple:additions"/> Muſic, as now explained, on the Manners of
Mankind is too evident to need any farther Proof.</p>
            <p>On the other Hand, it is no leſs evident, that PLATO was of
Opinion, that a Corruption of Manners muſt cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Muſic. He hath ſhewn
us in the Paſſage given above, that the Boldneſs and Degeneracy of the
People of ATHENS firſt allured the Poets to debaſe their Art, by ſinging
ſuch Poems as were accommodated to their vicious Taſte founded on their
vicious Manners: That as Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners had thus debaſed Muſic, ſo this corrupt
Muſic by a natural Reaction ſtill farther corrupted Manners, and
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated the Deſtruction of Religion and Virtue.</p>
            <p n="35">35. "In Conſequence of theſe Progreſſions, a gradual
and total Separation of the Bard's complex Character enſued. The Leader of
the State no longer was ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious of the muſical Art; nor the Poet
deſcended to the Profeſſion of Lyriſt, Singer, or Actor: Becauſe
theſe Profeſſions, which in the earlieſt Ages had been the Means of
inculcating every thing laudable and great, grew by Degrees of leſs and
leſs Importance; and being at length perverted to the contrary Purpoſes,
were in the End diſdained by the wiſe and virtuous." Theſe gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual
Separations of the ſeveral Branches of the Bard's complex Office, and of
Melody, Dance, and Song, are not incurious in their Progreſſion.—We
have ſeen, that in the <hi>earlieſt</hi> Ages, the <hi>Gods</hi> or
<hi>Legiſlators</hi> themſelves aſſumed the full and complex Character;
that they were <hi>Poets, Lyriſts, Singers</hi> and <hi>Dancers.</hi> The

<hi>Muſician's</hi> Character; a Separation which 
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:0964200100:137" rendition="simple:additions"/> naturally aroſe from decreaſing
Enthuſiaſm, and increaſing Cares of Government. As LINUS and ORPHEUS were
the firſt, ſo PYTHAGORAS and SOLON ſeem to have been the laſt, who
<hi>compoſed</hi> Songs and <hi>ſung</hi> them to the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounding
People.—The Profeſſion of <hi>Bard</hi> or <hi>Muſician</hi> was
now become a <hi>ſecondary,</hi> but <hi>reſpectable</hi> Character, as
being an Aſſiſtant to the Magiſtrate, and an uſeful Servant of the
State, a Teacher of Religion and Morals. The Bard <hi>ſung</hi> and
<hi>played</hi> always, and led the <hi>Dance</hi> occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally: But when
HOMER's Poems had eclipſed every other Epic Strain, another Separation
followed: The <hi>Rhapſodiſts</hi> aroſe in GREECE: They ſung HOMER's
Poems to large ſurrounding Audiences: They were ſtrictly his
<hi>Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives,</hi> who now gave his Poems to the People, with that
poetic Fire and Rapture which the Bard himſelf had poſſeſſed and
exerted: For in PLATO's <hi>Ion,</hi> the <hi>Rhapſodiſt</hi> ſays, that 
<q rend="inline">"when he ſings a piteous Tale, his Eyes ſwim
with Tears; when he ſings a terrible Event, his Heart beats, and his Hair
ſtands erect."</q> In the earlier Ages of Tragedy, the Poet both acted and
ſung: But in the Time of SOPHOCLES, another Separation, parallel to the
laſt, enſued; and the Province of <hi>Actor</hi> began to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
from that of <hi>Poet.</hi>—Soon after this Time, we find in the
Paſſage quoted above from PLATO, that a Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>whole</hi>
Art of <hi>Muſic</hi> from its <hi>proper Ends</hi> took Place at ATHENS: Its
ſalutary Effects were now loſt: and as at this Period the Paſſion for

            <head>SECT. VII. Of the Origin and Progreſſion of Comedy in ancient
GREECE.</head>
            <p>THERE is one conſiderable Branch of the MUSIC of antient GREECE, I
mean COMEDY, the Riſe and Progreſſion of which, together with their
Cauſes, have been deſignedly paſſed in Silence: Becauſe, if this
Diſquiſition had been mixed with what hath been <pb n="138" facs="tcp:0964200100:141"/>
delivered concerning the <hi>Ode, Epic,</hi> and <hi>Tragedy,</hi> the Chain of
Argument would have been broken; and that Order and Clearneſs deſtroyed,
which it was neceſſary to preſerve as much as poſſible in this
involved Subject.</p>
            <p>Let us now proceed, therefore, to reduce the Origin and Progreſs
of the <hi>Greek Comedy</hi> to their natural and eſſential
Cauſes.—To point out the Riſe of this Poem from ſavage Life; to
unfold the true Reaſons why it was ſo late in taking its legitimate Form in
GREECE; and then to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, on what Foundation the <hi>old, middle,</hi> and
<hi>new</hi> Comedy, appeared in their reſpective
<hi>Succeſſions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Deſcription of the ſavage Song Feaſts, given above from
LAFITAU, it appears that theſe warlike Tribes 
<q rend="inline">"are ſtill quicker at rallying, than at
praiſing, each other. He who dances, takes whomſoever he pleaſeth by the
Hand; and brings him forth into the midſt of the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly; to which he
yields without Reſiſtance. Mean while the Dancer continued to
<hi>ſing,</hi> and ſometimes in his Song, and ſometimes in the intervals,
he throws his Sarcaſms on the Patient, who hears him without Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply.—At
every <hi>bon Mot,</hi> loud Peals of Laughter ariſe along the Galleries, who
animate this Sport, and often oblige the Patient to cover his Head in his
Mantle<note n="b" place="bottom">
                     <bibl>See above, Sect.
ii.</bibl>
                  </note>."</q>
            </p>
            <p>Now, if we again ſuppoſe, as we have already done, that the
Uſe of <hi>Letters</hi> ſhould come among theſe ſavage Tribes, and be
cultivated with that ſpirit which is natural to a free and active People;
from this Picture, as given by LAFITAU, the following Conſequences would
naturally ariſe.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="139" facs="tcp:0964200100:142"/>1. "Their caſual Strokes of Raillery
would improve into written Invectives, which would occaſionally be ſung by
their ſarcaſtic Choirs." Becauſe nothing could be more alluring to a
People of this ſatyric Turn, than ſuch a Repoſitory of Wit and Raillery;
which, like a Quiver ſtored with the keeneſt Arrows, would be ever at Hand,
ready to be diſcharged againſt the occaſional Objects of their
Reſentment.</p>
            <p n="2">2. "Narrative or Epic Poems of the <hi>invective</hi> or
<hi>comic</hi> Kind would likewiſe ariſe, and be occaſionally ſung at
their public Feſtivals." For the Spirit of Sarcaſm being once awakened, it
would of courſe proceed from occaſional Strokes of Raillery, to the Recital
of ridiculous Actions, for the Gratification and Entertainment of a lively and
ſatyric People.</p>
            <p n="3">3. "From theſe two Species (the <hi>choral</hi> and
<hi>narrative</hi> united) the firſt rude Outline of <hi>Comedy</hi> would
ariſe." We have ſeen how <hi>Tragedy</hi> aroſe from parallel Cauſes:
And Theſe would naturally take Place in producing <hi>Comedy.</hi> For the
<hi>Narrative,</hi> already animated by Action, would eaſily ſlide into
dramatic Repreſentation, as in the Riſe of <hi>Tragedy</hi>; and the
correſpondent <hi>Peals of Laughter</hi> (by the Aſſiſtance of written
Invectives) would aſſume the Form of a <hi>comic Choir.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. "While the ſalutary Principles of Legiſlation ſhould
prevail, Comedy thus formed, would be little encouraged by the Leaders of the
State." For the grander Kinds of Poetry, already treated of, containing the
Principles of Religion, Polity, and Morals, would draw their main Attention;
while their Comedy, being no more than the <pb n="140" facs="tcp:0964200100:143" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Vehicle of Ridicule and vague Invective, would (at moſt) be only
<hi>endured</hi> by prudent Legiſlators.</p>
            <p n="5">5. "A provident Community, of Principles uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſevere,
might even baniſh this Species of Poem, as deſtructive to their State."
Becauſe nothing could be more dangerous to a Commonwealth eſtabliſhed on
Severity of Manners, than the unbounded Licentiouſneſs of Sentiment and
Speech, which this Comedy muſt tend to produce.</p>
            <p n="6">6. "If in a State of more relaxed Principles, where ſuch
Comedy had been tolerated, a general Corruption of Manners ſhould take Place
among the People; and if by any means, ſuch a corrupt People ſhould
over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power the Magiſtrates, and aſſume to themſelves the Reins of
Government; then, this Species of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy would riſe into Credit, and be
publicly eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed." For the <hi>upright Leaders</hi> of the State being
<hi>depoſed,</hi> and the <hi>Creatures</hi> of ſuch a <hi>corrupt
People</hi> being ſeated in their <hi>Place, that Comedy</hi> would now be
<hi>authorized</hi> by Law, which was moſt accommodated to the
<hi>Taſte</hi> and <hi>Vices</hi> of ſuch a <hi>corrupt People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. "The Ridicule and Invective of their Comedy, thus
eſtabliſhed, would be pointed chiefly againſt thoſe Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, or
private Men, whoſe Qualities would be hateful to the debauched Populace." For
Corruption being now eſtabliſhed as it were by Law; that is, by the Voice
of a degenerate People which ſtood in the Place of Law; the Poets would find
it neceſſary to gratify the People's Vices as the ſureſt Road to
Succeſs; and the moſt certain Road to this muſt be by the <hi>Ridicule of
Virtue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">
               <pb n="141" facs="tcp:0964200100:144" rendition="simple:additions"/>8. "If a <hi>Tyranny</hi>
ſhould ſuddenly erect itſelf on the Ruins of ſuch a People, it would by
its Authority <hi>ſilence</hi> this Species of <hi>Comedy.</hi>"—For
every thing hateful to the People being now the eſtabliſhed Subject of the
comic Muſe, the Tyrants, who had taken away the public Liberty, muſt expect
to become the Subject of Comedy, if permitted to revel in its former
Licentiouſneſs.</p>
            <p n="9">9. "The Poets would probably find a Subterfuge, for the
Gratification of the People; and continue to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent <hi>real
Characters</hi> under <hi>feigned Names.</hi>" For this would be the only
Species of Comedy they could purſue with a Probability of Succeſs: And this
might be conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued without much Danger, if they were cautious with Reſpect
to the Perſons of the Tyrants.</p>
            <p n="10">10. "If a great Conqueror ſhould ariſe, and, by
ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duing a Variety of Nations, ſhould open a Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation between ſuch
a State and others of more luxurious and refined Manners, this
<hi>ſecond</hi> Species of Comedy would naturally receive a
<hi>Poliſh</hi>; and, inſtead of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>direct perſonal Invective, would
aſſume the more deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate Form of general Raillery, and become a Picture of
human Life."—For one of the firſt Efforts of a growing Politeneſs is
to avoid all Occaſions of <hi>Offence</hi>; and this, without Reſpect to
any Conſequences, either good or bad, which may affect the Public; but merely
from a ſelfiſh Regard to the Opinion of <hi>Elegance,</hi> and the Pride of
<hi>Urbanity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In Support of theſe Deductions, let us now endeavour to
<hi>realize</hi> them; by ſhewing, that ſuch Conſequences did ariſe in
GREECE: And in the Courſe of this Argument, the Writer hopes he ſhall be
able to diſcloſe the true Cauſes <pb n="142" facs="tcp:0964200100:145" rendition="simple:additions"/> of the
Progreſſion of the ancient Comedy, ſo different from that of the higher
Kinds of Poetic Compoſition.</p>
            <p n="1">1. "In the earlieſt Periods of the Greek States, their
Caſual Strokes of Raillery were improved into written Invectives, and were
occaſionally ſung by their ſarcaſtic Choirs." Theſe written
Invectives were in Fact ſo early, that all the Greek Writers with one Voice
confeſs themſelves altogether ignorant of their Origin. Their firſt
Appearance is aſcribed by different Authors to different Nations<note n="c" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>See VOSSIUS <hi>Inſt. Poët.</hi> l. ii. c.
23.</bibl>
               </note>; and no Wonder if Evidence be wanting in Support of each
Pretence, when it is probable, that theſe ſarcaſtic Choirs aroſe in
many of the <hi>Greek</hi> States nearly at the ſame Time; that is, in or
about the firſt Periods of Civilization and Letters. For we have ſeen, that
ſuch a Period would naturally produce them: 
<q rend="inline">"Becauſe nothing could be more alluring to a
People of the ſatyric Turn, than ſuch a Repoſitory of Raillery and
Sarcaſm."</q> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, we muſt not omit to obſerve, that their
Traditions are much more accommodated to Nature and Probability on this
Subject, than on the Riſe of the tragic Choir, which they ſeem generally to
have attributed to the ſingle Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the drunken Votaries of
BACCHUS.</p>
            <p n="2">2. "Narrative or Epic Poems of the invective or comic Kind
aroſe, and were occaſionally ſung at their public Feſtivals." For the
truth of this Fact we have the Teſtimony of ARISTOTLE, who tells us, 
<q rend="inline">"that although we know not the names either of
theſe Poems or their Authors; yet there is Reaſon to believe that many had
been written before HOMER; and that his <hi>Margites</hi> 
                  <pb n="143" facs="tcp:0964200100:146" rendition="simple:additions"/> brought this Species to its Perfection in the
ſame Manner as the <hi>Iliad</hi> and <hi>Odyſſey</hi> had compleated the
Form of the Epic Poem<note n="d" place="bottom">

4.</bibl>
                  </note>."</q> That HOMER, as well as other Bards of the early Periods,
ſung their comic Poems at the feſtal Solemnities, needs no farther Proof
here.</p>
            <p n="3">3. "From theſe two Species (the <hi>Choral</hi> and
<hi>Narrative</hi> united) the firſt rude Outline of Comedy aroſe." The
<hi>Narrative,</hi> already animated by a lively Action, did eaſily ſlide
into <hi>dramatic</hi> Repreſentation; and the correſpondent Peals of
<hi>Laughter</hi> excited among the ſurrounding Audience, by means of written
Invectives, aſſumed the Form of the <hi>comic Choir.</hi> In this Point, we
have again to contend with the general Body of Critics, from ARISTOTLE down to
the preſent Times, who all concur in aſcribing the Riſe of the legitimate
Form of Comedy to HOMER's <hi>Margites</hi>; in the ſame Manner as they have
aſcribed the Riſe of <hi>Tragedy</hi> to the <hi>Iliad</hi> and
<hi>Odyſſey.</hi> But notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this general Concurrence of
Opinion, it ſeems evident that the Progreſſion of Comedy was founded in
the ſame Cauſes with that of Tragedy: That they both natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally aroſe in
the Courſe of Things, from an Union of the <hi>Narration</hi> and the
<hi>Choir,</hi> without any Reſpect had to HO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MER's Poems. The ſame
Arguments that have proved the one, will confirm the other. We ſee the
natural Seeds of Comedy and ſcenic Repreſentation in ſavage Life, no
leſs than thoſe of Tragedy<note n="e" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>See above, Sect.
ii.</bibl>
               </note>: Nay, even in the earlieſt Periods of GREECE itſelf, we
ſhall find the firſt rude Form of Comedy, ariſing from an Union of
<hi>dramatic Repreſentation</hi> and a <hi>Choir,</hi> long before HOMER
exiſted. In the Account <pb n="144" facs="tcp:0964200100:147"/> already cited from STRABO and
others, of the <hi>muſical Conteſt</hi> eſtabliſhed at DELPHI, which in
Time branched out into the <hi>Pythian</hi> Games, as we have found the firſt
rude Form of <hi>Tragedy</hi>; ſo now we ſhall find likewiſe a faint
Outline of the firſt rude Form of <hi>Comedy.</hi> For it appears, that
APOLLO with his Choir, and his Worſhipers in after-times, not only
repreſented his Victory, and ſung a Paean in Conſequence of it (in which
Union we ſee the firſt rude Form of Tragedy) but likewiſe, in the Way of
Ridicule they repreſented the <hi>Hiſſes</hi> of the dying Serpent, and

            <p n="4">4. "While the ſalutary Principles of Legiſlation
pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed, Comedy, thus formed, was little encouraged by the Leaders of the
State." The Authority of ARIS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TOTLE is clear and deciſive on this Point. 
<q rend="inline">"Comedy remained obſcure and unknown, becauſe
little Regard was had to it from the Beginning; the Magiſtrate being late in
appointing it a Choir."</q> He aſſigns no Reaſon for this Conduct of the
Magiſtrate: But a ſufficient <pb n="145" facs="tcp:0964200100:148"/> Reaſon appears to be

<q rend="inline">"For the grander Kinds of Poetry containing the

            <p n="5">5. "There was a provident Community, of Principles uncommonly

ſhall now ſee the admirable Conſiſtency of their Conduct, with
Reſpect to the very Beginnings of <hi>Comedy,</hi> when it firſt dawned
among them in the Verſes of ARCHI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LOCHUS. 
<q rend="inline">"The <hi>Spartans</hi> ordered the Writings of
ARCHILOCHUS to be baniſhed from their City, becauſe they thought the

were then admitted. See SUIDAS, ATHE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NAEUS, and other Authors of the later
Periods.</note>."</q>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. "In the Republic of ATHENS, which was of more relaxed
Principles, where this Comedy had been tolerated, a general Corruption of
Manners took Place <pb n="146" facs="tcp:0964200100:149"/> among the People: The corrupt People
overpowered the Magiſtrates; aſſumed to themſelves the Reins of
Government, and on this Foundation the old Comedy aroſe into Credit, had a
Choir appointed by the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, and was publicly eſtabliſhed." This
was the natural and neceſſary Conſequence of the Power of a corrupt
People. For the upright Magiſtrates being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, and the Creatures of
this corrupt People ſeated in their Place, <hi>that</hi> Comedy was now
authorized by Law, which was moſt accommodated to the Vices and Taſte of a
diſſolute Populace.</p>
            <p>Theſe Cauſes clearly account for the Eſtabliſhment of the
old Comedy, at that very Period when it took Place. But as other Cauſes, void
of all Foundation, have been aſſigned for this, by various Authors; it will
be neceſſary to prove the Truth of the Cauſes here alledged, from the
Authority of the Greek Writers.</p>
            <p>PLATO, in the Paſſage cited above<note n="k" place="bottom">

               </note>, gives us the Hiſtory
of the Corruption of the People, and of Muſic; but in ſuch general Terms,
that, without ſome farther Evidence, it is impoſſible clearly to fix the
Time when, or the Means by which, this Change was brought about, ſo fatal to
the Republic of <hi>Athens.</hi> It happens fortunately, that PLUTARCH hath
recorded the Event with ſuch Particularity of Circumſtance, as leaves no
Room to doubt on this Subject. PERICLES was the Man, who for his own private
Ends of Popularity, effected this ruinous Change: For 
<q rend="inline">"By giving the People the Plunder and
Poſſeſſion of the Lands taken from the Enemy, and by 
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:0964200100:150"/> ſquandering the public Monies (formerly reſerved for
the Uſes of War) in SHEWS and PLAYS for their <hi>Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment,</hi> and by
Grants of Largeſſes and Penſions, he changed them from a ſober,
modeſt, and thrifty People, who maintained themſelves by their own Labour,
into a riotous and debauched Multitude; and thus rouſed them into ſedition

                  </note>."</q> From this Paſſage it is evident, that PERICLES
not only debauched the <hi>Athenian</hi> People; but that the Exhibition of
Plays and Shews was one of the very Engines of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption<note n="m" place="bottom">Thus CICERO ſpeaks of the old Greek Comedy.—<q rend="inline">"Eſto: popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lares Homines, improbos, in

                  </q>—Where, we may
ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, the Judgment of CICERO is falſe concerning PERICLES: As it
ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that he was the firſt Corrupter of the People: And it ſeems to
have been a juſt Puniſhment, that he was laſhed by that illiberal Comedy,
which His own Influence firſt let in upon the State.</note>.—The
concurrent Teſtimony of XENOPHON clears the whole Affair; and gives as a full
View of the Conſequences of this general Corruption, ſo far as the <hi>old
Comedy</hi> is concerned. For in his Diſcourſe on the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi>
Republic, he informs us, 1<hi>ſt,</hi> That, at the Period we have now fixed,

<q rend="inline">"The Body of the People expelled All Good Men from

That 
<q rend="inline">"they took the <hi>Gymnaſtic</hi> and

That 
<q rend="inline">"in their <pb n="148" facs="tcp:0964200100:151"/> Comedies they

            <p>Theſe Evidences are ſo clear and preciſe, as to leave no

            <p>Lord SHAFTESBURY hath greatly miſtaken this Matter in his

               <note n="o" place="bottom">

               </note>; and is as
careleſs or defec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive here in the Circumſtance of Erudition, as at other
times in that of Reaſoning. He ſeems in one Paſſage to attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute the
late Cultivation and Eſtabliſhment of the old Comedy to its being of more
<hi>difficult</hi> Compoſition than Tragedy: 
<q rend="inline">"In this Part (Tragedy) the Poets ſucceeded
ſooner than in Comedy, or the facetious Kind; as it was natural indeed to
ſuppoſe, ſince this was in reality the eaſieſt (eaſier) Manner of
the two."</q> This is deciding a doubtful Point by a mere Affirmation: For the
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative Difficulty of theſe two Kinds hath been treated at large by a
learned and moſt judicious Writer, who after a candid and profound
Diſcuſſion of the Queſtion, thinks it beſt to leave it undecided<note n="p" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>BRUMOY <hi>Theatre des Grecs,</hi> tom.
vi.</bibl>—This Queſtion hath indeed been ſaid, by a learned Writer,
to admit of a <hi>deciſive Anſwer,</hi> on this Principle; that 
<q rend="inline">"Tragedy, whoſe End is the <hi>Pathos,</hi>
produces it by <hi>Action,</hi> while Comedy produces its End, the
<hi>Humorous,</hi> by <hi>Character.</hi> Now it is much more difficult to
<hi>paint Manners,</hi> than to <hi>plan Action</hi>; becauſe That requires
the <hi>Philoſopher's Knowledge</hi> of <hi>human Nature</hi>; this, only the
<hi>Hiſtorian's Knowledge</hi> of <hi>human Events.</hi>"</q>—But in
the Courſe of this Argument, it ſeems entirely forgot, that the tragic
Poet's Province is not only to <hi>plan,</hi> but to <hi>paint</hi> too. Had he
no farther Taſk, than what depends on the mere <hi>Hiſtorian's
Knowledge</hi> of <hi>human Events,</hi> the Reaſoning would hold. But as it
is the firſt and moſt eſſential Effort of his Genius, in the
Conſtruction of a <hi>compleat</hi> Tragedy, to <hi>invent</hi> and
<hi>order</hi> a <hi>pathetic</hi> Plan, <hi>conſiſtent</hi> in all it's
Parts, and <hi>riſing</hi> towards it's <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletion</hi> by a
<hi>Succeſſion</hi> of Incidents which may <hi>keep up</hi> and continually
<hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe Terror</hi> or <hi>Pity</hi>; it is manifeſt, that the
<hi>Perfection</hi> of his <hi>Plan</hi> depends not on his mere <hi>hiſtoric
Knowledge</hi> of <hi>human Events,</hi> but on his <hi>philoſophic
Diſcernment</hi> of <hi>human Paſſions</hi>; aided by a <hi>warm</hi> and
<hi>enlarged Invention:</hi> Talents as rare, at leaſt, as the
<hi>Knowledge</hi> or <hi>Diſcernment</hi> of <hi>human
Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters.</hi>—If to this we add the ſubſequent Taſk, of giving
the <hi>high Colourings</hi> of <hi>Paſſion</hi> to the tragic
<hi>Plan</hi> thus <hi>ordered,</hi> the <hi>Difficulty</hi> of writing a
compleat <hi>Tragedy</hi> may ſeem to be in ſome Reſpects <hi>equal,</hi>
in others <hi>ſuperior</hi> to that of producing a compleat <hi>Comedy:</hi>
For in the <hi>Conduct</hi> of this laſt Species, it is acknowledged, that a
<hi>ſmall Degree</hi> of <hi>poetic Invention</hi> will <hi>ſupport</hi>
it.</note>. The noble Writer, next, ſeems to attribute the late Cultivation
of Comedy to 
<q rend="inline">"the Spirit of literary Criticiſm, which in the
Nature <pb n="149" facs="tcp:0964200100:152"/> of things could not ariſe, till it had
Materials to work on; and This he ſuppoſeth to have been the <hi>falſe
Sublime</hi> of their <hi>Tragedies,</hi> which were often <hi>parodied</hi> in
the <hi>old Comedy.</hi>"</q>—But neither can this Cauſe be
ſufficient to account for the Effect; becauſe it appears that the beſt
Men, as well as the beſt Tragedies, were parodied or ridiculed more commonly
than the worſt. Of this, the Fate of SOCRATES may ſtand as a convincing
Proof. This Fact could not entirely eſcape the Notice of the noble Writer;
for he acknowledges, that 
<q rend="inline">"even this <hi>Remedy</hi> it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf was found to
turn into a <hi>Diſeaſe</hi>
                  <note n="r" place="bottom">
                     <bibl>P.
248.</bibl>
                  </note>."</q> But we have already proved, that it was a Diſeaſe
even on its firſt Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. In a Word, the Authorities given above, in
Support of the true Cauſes of the Cultivation and Eſtabliſhment of the
old Greek Comedy at ATHENS, contain the cleareſt Proof that the noble
Writer's Deductions on this Subject are <hi>ſpecious,</hi> but <hi>not
ſolid</hi>; and that he diſcovers but little of what he ſeems to value
ſo much, 
<q rend="inline">"a Comprehenſion of <pb n="150" facs="tcp:0964200100:153"/> ancient
Manners and ancient Hiſtory."</q>—But, what is odd enough, after having
ſeparately aſſigned theſe ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Cauſes as being each the
Foundation on which the old Comedy aroſe and was eſtabliſhed, He at
length glances accidentally upon the true one: Yet manifeſtly without any
particular Knowledge of the Facts which ſupport it. 
<q rend="inline">"According to this <hi>Homerical</hi> Lineage of
Poetry, <hi>Comedy</hi> would naturally prove the <hi>Drama</hi> of
<hi>lateſt Birth.</hi> For though ARISTOTLE cites HOMER's <hi>Margites</hi>
as analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gous to <hi>Comedy,</hi> yet the <hi>Iliad</hi> and
<hi>Odyſſey,</hi> in which the heroic Style prevails, having been ever
<hi>higheſt in Eſteem,</hi> were likelieſt to be <hi>firſt wrought and
cultivated</hi>

                  </note>."</q> We may conclude, then, upon the Authority
of the three great Ancients cited above, that 
<q rend="inline">"the Cultivation and <hi>Eſtabliſhment</hi> of
the old <hi>Greek Comedy</hi> aroſe from the united <hi>Corruption</hi> and
<hi>Power</hi> of the <hi>Athenian</hi> Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple."</q>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. "The Ridicule and Invective of their Comedy, thus
eſtabliſhed, was pointed chiefly againſt thoſe Magiſtrates or private
Men, whoſe Qualities were hateful to the debauched Populace." For the Proof
of this, the Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is referred to the Paſſages already cited from PLATO,
and XENOPHON: And on this Solution, the Fate of SO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CRATES is clearly accounted
for. Nor could any thing be more natural, if the Cauſes here aſſigned for
the Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of the old Comedy be true. 
<q rend="inline">"For Corruption being now eſtabliſhed, as it
were, by Law: that is, by the Voice of a degenerate People, which ſtood in
the Place of Law; the Poets found it neceſſary to gratify the People's
Vices, as the ſureſt Road to Succeſs; and <pb n="151" facs="tcp:0964200100:154"/> the only
Road to this, was now by the <hi>Ridicule</hi> of <hi>Virtue.</hi>"</q>
            </p>
            <p n="8">8. "A Tyranny ſuddenly erected itſelf on the Ruins of the
corrupt <hi>Athenian</hi> People, and at once ſilenced this Species of
Comedy." This Event happened on the taking of ATHENS by LYSANDER; and thro' the
Authority of the thirty Tyrants whom he eſtabliſhed there. Theſe
<hi>Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſors</hi> did That from <hi>Fear,</hi> which <hi>upright</hi>
Magiſtrates would have done from <hi>Virtue.</hi> The plain Reaſon hath
been aſſigned above: 
<q rend="inline">"Becauſe every thing hateful to the People being
now the eſtabliſhed Subject of the comic Muſe, the Tyrants who had
deſtroyed the public Liberty, muſt expect to become the Subject of Comedy,
if permitted to revel in its former Licentiouſneſs."</q> Here again the
noble Author of the Characteriſtics ſeems to aſſign a fictitious
Cauſe for this Event, drawn from his own Conjectures, inſtead of Hiſtory.

<q rend="inline">"Nothing could have been the Cauſe of this gradual
Reform in the Commonwealth of Wit, beſide the real Reform of Taſte and
Humour in the Commonwealth or Government itſelf."</q>—For, ſaith he, 
<q rend="inline">"it <hi>little concerned</hi> the <hi>Foreigners in
Power</hi> (the thirty Tyrants) after what Manner thoſe <hi>Citizens</hi>
treated <hi>one another</hi> in their <hi>Comedies</hi>; or what ſort of Wit

250.249.</bibl>
                  </note>."</q> It can hardly be neceſſary to point out, in
what Circumſtance this Reaſoning is defective. Had the private Citizens
buffooned <hi>each other only</hi> in their <hi>Comedies,</hi> the <hi>Thirty
Tyrants</hi> would indeed have had little to fear: But as it is evident, that
the <hi>public Magiſtrates,</hi> and their <hi>Conduct,</hi> had been the
ſtanding <pb n="152" facs="tcp:0964200100:155"/> Objects of theatrical Ridicule, it certainly
<hi>much concerned</hi> theſe <hi>Foreigners in Power,</hi> to prevent that
ſarcaſtic Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of their oppreſſive Government, which they
muſt neceſſarily expect from the keen Spirit of an exaſperated and
licentious People. The noble Writer endeavours to confirm his Opinion by a
parallel Inſtance drawn from the <hi>Roman</hi> Commonwealth; where a
ſimilar Prohibition took Place with regard to the <hi>Atellane</hi> Fables,
at a Time, when no Effects of foreign 
<q rend="inline">"Power, or of a home Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny can be pretended<note n="u" place="bottom">
                     <bibl>P. 251.</bibl>
                  </note>."</q> But this Inſtance,
joyned to the Evidences already given on the Subject, inſtead of confirming,
overturns his Syſtem: It only proves what was alledged above, that the
<hi>Athenian Tyrants</hi> did that from <hi>Fear,</hi> which the <hi>Roman
Magiſtrates</hi> did from <hi>Virtue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="9">9. "The Poets found a Subterfuge, for the Gratification of the
People; and continued to repreſent real Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters under feigned Names."
Thus the <hi>middle Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy</hi> was naturally eſtabliſhed. For this was
the only Species which they could now purſue with any Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of
<hi>Succeſs:</hi> And this was continued without much <hi>Danger,</hi> as we
find they were cautious with Reſpect to the Perſons of the
Tyrants.—That ſuch was the true Origin of this Change in the Character
of the Greek Comedy, appears farther from the two following Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations.
Firſt, there is not the leaſt Reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Athenian People were
at all changed from their coarſe Manners and profligate Character, at the
Time when the old Comedy was ſilenced: And ſecondly, by the Accounts left
concerning the Genius of the <hi>mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle Comedy,</hi> it appears, that it was
in all Reſpects as <pb n="153" facs="tcp:0964200100:156" rendition="simple:additions"/> illiberal and buffooning, in
its Beginnings as the old Comedy had been; the ſingle Circumſtance of
<hi>nominal Deſignation</hi> only accepted.</p>
            <p n="10">10. "A great <hi>Conqueror</hi> aroſe: And, by ſubduing a
Variety of Nations, opened a <hi>Communication</hi> between the Commonwealth of
ATHENS, and the <hi>eaſtern</hi> King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms which were of more
<hi>luxurious</hi> and <hi>refined</hi> Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners: On this Event, the
<hi>ſecond</hi> or <hi>middle</hi> Species of <hi>Comedy</hi> naturally
received a <hi>Poliſh</hi>; and, laying aſide the indirect perſonal
Invective, aſſumed the more delicate Form of general Raillery; and became a
Picture of human Life." The learned Reader will eaſily ſee, that ALEXANDER
<hi>the Great</hi> is the Conqueror here alluded to: in his Reign it was, and
not till that late Period, that the <hi>middle</hi> Comedy was poliſhed into
the <hi>new.</hi> This was the natural Effect of that Politeneſs, which was
introduced at ATHENS by a frequent and familiar Commerce with the effeminate
Nations of the Eaſt. Till then, although the <hi>Athenians</hi> juſtly
boaſted a Superiority in the <hi>Arts,</hi> yet in their Converſe and
Treatment of each other, the concurrent Authority of ancient Hiſtorians, as
well as the more certain Teſtimony of their own remaining Comedies,
aſſure us, that they were of an <hi>illiberal</hi> and <hi>buffooning</hi>
Turn. But no ſooner were the <hi>Aſiatic</hi> Luxuries and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finements
brought to ATHENS, by the Conqueſts of ALEXANDER, than their coarſe Manners
melted gradually into falſe Politeneſs and Effeminacy. Now, 
<q rend="inline">"one of the firſt Effects of a growing
Politeneſs, is to avoid all Occaſions of Offence; and this, without
Reſpect to any Conſequences, either good or bad, which may affect 
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:0964200100:157" rendition="simple:additions"/> the Public; but merely from a ſelfiſh Regard
to the Opinion of <hi>Elegance,</hi> and the Pride of
<hi>Urbanity.</hi>"</q>
            </p>
            <p>This Reaſoning coincides in all Reſpects with the laſt
Progreſſion of Comedy at ATHENS: And thoſe Writers, as Lord SHAFTESBURY
and the Author of the Life of HOMER, who have attempted to reſolve the
Eſtabliſhment of the new Comedy into a <hi>Reform</hi> or
<hi>Improvement</hi> of Manners, in a <hi>virtuous</hi> Senſe, have
miſtaken <hi>Shadows</hi> for <hi>Realities,</hi> and confounded
<hi>Decency</hi> with <hi>Virtue.</hi> For it is certain, that both private and
public Virtue were at the loweſt Ebb, while Comedy was aſſuming its
<hi>new</hi> and finiſhed Form. This we are aſſured of by the concurrent
Teſtimony of PLUTARCH, JUSTIN, and other ancient Writers: Even ſo far were
the <hi>Athenians</hi> from regarding the public Welfare or Defence of their
Country, that it was made a capital Crime for any Man to propoſe the
Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtabliſhment of their Militia, or the Application of the public Funds
to its Maintenance<note n="w" place="bottom">

was ſliding in, to ſupplant the rougher Appearances of <hi>Virtue.</hi> We

too generally

            <head>SECT. VIII. Of the natural Union and Progreſſions of Melody
and Song, in other European Countries.</head>
            <p>THUS we have traced the Progreſſion of the ancient
<hi>Greek</hi> MUSIC in all its Branches, through the various Stages of their
Union and Power, down to their final Separation and Corruption in the later
Periods. As a Confirmation of the eſſential Principles offered in this
Diſcourſe, let us now conſider this natural Union and Progreſſion, as
it hath appeared in other Nations, where theſe Arts never arrived at ſo
compleat a Form; where the Progreſſion ceaſed before any high Degree of
Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection came on, either through a Want of improving Lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature, or by
other Obſtructions from internal or external Cauſes.</p>
            <p>The neareſt Approach we can make to the ſavage State, in any
Inſtance drawn from the Records of Antiquity, ſeems to be found in the
Hiſtory of the <hi>Curetes,</hi> or <hi>Cory<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bantes</hi> of the Iſland of
CRETE. STRABO and DIODORUS, who give us their Hiſtory, deſcribe them as
barbarous Tribes of Men, living among Caves and Mountains, at once
<hi>Warriors, Prieſts, Poets,</hi> and <hi>Muſicians</hi>; who cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated
their public Feſtivals with enthuſiaſtic and clamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Muſic, Song,
and Dance, accompanied with Drums, Cymbals, and other noiſy Inſtruments,
almoſt in the very Manner of the ſavage Iroquois<note n="x" place="bottom">

<hi>Egyptian</hi> Legiſlation. After MINOS, THALES aroſe: In whom we find
the united Characters of Legiſlator and Muſician: He compoſed Laws, for
the <hi>Cretan</hi> State, and ſung them to his Lyre<note n="y" place="bottom">As THALES ſucceeded RHADAMANTHUS and MINOS, who had
<hi>both</hi> copied the EGYPTIAN Forms of Legiſlation; his compoſing
<hi>Laws</hi> in <hi>Verſe</hi> could only be the Effect of mere
<hi>Imitation.</hi>
               </note>. But Muſic being fixed to certain Forms by Law, we
are not to wonder that its Progreſſion ſtopped, as at SPARTA; which
Commonwealth was modelled on the rigorous Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of CRETE.</p>
            <p>With Reſpect to EGYPT, the Beginnings of that famous Kingdom are
ſo loſt in its Antiquity, that we know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the firſt Advances
there made in <hi>Muſic</hi> from its original Savage State. We only read,
that in ſome early Period of Civilization its Forms were unalterably fixed by
Law, and therefore all <hi>Improvement</hi> and <hi>Corruption</hi> alike
<hi>prevented.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the more <hi>northern</hi> Nations of <hi>Europe,</hi> it is
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, that we know little of them from ancient Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory till the
ſecond Period of Muſic commenced, that is, till the <hi>Legiſlator's</hi>
Character had been <hi>ſeparated</hi> from that of the <hi>Muſician.</hi>
The cleareſt Inſtance of the Union of the <hi>Legiſlator's</hi> and

honoured among the <hi>Scythian</hi> or <hi>Daniſh</hi> Tribes: That their

<hi>peaceable</hi> Species of Legiſlation. For STRABO tells us, that 
<q rend="inline">"throughout the whole Diſtrict of GAUL, there are
three Kinds of Men, who are held in ſingular Honour: The <hi>Bards,</hi> the

               </note>.</p>
            <p>Of the Genius of thoſe <hi>Britiſh Bards</hi> who inhabited the
northern Diſtricts of the Iſland, we have a noble Proof in the Poems lately
publiſhed under the Name of OSSIAN. Theſe appear to have been compoſed
and ſung, during the ſecond Period of Muſic; that is, when the Bard's
Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion <pb n="159" facs="tcp:0964200100:162"/> had ſeparated from that of the
Legiſlator, yet ſtill retained its Power and Dignity in full Union. For
OSSIAN, the declared Author of the Poems, was the Son of the royal FINGAL,
accompanied him in his Wars, and ſung his Atchievements to the Harp. Theſe
Poems give a noble Confirmation to many of the Principles ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced in this
Analyſis. They are of various Forms; though none of them properly unmixed.
The <hi>Song,</hi> in the Days of this ſublime and original Bard, appears
evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently to have worn the <hi>inartificial</hi> and <hi>mixed</hi> Forms of
Compoſition, which we have found generally and of Courſe to prevail in the
early Periods. Thus, FINGAL is chiefly <hi>Epic</hi>; yet the <hi>hymnal</hi>
Species abounds in it: Others are <hi>dramatic</hi>; yet in theſe, the
<hi>narrative</hi> often takes Place: Others, again, are in the Form of
<hi>Odes</hi>; yet even theſe are ſtrongly mixed and marked with the
<hi>Epic</hi> and <hi>dramatic</hi> Manner<note n="f" place="bottom">As theſe
Circumſtances are internal Proofs of the <hi>Antiquity</hi> of the Poems;
ſo there are other collateral Evidences of the ſame Nature, which ſeem
clearly to confirm it. Such are the grand Simplicity of Imagery and Diction,
the ſtrong Draughts of rude Manners and uncultivated Scenes of Nature, which
abound in all theſe Poems; Pictures, which no civilized Modern could ever
imbibe in their Strength, nor conſequently could ever throw out. Such, again,
are the frequent Alluſions (wrought into the very Eſſence of the Poems)
to the Principles of the old <hi>Celtic</hi> Religion, which in ancient times
had overſpread theſe Kingdoms: Of this Nature is That which the
Tranſlator calls the <hi>moſt extravagant Fiction</hi> in all OSSIAN's
Poems; I mean, the Battle between FINGAL, and the Ghoſt or Spirit of
LODA<note n="*" place="bottom">

                  </note>: Now this, though it carries the Appearance of
Extravagance, and ill-judged Improbability, yet, upon a nearer View, will be
ſound to contain an internal Evidence of the <hi>Antiquity</hi> of the Poem;
as it is drawn from the very Eſſence of the old <hi>Celtic</hi> Belief.
Thus ſpeaks the learned BARTHOLINE:—<q rend="inline">"Summa Audacia credebatur Lucta cum Spectris non

            <p>The <hi>Bards</hi> had eſtates ſettled on them, that they might
be free from worldly Cares: They lived in perfect In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependence, and were
obliged to no Service: Their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons were inviolable: To kill them, was

            <p>The Profeſſion was hereditary: But when the <hi>Bard</hi> died,
his Eſtate deſcended not to his eldeſt Son, but to the moſt

            <p>Thus inveſted with Honours, Wealth, and Power; and

Council of the Nobility and Gentry (for Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity being now planted in

Idleneſs and Hypocriſy. When the <hi>Principal Bards</hi> aſſembled in

this, their Number was leſſened and regulated: By the Advice of St. COLUM

            <p>'Tis to be obſerved, that in ſome unrecorded Period, a

            <p>However, we find that on the Extinction of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Increaſe
of Barbariſm in this Kingdom, the native Vigour of the poetic Stock again
ſhot up in a ſucceeding Age; and for Want of a proper Culture, was again
become one of the ruling Evils of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, in the Time of SPENSER; Who

as for Words to ſet off ſuch Lewdneſs, it is not hard for them to give a
goodly and painted ſhew thereunto, borrowed even from the Praiſes which are
proper to Virtue itſelf: As of a moſt notorious <hi>Thief</hi> and wicked
<hi>Outlaw,</hi> which had lived all his Life Time of <hi>Spoils</hi> and
<hi>Robberies,</hi> one of their <hi>Bardes</hi> in his Praiſe will ſay,
that he was none of the idle <hi>Milk-Sops</hi> that was brought up by the
<hi>Fire-ſide</hi>; but that moſt of his Days he ſpent in <hi>Arms</hi>
and valiant <hi>Enterpriſes:</hi> That he did never eat his Meat, before he
had won it with his Sword: That he lay not all Night ſlugging in a Cabin
under his Mantle; but uſed commonly to keep others waking to defend their
Lives; and did light his Candle at the Flames of their Houſes, to lead him in
the Darkneſs: That the Day was his Night, and the Night his Day: That he
loved not to be long wooing of Wenches to yield to him; but where he came, he
took by Force the Spoil of other Men's Love, and left but Lamentation to their
Lovers: That his Muſic was not the Harp, nor Lays of Love, but the Cries of
People, and the claſhing of Armour: And finally, that he died, not bewailed
of many, but made many wail when he died, that dearly bought his
Death."—"I have cauſed divers of theſe Poems to be tranſlated unto

Whence ſome of the Hiſtorians ſeem to gueſs that it hath degenerated;

certain <hi>Separations</hi> have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued, ſimilar to thoſe which took
Place in ancient GREECE: Any of which Cauſes muſt naturally deſtroy its
Force.</p>
            <p>It appears, however, that the Progreſſion had advanced ſo far
in ſome former Period, prior to CONFUCIUS, as to produce <hi>dramatic
Repreſentation,</hi> mixed with <hi>Song:</hi> And <pb n="169" facs="tcp:0964200100:172"/> in
Conformity, to the Principles given above, we find, that as they regard not the
<hi>Unities</hi> of Action, Place, or Time, ſo neither is any <hi>continued
Choir</hi> in uſe; though there be manifeſt Remains of it in their
<hi>Plays:</hi> For at the Concluſion of Scenes or Acts, as well as at other
Times when a <hi>pathetic</hi> Circumſtance occurs, the Perſons of the
Play, inſtead of <hi>declaiming,</hi> begin to <hi>ſing.</hi> The
<hi>Prologue</hi> reſembles that uncouth one of GREECE, that is, he tells you
<hi>who</hi> he is, and <hi>what</hi> is his <hi>Errand.</hi> All their Plays
have a <hi>moral</hi> or <hi>political</hi> Direction, ſuited to the Genius
of the People and the State. They know not the Difference between
<hi>Tragedy</hi> and <hi>Comedy</hi>; another Circumſtance which confirms the
Principle given above, concerning the true Riſe and Diſtinction of theſe
two Kinds in GREECE: For the <hi>Chineſe,</hi> as they have ever been of a
<hi>timid</hi> and <hi>peaceable</hi> Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, ſo neither are they given
to <hi>Raillery</hi> or <hi>Sarcaſm,</hi> but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together to
<hi>Civility</hi> and mutual <hi>Reſpect.</hi> Hence, neither the
<hi>Tragic</hi> nor <hi>comic</hi> Drama could probably ariſe, ſo as to be
marked as a <hi>diſtinct Species.</hi> Accordingly, their <hi>Plays</hi> are
generally of an <hi>intermediate</hi> Caſt, between <hi>Terror</hi> and
<hi>Pity</hi> on the one Hand, <hi>Sarcaſm</hi> or <hi>Ridicule</hi> on the
other. The "<hi>little Orphan</hi> of CHINA," indeed, which is given as a
Specimen by DU HALDE, borders on the <hi>tragic</hi> Species: But this Play is
but one of a hundred, moſt of which are of a different Caſt; and was
ſelected by him, becauſe he thought it the beſt adapted in its Genius, to
the Spirit and Taſte of the <hi>Europeans:</hi> For he tells us expreſly,
that the general Character of their Plays are altogether different from this;
that they are commonly of a <hi>middle</hi> Kind, and neither <hi>Tragedy</hi>
nor <hi>Comedy.</hi> Another Circumſtance of the Progreſſion muſt be
marked; which <pb n="170" facs="tcp:0964200100:173"/> is, that their <hi>Actors</hi> are a
<hi>ſeparate</hi> Rank from their <hi>Poets</hi>; that they are formed into
<hi>Companies,</hi> and have loſt their original Dignity of Office and
Character.</p>
            <p>In the ancient Kingdom of PERU, the Progreſſion of
<hi>Muſic</hi> had reached the ſame Period, though ſomewhat different in
its Circumſtances. GARCILASSO DE LA VEGA informs us, that their fabulous
Songs were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable; that he had heard many, and learnt ſome of them,
from his Anceſtors, who were the laſt of the royal Family of the INCAS.
They were of various Kinds, founded on a Variety of Paſſion, religious,
warlike, and amorous. They had invented a Kind of <hi>unequal Pipe,</hi> formed
of Reeds of different Lengths, preciſely the ſame with that of ancient
GREECE. They had alſo a Species of Flute, with four or five Stops: Their
Muſic was ſimple, like that of all unpoliſhed Countries. Their INCAS or
<hi>Chiefs</hi> had been <hi>Poets</hi> or <hi>Muſicians</hi> in the early
Periods; and the Author of the Commentaries gives a Poem com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by one of
them, which bears all the Marks of a ſpirited and ſavage Original. They had
their <hi>dramatic</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations, in Part <hi>reſembling,</hi> and
in Part <hi>differing</hi> from thoſe of the <hi>Chineſe.</hi> Their
Manners and Character, <hi>brave</hi> though not <hi>ferocious,</hi> had
naturally produced <hi>Tragedy,</hi> though of a Kind rather <hi>grand</hi>
than <hi>terrible</hi>

               </note>. But their <hi>mild Temper,</hi> in Time of <hi>Peace</hi>
little given to <hi>Sarcaſm,</hi> ſeems to have <hi>prevented</hi> the
Birth of <hi>Comedy.</hi> GARCI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LASSO, indeed, divides their <hi>Drama</hi>
into <hi>Tragedy</hi> and <hi>Comedy:</hi> But this was manifeſtly the Effect
of his own preconceived Opinions, and aroſe from a Habit of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
all <hi>dramatic</hi> Compoſition as belonging to one <pb n="171" facs="tcp:0964200100:174"/>
of theſe <hi>Species.</hi> For he tells us that 
<q rend="inline">"their <hi>Tragedies</hi> repreſented their
military Exploits; the <hi>Triumphs, Victories,</hi> and <hi>heroic
Actions</hi> of their renowned Men: And the Subject or Deſign of their
Comedies was to demonſtrate the Manner of good <hi>Huſbandry</hi> in
<hi>culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vating</hi> and manuring their <hi>Fields,</hi> and to ſhew the

of which two Circumſtances may ſeem to conſtitute the
<hi>Eſſence</hi> of <hi>true Comedy.</hi> Theſe Plays were
<hi>compoſed</hi> by the <hi>Amautas</hi> or <hi>Bards,</hi> whoſe Office
was ſeparated from that of the INCAS, but ſtill held in Honour, as in other
barbarous Polities. But in another Reſpect, the Progreſſion was different
from that in CHINA. The <hi>Actors</hi> maintained the original Dignity which
they had held in the early Periods: For the <hi>Lords</hi> and

            <p>To theſe we may add one Inſtance more, concerning the natural
Union and Progreſſion of Muſic and Poetry: An Inſtance leſs known,
yet more ſingular than any of theſe already given. When the <hi>Chriſtian

found a Sect called the "<hi>Chriſtians of St.</hi> THOMAS," living in great

<pb n="172" facs="tcp:0964200100:175"/> found theſe Chriſtians, as well as the Pagans of the
Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, poſſeſſed of rude <hi>Muſic</hi> and <hi>Poetry,</hi> in
their <hi>natural Union</hi> and <hi>Power.</hi> They acquieſced in the
Application of theſe Arts, already made by the Chriſtian Tribe, and
wiſely laid hold of their Influence, for the Converſion of the Pagan
Natives. Under theſe Circumſtances, the following Accounts will appear
natural and probable, on the Principles already delivered.</p>
            <p>Firſt, it appears that the general and Fundamental Practice of
<hi>ſinging</hi> the <hi>Praiſe</hi> of <hi>great Men,</hi> had been
maintained from the moſt ancient Times. In Conſequence of this, 
<q rend="inline">"The Synode being ended, the Partiſans of the

to Poſterity by this Kind of Poem all the moſt remarkable Events. The Song
was caught and immediately diſperſed every where; and during the Viſits
which the Prelate made, the People ſung it in his Preſence; which together
with their <hi>Dances</hi> and <hi>Muſic</hi> made the chief Part of his

            </p>
            <p>The religious <hi>Song</hi> and <hi>Dance</hi> were no leſs
remarkably and ſingularly maintained in a Kind of imperfect <hi>Union,</hi> 
               <pb n="173" facs="tcp:0964200100:176"/> as they had been transfered from <hi>Pagan</hi> Objects

            <p>The Miſſionaries who have viſited the oppoſite Coaſt of
COROMANDEL, give us Proof, that the <hi>Progreſſion</hi> of
<hi>Muſic</hi> and <hi>Poetry</hi> had not ſtopped at this early Period,
but advanced to <hi>theatrical Repreſentation</hi>; which, we ſhall ſee,
they were bold enough to apply even to the great Purpoſe of
<hi>Converſion.</hi> 
               <q rend="inline">"In this Country they have an extreme Paſſion
for the <hi>Theatre.</hi> Good Poets are held in great <hi>Veneration</hi>
among this People, who are by no means of a barbarous Caſt. In INDIA, Poetry
enjoys the Favour of the Great. They give its young Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors the Honour
of the <hi>Palanquin,</hi> which is a very <pb n="174" facs="tcp:0964200100:177"/> high
Diſtinction. The <hi>Theatre,</hi> which was prepared near our Church, was of

            <p>LET us now, in Concluſion, analyze the State of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lody and Song,
among the ancient <hi>Hebrews.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The leading Singularity of this extraordinary People was their
Rejection of Idolatry, and their eſtabliſhed Worſhip of the <hi>one</hi>
GOD, the <hi>Creator</hi> of the World. As this Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance gave a peculiar
Colour to their <hi>Religion</hi>; ſo, upon the Principles of this
Diſſertation it will follow, that it muſt give a Peculiar Turn to their
<hi>Muſic</hi>; becauſe we have ſeen, that the Genius of the <hi>original
Muſic</hi> of every Country depends on its <hi>Religion</hi> as its chief
<hi>Baſis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In Conſequence of this Principle, their <hi>Song</hi> or
<hi>Poem</hi> was chiefly dedicated to the <hi>Celebration</hi> of the
<hi>true</hi> GOD, the <hi>Creator</hi> of all things: At other Times it is
compoſed of <hi>moral Exhortations,</hi> delivered as the Dictates of his
Will, or thrown out in prophetic Raptures concerning the great Intents of his
Providence.—Hence the <hi>Hymn, Ode,</hi> or poetic <hi>Rapture,</hi>
which we have found to be naturally the firſt Form of Compoſition among all
Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, appeared with unrivaled Splendor in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Poetry,
becauſe its <hi>Object</hi> is ſo much <hi>Superior</hi> to that of other
Nations: The one being no more than the limited and narrow Power of
ſuppoſed <hi>local Gods</hi>; the other, <pb n="176" facs="tcp:0964200100:179" rendition="simple:additions"/> the
Omnipotence and Wiſdom of an <hi>eternal</hi> and <hi>univerſal
Creator.</hi> Of this Diſtinction their <hi>Bards</hi> were fully
ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible. 
<q rend="inline">"As for the Gods of the Heathen, they are but
<hi>Idols</hi>; but it is the <hi>Lord,</hi> that <hi>made</hi> the
<hi>Heavens.</hi>"</q> The Book of Pſalms, the Lamentations, the Songs of
MOSES, DAVID, ISAIAH, and other Prophets, all written in Meaſure, and ſung
by thoſe who compoſed them, are ſo many ſtriking Inſtances of the
true and unequaled Sublime.</p>
            <p>With Reſpect to the <hi>Form,</hi> it may be obſerved, that
their <hi>Songs</hi> or <hi>Hymns</hi> are of that <hi>mixed</hi> Species which
naturally ariſeth firſt, before any Separations take Place, or produce the
ſeveral Species of Compoſition. Though the <hi>hymnal</hi> Form be chiefly
<hi>predominant,</hi> yet we find them frequently to be a Mixture of <hi>Ode,
Narration,</hi> and <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue</hi>; and thus they contain the Seeds or
Principles of the three great ſucceeding Kinds, of <hi>unmixed Ode,
Epic,</hi> and <hi>Tragedy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It may be regarded as an extraordinary Circumſtance, that this
firſt <hi>mixed</hi> Form of Compoſition ſhould have continued unchanged
for a Period of at leaſt a thouſand Years; and that from firſt to laſt
it ſhould never move forward, ſo as to produce the <hi>Epic</hi> and
<hi>Dramatic</hi> Species: But on Examination it will appear, that the ſame
Cauſe (the Worſhip of the one GOD) which produced the higheſt Degree of
Sublime in the <hi>hymnal</hi> Species, naturally <hi>checked</hi> the Courſe
of poetry among the JEWS; and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented that <hi>Progreſſion</hi> which we
have found to ariſe from the natural State of Things, in <hi>Pagan</hi>
Countries.</p>
            <p>With Reſpect to the <hi>Epic</hi> Poem, we have ſeen that, in
its firſt and original Conception and Formation, it is no 
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:0964200100:180"/> other than 
<q rend="inline">"A fabulous Hiſtory, rowling chiefly on the great
Actions of the Gods and Heroes of the Nation; and compoſed under certain
Limitations with Reſpect to its Manner, for the Ends of Pleaſure,
Admiration, and Inſtruction."</q> Hence, the <hi>true</hi> GOD being the
ſole Object of the Adoration of the HEBREWS, and their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords being the
ſacred Depoſitary of the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of his <hi>Providence,</hi> the
Truth of which it was deemed the higheſt Crime to violate; the Invention and
Conſtruction of an <hi>Epic Fable</hi> could never be the Reſult of a
natural and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taught Progreſſion.</p>
            <p>If the <hi>Epic</hi> Form was thus naturally prevented by the
Severity of Truth, the firſt Form of <hi>Tragedy,</hi> and <hi>dramatic
Exhibition</hi> muſt of Courſe be checked from the ſame Principle: For we
have ſeen that the native and original tragic Species is but an Union of the
Ode and Epic Fable, animated by perſonal Repreſentation. To this we may
ſubjoin, that an additional Abſurdity would here preſent itſelf: The
Abſurdity of cloathing the <hi>Deity</hi> in a viſible and <hi>human
Form:</hi> A Circumſtance ſtrictly forbidden by the <hi>Jewiſh</hi>
Law.</p>
            <p>If it be ſaid, that although theſe Reaſons are good, againſt
their introducing the <hi>Deity</hi> as the leading Subject either of
<hi>Epic</hi> or <hi>dramatic Fable,</hi> yet ſtill their <hi>Heroes</hi>
might have furniſhed Subjects for <hi>Both:</hi> We may reply, that all the
great Actions of their Heroes were ſo inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately connected with the
important Hiſtory of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, which this People were deſtined both to
<hi>execute</hi> and <hi>preſerve,</hi> that even <hi>Theſe</hi> became
improper Subjects for the Mixture and Alloy of Fable. And farther; The very
Tendency of Fancy towards ſuch a Progreſſion of <pb n="178" facs="tcp:0964200100:181"/>
Poetry was quenched <hi>here</hi> alſo, in its firſt Conception. For the
firſt and original Enthuſiaſms of an untaught Tribe are awakened by the
Belief, that their deceaſed Heroes are advanced to the Rank of <hi>Gods,</hi>
and ſtill main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their former <hi>Relation</hi> and <hi>Affection</hi> to
their native <hi>Country:</hi> Hence the Imagination is kindled by Hope of
their Favour and Aſſiſtance: Hence Adoration riſeth; flattering Fables
of their Power, Proweſs, and Atchieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, are invented; and the Genius of
<hi>Epic</hi> and <hi>Tragic</hi> Song is awakened into Action. But where (as
among the JEWS) their greateſt Men are repreſented as what they were, weak,
ignorant, and mortal; often humbled for their Sins; always under the Controul
of an over-ruling Providence; and after Death, loſt to every earthly
Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion; here, the firſt natural Enthuſiaſms of the Soul could meet
with no Objects to excite them: A Colliſion was wanting: And the artleſs
Mind, inſtructed only in ſacred Things, returned of itſelf to the unmixed
and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>artificial Celebration of the <hi>all-wiſe</hi> and
<hi>all-powerful</hi> GOD.</p>
            <p>As, from theſe Cauſes, the Forms of their <hi>Song</hi> never
had any Progreſſion; ſo, it ſeems probable, that their <hi>Melody</hi>
ſtood ſtill, in the ſame Manner. Its Application was chiefly to the
Service of Religion; and as their Hymn continued unchanged in its Genius, we
may reaſonably believe that the Melody which accompanied it, had the ſame
Fate. For though there was nothing particular ordained, with Reſpect to
Muſic, in the <hi>Moſaic</hi> Law; yet, where almoſt every other
Circumſtance relative to Worſhip was particularly preſcribed, this
Severity of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution would give a Kind of Sanctity to every ancient
Cuſtom that ſtood connected with it; and hence their Modes of Melody would
probably remain unchanged. <pb n="179" facs="tcp:0964200100:182" rendition="simple:additions"/> CLEMENS ALEXANDRINUS
informs us, that their Hymns were compoſed in the <hi>Dorian</hi> Mode<note n="g" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>STROMAT. l. vi.</bibl>
               </note>: Which, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it was, we
know to have been one of the moſt <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient,</hi> as well as
<hi>grave</hi> and <hi>ſedate</hi>; and therefore fit for the Service of the
Temple.—Their Inſtruments were various, but ſimple: That which DAVID
chiefly uſed, appears to have been the <hi>Nabla</hi> or <hi>Trigonon</hi>; a
three-cornered Inſtrument, of the <hi>Harp</hi>-Species. Its Compaſs we
know from his own Authority; and that it was an Inſtrument of <hi>ten
Strings.</hi> We may be aſſured, too, that his Melody was not only
ſimple, but ſingle: For he muſt have held his Harp with one Hand, and
played with the other, when he led the <hi>religious Dance</hi> before the
Ark.</p>
            <p>As their <hi>Song</hi> and <hi>Melody,</hi> ſo their
<hi>Dance</hi> ſeems to have been chiefly employed in the Service of
Religion. The moſt frequent Exerciſe of this religious Rite devolved upon
the Women. It appears too, that the Prophets had ſome Kind of <hi>ſolemn
Movements,</hi> ſuited to the State and Circumſtances of their divine
Enthuſiaſm: This Branch of the triple muſical Alliance ſeems (as in
other Countries) to have made the earlieſt Separation. It ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to have
been chiefly exerciſed by the lower Ranks, in the Time of DAVID: And hence it
was, that MICHAL, the Daughter of SAUL, like a true fine Lady, deſpiſed
that Monarch, for exerciſing a Mode of Piety, which in her Days was <hi>no
longer faſhionable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the united or complex Character of <hi>Legiſlator</hi> and
<hi>Bard,</hi> it is remarkable, that this was preſerved among the JEWS
through a longer Succeſſion of Ages than in any other Nation, from the
ſame Cauſe which prevented any <pb n="180" facs="tcp:0964200100:183"/> Progreſſion or
Change in the Forms of their Song: For the muſical Art being chiefly
exerciſed in the Praiſes of the true GOD, was in leſs Danger of being
<hi>corrupted,</hi> and therefore not only its <hi>Utility</hi> was longer
<hi>preſerved,</hi> but likewiſe its <hi>Profeſſors</hi> were in leſs
Danger of being <hi>debaſed,</hi> than in other Countries where trifling or
immoral Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications of the Art enſued. Conſequently, the Rulers of the
People could have no Temptation to quit any Part of that Character or Office,
which ſtill maintained its priſtine Uſe and Dignity. Accordingly, we
find, that from MOSES down to SOLOMON, during a Period of at leaſt a
thouſand Years, the <hi>complex</hi> Character of <hi>Legiſlator</hi> and
<hi>Bard</hi> often appeared in the moſt diſtinguiſhed Leaders of their
State, and from firſt to laſt remained unbroken. MOSES, their firſt great
Lawgiver, led the Song of Triumph, on the Overthrow of the <hi>Egyptians</hi>
in the <hi>Red-Sea</hi>
               <note n="h" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>EXODUS.</bibl>
               </note>:
MIRIAM, a diſtinguiſhed Propheteſs, led the female Dance and Choir, on
the ſame Occaſion<note n="i" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>Ibid.</bibl>
               </note>. While
the <hi>Judges</hi> ruled in ISRAEL, this complex Office ſtill remained:
DEBORAH is an Inſtance of this Truth: She <hi>judged</hi> ISRAEL; and ſung
her noble Song of Triumph, on the Death of SISERA and JABIN. We find, that
whoever was raiſed to the Station of a <hi>Judge,</hi> or <hi>Chief,</hi> was
commonly inveſted not only with the <hi>prophetic</hi> but the
<hi>bard-like</hi> Character: For we know, that the Prophets generally ſung
their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetic Raptures to the Harp<note n="k" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>1 SAM.
x.—1 CHRON. xxv.</bibl>
               </note>. In After-times, when SAUL was elected
<hi>King,</hi> he too aſſumed at once the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetic and muſical Office.
The Songs and bard-like Powers of DAVID, his <hi>kingly</hi> Succeſſor, are
too well known <pb n="181" facs="tcp:0964200100:184"/> to need an Illuſtration. The ſame
muſical and poetic Character maintained its Union with that of <hi>King,</hi>
in his Son SOLOMON; whoſe <hi>Songs,</hi> we are told, were no leſs than a
<hi>thouſand and five.</hi> After him the <hi>complex</hi> Office of
<hi>Legiſlator</hi> and <hi>Bard</hi> ſeems to have <hi>ſeparated:</hi>
The peculiar Cauſes which had ſo long upheld it in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi>
State, now began to ceaſe: For <hi>Idolatry</hi> more and more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed,
<hi>Manners</hi> became <hi>corrupt,</hi> and public Miſery and Ruin
enſued. The <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Bards</hi> were now no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger found in
the Courts of Kings, or among the Rulers of the People: Yet ſtill they
continued to throw out the Emanations of prophetic and moral Truth, accompanied
with the Enthuſiaſm of <hi>Song,</hi> in the more retired, and yet
uncorrupt Situations of private Life: And ſuch were the <hi>later
Prophets,</hi> whoſe Writings ſtill remain in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>As this appears to be a true Analyſis of the State of
<hi>Muſic</hi> among the ancient HEBREWS; it will now lead us to an eaſy
Solution of a Fact which hath been regarded as myſterious by ſome of the
Learned; 
<q rend="inline">"That while moſt other Nations had their
<hi>Bards</hi> or <hi>Poets</hi>; the JEWS, though their Compoſitions are
uncommonly ſublime, never had any <hi>Poets by Profeſſion,</hi> nor even
a Word in their Language which denotes the Character<note n="l" place="bottom">

&amp;c.</bibl>
                  </note>."</q> The Principles here given afford a clear Solution
of this Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity. Their <hi>Prophets</hi> were indeed their <hi>Bards</hi>;
and appear to have been inveſted with all the Dignity belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that
Office in its moſt honoured State. But as the Almighty GOD, and the great
Events of his <hi>Providence,</hi> 
               <pb n="182" facs="tcp:0964200100:185" rendition="simple:additions"/> were the
continued <hi>Object</hi> of their <hi>Songs</hi>; ſo, the <hi>poetic</hi> or
<hi>muſical</hi> Character was but <hi>ſecondary</hi> to the
<hi>religious:</hi> Therefore the Name of <hi>Bard</hi> was ſwallowed up and
loſt in the higher Title of

            <head>SECT, XI. Of the State of Muſic and Poetry in ancient
ROME.</head>
            <p>WE have now traced the Progreſs of <hi>Melody</hi> and
<hi>Song,</hi> through the moſt remarkable Periods of thoſe various
Nations, in which their <hi>Riſe, Union,</hi> and <hi>Progreſs</hi> was
<hi>native</hi> and <hi>original.</hi> Let us now view them in their more
<hi>weak, borrowed,</hi> and <hi>ſeparate</hi> State: This Inquiry will bring
us down to our own Times: And here we muſt occaſionally quit the ancient
Names of <hi>Melody</hi> and <hi>Song</hi>; and ſometimes adopt thoſe
Titles which the two Arts (now ſeparate) received in the later Ages of
GREECE, and which they have ever ſince retained among the poliſhed Nations
of EUROPE, I mean thoſe of MUSIC and POETRY.</p>
            <p>The firſt Flight which <hi>Muſic</hi> and <hi>Poetry</hi> took
from GREECE was to ROME: For in this imperial City, they were not
<hi>native.</hi> The Cauſes of this original Defect, together with the State
and Progreſſions of theſe Arts at ROME, on their Arrival from GREECE,
will make the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of this Section.</p>
            <p>The only Cauſe that hath been aſſigned for the Want of Muſic
and Poetry among the <hi>Romans</hi> in the early Ages of the Republic, hath
been 
<q rend="inline">"that their Attention to War and Conqueſt
ſwallowed up all other Regards; and <pb n="183" facs="tcp:0964200100:186"/> therefore Muſic
and Poetry were of courſe neglected."</q> This Reaſoning might hold, if
theſe Arts made no more than a mere <hi>Amuſement</hi> in the
<hi>early</hi> Ages, as they gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally do in the <hi>later</hi> Periods of a
State. But as it appears in the Courſe of this Diſſertation, that Melody
and Song are the natural Produce of ſavage Life, however warlike; that the
Continuance of this warlike Character tends ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to heighten than
extinguiſh their Power; and that the Hiſtory of human Nature confirms this
Truth; We muſt therefore ſeek for this peculiar Defect in ſome other, and
more hidden Cauſe.</p>
            <p>There is a Principle which relates to the Eſtabliſhment and
Character of <hi>Colonies,</hi> which will hereafter appear at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with
extenſive Conſequences, and which will aſſiſt us in unfolding the
true Foundation of this Defect.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Melody, Dance,</hi> and <hi>Song,</hi> being the natural Effects
of ſavage Manners continuing through ſeveral Ages, it muſt follow, that
<hi>Colonies</hi> will in general be found to poſſeſs them in a very
imperfect State. Fox <hi>Colonies</hi> are ſeldom ſent out, till that early
Period is paſt, when the <hi>Legiſlator's</hi> and <hi>Bard's</hi>
Character are <hi>united</hi> in the ſame Perſon. Hence, the
<hi>Leader</hi> of the new Colony not being poſſeſſed of the poetic and
muſical Enthuſiaſm, can neither have <hi>Ability</hi> nor
<hi>Inclination</hi> to inſtil or propagate theſe Arts among his Followers.
Thus the firſt leading Flame of Enthuſiaſm is quenched: And the inferior
Ranks, being buſied in the Affairs of their new Settlement, have not that
Leiſure which the unemployed ſavage State affords, to turn their Attention
on theſe natural Pleaſures: For Colonies of Men ſeldom depart from their
native Country, unleſs when driven by ſome Kind of <hi>Neceſſity:</hi>
And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <pb n="184" facs="tcp:0964200100:187"/> muſt betake themſelves, for
Subſiſtance, either to <hi>Induſtry</hi> or <hi>War.</hi> The laſt of
theſe was the chief Occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of the <hi>Roman</hi> State: And thus, not
becauſe they were a <hi>warlike</hi> People, but becauſe they were a
<hi>needy Colony,</hi> the <hi>muſical Arts</hi> which were ſo
<hi>powerful</hi> in <hi>early</hi> GREECE, were ſo <hi>weak</hi> in
<hi>early</hi> ROME.</p>
            <p>This Obſervation will hold true of moſt other Countries peopled
by foreign Nations after a certain Period of Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lization. Thus CARTHAGE was a
Colony which went out from TYRE: And <hi>Muſic,</hi> which was of Weight in
the <hi>native</hi> City, was of no Conſideration in the
<hi>deſcendant</hi> State. Thus again, the <hi>Iriſh, Welſh,</hi> and
<hi>Scots,</hi> are ſtrictly <hi>natives</hi>; and accordingly, have a
Muſic of <hi>their own:</hi> The <hi>Engliſh,</hi> on the contrary, are a
foreign Mixture of late-eſtabliſhed Colonies; and as a Conſequence of
this, have <hi>no native Muſic.</hi> He who would find the <hi>original
Muſic</hi> of ENGLAND, muſt ſeek it in WALES.</p>
            <p>Here, then, appears the true Cauſe of this Defect in the early
Ages of ROME. So ignorant were the <hi>Trojan</hi> Found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Empire in
the muſical Arts, that they had not even the firſt Rudiments of
<hi>Song:</hi> For we are told by a learned <hi>Roman,</hi> that when ENEAS
brought the Images of the Gods to Shore, 
<q rend="inline">"the <hi>Women howled</hi> and <hi>danced</hi> at
the Solemnity<note n="m" place="bottom">
                     <bibl>DIONYS. <hi>Halicarn.</hi> l. i. c.
55.</bibl>
                  </note>."</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Hiſtory of the muſical Arts in ROME confirms this general
Principle: Their Muſic and Poetry was always <hi>borrowed</hi> and
<hi>adopted:</hi> Let us trace its Progreſs through the ſeveral
ſucceeding ages.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="185" facs="tcp:0964200100:188"/>NUMA POMPILIUS firſt introduced theſe Arts
into the <hi>Roman</hi> religious Ceremonies. Had he been a <hi>Native</hi> of
ROME, he had been a clear Exception to the Principle here given: But inſtead
of overturning, he confirms it: For he was a retired, philoſophic, and
illuſtrious <hi>Sabine:</hi> And the <hi>Salian</hi> Prieſts which he
eſtabliſhed, were <hi>Muſicians</hi> or <hi>Bards,</hi> who had been
brought by EVANDER from ARCADIA into ITALY<note n="n" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>DIONYS. <hi>Hal.</hi> l. i.</bibl>
               </note>. Thus, the
<hi>Salian</hi> Songs were not <hi>native,</hi> but <hi>tranſplanted</hi>
into ROME.</p>
            <p>We find no farther Progreſs in the muſical and poetic Arts, for
many Ages: Save only, that a vague Rumour prevailed in the later Periods of the
Commonwealth, that in ancient Times it had been uſual to ſing the Praiſes
of great Men at Feaſts<note n="o" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>CICERO <hi>de Leg.</hi>
l. ii.</bibl>
               </note>.</p>
            <p>The next Progreſſion of the muſical Arts in ROME, was the
<hi>Adoption</hi> of the <hi>Thuſcan Shews:</hi> Theſe, as LIVY in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms

               </note>. The borrowed Flame was ſoon caught and ſpread among

            </p>
            <p>To theſe the <hi>Atellane</hi> Plays ſucceeded; being in the

the OSCI, a neighbouring Province: Both theſe, and the <hi>Thuſcan

no longer in their <hi>natural,</hi> but in an <hi>ingrafted</hi> State. The
firſt Idea, then, of <hi>Comedy</hi> was caught by <hi>Adoption</hi> in this

<hi>Imitators.</hi> And thus, contrary to the natural Courſe of Things (as we

<hi>Comedy</hi> had, by Accident, an Eſtabliſhment prior to

from the adopted Shews. But ſo little were theatrical Repreſentations the
Effect of Nature at ROME, and ſo much were they received as mere Shews of
<hi>Pleaſure</hi> and <hi>Amuſement,</hi> that even at this early Period an
unexampled <hi>Separation</hi> commenced; a Separation more abſurd than any
that had taken Place in GREECE. For now, 
<q rend="inline">"LIVIUS acting his own Play according to the

<hi>mute</hi> Action. We may ſafely pronounce it impoſſible that this
Separation could have come on, unleſs the theatric Repreſentations had
already degenerated into a mere <hi>Amuſement.</hi> When a <hi>ſlave</hi>

            </p>
            <p>However, the theatrical Shews in this Period ſeem to have had
little Effect; the Manners of the People con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing much the ſame with
thoſe of more ancient Times. After the Succeſſion of a few Ages, the
principal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions came on; and theſe aroſe from their
Acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with, and their Conqueſt of GREECE.</p>

borrow and adopt them, in that <hi>ſeparate, imperfect,</hi> and

            <p>With Reſpect to the <hi>Subjects</hi> of their <hi>Tragedy,</hi>
they were here no leſs mere Imitators. For although they had one Species in
which their own Great Men were the <hi>Heroes</hi> of the Poem, yet even this
was not original, but altogether built on the <hi>Grecian</hi> Model. But
farther, we learn from HORACE, that the moſt approved Subjects were thoſe
which were drawn from HOMER's Poems. He gives this as a Rule to the Poets of
his Time and <pb n="189" facs="tcp:0964200100:192" rendition="simple:additions"/> Country; 
<q rend="inline">"That to throw the Fables of the <hi>Iliad</hi> into
tragic Scenes is a ſafer and better Practice, than to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt Subjects yet
untouched."</q> A Paſſage which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains the cleareſt Proof, that
Tragedy was now ſeparated from its higheſt Purpoſes; and that the
<hi>great Ends</hi> of this <hi>Poem,</hi> which gave it ſo much
<hi>Power</hi> in GREECE, were utterly loſt to the Roman People.</p>
            <p>The primary Applications of <hi>Tragedy</hi> being thus little known
in ROME, even on its firſt Admiſſion; we cannot wonder that it became a
weak and languid Amuſement: Eſpecially, among a People whoſe Manners
were, now ſinking into That Character which tended to give <hi>Comedy</hi>
the Aſcendant, as in the declining Period of the <hi>Greek</hi> States. Thus
the true Cauſe appears, why <hi>Comedy</hi> was cultivated ſo much more
than <hi>Tragedy,</hi> in every Period of this Republic.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Ode</hi> or <hi>hymnal</hi> Species ſeems to have been as
ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually ſeparated from the Ends of <hi>Public Utility,</hi> as the
<hi>Tragic</hi> Poem. HORACE often declares his Inability to attempt any thing
<hi>Great</hi> in this Kind. The general Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of his Odes correſponds
much with his own Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent: They are always elegant, ſeldom majeſtic. His
<hi>Irreligion</hi> even <hi>diſqualified</hi> him from excelling in the

<hi>public State</hi> of ROME; yet theſe are always <hi>checked,</hi> and
made <hi>ſubſervient</hi> to the Favour of MAECENAS and AUGUSTUS. In a
Word, they are but <hi>ſecondary: Urbanity</hi> of Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<hi>Elegance</hi> of <hi>Phraſe,</hi> and of <hi>Compliment</hi> to his

<hi>Roman Epic</hi> Poem; notwithſtanding the inordinate Praiſes that have
been laviſhed on VIRGIL's <hi>Aeneid,</hi> it may with Truth be affirmed,
that neither the <hi>original</hi> nor <hi>legiſlative</hi> Spirit of ancient
GREECE appear with any uniform Splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor through the Courſe of this
celebrated Work. Elegant in Diction, a Maſter in Rythm and Numbers, nervous
in Figures, majeſtic in Deſcription, pathetic in tragic Inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,
ſtrong in the Delineation of Character, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed in all the
<hi>ſecondary Qualities</hi> of an <hi>Epic Poet</hi>; yet ſtill VIRGIL
wanted that all-comprehenſive Genius which alone can conceive and ſtrike
out a great original Epic Plan, no leſs than that independent Greatneſs of
Soul which was quenched by the <hi>ruinous Policy</hi> of the Times, and which
alone can animate true Genius to a full Exertion of its Powers in the Cauſe
of <hi>public Virtue</hi> and <hi>Mankind.</hi> Through the firſt of theſe
Defects, the <hi>Aeneid</hi> abounds with Inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents that are borrowed,
unconnected, broken, and ill-placed; through the ſecond, though here and
there the Spirit of <hi>general Legiſlation</hi> appears, yet the great
Subjects <hi>peculiarly relative</hi> to the <hi>Roman</hi> State, the
<hi>Glories</hi> of the <hi>Republic,</hi> the <hi>Atchievements</hi> of its

            <p>As both the <hi>Ode</hi> and <hi>Epic</hi> had thus degenerated from
their original Character in GREECE, ſo we ſhall find that the
<hi>Recitation</hi> of them kept Pace with this ſpurious Birth. We have
already ſeen, that in the more early Periods of the <hi>Greek</hi> Republics,
their Poems were <hi>ſung</hi> to the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounding Audience for the

               <hi>Morals,</hi>
and <hi>Polity.</hi> In ROME, as in the later Periods of GREECE, we find the
<hi>Song</hi> brought down to <hi>Recitation,</hi> and theſe <hi>great
Purpoſes</hi> ſwallowed up and loſt in the <hi>Vanity</hi> and
<hi>Self-Importance</hi> of the <hi>Poet.</hi> Hence we find their beſt
Writers declaring their Diſlike to the Practice of <hi>public
Recitation,</hi> becauſe Flattery was now become the Food of every reciting
Poetaſter. The whole Farce and Foppery of this Practice, which was indeed no
other than the ſpurious Iſſue of the old <hi>Grecian Song-Feaſt,</hi>
is given at large by VOSSIUS, to whom, for Brevity's Sake, we refer<note n="a" place="bottom">

            <p>The muſical Arts, being thus <hi>ſeparated,</hi> and

            <p>On the contrary, as Manners and Principles grew more profligate,
along with the inordinate growing Power and Luxuries of the Empire; ſo the
Genius of the <hi>poetic</hi> and <hi>muſical</hi> Arts kept Pace with them.
<hi>Poem,</hi> which in the Days of ancient GREECE had been the

            <p>In the later Periods the Miſchief grew ſtill more intolerable:
For now, the ſerious Arts were cultivated by Few: Nothing was heard but light
and effeminate Muſic: The Singer took the Philoſopher's Place; the
Libraries were ſhut up; and the general Attention was turned upon muſical
Inſtruments proper to accompany and ſuſtain the Geſticulation of the
Actors. The Effects of this Diſſolute Taſte ſoon appeared: For
QUINTILIAN tells us, that

ſtruggles hard to free herſelf from peccant and deadly Humours. This Time
was now come at ROME; but it came too late: The Body politic was expiring, and

the dying Empire. TOTILA attacked and pillaged ROME: The degenerate Arts ſunk

amidſt the Spoils of a ſubjected World, now begged before their own
Doors.</p>
            <p>The extravagant Paſſion of ſome of their later Emperors for
the muſical Arts, and theſe too of the moſt debauched and profligate
Characters, particularly CALIGULA and NERO, is too well known to need a
Delineation: This Eſſay is not intended as a <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of
<hi>Facts,</hi> but an <hi>Inveſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation</hi> of the <hi>Cauſes</hi> that
produced them. On this Subject, therefore, there is one Circumſtance which
may demand our attention. We have ſeen above, that the firſt original
Legiſlators turned their Attention ſtrongly on the muſical Arts; and we
now find, that the abandoned Rulers of a decaying Empire adopt them with no
leſs Eagerneſs: Doth not this Contrariety of Facts ſeem to ſhake ſome
of the Principles which we have attempted to eſtabliſh? So far from this,
that it confirms them: For in both In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, <hi>Muſic</hi> was made
<hi>ſubſervient</hi> to the <hi>Views</hi> or ruling <hi>Paſſions</hi>
of thoſe who <hi>led</hi> the People. The honeſt Legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lators of early
Times employed it for the Ends of public Utility; the profligate Emperors
abuſed it to the Purpoſes <pb n="194" facs="tcp:0964200100:197"/> of Licentiouſneſs.
Among the former, by a legitimate Uſe, it became the Inſtrument of
eſtabliſhing Common-wealths: Among the latter, by a perverted Application,
it ſhook the Foundations of Empire: ORPHEUS drew the barbarous Tribes, from
Theft, Adultery, and Murder, by his Songs and Lyre: NERO plundered his
Patricians of their Eſtates to load his Muſicians with Wealth; and amidſt
the forced Acclamations of a corrupted Theatre, violated a veſtal Virgin on
the Stage.</p>

<hi>Roman</hi> Empire.—But Mankind, emerging from the Ruins of
<hi>Luxury, Profligacy,</hi> and <hi>Invaſion,</hi> are of a different
Character from that of human Nature ariſing from mere <hi>Barbarity</hi> into
<hi>Civilization.</hi> We have traced the natural Progreſs of theſe Arts in
the <hi>laſt</hi> of theſe; but from the former, nothing conſiſtent or
ſteady can ariſe. The Views, Manners, Principles, and Paſſions of a
furious Conqueror, meeting and mixing with thoſe of a ſubdued and abandoned
People, produce ſuch a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound of diſſimilar and contending Cauſes,
as approach in their Effects to the Appearance of mere Chance or Fortune.</p>
            <p>But the Circumſtance moſt worth remarking is this, that in
ſuch a Period, all the natural Seeds and Principles of the muſical Arts are
loſt. The whole <hi>local</hi> Fabric of <pb n="195" facs="tcp:0964200100:198"/> 
               <hi>Religion,
Polity,</hi> and <hi>Morals,</hi> is commonly ſunk in the general Ruin; and a
barbarous Conqueror followed by an enraged Soldiery, who have left their own
Country to invade another, have generally the <hi>Vices</hi> of
<hi>Savages,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their <hi>Virtues.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hence the <hi>muſical</hi> Arts could not ariſe from the Ruins
of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, but from the ineffectual Principle of <hi>mere
Imitation.</hi> They wanted that <hi>native</hi> Force and Vigour which had
given them ſo free and full a Growth in ancient GREECE.</p>
            <p>Such therefore being the Birth of the <hi>modern Poetry</hi> and
<hi>Muſic</hi> of EUROPE; having been the caſual Offspring of the corrupted
<hi>Roman</hi> Arts, which were themſelves no more than partial Imitations of

            <p>This general Principle being given, we might perhaps end our Inquiry

Judgment of Mankind: But to give all poſſible Satisfaction on a Subject
which may by ſome be regarded as a Matter of Curioſity, we ſhall trace

as they have Relation to each other.</p>
            <p>Before the Roman Empire fell to Ruin, its Rulers took Care, to the
utmoſt of their Power, to extirpate the native Muſic of the barbarous
Countries which they conquered. Of this JULIUS CAESAR, AMMIANUS MARCELLINUS and
SUETONIUS inform us. This was a high Stroke of Policy: For their native Songs
being (as in ancient GREECE) the Repoſitory of their Religious and Political 
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:0964200100:199"/> Syſtem, nothing could ſo effectually
<hi>ſubdue</hi> the <hi>Minds</hi> of theſe Barbarians, as the Baniſhment
or Deſtruction of their <hi>Bards</hi> and <hi>Druids.</hi> We have already
ſeen Edward the Firſt of ENGLAND acting the ſame Tragedy in WALES, on the
ſame Principle.</p>
            <p>On the Revival of Learning, the three greater Kinds of
<hi>Poetry</hi> were, in many Inſtances, neceſſarily <hi>divorced</hi>
from <hi>Muſic.</hi> For the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Poets being
the only approved <hi>Models,</hi> could be read and imitated by <hi>Scholars
only.</hi> Thus, the <hi>Art</hi> which in ancient GREECE had been the genuine
Effect of natural Enthuſiaſm, and aided by a native and correſpondent
Melody, had been delivered to the People by the inraptured Bard, could now be
ſtudied and attained only by the <hi>ſequeſtered Few,</hi> who were
ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up by a literary Application, often ignorant of the Powers of
Muſic, and little acquainted with Society and Mankind.—Hence the
<hi>Epic Poet</hi> (the Manners of the Times likewiſe forbidding<note n="l" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>See below, Sect. xiii.</bibl>
               </note>) could no longer appear
at the Place of public Concourſe, with his Lyre and feſtal Robes, to charm
the liſtening Audience with his legiſlative Songs; but retired to the
<hi>Cloſet,</hi> and with a more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed Mien delivered his
Inſpirations in written Verſe, for the Pleaſure, Admiration, and
Inſtruction of Mankind.—This might have been indured: Becauſe ſome
of the general Ends of that calmer Species may be obtained by a
<hi>Home-application.</hi> But the Misfortune was, that even <hi>Tragedy</hi>
and <hi>Ode,</hi> whoſe End is to ſhake the Soul with Terror, Pity, or Joy,
by a <hi>theatrical Exhibition</hi>
               <note n="m" place="bottom"> 
                  <p>It hath become a favourite Topic among certain Perſons, to
decry the theatrical Exhibition of Tragedy, as an Object below the Ambition of
a Poet. Whether any faſtidious tragic Muſe hath <hi>privately</hi> knocked
at the Door of the Theatre, and been <hi>refuſed Admittance,</hi> we ſhall
not here <hi>affirm:</hi> But it belongs to our Subject to ſhew on what
Foundation the theatrical Exhibition makes an eſſential Part of Tragedy;
and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, the tragic Poem is an <hi>imperfect Species.</hi>
                  </p> 
                  <p>The Epic Poem not only imitates Actions, Sentiments, Characters,
and Paſſions; but likewiſe delineates their chief external and attendant
Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of Place, Perſon, Voice, Countenance, Attitude, and
Geſture: And hence a full and perfect Imitation enſues. In the Dramatic or
Tragic Poem, little of this latter Kind can be admitted, without violating the
Probability and Power of the Dialogue: On this Foundation, the Deſcription of
theſe external and attendant Circumſtances is neceſſarily left to the
Conduct of the <hi>Actor</hi>; who, in theſe Articles, aſſumes the
Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of the Poet, and is a real <hi>Imitator.</hi> Hence a dramatic Poem,
<hi>written,</hi> but <hi>not repreſented,</hi> is capitally defective in the
great Article of <hi>Imitation;</hi> and is therefore a Species
<hi>eſſentially imperfect.</hi>—ARISTOTLE hath over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looked this
capital Diſtinction between the Epic and Tragic Poem, in his Compariſon of
theſe two Species.

            <p>This falſe Taſte in <hi>Ode-writing</hi> hath ſo ſtrongly
eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed itſelf in ENGLAND, that an <hi>Ode</hi> of the <hi>true</hi>
Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter is ſtiled (by Way of Diſtinction) An Ode for <hi>Muſic:</hi>
Of this Kind we have two noble ones in our Language, <pb n="198" facs="tcp:0964200100:201"/> by
DRYDEN and POPE: But theſe will be conſidered more at large below.</p>
            <p>As the modern Poetry thus became often unfit for Muſic, ſo from
a ſingular Cauſe the Separation was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, and Muſic in its Turn
became often unfit for Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. After many Centuries had paſſed in
Darkneſs, GUIDO aroſe: And with a Force of Genius ſurpaſſing that of
all his Predeceſſors, invented the Art of <hi>Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point,</hi> or
<hi>Compoſition</hi> in <hi>Parts:</hi> Yet this very Circumſtance, which
ſeemed to promiſe ſo noble an Improvement in Muſic, was a ſtrong
concurrent Cauſe of compleating its Divorce from Poetry. For now,
<hi>inſtrumental</hi> Muſic, having aſſumed a new and more inviting
Form, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ennobled by the principles of a complex and varied
<hi>Harmony,</hi> was introduced as being of itſelf a <hi>compleat</hi>
Species, independent of Poetry or Song. This gave it an <hi>artificial</hi> and
<hi>laboured</hi> Turn; while the Compoſer went in Queſt of curious
Harmonies, Diſcords, Reſolutions, Fugues, and Canons; and prided himſelf
(like the Poet) in a pompous Diſplay of Art, to the Neglect of
<hi>Expreſſion</hi> and true <hi>Pathos.</hi> And thus modern Muſic, on
its firſt Riſe, was in a Manner divorced from <hi>Poetry,
Legiſlation,</hi> and <hi>Morals.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe Cauſes ſufficiently account for the preſent State of
the two Siſter Arts, in every Inſtance of their <hi>total Separation.</hi>
Let us now conſider them in thoſe Situations where their Union is indeed in
ſome Sort maintained, but this in an improper and ineffectual Manner.</p>
            <p>The four diſtinct Forms in which theſe two Arts ſtill maintain
an imperfect Union are, 1. The common <hi>Song</hi> or <hi>Canzonette.</hi> 2.
The <hi>Opera,</hi> or <hi>Drama</hi> for the <hi>Stage.</hi> 
               <pb n="199" facs="tcp:0964200100:202"/> 3. The <hi>Anthem,</hi> or <hi>Motet,</hi> for the
<hi>Church.</hi> 4. The <hi>Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torio,</hi> or <hi>ſacred Drama.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. The common <hi>Song</hi> or <hi>Canzonette</hi> hath ſunk
from the original Dignity which it maintained in ancient GREECE, from two
evident Cauſes. Firſt, The Separation of Muſic and Poetry from their
important Ends, and from each other, naturally prevented the modern Poets and
Muſicians from conſidering this Species as being much worthy of their
Attention. Secondly, The nobler Applications of the <hi>Song</hi> being thus
relinquiſhed and loſt, no Wonder if Men of high Station and moral Dignity
diſdained the Practice of it (even where they had Ability) as being an Object
unworthy of their Regard. Hence it hath come to paſs, that this Species is
hardly ſuppoſed to touch on any Subject religious, political, or moral,
unleſs it be in Jeſt<note n="n" place="bottom">There are ſome Exceptions to
this general Obſervation; but they take Place chiefly among the
<hi>Vulgar</hi>; among whom the <hi>Ballad-Song</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly retains its
<hi>moral</hi> and <hi>political</hi> Applications.</note>. And thus the
reigning Topics of the <hi>Song</hi> are generally <hi>Love</hi> and
<hi>Wine.</hi> The <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Engliſh</hi> have adopted both
theſe Subjects: The <hi>Chanſons à boire</hi> of the former, and the
<hi>drinking Catches</hi> of the latter, are Proofs of their Jollity rather
than Taſte: Yet they clearly diſplay the different Characters of the two
Nations. A parallel Remark might perhaps be made on their <hi>Love-Songs:</hi>
With this Exception, however, that in a Song of this Kind, PURCEL hath left us
one of the fineſt and beſt va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried Pieces of muſical Expreſſion that
ever was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed<note n="o" place="bottom"> From roſy Bowers,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note>: And in Juſtice to the preſent Times it muſt be
farther obſerved, that in ENGLAND, this Species is <pb n="200" facs="tcp:0964200100:203"/> now
in a good Degree reſcued from its former Indelicacy. The <hi>Italians</hi>
and <hi>Scots</hi> have chiefly turned the <hi>Song</hi> on the Subject of
<hi>Love.</hi> With Reſpect to the <hi>Poetry,</hi> the <hi>Italian
Canzonettes</hi> are more elegantly written than the <hi>Scotch,</hi> though
with leſs Nature and Paſſion. In the <hi>Muſic</hi> of the <hi>Italian
Canzonettes</hi> there is little Variety: They ſoon diſguſt, by their
Sameneſs of Expreſſion: The <hi>Scotch Airs</hi> are perhaps the trueſt
Model of artleſs and pathetic muſical Expreſſion, that can be found in
the whole Compaſs of the Art. Some of them are ſaid to have been the
Compoſition of DAVID RIZZIO, who is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to have ingrafted the
<hi>Italian</hi> Regularity and Elegance of Song, on the original wild and
pathetic Manner of the <hi>Scots.</hi> This Tradition carries the Appearance of
Truth: For the <hi>Scotch</hi> Airs are of two different Kinds, eaſily
diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhable from each other: The one <hi>regular,</hi> and ſubject
to the Rules of Counterpoint: The other wild and deſultory, and ſuch as do
not eaſily receive the Accompanyment of a Baſs. The firſt of theſe may
ſeem to have been the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition or Reform of RIZZIO; but in Force of
Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion and Pathos, the latter generally excel them: A Circumſtance
which proves how little the Rules of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Counterpoint have to do with the
<hi>Powers</hi> of <hi>Muſic.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">The State of the <hi>Opera</hi> will deſerve a more
particular Elucidation: And to this End we muſt endeavour to trace it to its
Origin, which lies in great Meaſure hid in Darkneſs. RICCOBONI is of
Opinion that the firſt ever repreſented, was that which the <hi>Doge</hi>
and <hi>Senate</hi> of VENICE exhibited for the Entertainment of HENRY the
third of FRANCE, in the Year 1574<note n="p" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>
                     <hi>Theat.</hi>
&amp;c.</bibl>
               </note>. But this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count <pb n="201" facs="tcp:0964200100:204" rendition="simple:additions"/> is by no
means ſatisfactory: For SULPITIUS, an Italian, ſpeaks of the <hi>muſical
Drama,</hi> as an Entertainment known in ITALY in the Year 1490<note n="p" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>MENETRIER <hi>de Repreſentations en
Muſique.</hi>
                  </bibl>
               </note>.</p>
            <p>Hiſtory traces the Riſe of the <hi>Opera</hi> no farther: But a
Circumſtance mentioned by SULPITIUS, who was a Man of Letters, may ſeem to
lead us up to its true Origin. He is by ſome ſuppoſed to have been the
Inventor of this <hi>muſical Drama</hi>; but he ingenuouſly tells us
himſelf, that he only <hi>revived</hi> it<note n="q" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>Ibid.</bibl>
               </note>. We have ſeen above, that the
<hi>Tragedy</hi> of the ancient <hi>Greeks</hi> was accompanied with Muſic;
that the ſame Union was borrowed and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained through the ſeveral
Periods of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire: If therefore we ſuppoſe, what is
altogether probable, that the Form of the ancient Tragedy had been ſtill kept
up in ſome retired Part of ITALY, which the Barbarians never conquered; we
then obtain a fair Account of the Riſe of the modern <hi>Opera,</hi> which
hath ſo much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded all Inquiry.</p>
            <p>As VENICE was the Place where the <hi>Opera</hi> firſt appeared in
Splendor, ſo it is highly probable, that <hi>there</hi> the <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Tragedy</hi> had ſlept in Obſcurity, during the Darkneſs of the Barbarous
Ages. For while the reſt of ITALY was over-run by the Nations from the North,
the Seas and Moraſſes of VENICE preſerved <hi>Her</hi> alone from their
In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſions: Hence, Hiſtory tells us, the People flocked to VENICE from
every Part of ITALY: Hence the very Form of her Republic hath been maintained
for thirteen hundred Years: And from theſe Views of <hi>Security,</hi> it was
natural for the helpleſs Arts to ſeek an Aſylum within 
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:0964200100:205"/> her Canals, from the Fury and Ignorance of a barbarous
Conqueror.</p>
            <p>Other Circumſtances concur, to ſtrengthen this Opinion. The
<hi>Carnaval</hi> firſt appeared in Splendor, and ſtill wears it at VENICE,
beyond every other Part of ITALY: Now the <hi>Carnaval</hi> is, in many
Circumſtances, almoſt a Tranſcript of the ancient <hi>Saturnalia</hi> of
ROME.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>Venetian Comedy,</hi> the <hi>Actor</hi> wears a
<hi>Maſque:</hi> A palpable <hi>Imitation,</hi> or rather
<hi>Continuance,</hi> of the old <hi>Roman</hi> Cuſtom.</p>
            <p>That the modern <hi>Opera</hi> is no more than a Revival of the old
<hi>Roman Tragedy,</hi> and not a new-invented Species, will appear ſtill
more evident, if we conſider, that it is an Exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition altogether out of
Nature, and repugnant to the univerſal Genius of Modern Cuſtoms and
Manners. We have ſeen the natural Union of Poetry and Muſic, as they riſe
in the ſavage State; and how this Union forms the tragic Species in the
natural Progreſſion of Things, Hence we have deduced the muſical
Tragedies of ancient GREECE: But in ancient ROME, it appears, they aroſe
merely from <hi>Imitation</hi> and <hi>Adoption.</hi> Nor could it be
otherwiſe; becauſe the <hi>Romans</hi> wanted the firſt ſeeds or
Principles from whence the muſical Tragedies of the <hi>Greeks</hi> aroſe.
The ſame Reaſoning takes Place, with Reſpect to the modern
<hi>Opera:</hi> It emerged at a Time, when the general State of Manners in
EUROPE could not naturally produce it. Had it been the Reſult from
<hi>Nature,</hi> its Production would have been more <hi>general.</hi> It
emerged in that very City, where moſt probably it muſt have lain hid: In a
City, whoſe other Entertainments are evidently borrowed from thoſe of
ancient ROME. And if to theſe <pb n="203" facs="tcp:0964200100:206"/> Arguments we add this
farther Conſideration, that the Subjects of the very firſt <hi>Operas</hi>
were drawn from the Fables of ancient GREECE and ROME<note n="q" place="bottom">The Subjects of the firſt <hi>Operas</hi> were APOLLO and
DAPHNE, ORPHEUS and EURIDICE, ALCESTES and ATYS; which laſt, in the Title
Page of the oldeſt extant Edition, is called <hi>a muſical
Tragedy.</hi>
               </note>, and not from the Events or Atchievements of the Times;
and farther, that in their <hi>Form,</hi> they were exact Copies of the
<hi>ancient Drama</hi>; theſe accumulated Proofs amount to near a
De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration, that the <hi>Italian Opera</hi> is but the <hi>Revival</hi>
of the old <hi>Roman Tragedy</hi>
               <note n="r" place="bottom">As theſe
Circumſtances prove that the <hi>modern Opera</hi> is a <hi>Revival</hi> of
the <hi>old Roman Tragedy</hi>; ſo, we are led from hence to a probable
Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture concerning the <hi>meaſured Recitation</hi> of the <hi>Roman
Tragedians:</hi> And that it was ſomething of the Nature of modern
<hi>Recitative.</hi>
               </note>.</p>
            <p>Such being the <hi>Birth</hi> of the modern <hi>Opera,</hi> no
Wonder it inherits the <hi>Weakneſs</hi> of its <hi>Parent:</hi> For we have
ſeen, that the <hi>Roman Tragedy</hi> never had its proper Effects,
conſidered in a <hi>legiſlative</hi> View; having been ſeparated from its
important Ends before its Arrival from GREECE. As therefore it had declined
into a mere <hi>Amuſement</hi> when it was firſt adopted by ROME; and as we
have ſeen, that in Proportion as the Roman Manners grew more diſſolute,
Tragedy ſunk ſtill lower in its Character, till at length it became no more
than a Kind of mere <hi>Subſtratum</hi> or <hi>Groundwork,</hi> on which the
Actors diſplayed their Abilities in <hi>Singing</hi> and
<hi>Geſticulation</hi>; it was altogether natural that it ſhould riſe
again in the ſame unnerved and effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Form.</p>
            <p>From theſe Cauſes, therefore, we may trace all the Features of
the modern <hi>Opera,</hi> however <hi>unnatural</hi> and <hi>diſtorted</hi>
they may appear. The <hi>Poem,</hi> the <hi>Muſic</hi> and the 
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:0964200100:207" rendition="simple:additions"/> 
               <hi>Performance,</hi> as they now exiſt in
<hi>Union,</hi> are the manifeſt Effects of this ſpurious Origin.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That the <hi>Subject</hi> of the <hi>Poem</hi> ſhould,
even on its firſt Appearance, be drawn from Times and Countries little
intereſting, and <hi>Gods</hi> and <hi>Wonders</hi> and <hi>celeſtial
Machinery</hi> introduced, which neither the Poet nor his Audience
<hi>believed</hi> in, could only be the Effect of a <hi>blind</hi> Principle of
<hi>Imitation,</hi> tending to mere <hi>Amuſement.</hi>—The
eſtabliſhed Separation of the Poet's from the Muſician's Art was
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive of parallel Effects: For the Poet, ambitious only of ſhining in
his particular Sphere, became generally more Intent on Imagery than Pathos: Or
elſe, inſtead of being <hi>principal,</hi> he became
<hi>ſubſervient</hi> to the Compoſer's Views; from whence aroſe a
Motley kind of Poem (calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated only for a Diſplay of the Muſician's Art)
which degenerated by Degrees into a mere <hi>Paſticio.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly; the ſame Cauſes account for all the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities of
the <hi>Muſic.</hi>—The <hi>Recitative,</hi> or perpetual mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical
Accompanyment in the declamotary Parts, is a Practice ſo much at Variance
with modern Manners, that it extorted the following Cenſure from a candid
Critic: 
<q rend="inline">"I beg Pardon of the Inventors of the <hi>mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical
Tragedy,</hi> a Kind of Poem, as <hi>ridiculous</hi> as it is
<hi>new.</hi>"—"If there be any thing in the World that is at Variance
with <hi>tragic Action,</hi> it is <hi>Song.</hi>" "The <hi>Opera</hi> is the
<hi>Groteſque</hi> of Poetry; and ſo much the more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable, as it
pretends to paſs for a regular Work<note n="s" place="bottom">
                     <bibl>DACIER
<hi>Rem. ſur Ariſtote,</hi> p. 85.</bibl>
                  </note>."</q> Now if, along with
DACIER, we regard the <hi>Opera</hi> as a modern <hi>Invention,</hi> this
Circumſtance of the perpetual muſical Accompanyment is indeed
<hi>unaccountable:</hi> But if we regard it as a mere <hi>Imitation</hi> or
<hi>Continuance</hi> of the old <pb n="205" facs="tcp:0964200100:208"/> 
               <hi>Roman Tragedy,</hi>
and trace <hi>this</hi> upwards to its true Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, the <hi>Greek
Drama</hi>; and again follow <hi>this</hi> to its original Source, the
<hi>ſavage Song-Feaſt</hi>; we then ſee how naturally theſe
<hi>extremes unite</hi>; and diſcern the rude <hi>Melody</hi> and
<hi>Song</hi> of the <hi>barbarous Greek</hi> Tribes gradually melted into the
<hi>Refinements</hi> of the <hi>modern Opera.</hi>—Again, as the
Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Poet's from the Muſician's Art produced an <hi>improper
Poetry</hi>; ſo the Separation of the Muſician's from the Poet's Character
was productive of improper and <hi>unaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting Muſic:</hi> For the
Compoſer, in his Turn, intent only on <hi>ſhining,</hi> commonly wanders
into unmeaning Diviſion, and adopts either a delicate and refined, or a
merely popular Muſic, to the Neglect of true muſical Expreſſion. Hence,
too, the <hi>Da Capo</hi> had its natural Origin: A Practice which tends only
to tire and diſguſt the Hearer, if he comes with an Intent of being
<hi>affected</hi> by the <hi>tragic Action,</hi> or with any other View than
that of <hi>liſtening</hi> to a <hi>Song</hi>
               <note n="t" place="bottom">The
<hi>Da Capo,</hi> which is ſo ſtriking an Abſurdity in the more modern
Operas, was not uſed in thoſe of older Date. Even COLONNA, who lived about
the middle of the ſixteenth Century, employed it not; as appears by one of
his Operas performed at the Academy in BOLOGNA, A. D. 1688. But in an Opera of
<hi>Old</hi> SCARLATTI (intitled <hi>La Teodora</hi>) compoſed in 1693, the
<hi>Da Capo</hi> is found, though not in all his Songs. After that Period, the
Uſe of it ſeems to have become <hi>general:</hi> For in an Opera of
GASPARINI (intitled <hi>Il Tartaro nella China</hi>) compoſed in 1715, the
<hi>Da Capo</hi> is found in every Song.</note>.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, with Regard to the <hi>Performance</hi> of the
<hi>Opera.</hi>—The theatrical Repreſentation is of a Piece with the
Poetry and Muſic: For, having been regarded, from its firſt Riſe, more as
an Affair of aſtoniſhing Shew than of affecting Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance, it is
gaudy, flaunting, and unnatural. The Sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers (like the <hi>Poet</hi> and
<hi>Muſician)</hi> being conſidered merely as <pb n="206" facs="tcp:0964200100:209"/>
Objects of Amuſement, no Wonder if their Ambition ſeldom reacheth higher
than to the Diſplay of an artificial Execution.—As a Conſequence of
theſe Principles, the <hi>Caſtrati</hi> were introduced into all Sorts of
Characters, in ſpite of Nature and Probability; and ſtill continue to
repreſent Heroes and Stateſmen, Warriours and Women.—The flouriſhed
Cloſe or Cadence aroſe naturally from the ſame Sources: From a total
Neglect of the Subject and Expreſſion, and an Attention to the mere
Circumſtance of Execution only.—The frequent <hi>Encore,</hi> or Demand
of the repeated Performance of particular Songs was the natural Effect of the
ſame Cauſes. No Audience demands the <hi>Repetition</hi> of a pathetic
Speech in <hi>Tragedy,</hi> though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in the fineſt Manner, becauſe
their Attention is turned on the Subject of the Drama: Thus if the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
were <hi>warmed</hi> by the <hi>Subject</hi> of an <hi>Opera,</hi> and <hi>took
Part</hi> in the main <hi>Action</hi> of the Poem, the <hi>Encore,</hi>

But the whole being conſidered as a mere <hi>muſical Entertainment,</hi>
and the tragic <hi>Action</hi> commonly <hi>forgot,</hi> the artificial
Performance of a <hi>Song</hi> became naturally a chief Object of Admiration,
and the Repetition of it a chief <hi>Object</hi> of Requeſt.</p>
            <p>Thus the whole Farrago of the <hi>modern Opera</hi> ſeems
reſolved into its clear and evident Principles: And hence the
<hi>Subject,</hi> the <hi>Muſic,</hi> the <hi>Action,</hi> the
<hi>Dreſs,</hi> the <hi>Execution, Decorations,</hi> and <hi>Machinery,</hi>
are ſuch a glar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Compound of trifling and abſurd
<hi>Improbabilities,</hi> that the <hi>tragic Influence</hi> is
<hi>overlaid</hi> and <hi>loſt</hi>; nor is it poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for any
impartial and rational Spectator to take Part in the dramatic Action, or be
<hi>moved</hi> by the <hi>ill-feigned Diſtreſs.</hi>

derogate from the Ability or Merit of all the <hi>Poets, Muſicians,</hi> and
<hi>Singers,</hi> who devote their Labours to the <hi>Opera.</hi> He knows
there are Exceptions in each of theſe Departments<note n="t" place="bottom">Some of METASTASIO's and QUINAULT's Operas are fine Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedies in

<hi>Opera,</hi> as an Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment unworthy all Attention, conſidered as a
mere Amuſement: On the contrary, whoever is inclined to hear a Succeſſion

that can dazzle the Eye, and all the Refinement of Execution that can inchant
the Ear, let him attend the <hi>Opera,</hi> and he will find his Taſte highly
gratified. But this Inquiry aims at a far more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Purpoſe: Its
Intention is, to point out the Union, the <hi>Powers</hi> and <hi>primary
Ends</hi> of <hi>Poetry</hi> and <hi>Muſic:</hi> And when the modern
<hi>Opera</hi> is viewed in this Light, the Writer preſumes, its Defects are
too conſpicuous to admit a Vindication.</p>
            <p>'Tis ſaid, indeed, that the Weakneſs and Impropriety of this
Entertainment is chiefly found in foreign Countries, where the <hi>Italian</hi>
Poetry and Muſic are not <hi>native</hi>; but that in ITALY, its Power and
Influence are conſiderable. This the ſenſible ROUSSEAU affirms in his
Diſſertation on the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Italian</hi> Muſic. But
particular and well atteſted Facts are ſtubborn Things, and will not bend
to general Affirmations: And of this Fact, the concurrent Teſtimony of all
obſervant Travellers aſſures us; That in the <hi>Italian</hi> Theatre,
the Seats of the chief Hearers reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſo many ſeparate Apartments,
where the Nobility ſit retired, converſing on indifferent Subjects, and
regardleſs of the Progreſs of the Drama, till ſome celebrated Singer 
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:0964200100:211" rendition="simple:additions"/> comes upon the Stage; and then, and then only,
enſues a Burſt of <hi>Rapture,</hi> of <hi>Bravo's, Encores,</hi> and
<hi>Applauſe.</hi> The Paſſion, therefore, thus expreſſed on this
Occaſion, is evidently the Effect, not of a true <hi>Feeling</hi> of the
<hi>Subject</hi> or tragic <hi>Action,</hi> which is entirely
<hi>diſregarded,</hi> but (as in the later Periods of ancient ROME) of an
<hi>extravagant Admiration</hi> of the <hi>Singer's Ability</hi> and
<hi>Art.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. The modern State of the <hi>Anthem, Motet,</hi> or
<hi>Hymn,</hi> comes next under Conſideration.—With Reſpect to the
ſacred Poetry that hath ever been uſed in the <hi>Chriſtian Church,</hi>
it is various in different Countries. It appears that in ITALY, it hath been an
allowed Cuſtom from the earlieſt Ages, to permit the Admiſſion of
<hi>Hymns</hi> or <hi>Motets</hi> as a Part of divine Service. This Practice,
in Courſe of Time, produced wild and incoherent Compoſitions: For the
poetic Character being ſeparated from the muſical; the
<hi>Compoſers,</hi> little ſkilled in the Art of Poetry, and yet
conſidering themſelves as <hi>Principals,</hi> have often formed their
Motets of Sentiments and Paſſions <hi>inconſiſtent</hi> with each
other<note n="u" place="bottom">For an Inſtance of this Kind, take the
following, which is one of CARISSIMI's moſt celebrated <hi>Motets:</hi> 
                  <q rend="inline">"Peccavi, Domine, &amp; miſerere mei; te diligit
Anima mea, te ſemper quaeſivit Cor meum; Ergo, mi Jeſu, mi Creator, mi
Salvator, dimitte Culpas, parce Peccatis meis," &amp;c.</q>
               </note>. Another
Separation here, too, enſued: I mean the total Separation of <hi>Senſe</hi>
from <hi>Sound:</hi> For theſe Motets are generally compoſed in the
<hi>Latin</hi> Tongue, and therefore <hi>unintelligible</hi> to the greateſt
Part of thoſe who <hi>hear</hi> them.</p>
            <p>As to the Church Muſic of ITALY and its once appendant Provinces,
it hath aſſumed a Variety of Shapes, and in different Times hath undergone
great Changes. In the ſecond Century, it appears that the pagan Melody was 
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:0964200100:212"/> adopted, and allowed under certain Reſtrictions of
Modeſty and Decorum<note n="w" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>JUST. MART.
<hi>Quaeſt</hi> 107.</bibl>
               </note>. It was afterwards eſtabliſhed at
CON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STANTINOPLE by CONSTANTINE; then at ALEXAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DRIA, by ATHANASIUS. This
Eſtabliſhment was found to have bad Effects, through the effeminate Genius
of the Muſic then in Vogue, and was therefore baniſhed from the Church of
ALEXANDRIA. No Wonder, if it was infected with the Genius of the pagan Muſic
of the Times, which we find to have been diſſolute and ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate<note n="x" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>See above, Sect. xi.</bibl>
               </note>. From the general
Prevalence of this debauched Taſte, AUGUSTINE was tempted to baniſh Muſic
from the Church: But AMBROSE reformed the Office of the Church of MILAN; and
eſtabliſhed a Melody auſtere in the Extreme: This was improved by
GREGORY; whoſe Melody ſucceeded, and was eſtabliſhed in the following
Century: And now, the Devaſtations of the Barbarians coming on, this
<hi>Plain Song</hi> naturally lay hid unchanged in the Chriſtian Church,
during the ſucceeding Ages of Ignorance and Cruelty.</p>
            <p>On the faint Revival of Arts in the eleventh Century, the Appearance
of GUIDO gave a new Genius to the Muſic of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church. For
according to the natural Tendency of his Invention of the Art of
<hi>Counterpoint,</hi> GASSENDI tells us that all the World now run mad after
an artificial Variety of Parts. About four hundred Years after GUIDO, the
debauched Art once more paſſed over into ITALY from GREECE: Certain
<hi>Greeks,</hi> who eſcaped from the taking of CONSTANTINOPLE, brought a
refined and enervate ſpecies of Muſic to ROME: Where, meeting with a
congenial Effeminacy, under the gay and diſſolute 
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:0964200100:213" rendition="simple:additions"/> Pontificate of the Princes of the Houſe of
MEDICI, it ran into ſuch an Extreme of Indecorum, that <hi>Pope</hi> PIUS the
<hi>Fourth</hi> formed a Reſolution to expel it from the Church. PALAESTRINI
had the Art and Addreſs to divert this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending Storm; by compoſing
ſome Pieces of ſuch a majeſtic Gravity, as convinced the <hi>Pope</hi>
that Muſic thus truly ſacred might be made ſubſervient to the nobleſt
Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes. This Severity of Compoſition ſtill remains in the <hi>Pope's
Chapel</hi>; where, ever ſince the Reform laſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, even muſical
Inſtruments are not admitted, for fear of creating new Abuſes. But the
common Genius of their modern Church Muſic or Motets is altogether
dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent: It is infected with the ſame Puerility of Stile with their Opera
Airs: An unbounded Compaſs, extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant Diviſions on ſingle Syllables, a
Play upon particular Words to the Neglect of the general Tenor of the Song,
form its general Character. How can it be otherwiſe? When the ſame
Muſicians, (and theſe ſeldom much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted in the Subject, or
acquainted with the Language of their ſacred Poetry) generally compoſe both
for the <hi>Opera</hi> and the <hi>Church.</hi> Some noble Exceptions, however,
may be found to this general Remark; Of theſe, CARIS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SIMI is one: But the
moſt eminent Inſtance is in BENEDETTO MARCELLO a noble <hi>Venetian</hi>;
many of whoſe Pſalms, if we conſider their Expreſſion either as
ſublime, tender, graceful, or joyous, clearly excel the vocal Compoſitions
of all his Countrymen, in Variety, Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity, and Truth<note n="y" place="bottom">It muſt be obſerved, that MARCELLO's Compoſitions are not
ſet to the <hi>Latin Tranſlation</hi>; but to an <hi>Italian
Paraphraſe</hi> of the Pſalms.</note>.</p>
            <p>With Reſpect to the <hi>Performance</hi> of their Church Muſic
in ITALY, it hath naturally too much followed the Genius 
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:0964200100:214" rendition="simple:additions"/> of the Art itſelf. They have no eſtabliſhed
Choirs of Prieſts: The <hi>Caſtrati</hi> are the chief Singers in the
Church: In ROME, theſe Performers go round the City in Bands, as they are
accidentally hired; and bring no great Credit to the ſacred Muſic, either
by their Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters or perſonal Appearance. The Truth is, Church Muſic, in
ITALY, like that of the <hi>Opera,</hi> is conſidered more as a Matter of
Amuſement than Devotion. Hence the Decorations and muſical Exhibitions of
their <hi>Churches,</hi> in the Time of <hi>Carnaval,</hi> approach towards
thoſe of the <hi>Theatre</hi> at an <hi>Opera:</hi> And the general Attention
is ſo far from being turned on ſacred Subjects, that it is chiefly
exerciſed in <hi>Debates</hi> and <hi>Quarrels</hi> about the
<hi>Excellence</hi> and <hi>Superiority</hi> of the performing
<hi>Caſtrati.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Such then have been the <hi>Separations</hi> and
<hi>Progreſſions</hi> of <hi>ſacred Poetry</hi> and <hi>Muſic</hi> in
the <hi>Mother</hi> Country, from whence they have been chiefly derived and
tranſmitted to the reſt of EUROPE. However, as they wear an Aſpect
ſomewhat different in FRANCE and ENGLAND, it may be proper to point out the
chief Variations, together with the Cauſes that have produced them.</p>
            <p>In FRANCE the ſacred Poetry of their <hi>Motets</hi> or
<hi>Hymns</hi> is, in its general Turn, much ſuperior to that of ITALY: For
in FRANCE it is moſt commonly ſelected and borrowed, if not tranſcribed,
from the <hi>ſacred Writings.</hi> This inſures to it a conſiderable
Degree of Propriety, Dignity, and Force. How this came to paſs, we may learn
from an Authority no leſs than that of the great COLBERT; who, in his
political Teſtament, acknowledges this among other Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations which the
Church of FRANCE hath owed to their Intercourſe with the
<hi>Proteſtants,</hi> that it hath given them a <pb n="212" facs="tcp:0964200100:215" rendition="simple:additions"/>
more general and intimate Acquaintance with the holy Scriptures.—Their
ſacred Muſic, though not poſſeſſed of that Grace which the beſt
Italian may truly boaſt, yet it may be juſtly regarded as the beſt that
FRANCE hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced; becauſe it is ſet to a much better muſical
Language than their own: For the <hi>Latin</hi> Tongue hath a Variety of Accent
and Meaſure, which adapts itſelf happily to muſical Expreſſion;
whereas the <hi>French</hi> Language is hoarſe, ill-accented, or of ambiguous
Accent, void of Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony and Variety, and incurably diſcordant: But ſtill,
the Compoſition of their <hi>Motets</hi> in the <hi>Latin</hi> Tongue is
at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with the ſame abſurd Conſequence as in ITALY, that the People
in general do not underſtand them.—In one Reſpect, however, their
ſacred Muſic hath not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from its proper Character ſo far as the
modern <hi>Italian</hi>; I mean, in its Gravity of Stile: And this, it ſeems
probable, hath been owing in Part to take eſtabliſhed Choirs in FRANCE,
which are compoſed of regular <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtics,</hi> and therefore not
ſo eaſily ſeduced to adopt a light and flaunting Species of Muſic, as
the wandering Bands of <hi>Italian Caſtrati.</hi> Another concomitant Cauſe
of this reſerved and ſober Muſic may probably have been the Mixture of
the Proteſtant Party in FRANCE: For theſe (according to the Genius of every
new-reformed Sect) adopted a grave and ſimple Melody: They were therefore a
ſalutary Check upon the eſtabliſhed Church, tending to the Prevention of
open and ſcandalous Abuſes.—Laſtly, with Regard to the Article of
<hi>Performance,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> have greatly the Advantage in Point
of Propriety and Decorum; for, as we have obſerved, their Choirs are
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of an eſtabliſhed Prieſthood, who attend to this 
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:0964200100:216" rendition="simple:additions"/> peculiar Profeſſion; whoſe Characters are
of higher Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration than thoſe of the <hi>Italian</hi> Bands; and
whoſe Learning, as well as Religion and Manners, naturally lead them to a
more reverent and devout Execution of their ſacred Office.</p>
            <p>In ENGLAND the State of Things is in ſome Reſpects better, and
in ſome Reſpects worſe than in FRANCE. Our ſacred Poetry, ſung in the
<hi>Cathedrals,</hi> is tranſcribed ſtrictly from the <hi>holy
Scriptures,</hi> and moſt commonly from the Book of Pſalms: Except only the
<hi>Te Deum,</hi> which is one of the moſt ancient and approved Hymns of the
Church. This Reſtriction, by which no Hymns of new Invention are admitted as
a Part of divine Service, we owe to the grand Reformation: This opened to us
the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the ſacred Writings, which had before been locked up, as in
ITALY. From the ſame Cauſe, our <hi>Anthems</hi> are likewiſe given in
our own Tongue; which though not ſo various as the <hi>Latin,</hi> is yet
generally round and ſonorous, clearly accented, and capable of being adapted
to a Variety of muſical Expreſſion. But while we juſtly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire the
<hi>ſacred Poetry</hi> of our <hi>Cathedral</hi> Service, muſt we not
lament the State of it in our <hi>parochial</hi> Churches, where the cold, the
meagre, the diſguſting <hi>Dulneſs</hi> of STERNHOLD and his
<hi>Companions,</hi> hath <hi>quenched</hi> all the <hi>poetic Fire</hi> and
<hi>devout Majeſty</hi> of the <hi>royal Pſalmiſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Character of our <hi>Cathedral Muſic</hi> is of a
<hi>middle</hi> Kind: Not of the firſt Rank in the great Quality of
<hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion</hi>; nor yet ſo improper or abſurd, as to deſerve a
ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Reprobation. Too ſtudious a Regard to <hi>Fugues</hi> and an
artificial <hi>Counterpoint</hi> appears in the <hi>old,</hi> and too
<hi>airy</hi> and <hi>light</hi> a Turn, to the Neglect of a grand Simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:0964200100:217" rendition="simple:additions"/> in the <hi>new:</hi> Two Extremes which tend
equally, though from oppoſite Cauſes, to deſtroy <hi>muſical
Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi>
               <note n="y" place="bottom">

                  </bibl>
               </note>. Yet, there are Paſſages in PURCEL's
Anthems, which may fairly ſtand in Competition with thoſe of any
Compoſer, of whatever Country. There are others who may juſtly claim a
conſiderable Share of Praiſe. HANDEL ſtands eminent, in his Greatneſs
and Sublimity of Style.—Our <hi>parochial Muſic,</hi> in general, is
ſolemn and devout: Much better calculated for the Performance of a whole
Congregation, than if it were more broken and elaborate. In Country Churches,
wherever a more artificial Kind hath been imprudently attempted, Confuſion
and Diſſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance are the general Conſequence.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Performance</hi> of our Cathedral Muſic is defective: We
have no grand eſtabliſhed Choirs of Prieſts, as in FRANCE; whoſe
Dignity of Character might in a proper Degree maintain That of the divine
Service. This Duty is chiefly left to a Band of <hi>Lay-Singers,</hi> whoſe
Rank and Education are not of Weight to preſerve their Profeſſion from
Contempt. The Performance of our parochial Pſalms, though in the Villages it
be often as mean and meagre as the Words that are ſung; yet in great Towns,
where a good Organ is ſkilfully and devoutly employed by a ſenſible
Organiſt, the Union of this Inſtrument with the Voices of a
well-inſtructed Congregation, forms one of the grandeſt Scenes of
unaffected Piety that human Nature can afford. The Reverſe of this appears,
when a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of illiterate People form themſelves into a <hi>Choir</hi>
diſtinct from the Congregation. Here Devotion is loſt, 
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:0964200100:218" rendition="simple:additions"/> between the impotent <hi>Vanity</hi> of thoſe
who <hi>ſing,</hi> and the ignorant <hi>Wonder</hi> of thoſe who
<hi>liſten.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. The <hi>Oratorio</hi> is a <hi>dramatic
Repreſentation</hi> of ſome Story taken from the ſacred Scriptures, or
the Records of the Church, accompanied with Muſic. Its Origin is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
to the barbarous Period of the <hi>Croiſades</hi>; when Companies of
<hi>Pilgrims,</hi> returning from JERUSALEM, formed themſelves into
<hi>Choirs,</hi> and ſung the Praiſes and Atchievements of Saints and
Martyrs<note n="z" place="bottom">

                  </bibl>
               </note>. Thus it is ſaid to have ariſen and been
eſtabliſhed in FRANCE. But how it could aſſume the Form of <hi>dramatic
Repreſentation accompanied with Muſic,</hi> is hard to ſay, without
ſuppoſing it (like the <hi>Opera)</hi> to have been the Effect of an
<hi>Imitation.</hi> On this principle we may trace it to a probable Origin. It
is well known, that the Pagan Shews were often ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited in the Temples, or at
the Tombs of deceaſed Heroes: 'Tis no leſs certain, that the early
Chriſtians adopted the Practice, with a due Change of Objects, either from a
mere Imitation of the Pagan Cuſtom, or with a View to the Converſion of
Idolators. Nothing, therefore, could be more natural, than that the muſical
Accompanyment ſhould remain, though the Objects were changed. Of this Mode of
Piety we have a clear Inſtance in a Diſcourſe of AUGUSTINE, who condemned
the Practice; where, ſpeaking of CYPRIAN's Tomb, he ſays, 
<q rend="inline">"Not many Years ago, the Petulance of the Dancers

ſuppoſing this Practice to have ſtill ſubſiſted in ſome remote or
obſcure Part of ASIA or GREECE, it might na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally be adopted by Companies
of devout Pilgrims, in their Peregrinations to the holy Land: And thus the
ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred muſical Drama would be <hi>naturally produced.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In ITALY the Origin of the <hi>Oratorio</hi> is ſaid to have been
more recent, and clearly the Effect of an Imitation. We are told, that the
famous PHILIP DE NERY, a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of FLORENCE, and Founder of the Congregation
of the Prieſts of the <hi>Oratory</hi> in the Year 1540, obſerving the
ſtrong Paſſion of the <hi>Roman</hi> People for <hi>muſical
Repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations,</hi> invented the <hi>ſacred Drama,</hi> with a View to
their Improvement in Piety. Hence it is ſaid to have received the Name of
<hi>Oratorio,</hi> which it ſtill wears. The <hi>Opera,</hi> already
eſtabliſhed at VENICE and ROME, was his Model: He had little more to do,
than to change the Objects from <hi>Pagan</hi> to <hi>Chriſtian:</hi> And
thus from ITALY it ſpread into other Parts of EUROPE<note n="b" place="bottom">

            <p>The capital Impropriety and Defect of this Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, while it
wears the <hi>dramatic</hi> Form, is the perpetual Recitative or muſical
Accompanyment in the interlocutory Parts, ſimilar to that of the
<hi>Opera.</hi> This is a Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance ſo repugnant to modern Manners, and
therefore ſo far out of Nature, that no Audience can be much affected by the
Repreſentation, or take Part in an Action ſo impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably feigned. The
neceſſary Effect of This glaring Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probability is a general Inattention to
the <hi>Subject,</hi> and a Regard centered chiefly on the <hi>Muſic</hi> and
<hi>Execution.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of this Species of <hi>Poem</hi> the <hi>Italians</hi> have ſome
fine ones, written by METASTASIO. They cannot perhaps be rank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed 
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:0964200100:222"/> in the firſt Claſs, either for Sublimity or Pathos.
But Elegance of Style, Simplicity of Plan and Conduct, ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated by a noble
Spirit of Devotion, prevails throughout theſe Compoſitions. The
<hi>Muſic</hi> of the <hi>Oratorio</hi> in ITALY too much reſembles That of
the <hi>Opera:</hi> Simplicity, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, and devout Expreſſion, are
ſacrificed to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſer's Vanity or ill-directed Art.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Performance</hi> of this <hi>ſacred Drama</hi> in ITALY is
ſaid to be attended with many of the ſame Circumſtances of Impropriety
with that of the <hi>Opera,</hi> from which it had its Origin: All tending to
render it rather a Subject of mere Amuſement, than of Piety and Virtue. Add
to this, that being performed in the Churches, it may be queſtioned whether
the Drama be dignified, or the Temple prophaned, by ſo inadequate a
Repreſentation.</p>
            <p>In FRANCE, I do not find the <hi>Oratorio</hi> is now in Uſe: Its

            <p>In ENGLAND, this <hi>ſacred Drama</hi> is in ſome Reſpects

muſical Accompanyment, the leading Impropriety hath ariſen from an entire
<hi>Separation</hi> of the <hi>Poet's</hi> and <hi>Muſician's Office.</hi>
Even when the <hi>Poet</hi> remains <hi>principal,</hi> this Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration tends
to bad Effects: But to compleat the Evil, the <hi>Muſician's</hi> Character
hath here, in many Inſtances, aſſumed the <hi>Precedence</hi>; and the
<hi>Poet</hi> become <hi>ſubſervient</hi> to him, as his <hi>Director.</hi>
How this came to paſs, may be eaſily explained. This Kind of Poem being
unknown in ENG<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LAND <pb n="218" facs="tcp:0964200100:223" rendition="simple:additions"/> when HANDEL arrived; and that
great Muſician being the firſt who introduced the <hi>Oratorio</hi>; it
became a Matter of Neceſſity, that he ſhould <hi>employ</hi> ſome
Writer in his Service. Now this being a Degradation, to which Men of Genius
would not eaſily ſubmit, he was forced to apply to <hi>Verſifiers</hi>
inſtead of <hi>Poets.</hi> Thus the Poem was the Effect either of Hire or
Favour, when it ought to have been the voluntary Emanation of Genius. Hence,
moſt of the Poems he compoſed to, are ſuch, as would have ſunk and
diſgraced any other Muſic than his own.</p>
            <p>But although his exalted Genius bore itſelf up againſt this
Weight of Dulneſs; yet ſuch a leading Defect could not fail to have
eſſential Effects on the Muſician's Art. For although no Man ever
poſſeſſed greater Powers of muſical Expreſſion; yet, when the
Writer gave him ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times little, and ſometimes nothing to expreſs, the
main Foundation of his Art failed him: He was in the Situation of a great
Painter, who ſhould be deſtined to give Life by Colours, to a dead and
unmeaning Deſign<note n="d" place="bottom">The MESSIAH is an Exception to this
general Remark: Though that grand Muſical Entertainment is called an
<hi>Oratorio,</hi> yet it is not <hi>dramatic</hi>; but properly a Collection
of <hi>Hymns</hi> or <hi>Anthems</hi> drawn from the ſacred Scriptures: In
ſtrict Propriety, therefore, it falls under another Claſs of Compoſition,
which we have already conſidered.—The <hi>Oratorio</hi> of SAMSON is
properly <hi>dramatic:</hi> But the Poem is ſo much changed in the Attempt
towards accommodating it to Muſic, that it can hardly be regarded as the Work
of MILTON.—The L'ALLEGRO and IL PENSEROSO are two elegant Poems; and are
finely ſet to Muſic by HANDEL: But being merely <hi>deſcriptive,</hi> and
in no Degree <hi>pathetic,</hi> they cannot be ranked among the higheſt Forms
of Poetry; nor could they give Play to his higheſt Powers of
Expreſſion.</note>. Nay, even where any Degree of poetical Expreſſion
happened to give Play to his expreſſive Powers, yet ſtill, the general 
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:0964200100:224" rendition="simple:additions"/> Compoſition being unconnected, weak, and
unaffecting, there could be neither Contraſt nor Succeſſion of pathetic
Songs and Choirs; which, when properly united in one great Subject, heighten
each other by a continued Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, like the ſucceſſive Scenes of
a <hi>well-plan'd Tragedy.</hi> Had HANDEL's Airs and Choirs been compoſed in
this connected Manner, and the Probability of the Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in other
Reſpects preſerved, their Effect had been proportionable. At preſent,
being often disjoined, and deprived of that Connexion which ought to ariſe
from the Poet's Art, they loſe all the Force which an Accumulation of
Paſſion would have produced. They ſtand ſingle: While in a
well-conducted Poem, the Effect of every <hi>ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding</hi> Song or Choir
would be heightened by the Power of the <hi>preceding.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But while we pay all due Regard to the Memory of this great
Muſician, and acknowledge, nay maintain, that his Compoſitions often
ariſe to the higheſt Pitch of <hi>Sublimity</hi> and <hi>Pathos</hi>;
critical Juſtice demands ſome farther Remarks on this Subject, for the Sake
of future Artiſts.—As a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Conſequence, therefore, of the
<hi>Separation</hi> of the <hi>Poet's</hi> and <hi>Muſician's</hi> Province,
and of his too great At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to the <hi>latter</hi>; his Muſic is
ſometimes improperly conducted, even where it is not influenced by the
Defects of the Poem. From this Separation, in which he only complied with the
eſtabliſhed Practice of the Times, the following incidental Defects
naturally aroſe. 1. Too much muſical Diviſion upon ſingle Syllables, to
the Neglect of the Senſe and Meaning of the Song.—2. A partial
Imitation of incidental Words, inſtead of a proper Expreſſion of the
ruling Sentiments; even when ſuch Words and Sentiments happen to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:0964200100:225" rendition="simple:additions"/> to each other.—3. Solo Songs often too much
lengthened, without the Intervention of the Choir, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirit and
ſuſtain them: Eſpecially the <hi>Da Capo</hi> is almoſt in every
Inſtance of bad Effect, as it renders the firſt and capital Part of the
Song <hi>inſipid</hi> by an <hi>unmeaning Repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>—4. Choirs
ſometimes too much lengthened, without the Intervention of ſingle Songs or
Duets, for the neceſſary Repoſe of the Ear, which is apt to be fatigued
and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſted by ſuch a long-continued and forcible
Impreſſion.—5. Choirs ſometimes (though ſeldom) calculated more
for the Diſplay of the Compoſer's Art, in the Conſtruction of
<hi>Fugues</hi> and <hi>Canons,</hi> than for a natural Expreſſion of the
Subject.—6. The <hi>Choir</hi> in <hi>many</hi> Inſtances (and the
<hi>ſingle Song,</hi> in <hi>ſome)</hi> not <hi>ſudden</hi> enough in its
Intervention; being generally <hi>prepared</hi> by a correſpondent Symphony
of inſtrumental Muſic; which creates Expectation and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiment,
deſtroys Surprize, and thus <hi>leſſens</hi> the <hi>Impreſſion</hi>
and <hi>Effect.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Inſtances might be produced of all theſe Defects, in the
Compoſitions of this great Maſter: But they aroſe not ſo much from
Himſelf, as from the Period in which he lived. Therefore the Writer chuſeth
to caſt them into Shades, refering them to the Obſervation and Regard of
muſical Profeſſors rather than ſeem to fix a Mark of Diſreſpect on
any particular Compoſition of a Man whoſe exalted Genius he reveres. And
upon the whole, his <hi>Airs, Duets,</hi> and <hi>Choirs,</hi> as they
ſurpaſs every thing yet produced, in Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur and Expreſſion; ſo,
they will ever be the richeſt Fountain for <hi>Imitation</hi> or
<hi>Adoption</hi>; and, even ſingly taken, will juſtly command the Regard
and Admiration of all ſucceeding Ages.</p>

Reſpects may be cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured; in others, is to be approved. The Exhibition of
the Choir and accompanying Band is not only decent, but grand and ſtriking: A
becoming Gravity attends it, both among the Performers and the Audience. The
Airs and Choirs are often ſung with a Decorum not unſuitable to the Dignity
of the Occaſion. On the other Hand, there are Defects which naturally ariſe
from the <hi>Separation</hi> of the <hi>Performer's</hi> from the
<hi>Poet's</hi> and <hi>Muſician's</hi> Art.—The Singers are not always
ſo animated in their Manner, as to create a Belief in the Audience (whenever
a true poetic and muſical Expreſſion are united) that they feel the
Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents they expreſs. If a grand Simplicity of Performance were ſtill
more ſtudied, it would give an additional Luſtre to their Talents. Above

<hi>Bard's</hi> Character cannot again be <hi>generally</hi> and <hi>fully
united.</hi> We have ſeen, they na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally ſeparate in an early Period of
Civilization: And the Departments become ſo diſtinct, as to create a
general Incompatibility and Repugnance too clear to need an Illuſtration. But
although the Legiſlator can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not generally maintain the poetic and muſical
Character, he may ſtill continue to <hi>protect,</hi> and ſometimes even to

in a late <hi>Emperor</hi> to ſing in an Opera; as it was in LOUIS the
Fourteenth to dance on a parallel Occaſion; becauſe, in theſe
Inſtances, the Arts were ſeparated from their Important Ends. But it was a
noble Example in CHARLEMAGNE, when he dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified his Choir, by joining them in
the public Act of Religion, and ſinging divine Service in his imperial Robes.
HENRY the Second, and FRANCIS the Firſt, of FRANCE; CHARLES the Great, of

            <p>The <hi>Poet's</hi> and <hi>Muſician's</hi> Office cannot probably
be again united in their full and general Power. For in their preſent refined
State, either of their Arts ſeparately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, is of ſuch
<hi>Extent,</hi> that although they may inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally meet in one Perſon,
they cannot often be found together.—One Expedient there is, indeed, by
which the two Arts may be practically united by the ſame Perſon. That is,
if the <hi>Poet</hi> ſelect and adapt proper <hi>Muſic</hi> to his Poem; or
the <hi>Muſician</hi> ſelect and adapt proper <hi>Poetry</hi> to his
Muſic. Let us then conſider, which of theſe Methods is moſt likely to
ſucceed, in uniting the two Arts <hi>effectually.</hi> Now, though we
ſuppoſe the Muſician to be of ſufficient Ability to diſtinguiſh
<hi>good</hi> Poetry from <hi>bad</hi>; we muſt farther obſerve, that to
collect various Paſſages from vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Poets, and form them into one
<hi>whole</hi> with Propriety and Force, would be a Taſk difficult, if not
impoſſible: For the Expreſſions of Poetry are <hi>particular,</hi> and
un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterably <hi>appropriated</hi> to their Subject: They are therefore
generally incapable of a ſecond Application. The Fact is quite otherwiſe in
Muſic: For here, the Expreſſions are <hi>general</hi> and <hi>vague:</hi>
it is the <hi>Poetry</hi> to which they are applied, which fixeth and gives
them their <hi>particular Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion.</hi> 
               <pb n="224" facs="tcp:0964200100:231"/>
Therefore, a Selection of various Pieces may be made, and united in one
<hi>whole,</hi> with Propriety and Effect. This Union is indeed ſometimes
made in an unmeaning Way, in what the <hi>Italians</hi> call a
<hi>Paſticio:</hi> Where we commonly ſee a Series of Songs thrown together,
without Connexion or Deſign. But if we ſuppoſe a Poem properly conducted,
and adapted to Muſic of the firſt Excellence, in Subſerviency to the
Genius of the Poem; 'tis plain, that the Muſic ſo applied may acquire a
Force of Expreſſion more powerful in the <hi>ſecond</hi> Application than
in the <hi>firſt.</hi> As (to reſume a former Alluſion) the ſame Kind
of <hi>Colours</hi> may acquire a ſtronger Effect, by being employed on a
<hi>forcible</hi> than an <hi>inſipid Drawing.</hi> This is an <hi>Union</hi>
far eaſier to <hi>attempt,</hi> than to <hi>accompliſh.</hi> However; thus
much it ſeemed proper to remark, leſt every Endeavour of this Kind ſhould
be regarded as a mere <hi>Paſticio.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Singer's</hi> Profeſſion can ſeldom be united with
that of the <hi>Poet,</hi> and not generally with that of the
<hi>Muſician.</hi> The ſame Cauſe will maintain the Separation here, as
in the poetic and muſical Profeſſions. The Arts, in their preſent
refined and complicated State, ſeparately demand ſuch continued Application
and various Qualities, as ſeldom meet in the ſame Perſon.—'Tis the
Performer's Province, therefore, in this State of Separation, to conform to the
Genius of the <hi>Poem</hi> and the <hi>Muſic.</hi> As the Muſician is
ſubordinate to the Poet, ſo the Performer is ſubordinate to
<hi>Both.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Epic</hi> Poem cannot be again united with <hi>Muſic.</hi>
The Reaſons may be collected from the preceding Parts of this
Diſſertation. The long Narrations, the frequent Dialogue, the Mixture of
calm Deſcription and unim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſioned <pb n="225" facs="tcp:0964200100:232"/> Sentiment, all
theſe are clearly incompatible with the muſical Alliance, unleſs where
long-continued Cuſtom, and a Pre-Eſtabliſhment drawn from ſavage
Manners, had produced and confirmed an Union. But this, once broken, can never
be effectually reſtored: For it muſt ever want that Foundation of
<hi>Habit,</hi> on which it firſt aroſe, and gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed its Power<note n="d" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>See above, Sect. vi. Art. 10.</bibl>
               </note>.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Tragic</hi> Poem can never again be powerfully united with
Muſic. This repugnance ariſeth from the ſame Cauſe with the laſt. For
here, the continued muſical Accompanyment, mixing itſelf with the dramatic
Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter and the perpetual Dialogue, forms a <hi>whole</hi> ſo
incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patible with modern Manners, and ſo far out of known Nature, as
deſtroys that Probability which is the firſt Foundation of a true
Pathos.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Ode,</hi> or <hi>hymnal</hi> Species, may be again properly
and forcibly united with <hi>Muſic.</hi> We have already ſeen the
Foundation on which this Species is more univerſally al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied with Melody than
any other<note n="e" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>Sect. vi. Art. 17.</bibl>
               </note>. The
great Mean of their powerful Union muſt be a pathetic and correſpondent
Simplicity of Compoſition in Both.—With Reſpect to the pathetic
Simplicity of the <hi>Ode</hi>; although the obſcure, the learned, the cold,
the florid, the wordy, the amuſing Style, hath been too generally adopted by
the Moderns; yet this falſe Manner is not ſo ſtrongly eſtabliſhed, as
to preclude all Poſſibility of a general Reform: For we find, that where
the Poem is written in the ſimple, intelligible, and pathetic Form, it is
more generally approved (except only by <hi>mere Scholars</hi> who are ignorant
of Nature) than <pb n="226" facs="tcp:0964200100:233" rendition="simple:additions"/> the oppoſite Manner of falſe
Refinement. In Proof of this, we need only alledge the two noble Odes of POPE
and DRYDEN; which the world in general underſtand, feel, and admire.</p>
            <p>A <hi>ſimple</hi> and <hi>pathetic Melody</hi> may be no leſs
ſucceſsfully adopted, and applied to Poetry. This is evident, from the
incidental and frequent Practice of the greateſt Maſters. HANDEL, MARCELLO,
BONONCINI, CORELLI, GEMI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NIANI, and their beſt Diſciples, are often
admirable in the pathetic Simplicity of Song: More eſpecially they are ſo,
when they are fortunate enough to forget the Oſtenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Parade of Art.
The Succeſs is anſwerable to their Deſert: For this Simplicity of Style
is admired be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the artificial, by <hi>All,</hi> except only a <hi>Few,</hi>
whoſe Taſte (like that of the mere <hi>Scholar-Tribe)</hi> is debauched by
their own falſe Refinements<note n="f" place="bottom"> 
                  <p>Here it may be proper to point out, on what Foundation a
<hi>ſimple Melody</hi> is more <hi>pathetic</hi> than a <hi>complex</hi> and
<hi>artificial.</hi> 1. In the Expreſſion of the Paſſions, Nature doth
not offer muſical Sounds to the human Ear. For though the natural Tones of
<hi>Grief</hi> and <hi>Joy</hi> (the two Paſſions which are moſt
effectually expreſſed by Muſic) approach nearer to muſical Preciſion
than any other, yet ſtill they are in a certain Degree inconcinnous and
unmuſical. 2. As the Tones of the Paſſions are in ſome Degree
unmuſical, ſo are they generally more ſimple in their Compoſition or
Succeſſion, than the Tones which are commonly employed to form a regular
Melody. From the firſt of theſe Remarks it follows, that all muſical
Expreſſion of the Paſſions muſt be <hi>imperfect:</hi> For the
muſical Sounds not being found in Nature, if the Artiſt ſtrictly imitates
the Sounds he hears, they will be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſical; if he varies from Nature, ſo
as to make them muſical, the Imitation will be defective. Yet Imagination
hath a Power of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing its impreſſions on Reaſon, in a certain
Degree. This we find at the proper Repreſentation of a Tragedy; where, though
the Scenery, the Perſons, the Dreſſes, the Compoſition, and other
accompanying Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, are not a preciſe Tranſcript from Nature, that is,
though the Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation be defective, yet ſtill it is highly affecting: But if
the Repreſentation departs from Nature beyond a certain Degree, Reaſon then
revolts, and the affecting Power is loſt: And thus muſical Imitation,
though imperfect in a certain Degree, ſtill boaſts its Power: If imperfect
<hi>beyond</hi> a certain Degree, its affecting Power is loſt. But as it
follows from the ſecond Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, that the farther muſical Sounds depart
from <hi>Simplicity,</hi> the farther they depart from <hi>Nature</hi>; ſo,
the Conſequence is clear, that a <hi>ſimple Melody</hi> (though an
imperfect Imitation) may be <hi>pathetic</hi>; while a <hi>complex</hi> and
<hi>artificial</hi> Melody (by departing from Nature beyond a certain Degree)
will entirely <hi>loſe</hi> its <hi>affecting Power.</hi>
                  </p> 
                  <p>This naturally leads to the Conſideration of a myſterious
Circumſtance, which lies yet unaccounted for, at the very Foundation of
muſical Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion. The Fact is this; that 
<q rend="inline">"muſical Sounds which are employed to
expreſs Paſſions (as Grief or Joy) by an <hi>imperfect Imitation,</hi>
are often <hi>more affecting</hi> than the <hi>natural</hi> or <hi>perfect
Voice</hi> of theſe Paſſions, when given without muſical
Intonations."</q>—It ſeems not eaſy to aſſign a clear and
ſufficient Cauſe for this Appearance. Let the following Conjectures have
what Weight they may.—1. Have not muſical Sounds a mechanical Power
over the human Frame, by which they awaken it into a higher Degree of
<hi>Senſibility</hi> and <hi>Sympathy,</hi> than it poſſeſſeth in its
more <hi>cool</hi> and <hi>torpid</hi> State?—2. Are we not generally
ſo conſtituted, as to ſympathize much more ſtrongly with thoſe in
whom we find amiable Qualities, than their Oppoſites? And as Pity melts the
Soul to Love, ſo doth not Love melt the Soul to Pity?—3. Doth not a
<hi>ſweet Voice,</hi> like a <hi>fine Countenance,</hi> create a ſtrong
<hi>Prejudice</hi> in <hi>Favour</hi> of its <hi>Poſſeſſor,</hi> and
induce a <hi>Belief</hi> of <hi>amiable</hi> inherent
<hi>Qualities?</hi>—4. May not the Voice and Figure of a diſtreſſed
or joyous Object be ſo horrid or uncouth, ridiculous or ugly, as in a great
Meaſure to leſſen, if not totally to deſtroy the Sympathy of thoſe
who hear and ſee it?—If theſe Obſervations be true, then by
carrying the Voices or Expreſſions of Grief or Joy into ſweeter Tones and
higher Degrees of Melody than they poſſeſs in Nature, yet ſtill
preſerving the Reſemblance ſo far as not to deſtroy Probability, may we
not, on the Principles here given, create a higher Degree of Affection and
Sympathy, than the natural Voice of the Paſſions can give?</p>
               </note>.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="227" facs="tcp:0964200100:234"/>Yet there is one Circumſtance, in which
modern Poetry and Muſic, though both reduced to their full Simplicity, cannot
obtain that perfect Union which they held in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient GREECE. The Numbers of
the Poem and the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure <pb n="228" facs="tcp:0964200100:235"/> of the Muſic will
inevitably ſometimes claſh. That Variety of Feet with which the Greek
Tongue abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, gave ſuch Play to the Muſician's Art, in adapting a
<hi>various</hi> and <hi>correſpondent Melody,</hi> as no living Language can
boaſt. For Want of this Variety of Feet, there is generally a <hi>dead
Uniformity</hi> in the Structure of modern Verſe. The muſical Rythm or
Meaſure, therefore, muſt either want the neceſſary <hi>Variety,</hi> or
muſt <hi>ſometimes</hi> be at Variance with the poetic Numbers.</p>
            <p>The Arts of Poetry and Muſic, thus properly united and improved,
may poſſibly by Degrees be made a Part of <hi>Education,</hi> and applied
to the Culture of the youthful Mind, in Subjects <hi>religious, political,</hi>
and <hi>moral.</hi> This is a large Field of Obſervation, which at preſent
it may be more prudent rather to <hi>open</hi> than to <hi>tread.</hi> In
Favour of this Opinion, we may recollect the wonderful Powers of theſe united
Arts, exhibited above, not only in the Scenes of ſavage Nature, but among the
civilized Republics of ancient GREECE. And as we poſſeſs a nobler
Syſtem of Religion, Polity, and Morals, than they could ever boaſt; ſo
the Application of the Siſter Arts to theſe, under a ſtrict Subordination
to Truth, might ſeem to promiſe the nobleſt Conſequences in the
Education of Youth. Yet on the other Hand, it muſt be owned, that under the
preſent State of Manners, and the eſtabliſhed Forms of Education, this
event is rather to be wiſhed than hoped for. Inſtead, therefore, of urging
a Theory which might be regarded as viſionary and chimerical; the Writer will
for the preſent content himſelf with pointing out, 
<q rend="inline">"In what Reſpects the four principal Kinds, in
which Poetry and Muſic are now united, may be either improved in their Form,
or more effectually directed to their proper Ends."</q>

common <hi>Song</hi> or <hi>Canzonette,</hi> may perhaps be judged an Object
too inconſiderable for any ſerious Propoſal of a Reform. But the Writer
will not be aſhamed to follow the Example of the greateſt Authors among the
ancient <hi>Greeks,</hi> in recommending the early Practice of a proper
domeſtic Muſic, as tending powerfully to ſooth the diſcordant
Paſſions, to influence the Taſte, and fix the morals of Youth. If we
reflect, now apt the youthful Ear is to catch muſical Impreſſions, and
how open the Heart to every Impreſſion ſo forcibly convey'd, it cannot be
regarded as a Matter of Indifference (among thoſe who underſtand the Force
of early Habits) whether theſe firſt impreſſions be <hi>properly</hi>
or <hi>improperly</hi> directed. It may ſeem a Paradox, though perhaps a
cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Truth, that the future and leading Colour of the Paſſions, in both
Sexes, hath often been determined by a <hi>Song.</hi> Poets and Muſicians,
therefore, would do them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the trueſt Honour, if they would
religiouſly abſtain from lending the attractive Colours of their
reſpective Arts to the Embelliſhment of Licentiouſneſs and Vice.</p>
            <p>The Writer would not ſubject himſelf to ſuch an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of
Ignorance, as to ſuggeſt the Poſſibility of renewing the old
<hi>Grecian</hi> Practice, when Men of the firſt Rank and Dignity diſdained
not to grace the Feaſt with Songs <hi>religious, political,</hi> and
<hi>moral</hi>; with the Celebration of <hi>Gods, Heroes,</hi> and
<hi>Virtues:</hi> At the very Mention of this obſolete Practice, he ſees
Ridicule pouring in from every Quarter. 'Tis enough to hope from the preſent
<hi>faſhionable</hi> World, that they will <hi>abſtain</hi> from
<hi>Songs</hi> of an <hi>oppoſite Nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="230" facs="tcp:0964200100:237"/>As the practicable Utility of the common
<hi>Song</hi> or <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zonette</hi> ſeems to lie chiefly among the younger
ranks, an eaſy and familiar Simplicity of Style and Manner ſeems peculiarly
its proper Character. To this ought to be added (where the Subject will admit)
a certain Feſtivity and Brilliancy of Taſte; that the moſt attractive
Colours of the Arts may be thrown on Virtue; and Benevolence, Generoſity, and
Greatneſs of Soul, may habitually mix themſelves with domeſtic and
ſocial Amuſement.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>Anthem,</hi> with Reſpect to its
<hi>Subject,</hi> neither needs nor admits Improvement; being drawn from the
ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Scriptures<note n="g" place="bottom">Although it be a prudent Reſerve
in the Church of ENGLAND, to admit no other Poetry than the <hi>ſacred,</hi>
into divine Service; yet ſtill, for the high Purpoſe of domeſtic or
private Devotion and Practice, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of <hi>Hymns</hi> would be a
noble Addition to the Poetry and Muſic of a rational Society of Chriſtians.
Here, the Poet would have Room for a Diſplay of that Genius, which the
Prudence of the eſtabliſhed Church hath prevented, in the wiſe Regulation
of her public Service. Of this Kind may be juſtly regarded that fine
<hi>Ode</hi> of POPE, intitled, "<hi>The dying Chriſtian to his
Soul.</hi>"</note>. A proper <hi>Selection</hi> of Words for Muſic is indeed
a Work of Importance here: And though in many Inſtances this be well made,
yet it were to be wiſhed, that ſome ſuperior Judgment would
<hi>overſee,</hi> and ſometimes <hi>(negatively</hi> at leaſt)
<hi>direct</hi> the Compoſer, for the Preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Improprieties.</hi>
A parallel remark will extend it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf almoſt to the whole Book of Pſalms,
as they are verſified by STERNHOLD, for the Uſe of parochial Churches.
There are few Stanzas which do not preſent Expreſſions, to excite the
Ridicule of ſome Part of every Congregation. This Verſion might well be
aboliſhed, as it expoſeth one of the nobleſt Parts of divine Service to
Contempt: Eſpecially as there is another Verſion already 
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:0964200100:238" rendition="simple:additions"/> privileged, which though not excellent, is
however <hi>not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable.</hi>—The <hi>parochial Muſic</hi> ſeems
to need no Reform: Its Simplicity and Solemnity ſuit well its general
Deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; and it is of Power, when properly performed, to raiſe
Affections of the nobleſt Nature. It were to be wiſhed, that the
<hi>Cathedral Muſic</hi> were always compoſed with a proportioned Sobriety
and Reſerve. Here, as we have obſerved, the whole is apt to degenerate too
much into an Affair of Art. A great and pathetic Simplicity of Style, kept ever
in Subſerviency to the ſacred Poetry, ought to be aimed at, as the
trueſt, and the only Praiſe. The ſame devout Simplicity of Manner may be
attained in the Performance, and ought to be ſtudied by the Organiſt and
<hi>Choir:</hi> Their Ambition ſhould lie in a natural and dignified
Execution, not in a curious Diſplay of Art. The Maxim of AUGUSTINE was
excellent, and deſerves the ſerious Attention both of thoſe who perform,
and thoſe who hear: 
<q rend="inline">"I always think myſelf blameable, when I am drawn
to attend more to the <hi>Singer</hi> than to <hi>what is Sung.</hi>"</q> But
an additional Circumſtance ſeems neceſſary, as a Means of bringing back
Church Muſic to its original Dignity and Uſe: We have ſeen, in the
Courſe of this Diſſertation, how the Separations follow each other in the
Decline of the poetic and muſical Arts. And for the ſake of Truth, we
muſt here obſerve, that in the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of Cathedral Muſic, a
Separation hath long taken Place, fatal to its true Utility. The higher Ranks
of the Church do not think themſelves concerned in the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance. It were
devoutly to be wiſhed, that the muſical Education were ſo general, as to
enable the Clergy, of whatever Rank, to join the Choir in the Celebration of 
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:0964200100:239"/> their Creator, in all its appointed Forms: The Laity
would be naturally led to follow ſo powerful an Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.—There is
Reaſon to believe, that this Separation was in Part occaſioned by the
Introduction of an artificial Muſic, which became too difficult in the
Execution for any but profeſſed Muſicians: Here, then, we find an
ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional Motive, for bringing down the Cathedral Muſic from its preſent
complex and artificial Style, to that of Simplicity and eaſy Execution.</p>
            <p n="3">3. With Reſpect to the two dramatic Forms, the
<hi>Opera</hi> and <hi>Oratorio,</hi> we have already pointed out their chief
Defects, as they exiſt in their preſent State. But as to an effectual
Reformation, ſuch as may produce their proper <hi>Ends,</hi> it ſeems
utterly impracticable, while the <hi>dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic Form</hi> and the <hi>muſical
Accompanyment</hi> remain in <hi>Union.</hi> To hear Kings, Warriours,
Stateſmen, Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers, Patriarchs, Saints, and Martyrs, holding long
Converſations with each other in muſical Recitative, is a Circumſtance
ſo totally out of Nature, that the Imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation immediately revolts, and
rejects the Repreſentation as abſurd and incredible. The
<hi>Recitative,</hi> therefore, or perpetual muſical Accompanyment which
prevails in both, being thus unalterably at Variance with the <hi>dramatic
Form,</hi> the <hi>one</hi> or the <hi>other</hi> muſt be
<hi>deſtroyed</hi> ere <hi>Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility</hi> and <hi>Pathos</hi> can
ariſe.</p>
            <p>One Method of a Reform may be effected, by deſtroying the
<hi>Recitative,</hi> or perpetual <hi>muſical</hi> Accompanyment: And in this
Caſe, the Interlocutory Part would ſink into the common Form of
<hi>Tragedy.</hi> A <hi>muſical Choir,</hi> diſtinct from the Perſons of
the Drama, might ſtill be introduced <pb n="233" facs="tcp:0964200100:240"/>
               <hi>occaſionally,</hi> with much Propriety and Effect<note n="h" place="bottom">I ſay, <hi>occaſionally:</hi> For the <hi>continuing</hi>
Choir of the old <hi>Greek</hi> Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy would be a Circumſtance as far out
of Nature, as the Recitative it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Beſides, the perpetual and continuing
Choir would rob modern Tragedy of half her Powers and Graces: A ſtrict Unity
of Place and Time, as we have ſeen, are its neceſſary Conſequences<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <bibl>See above, Sect. vi. Art. 22.</bibl>
                  </note> But with
Reſpect to what is of far greater Importance, I mean the <hi>Action,</hi> its
Effects upon the whole were <hi>bad.</hi> 'Tis true, that even here, it had the
natural Effect of producing <hi>Unity:</hi> But while it ſecured the
<hi>Unity</hi> of the <hi>Action,</hi> it gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally deſtroyed its
<hi>Force.</hi> For there are few great, diſtreſsful, or terrible Actions,
which do not require ſome <hi>Variety</hi> of <hi>Place,</hi> in Order to
unfold them in all their moſt pathetic Situations and ſtriking Aſpects:
Many of theſe, therefore, muſt be loſt to the Poet and his Audience, and
a feeble and meagre Fable muſt generally ariſe from that ſtrict Unity of
Place which the continuing Choir produced. Hence we often find the Greek
Tragedians reduced to the Neceſſity of conveying by Narration many
affecting Incidents, which would have formed capital Scenes, could they have
been introduced conſiſtently with the Unity of Place. Were it neceſſary
to inlarge on this Subject, which is not incurious, it might be proved by an
Induction of particulars, that there is not a great and affecting Tragic Action
in the whole Compaſs of Antiquity, but what is miſerably cramped and maimed
by this Conſtraint; <hi>That</hi> of the <hi>Oedipus Tyrannus</hi> only
excepted, which indeed ſeems nearly, if not abſolutely perfect, in all the
Parts of its Conſtruction.</note>. Above all, the Occoſions muſt have a
ſtrong Reference to the moſt pathetic Situations of the tragic action: The
<hi>Choir</hi> muſt conſiſt of ſuch Characters, as may with
<hi>Probability</hi> appear in the muſical Department: The Ode muſt be
written in the Style of Paſſion; not with the Parade of unaffecting
Imagery, or tedious Allegory; which, inſtead of rowzing an Audience, would
lull them to Repoſe: The Muſic and Performance muſt be of a
correſpondent Nature. In pointing out this Reform of the muſical Drama, the
Writer may ſeem to ſeparate the two Siſter <pb n="232" facs="tcp:0964200100:241"/>
               <gap reason="duplicate" resp="#OXF" extent="1 page">

               <pb n="234" facs="tcp:0964200100:243"/> Arts,
inſtead of uniting them: But in Reality, he only propoſes their Separation
in one Circumſtance, as the neceſſary means of compleating their Union in
another.</p>
            <p>But leſt this ſhould ſeem to confine the muſical Art to an
Alliance with the mere <hi>Ode</hi> or <hi>Hymn</hi> only, and to baniſh it
entirely from the Repreſentation of <hi>Actions</hi>; let us now proceed to
another and more perfect Kind of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, in which many of the
<hi>Subjects</hi> of the <hi>Opera</hi> and <hi>Oratorio</hi> may be exhibited
in <hi>full Union</hi> with the <hi>Powers of Muſic,</hi> joined with
<hi>Probability</hi> and <hi>Nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We have ſeen above, that from an Union of the <hi>Ode</hi> and
<hi>Epic,</hi> a firſt rude Outline of Tragedy naturally aroſe, compounded
of <hi>muſical Narration</hi> and <hi>choral Song</hi>
               <note n="i" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>See above, Sect. vi. Art. 19.</bibl>
               </note>. Here then let
us fix, for the proper Form of the muſical Exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of great, terrible, or
pathetic Actions. This Union forms what may properly be ſtyled the
<hi>Narrative</hi> or <hi>Epic Ode.</hi> It aroſe from Nature, at a Period
when the Actions repreſented were of the <hi>ſimpleſt</hi> Kind<note n="k" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>See ibid.</bibl>
               </note>. This Simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of Action is
ſtill neceſſary to be preſerved, for the Perfection of this Species;
becauſe a complicated Action would inevitably produce long and unanimated
Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, would unnerve the muſical Recitation, and deſtroy the very
Genius of the Poem. Suppoſing, then, the Action to be ſimple and
impaſſioned; the <hi>Poem,</hi> the <hi>Muſic,</hi> and
<hi>Performance,</hi> if well conducted, will be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with ſuch a Degree
of <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Probability,</hi> as will give the Alliance of
Poetry and Muſic their higheſt Power and Pathos. The intermixed Narrations
muſt be ſhort and animated: The Songs and Choirs various and 
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:0964200100:244"/> expreſſive; and being frequently interrupted by the
brief Recitals, may by theſe Means be inſpirited far beyond the ſimple
and continued Ode, which from its unbroken Length often degenerates into
Languor. By this Union, all the ſtriking Parts of the Action may be brought
forth to View, while every thing that is cold, improbable, and unaffecting, may
be veiled in Darkneſs.—The <hi>Recitative,</hi> or muſical
Accompanyment in the <hi>narrative</hi> Parts, will <hi>here</hi> loſe a
great Part of that Improbability which incumbers it in the <hi>dramatic</hi>
Repreſentation: For <hi>here,</hi> the <hi>Reciter</hi> is a profeſſed
Muſician, whoſe Province lies in the Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſm of Song; and the
<hi>Narrations</hi> being <hi>ſhort</hi> and <hi>animated,</hi> beyond what
is poſſible in the continued Uſe of <hi>Dialogue,</hi> they approach
nearer to the Genius of the <hi>Ode,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore may without
Improbability or Impropriety receive a muſical Accompanyment which approaches
nearer to a full and direct Song.—And laſtly, the <hi>Songs</hi> and
<hi>Choirs</hi> are in their Performance ſo far from being unnatural, that
they are no more than a powerful Tranſcript from Nature, impelling thoſe
who hear the Recital of the Action, and are inſtructed in the Laws of Melody,
to join in every repreſented Scene of Joy, Triumph, Terror, Exultation,
Devotion, or Diſtreſs.</p>
            <p>Of this <hi>narrative or Epic Ode,</hi> we have two fine Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
in our Language, written by POPE and DRYDEN. In Force of Paſſion, and
Variety of correſpondent Verſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication<note n="l" place="bottom">We have
ſhewn above, that the Return of the <hi>ſame Meaſure</hi> in the
<hi>Strophe, Antiſtrophe,</hi> and <hi>Epode,</hi> of the ancient <hi>Greek
Ode,</hi> was the natural Conſequence of its Union with the <hi>Dance.</hi>
But this Union being irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverably loſt, the unvaried Meaſure of the Ode
becomes at beſt an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaning Thing; and is indeed an abſurd one, as it
deprives the Poet of that Variety of Meaſure, which often gives a great
Energy to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, by the incidental and ſudden Intervention of an
<hi>abrupt</hi> or <hi>lengthened</hi> Verſification. The two Odes here
mentioned, contain a Variety of fine Examples in this Kind of Beauty.</note>,
they are admirable. The Songs and Choirs <pb n="236" facs="tcp:0964200100:245"/> are by Turns
tender, joyous, and majeſtic, and are often calculated for the nobleſt and
moſt powerful Union of Poetry and Muſic. On the other Hand, while their
un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rivalled Excellence is admitted, critical Juſtice demands, that we point
out ſome Blemiſhes in theſe two immortal Odes, leſt an
undiſtinguiſhing Principle of Imitation ſhould lead to an Adoption of
their Faults along with their Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.—With Reſpect to Mr. POPE's Ode
on St. CECILIA's Day, the <hi>Subject</hi> ſeems to want <hi>Unity:</hi> It
is not a Recital of <hi>one</hi> great Action, but rather a poetic
Deſcription of the <hi>Adventures</hi> of ORPHEUS.—Mr. DRYDEN's Ode is
perfect in the Unity of the Action; but <hi>imperfect</hi> in the <hi>moral
End:</hi> For it is a Repreſentation of the abuſed Power of Muſic, in
firing a young Prince to an Act of Revenge and Cruelty. In the Execution, there
is but one Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of Conſequence; which ſeems to run through both theſe
Odes, ſo juſtly celebrated: The <hi>Narrative</hi> Part is not always
ſufficiently <hi>diſtinguiſhed</hi> from the <hi>Song.</hi> They run into
each other in ſuch a Manner, that the muſical Compoſer muſt often find
himſelf embaraſſed, whether to accompany with Recitative, or a more
compleat Melody. Indeed, it is manifeſt, that theſe illuſtrious Poets
were not aware of this Diſtinction: And hence it came to paſs, that many
Paſſages which they evidently meant for <hi>Song,</hi> are in the Form of
<hi>Narration.</hi> But let this be added, as a Juſtice due to theſe
celebrated Names, that the Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations <pb n="237" facs="tcp:0964200100:246"/> are in ſome
Parts ſo highly animated, that without any ſtriking Impropriety they admit
the Accompanyment either of the Song or Choir. 'Tis obvious to remark, that
HANDEL was ſometimes perplexed by this Irregularity of the poetic
Compoſition, when he ſet DRYDEN's Ode to Muſic: For ſome Parts are
thrown into Recitative which might ſeem rather to demand the Song; and others
are thrown into Song, which, in their preſent Narrative Form, ſeem rather
to demand the Recitative.—A Poet of inferior Rank<note n="m" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>Mr. HUGHES.</bibl>
               </note> hath attempted to rectify this
Diſorder in DRYDEN's <hi>Ode.</hi> But he had not ſufficiently eſtimated
his own Strength, when he adventured to tamper with the Bow of ULYSSES.
Whenever he hath attempted a <hi>Change,</hi> he hath quenched the poetic
Fire.</p>
            <p>The Subjects of the narrative or <hi>Epic Ode</hi> may be drawn with
Propriety either from <hi>ethnical</hi> or <hi>ſacred Story.</hi> The
<hi>ethnical</hi> will furniſh thoſe which are <hi>moral</hi> or
<hi>political</hi>; the <hi>ſacred</hi> is a rich Field of Subjects
<hi>moral</hi> and <hi>religious.</hi> There is a peculiar Propriety in
exhibiting the ſacred Story in this Manner of the <hi>Epic Ode</hi>;
becauſe in the dramatic Repreſentation of antique Subjects, through the
great Diſſimilarity of ancient Manners to our own, 'tis difficult to avoid
the Introduction of Circumſtances which will not be either manifeſtly
<hi>incongruous,</hi> or <hi>contemptible</hi> to an <hi>Eye</hi> merely
<hi>modern</hi>; two Appearances, which are carefully to be avoided in the
Repreſentation of ſacred Story. The Way of <hi>Narration,</hi> therefore,
is highly preferable; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in this, the Poet can produce the greateſt
and moſt ſtriking Situations, and at the ſame Time preſerve both
<hi>Probability</hi> and <hi>Reſpect,</hi> by throwing the reſt into
Shades.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="238" facs="tcp:0964200100:247"/>That this Repreſentation of ſacred
Subjects is the higheſt and moſt intereſting Union of Poetry and Muſic,
needs no elaborate Proof: It ſtands intimately connected with all the
ſublime Truths, the great and affecting Events of our Religion, which, when
thus exhibited by the united Powers of <hi>Poem</hi> and <hi>Song,</hi> call
forth all the nobleſt Emotions of the human Soul; and exalt it to the
higheſt Pitch of Elevation that our mortal Condition will admit.</p>

            <p>THUS far then, at leaſt, the poetic and muſical Arts may admit
an effectual Re-union, ſo as to produce their nobleſt Ends. As to any
farther Conſequences, they muſt be the Effect of this firſt Reform: And
therefore, till ſomething be done here, it can be of no Importance to point
out higher Improvements, which in the preſent State of Things would certainly
be eſteemed chimerical.</p>
            <p>Let us then, for the preſent, conclude with offering a Queſtion,

<q rend="inline">"Whether our Age and Nation might not ſtill
farther diſtinguiſh itſelf in its Regard for the nobler Arts, by the
Inſtitution of <hi>A Poetic and Muſical Academy,</hi> for the more
effectual <hi>Re-union</hi> of theſe two Arts, and their better
<hi>Direction</hi> to their <hi>higheſt Ends?</hi>"</q>—The Judgment of
an able and diſintereſted Society, eſtabliſhed for this Purpoſe,
might perhaps effect every Reform here propoſed in the four diſtinct
Species in which the two Arts are ſtill imperfectly and improperly united.
The Prize muſt be Honour only; leſt mercenary Spirits <pb n="239" facs="tcp:0964200100:248"/> ſhould intrude upon the Walk of Genius. It may be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed,
that the beſt Poets, of the riſing Age at leaſt, would court the
Approbation of ſuch an Academy: And from this Inſtitution, as from a
Nurſery of theſe Siſter-Arts, a Succeſſion of approved Poems would
naturally ariſe, in every Form that could properly receive the Colourings and
Embelliſhments of Muſic.—The familiar <hi>Song,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed for
domeſtic and ſocial Entertainment, when thus chaſtiſed by the moral
Decrees of the Academy, would gradually riſe into its ancient Dignity and
Uſe.—The Selection of the <hi>Anthem</hi> from the ſacred Scriptures
might receive the public Approbation of the Society: And the <hi>Hymn,</hi>
controuled by the ſame ſober Judgments, would aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume that pathetic
Sublimity and Simplicity of Style, which tends to elevate the Soul to the
Contemplation and Love of divine Things.—The <hi>tragic Choir,</hi>
properly reſtrained and limited by ſuch an Authority, might
<hi>oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſionally</hi> be introduced and applied to the Increaſe of Pity
and Terror, and to all the moral Ends of the dramatic Species. The <hi>Epic
Ode,</hi> directed by the Taſte and Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of this Academy, would obtain
its Completion. The greateſt and moſt affecting Subjects, drawn from the
Hiſtory of our own or other Countries, would riſe before us; while the
ſublimeſt and moſt intereſting Events re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in the ſacred
Scriptures, thus recommended and adorned, would make their Way through the
nobler Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to the Heart.</p>
            <p>The State and Character of our <hi>Muſic</hi> would be no leſs
influenced by the Authority of ſuch an Inſtitution. The Poems which
ſhould receive its unbiaſſed Approbation, would naturally become Objects
of the Ambition of our <pb n="240" facs="tcp:0964200100:249" rendition="simple:additions"/> beſt
<hi>Compoſers:</hi> Whoſe Genius, thus chaſtiſed and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to its
proper Ends, would no longer wander into the illegitimate Fantaſies of Song;
but in juſt Subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination to the poetic Expreſſions, would only be
am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious of joining its Powers, for the Production of a true

            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Performance</hi> of theſe approved <hi>Poems</hi> thus
heighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by approved <hi>Muſic,</hi> would naturally correſpond with the
Genius of Both, if under the Controul of the ſame wiſe Judgments. The
<hi>Singers</hi> would no longer think themſelves at Liberty to deſert
their Subject for the Pride of Execution: But, under the Inſpection of a
ſuperior Taſte and Authority, would be led to adopt a true Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of
Manner; and, like the juſt <hi>Actor,</hi> would be only ambitious of
aſſiſting the Poet and Muſician, in adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and compleating the
intended Repreſentation.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Importance</hi> of ſuch an Inſtitution may deſerve our
moſt ſerious thoughts. We have ſeen above, how con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genial the
<hi>poetic</hi> and <hi>muſical</hi> Arts are with the Frame and Faculties of
Man: That in every Period of Manners, whether ſavage, barbarous, civilized,
refined, or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, their Influence hath been felt in every Nation of the
Earth. So univerſal and powerful are their Effects on the Paſſions of the
Soul, that perhaps no Period of human Nature can be aſſigned (at leaſt,
the Writer knows of none) in which they have not been either
<hi>ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary</hi> or <hi>pernicious:</hi> In which they have not either
tended to promote and confirm Religion, Virtue, and public Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs; or
been the Inſtruments of Licentiouſneſs, and public Ruin.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="241" facs="tcp:0964200100:250" rendition="simple:additions"/>Add to this, that whoever will look
back into the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding Pages, will find that in all <hi>poliſhed
States</hi> theſe Arts have a natural Tendency towards Corruption, unleſs
checked and chaſtiſed by wholeſome Inſtitutions. This Tendency
ariſeth not from the Nature of the Arts them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; but from that
<hi>Period of Manners,</hi> which tends to pervert them from their <hi>proper
Ends.</hi>—Would you quench this natural Flame implanted in the human
Breaſt? The Attempt were Folly. You muſt deſtroy our <hi>Eyes</hi> and
<hi>Ears,</hi> thoſe Inlets to the Powers of <hi>Poetry</hi> and
<hi>Muſic,</hi> before you can accompliſh ſuch a Purpoſe. What then is
to be done, but to regulate this mighty Stream, which will inevitably run
either in the Channel of <hi>Vice</hi> or <hi>Virtue?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>More particularly, in a great and powerful Kingdom, where additional
Degrees of Wealth ſhould flow in with every Tide; theſe, eſpecially in a
Time of Peace, muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitably be followed by new Degrees of inventive
Luxury, and an unwearied Paſſion for Diſſipation and Amuſement. Hence
the peculiar Danger would ariſe, even where no ill Intentions ſhould dwell,
of a Perverſion of the <hi>mimetic,</hi> and eſpecially, of the
<hi>poetic</hi> and <hi>muſical Arts,</hi> from their proper and exalted, to
their improper and ignoble Ends.—If in ſuch a Kingdom, their loweſt
Forms ſhould be ſought for, while their higher were neglected; if Tragedy
ſhould give Way to Comedy, and Comedy to Farce, and Farce to Pantomime; if
Privileges ſhould be denied to the <hi>Labours</hi> of <hi>Genius,</hi> which
were indulged to the Tricks of <hi>Harlequin</hi> and
<hi>Pierot</hi>;—what could be more juſtly feared, than a general
Decline of Taſte, which by ſilent and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perceived Degrees might
inſenſibly ſlide into the ſame <pb n="242" facs="tcp:0964200100:251" rendition="simple:additions"/> fatal
Effects, which marked the later Periods of the <hi>Greek</hi> Republics, and
the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire?</p>
            <p>On the contrary; an effectual Union of theſe two power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Arts,
directed to their proper Ends, would be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive of the nobleſt
Conſequences: It would renew and augment the Dignity of every elegant
Accompliſhment; would refine the Taſte, inforce the Religion, purify the
Morals, ſtrengthen the Policy, of the moſt proſperous Kingdom; in a Word,
would give a proper and ſalutary Direction to that Overflow of Wealth, which
muſt either <hi>adorn</hi> or <hi>overwhelm</hi> it.</p>
            <p>An <hi>Inſtitution,</hi> therefore, which may promote ſuch
<hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Ends,</hi> may ſeem not only to claim the Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the
<hi>Wiſe</hi> and <hi>Good</hi> in every private Station; but might perhaps
be regarded as not unworthy the <hi>Protection</hi> of the <hi>beſt</hi> and
<hi>greateſt</hi> KING.</p>

Underſtanding by credible Report, that the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed Place for the

            <p>From this Commiſſion it appears, 1<hi rend="sup">ſt</hi>, That although many
of the <hi>Bards</hi> were maſſacred by EDWARD the Firſt, yet the whole
<hi>Order</hi> was by no means exterminated. 2<hi rend="sup">dly</hi>, That in the Reign of
ELIZABETH, Abuſes had crept on among the <hi>Welſh Bards,</hi> ſimilar to
thoſe which are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded of the <hi>Iriſh.</hi> 3<hi rend="sup">dly</hi>, That public
<hi>Conteſts</hi> for <hi>poetic</hi> and <hi>muſical Fame</hi> had been
eſtabliſhed in <hi>Wales</hi> from an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Times. 4<hi rend="sup">thly</hi>, That theſe
Conteſts are now ceaſed.</p>
            <p>In Wotton's "Leges Wallicae," (Append, p. 547, 548.) there are two
Laws of Henry the Fourth recorded, which relate to the Prevention of the
Abuſes of the Bard's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion; but in ſuch general Terms, that
nothing relative to the particular State of their Muſic and Poetry can be
collected from them.</p>
            <p>The Author will eſteem it a ſingular Favour, if any Gentleman
can tranſmit to him an authentic Account of the final Decline of the Bard's
Profeſſion in Wales.</p>
