            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE public may depend on the
following fragments as genuine
remains of ancient Scottiſh poetry. The
date of their compoſition cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
actly aſcertained. Tradition, in the
country where they were written, refers
them to an aera of the moſt remote anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity:
and this tradition is ſupported by
the ſpirit and ſtrain of the poems them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;
which abound with thoſe
ideas, and paint thoſe manners, that
belong to the moſt early ſtate of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety.
The diction too, in the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
is very obſolete; and differs wide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
from the ſtyle of ſuch poems as have
been written in the ſame language two
or three centuries ago. They were cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
compoſed before the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0245000200:3"/>
of clanſhip in the northern part
of Scotland, which is itſelf very an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient;
for had clans been then formed
and known, they muſt have made a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
figure in the work of a Highland
Bard; whereas there is not the leaſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of them in theſe poems. It is remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
that there are found in them no allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
to the Chriſtian religion or worſhip;
indeed, few traces of religion of any kind.
One circumſtance ſeems to prove them
to be coeval with the very infancy of
Chriſtianity in Scotland. In a frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the ſame poems, which the
tranſlator has ſeen, a Culdee or Monk
is repreſented as deſirous to take down
in writing from the mouth of Oſcian,
who is the principal perſonage in ſeveral
of the following fragments, his warlike
atchievements and thoſe of his family.
But Oſcian treats the monk and his reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
with diſdain, telling him, that the
deeds of ſuch great men were ſubjects too
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:0245000200:4"/>
high to be recorded by him, or by any
of his religion: A full proof that
Chriſtianity was not as yet eſtabliſhed
in the country.</p>
            <p>Though the poems now publiſhed
appear as detached pieces in this col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection,
there is ground to believe that
moſt of them were originally epiſodes
of a greater work which related to the
wars of Fingal. Concerning this hero
innumerable traditions remain, to this
day, in the Highlands of Scotland. The
ſtory of Oſcian, his ſon, is ſo generally
known, that to deſcribe one in whom
the race of a great family ends, it has
paſſed into a proverb; <q rend="inline">"Oſcian the laſt
of the heroes."</q>
            </p>
            <p>There can be no doubt that theſe
poems are to be aſcribed to the Bards;
a race of men well known to have conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
throughout many ages in Ireland
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0245000200:5"/>
and the north of Scotland. Every chief
or great man had in his family a Bard or
poet, whoſe office it was to record in
verſe, the illuſtrious actions of that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily.
By the ſucceſſion of theſe Bards,
ſuch poems were handed down from race
to race; ſome in manuſcript, but more
by oral tradition. And tradition, in a
country ſo free of intermixture with fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners,
and among a people ſo ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
attached to the memory of their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors,
has preſerved many of them in
a great meaſure incorrupted to this day.</p>
            <p>They are not ſet to muſic, nor ſung.
The verſification in the original is
ſimple; and to ſuch as underſtand the
language, very ſmooth and beautiful.
Rhyme is ſeldom uſed: but the cadence,
and the length of the line varied, ſo as to
ſuit the ſenſe. The tranſlation is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
literal. Even the arrangement
of the words in the original has been
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:0245000200:6"/>
imitated; to which muſt be imputed
ſome inverſions in the ſtyle, that other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
would not have been choſen.</p>
            <p>Of the poetical merit of theſe frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
nothing ſhall here be ſaid. Let
the public judge, and pronounce. It
is believed, that, by a careful inquiry,
many more remains of ancient genius,
no leſs valuable than thoſe now given
to the world, might be found in the
ſame country where theſe have been
collected. In particular there is reaſon
to hope that one work of conſiderable
length, and which deſerves to be ſtyled
an heroic poem, might be recovered and
tranſlated, if encouragement were given
to ſuch an undertaking. The ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
is, an invaſion of Ireland by
Swarthan King of Lochlyn; which is
the name of Denmark in the Erſe lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage.
Cuchulaid, the General or Chief
of the Iriſh tribes, upon intelligence of the
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:0245000200:7"/>
invaſion, aſſembles his forces. Councils
are held; and battles fought. But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſeveral unſucceſsful engagements,
the Iriſh are forced to ſubmit. At
length, Fingal King of Scotland, called
in this poem, "The Deſert of the hills,"
arrives with his ſhips to aſſiſt Cuchu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laid.
He expels the Danes from the
country; and returns home victorious.
This poem is held to be of greater anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
than any of the reſt that are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved:
And the author ſpeaks of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
as preſent in the expedition of Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal.
The three laſt poems in the collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
are fragments which the tranſlator
obtained of this epic poem; and though
very imperfect, they were judged not
unworthy of being inſerted. If the
whole were recovered, it might ſerve to
throw conſiderable light upon the Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh
and Iriſh antiquities.</p>

               <speaker>VINVELA.</speaker>
               <p>MY love is a ſon of the hill.
He purſues the flying deer.
His grey dogs are panting
around him; his bow-ſtring ſounds in
the wind. Whether by the fount of
the rock, or by the ſtream of the
mountain thou lieſt; when the ruſhes are
nodding with the wind, and the miſt
is flying over thee, let me approach
my love unperceived, and ſee him
from the rock. Lovely I ſaw thee
firſt by the aged oak; thou wert re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
tall from the chace; the faireſt
among thy friends.</p>
            </sp>

               <speaker>SHILRIC.</speaker>
               <p>WHAT voice is that I hear? that
voice like the ſummer-wind.—I ſit
not by the nodding ruſhes; I hear not
the fount of the rock. Afar, Vinvela,
afar I go to the wars of Fingal. My
dogs attend me no more. No more
I tread the hill. No more from on
high I ſee thee, fair-moving by the
ſtream of the plain; bright as the
bow of heaven; as the moon on the
weſtern wave.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>VINVELA.</speaker>
               <p>THEN thou art gone, O Shilric!
and I am alone on the hill. The
deer are ſeen on the brow; void of
fear they graze along. No more they
dread the wind; no more the ruſtling
tree. The hunter is far removed;
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0245000200:10"/>
he is in the field of graves. Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers!
ſons of the waves! ſpare my
lovely Shilric.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>SHILRIC.</speaker>
               <p>IF fall I muſt in the field, raiſe high
my grave, Vinvela. Grey ſtones, and
heaped-up earth, ſhall mark me to future
times. When the hunter ſhall fit by
the mound, and produce his food at
noon, <q rend="inline">"ſome warrior reſts here,"</q> he
will ſay; and my fame ſhall live in his
praiſe. Remember me, Vinvela, when
low on earth I lie!</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>VINVELA.</speaker>
               <p>YES!—I will remember thee—indeed
my Shilric will fall. What ſhall I do,
my love! when thou art gone for ever?
Through theſe hills I will go at noon: I
will go through the ſilent heath. There
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0245000200:11"/>
I will ſee where often thou fatteſt return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from the chace. Indeed, my Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ric
will fall; but I will remember
him.</p>

            <head>II.</head>
            <p>I SIT by the moſſy fountain; on the
top of the hill of winds. One tree is
ruſtling above me. Dark waves roll
over the heath. The lake is troubled
below. The deer deſcend from the
hill. No hunter at a diſtance is ſeen;
no whiſtling cow-herd is nigh. It is
mid-day: but all is ſilent. Sad are my
thoughts as I ſit alone. Didſt thou
but appear, O my love, a wanderer on
the heath! thy hair floating on the
wind behind thee; thy boſom heaving
on the ſight; thine eyes full of tears
for thy friends, whom the miſt of the
hill had concealed! Thee I would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
my love, and bring thee to thy
father's houſe.</p>
            <p>BUT is it ſhe that there appears, like
a beam of light on the heath? bright
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0245000200:13"/>
as the moon in autumn, as the ſun in
a ſummer-ſtorm?—She ſpeaks: but
how weak her voice! like the breeze
in the reeds of the pool. Hark!</p>
            <p>RETURNEST thou ſafe from the war?
Where are thy friends, my love? I
heard of thy death on the hill; I heard
and mourned thee, Shilric!</p>
            <p>YES, my fair, I return; but I alone
of my race. Thou ſhalt ſee them no
more: their graves I raiſed on the plain.
But why art thou on the deſert hill?
why on the heath, alone?</p>
            <p>ALONE I am, O Shilric! alone in the
winter-houſe. With grief for thee I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired.
Shilric, I am pale in the tomb.</p>
            <p>SHE fleets, ſhe ſails away; as grey
miſt before the wind!—and, wilt thou
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0245000200:14"/>
not ſtay, my love? Stay and behold
my tears? fair thou appeareſt, my love!
fair thou waſt, when alive!</p>
            <p>By the moſſy fountain I will ſit; on
the top of the hill of winds. When
mid-day is ſilent around, converſe, O
my love, with me! come on the wings

come! Let me hear thy voice, as

            <p>EVENING is grey on the hills. The
north wind reſounds through the
woods. White clouds riſe on the ſky: the
trembling ſnow deſcends. The river howls
afar, along its winding courſe. Sad,
by a hollow rock, the grey-hair'd Carryl
ſat. Dry fern waves over his head; his
ſeat is in an aged birch. Clear to the
roaring winds he lifts his voice of woe.</p>
            <p>TOSSED on the wavy ocean is He,
the hope of the iſles; Malcolm, the
ſupport of the poor; foe to the proud
in arms! Why haſt thou left us behind?
why live we to mourn thy fate? We
might have heard, with thee, the voice
of the deep; have ſeen the oozy rock.</p>
            <p>SAD on the ſea-beat ſhore thy ſpouſe
looketh for thy return. The time of
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0245000200:16"/>
thy promiſe is come; the night is ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering
around. But no white ſail is
on the ſea; no voice is heard except
the bluſtering winds. Low is the ſoul
of the war! Wet are the locks of youth!
By the foot of ſome rock thou lieſt;
waſhed by the waves as they come.
Why, ye winds, did ye bear him on
the deſert rock? Why, ye waves, did
ye roll over him?</p>
            <p>BUT, Oh! what voice is that?
Who rides on that meteor of fire! Green
are his airy limbs. It is he! it is the
ghoſt of Malcolm!—Reſt, lovely ſoul,
reſt on the rock; and let me hear thy
voice!—He is gone, like a dream of
the night. I ſee him through the trees.
Daughter of Reynold! he is gone.
Thy ſpouſe ſhall return no more. No
more ſhall his hounds come from the
hill, forerunners of their maſter. No
more from the diſtant rock ſhall his
<pb facs="tcp:0245000200:17"/>
voice greet thine ear. Silent is he in
the deep, unhappy daughter of Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nold!</p>
            <p>I will ſit by the ſtream of the plain.
Ye rocks! hang over my head. Hear
my voice, ye trees! as ye bend on the
ſhaggy hill. My voice ſhall preſerve
the praiſe of him, the hope of the
iſles.</p>

            <p>AUTUMN is dark on the mountains;
grey miſt reſts on the hills. The
whirlwind is heard on the heath. Dark
rolls the river through the narrow plain.
A tree ſtands alone on the hill, and

whirl round with the wind, and ſtrew
the grave of the dead. At times are

when the muſing hunter alone ſtalks
ſlowly over the heath.</p>
            <p>WHO can reach the ſource of thy

HERE was the din of arms; and

it was here thou didſt fall. Thine arm
was like a ſtorm; thy ſword, a beam

Louder than a ſtorm was thy voice,
when thou confoundedſt the field. War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors
fell by thy ſword, as the thiſtle by

            <p>DARGO the mighty came on, like a

of their ſteel.</p>
            <p>THE daughter of Rinval was near;
Crimora, bright in the armour of man;
her hair looſe behind, her bow in her

            <p>SON of the noble Fingal, Oſcian,
Prince of men! what tears run down

            <p>MEMORY, ſon of Alpin, memory
wounds the aged. Of former times are
my thoughts; my thoughts are of the
noble Fingal. The race of the king re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
into my mind, and wound me with
remembrance.</p>
            <p>ONE day, returned from the ſport of
the mountains, from purſuing the ſons
of the hill, we covered this heath with
our youth. Fingal the mighty was here,
and Oſcur, my ſon, great in war. Fair
on our ſight from the ſea, at once, a
virgin came. Her breaſt was like the
ſnow of one night. Her cheek like the
<pb facs="tcp:0245000200:26"/>
bud of the roſe. Mild was her blue
rolling eye: but ſorrow was big in her
heart.</p>
            <p>FINGAL renowned in war! ſhe cries,

war. I fly from the embrace of him
who would debaſe my blood. Cremor,
the friend of men, was my father; Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor
the Prince of Inverne.</p>
            <p>FINGAL's younger ſons aroſe; Carryl
expert in the bow; Fillan beloved of

            <p>FAR in the blue diſtance of the deep,
ſome ſpot appeared like the back of the
ridge-wave. But ſoon the ſhip increaſed
on our ſight. The hand of Ullin drew
her to land. The mountains trembled
as he moved. The hills ſhook at his
ſteps. Dire rattled his armour around
him. Death and deſtruction were in his
eyes. His ſtature like the roe of Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
He moved in the lightning of
ſteel.</p>
            <p>OUR warriours fell before him,
like the field before the reapers. Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal's
three ſons he bound. He plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
his ſword into the fair-one's breaſt.
She fell as a wreath of ſnow before the

death; her ſoul came forth in blood.</p>

OSCUR my ſon came down; the

rattled as thunder; and the lightning of
his eyes was terrible. There, was the
claſhing of ſwords; there, was the voice
of ſteel. They ſtruck and they thruſt;
they digged for death with their ſwords.
But death was diſtant far, and delayed
to come. The ſun began to decline;
and the cow-herd thought of home.
Then Oſcur's keen ſteel found the heart
of Ullin. He fell like a mountain-oak
covered over with gliſtering froſt: He
ſhone like a rock on the plain.—Here the daughter of beauty lieth; and
here the braveſt of men. Here one
day ended the fair and the valiant.
Here reſt the purſuer and the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued.</p>

DERMID and Oſcur were one: They
reaped the battle together. Their
friendſhip was ſtrong as their ſteel; and
death walked between them to the field.
They came on the foe like two rocks
falling from the brows of Ardven. Their
ſwords were ſtained with the blood of
the valiant: warriours fainted at their
names. Who was a match for Oſcur,
but Dermid? and who for Dermid, but
Oſcur?</p>
            <p>THEY killed, mighty Dargo in the
field; Dargo before invincible. His
daughter was fair as the morn; mild
as the beam of night. Her eyes, like
two ſtars in a ſhower: her breath, the
gale of ſpring: her breaſts, as the new-fallen
ſnow floating on the moving heath.
The warriours ſaw her, and loved; their
ſouls were fixed on the maid. Each
loved her, as his fame; each muſt poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs
her or die. But her ſoul was fixed
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0245000200:32"/>
on Oſcur; my ſon was the youth of

father; and loved the hand that ſlew
him.</p>
            <p>SON of Oſcian, ſaid Dermid, I love;
O Oſcur, I love this maid. But her

DERMID, make uſe of thy ſword;

            <p>THEY ſought by the brook of the
mountain; by the ſtreams of Branno.
Blood tinged the ſilvery ſtream, and

fat on the moſs; the laſt of the race of
Fingal. Sightleſs are his aged eyes;
his beard is waving in the wind. Dull

his ſoul: he began and lamented the
dead.</p>
            <p>How haſt thou fallen like an oak,

THE race of Fingal ſtood on thy

Keen were their ſpears of ſteel. Hardy
was he who dared to encounter their
rage. Fillan the great was there. Thou
Oſcur wert there, my ſon! Fingal him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
was there, ſtrong in the grey locks
of years. Full roſe his ſinewy limbs;
and wide his ſhoulders ſpread. The
unhappy met with his arm, when the
pride of his wrath aroſe.</p>
            <p>THE ſon of Morny came; Gaul, the
talleſt of men. He ſtood on the hill like
an oak; his voice was like the ſtreams of
the hill. Why reigneth alone, he cries,
the ſon of the mighty Corval? Fingal is
not ſtrong to ſave: he is no ſupport for
the people. I am ſtrong as a ſtorm in

Yield, ſon of Corval; Fingal, yield to

OSCUR ſtood forth to meet him;

arms round each other; they ſtruggled
on the plain. The earth is ploughed with
their heels. Their bones crack as the boat
on the ocean, when it leaps from wave to

they fell on the ſounding plain; as two

            <p>IT is night; and I am alone, forlorn
on the hill of ſtorms. The wind is
heard in the mountain. The torrent
ſhrieks down the rock. No hut receives
me from the rain; forlorn on the hill of
winds.</p>
            <p>RISE, moon! from behind thy
clouds; ſtars of the night, appear!
Lead me, ſome light, to the place where
my love reſts from the toil of the chace!
his bow near him, unſtrung; his dogs
panting around him. But here I muſt
ſit alone, by the rock of the moſſy
ſtream. The ſtream and the wind
roar; nor can I hear the voice of my
love.</p>
            <p>WHY delayeth my Shalgar, why the
ſon of the hill, his promiſe? Here is
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0245000200:46"/>
the rock; and the tree; and here the
roaring ſtream. Thou promiſedſt with
night to be here. Ah! whither is my
Shalgar gone? With thee I would fly
my father; with thee, my brother of
pride. Our race have long been foes;
but we are not foes, O Shalgar!</p>
            <p>CEASE a little while, O wind! ſtream,
be thou ſilent a while! let my voice be
heard over the heath; let my wanderer
hear me. Shalgar! it is I who call. Here
is the tree, and the rock. Shalgar, my
love! I am here. Why delayeſt thou
thy coming? Alas! no anſwer.</p>
            <p>Lo! the moon appeareth. The
flood is bright in the vale. The rocks
are grey on the face of the hill. But
I ſee him not on the brow; his dogs
before him tell not that he is coming.
Here I muſt ſit alone.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:0245000200:47"/>
BUT who are theſe that lie beyond
me on the heath? Are they my love
and my brother?—Speak to me, O my
friends! they anſwer not. My ſoul is
tormented with fears.—Ah! they are
dead. Their ſwords are red from the
fight. O my brother! my brother!
why haſt thou ſlain my Shalgar? why,
O Shalgar! haſt thou ſlain my brother?
Dear were ye both to me! ſpeak to me;
hear my voice, ſons of my love! But
alas! they are ſilent; ſilent for ever!
Cold are their breaſts of clay!</p>
            <p>OH! from the rock of the hill;
from the top of the mountain of winds,
ſpeak ye ghoſts of the dead! ſpeak,
and I will not be afraid.—Whither
are ye gone to reſt? In what cave of
the hill ſhall I find you?</p>
            <p>I ſit in my grief. I wait for morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in my tears. Rear the tomb, ye
<pb facs="tcp:0245000200:48"/>
friends of the dead; but cloſe it not
till I come. My life flieth away like a
dream: why ſhould I ſtay behind?
Here ſhall I reſt with my friends by the
ſtream of the ſounding rock. When
night comes on the hill; when the wind
is up on the heath; my ghoſt ſhall ſtand
in the wind, and mourn the death of
my friends. The hunter ſhall hear
from his booth. He ſhall ſear, but
love my voice. For ſweet ſhall my voice
be for my friends; for pleaſant were
they both to me.</p>

night, when all my children fell; when
Arindel the mighty fell; when Daura

            <p>DAURA, my daughter! thou wert
<pb facs="tcp:0245000200:50"/>
fair; fair as the moon on the hills of
Jura; white as the driven ſnow; ſweet as
the breathing gale. Armor renowned in
war came, and ſought Daura's love; he
was not long denied; fair was the hope
of their friends.</p>
            <p>EARCH ſon of Odgal repined; for
his brother was ſlain by Armor. He
came diſguiſed like a ſon of the ſea:
fair was his ſkiff on the wave; white
his locks of age; calm his ſerious brow.
Faireſt of women, he ſaid, lovely daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Armyn! a rock not diſtant in
the ſea, bears a tree on its ſide; red
ſhines the fruit afar. There Armor
waiteth for Daura. I came to fetch
his love. Come, fair daughter of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myn!</p>
            <p>SHE went; and ſhe called on Armor.
Nought anſwered, but the ſon of the
rock. Armor, my love! my love!
<pb facs="tcp:0245000200:51"/>
why tormenteſt thou me with fear?
come, graceful ſon of Ardnart, come;
it is Daura who calleth thee!—Earch
the traitor fled laughing to the land.
She lifted up her voice, and cried for
her brother and her father. Arindel!
Armyn! none to relieve your Daura?</p>
            <p>HER voice came over the ſea. Arin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del
my ſon deſcended from the hill;
rough in the ſpoils of the chace. His
arrows rattled by his ſide; his bow was
in his hand; five grey dogs attended
his ſteps. He ſaw fierce Earch on the
ſhore; he ſeized and bound him to an
oak. Thick fly the thongs of the hide
around his limbs; he loads the wind
with his groans.</p>
            <p>ARINDEL aſcends the ſurgy deep in
his boat, to bring Daura to the land.
Armor came in his wrath, and let fly
the grey-feathered ſhaft. It ſung; it
<pb facs="tcp:0245000200:52"/>
ſunk in thy heart, O Arindel my ſon!
for Earch the traitor thou diedſt. What
is thy grief, O Daura, when round
thy feet is poured thy brother's blood!</p>
            <p>THE boat is broken in twain by the
waves. Armor plunges into the ſea, to
reſcue his Daura or die. Sudden a blaſt
from the hill comes over the waves.
He ſunk, and he roſe no more.</p>
            <p>ALONE, on the ſea-beat rock, my
daughter was heard to complain. Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
and loud were her cries; nor
could her father relieve her. All
night I ſtood on the ſhore. All night I
heard her cries. Loud was the wind;
and the rain beat hard on the ſide of the
mountain. Before morning appeared,
her voice was weak. It died away, like
the evening-breeze among the graſs of
the rocks. Spent with grief ſhe expired.
O lay me ſoon by her ſide.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:0245000200:53"/>
WHEN the ſtorms of the mountain
come; when the north lifts the waves
on high; I ſit by the founding ſhore,
and look on the fatal rock. Often by
the ſetting moon I ſee the ghoſts of
my children. Indiſtinct, they walk in
mournful conference together. Will
none of you ſpeak to me?—But they
do not regard their father.</p>

Red through the ſtony vale comes
down the ſtream of the hill. Sweet are
thy murmurs, O ſtream! but more
ſweet is the voice I hear. It is the voice
of Alpin the ſon of the ſong, mourning
for the dead. Bent is his head of age,

               <p>MY tears, O Ryno! are for the dead;
my voice, for the inhabitants of the
grave. Tall thou art on the hill; fair
among the ſons of the plain. But thou
ſhalt fall like Morar; and the mourner
ſhalt ſit on thy tomb. The hills ſhall
know thee no more; thy bow ſhall lie in
the hall, unſtrung.</p>
               <p>THOU wert ſwift, O Morar! as a
roe on the hill; terrible as a meteor of
fire. Thy wrath was as the ſtorm of
December. Thy ſword in battle, as
lightning in the field. Thy voice was
like a ſtream after rain; like thunder
on diſtant hills. Many fell by thy
arm; they were conſumed in the flames
of thy wrath.</p>
               <p>BUT when thou returnedſt from war,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0245000200:56"/>
how peaceful was thy brow! Thy face
was like the ſun after rain; like the
moon in the ſilence of night; calm as
the breaſt of the lake when the loud
wind is laid.</p>
               <p>NARROW is thy dwelling now; dark
the place of thine abode. With three
ſteps I compaſs thy grave, O thou who
waſt ſo great before! Four ſtones with
their heads of moſs are the only memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
of thee. A tree with ſcarce a leaf,
long graſs which whiſtles in the wind,
mark to the hunter's eye the grave of
the mighty Morar. Morar! thou art
low indeed. Thou haſt no mother to
mourn thee; no maid with her tears of
love. Dead is ſhe that brought thee
forth. Fallen is the daughter of Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glan.</p>
               <p>WHO on his ſtaff is this? who is this,

eyes are red with tears, who quakes
at every ſtep?—It is thy father, O
Morar! the father of none but thee.
He heard of thy fame in battle; he heard
of foes diſperſed. He heard of Morar's
fame; why did he not hear of his
wound? Weep, thou father of Morar!
weep; but thy ſon heareth thee not.
Deep is the ſleep of the dead; low their
pillow of duſt. No more ſhall he hear
thy voice; no more ſhall he awake at
thy call. When ſhall it be morn in the
grave, to bid the ſlumberer awake?</p>
               <p>FAREWELL, thou braveſt of men!
thou conqueror in the field! but the field
ſhall ſee thee no more; nor the dark
wood be lightened with the ſplendor of
thy ſteel. Thou haſt left no ſon.
But the ſong ſhall preſerve thy name.
Future times ſhall hear of thee; they
