            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Publick having gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
a general Approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the late Tryal,
between the Marquis <hi>DE
GESVRES</hi> and his Lady,
as indeed ſo nice and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
a Subject deſerv'd: I was inclin'd
to ſearch our own Law-Books and Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorians,
to ſee what adjudg'd Caſes and
Precedents we had of the ſame Nature.</p>
            <p>That which is the moſt conſiderable
in our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Hiſtory was, the Caſe of
the Earl of <hi>ESSEX,</hi> and the Lady <hi>HOW<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ARD</hi>;
a Caſe that engag'd the Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
of the greateſt Stateſmen, and
the Caſuiſtry of a Monarch himſelf.
There has as yet been a great Defect
of Information concerning this Caſe,
which the Reader will now find ſupplied
from an Original <hi>Manuſcript</hi> of Arch-biſhop
<hi>ABBOT</hi>'s, written in his own
<pb facs="tcp:0639300101:3"/>
Hand. This <hi>Manuſcript</hi> contains an
exact Account of all the Artifice and
Stratagem uſed in that Affair, and is
not only very full and particular upon
the Caſe, but lets us into a conſiderable
Part of the Secrets and Politicks of
King <hi>JAMES</hi>'s Reign. I muſt aſſure the
Publick, that it is faithfully printed
from the Original, which is now in the
Hands of a learned Lawyer.</p>
            <p>To make a Collection of this Nature,
as perfect as I well could, there is
added the Lord <hi>AUDLEY</hi>'s Tryal, and
the Proceedings upon the Duke of
<hi>Norfolk</hi>'s <hi>Bill</hi> of <hi>Divorce,</hi> which, as
they bear ſome Relation to this Subject,
ſo they are now very rare, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable.
The Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi>'s Caſe,
in particular, employ'd ſome of our

very eminent Figures in their Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
and contains all that can be ſaid
upon the Article of <hi>Divorce.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In ſhort, theſe Volumes complete
the Account of Caſes of this kind,
and I dare promiſe will prove uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful

ACCOUNT
OF
Archbiſhop ABBOT.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>EORGE ABBOT, <hi>D.D.</hi>
was born at <hi>Guilford</hi> in
<hi>Surrey,</hi> and bred at <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi>
where he became
Maſter of <hi>Univerſity
College, An.</hi> 1604. upon
the Tranſlation of Dr. <hi>Bancroft</hi> from
the See of <hi>London</hi> to the Archbiſhoprick
of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> he was made Biſhop
of that See; and in the Year 1611. at
the deceaſe of <hi>Bancroft,</hi> ſucceeded him
in that honourable Poſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>An.</hi> 1619. He founded a large Hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital
at the Place of his Birth, himſelf
laying the firſt Stone, and endow'd it
with a liberal Maintenance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>An.</hi> 1621. As he was hunting in
<hi>Burnhill</hi> Park, belonging to my Lord
<pb facs="tcp:0639300101:5"/>
               <hi>Zouch,</hi> near <hi>Hertford</hi> Bridge, he kill'd
the Keeper by chance with a forked
Arrow out of a Croſs-bow, as he was
ſhooting at a Deer. The Quaere was,
Whether he ſhould incur the Penalty
of Irregularity by this involuntary
Manſlaughter, or Suſpenſion? but he
was acquitted from either; yet him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
out of a religious Tenderneſs of
Mind, kept a ſolemn Anniverſary Faſt
during his whole Life; and made a
ſufficient Proviſion for the Keeper's
Widow and Children.</p>
            <p>He govern'd the Church with great
Prudence, and was in much Eſteem
with the People and the moderate
Clergy, but in the Year 1627. many
Diſcontents ariſing, he was by the
Clamour of ſome turbulent Perſons,
ſequeſtred from his Office and Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,
tho' in a very ſhort Time he
was graciouſly receiv'd again into Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.</p>
            <p>He was an eminent Preacher, and
it is univerſally agreed that Gravity,
Learning, and Piety, adorn'd his Life.
He died at <hi>Lambeth, An.</hi> 1633.</p>

TOUCHING
The Nullity between the Earl of
<hi>Eſſex</hi> and his Lady, pronounc'd <hi>Sept.</hi>
25, 1613, at <hi>Lambeth,</hi> and the
Difficulties endur'd in the ſame.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Eing at the Court at <hi>White-Hall,</hi>
on the 12th of <hi>May,</hi>
1613, or thereabouts, his
Majeſty mov'd me, that I
would be a Commiſſioner in
a Controverſy to be begun
between the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> and his Lady,
for the ſeparating of them; and when his
Majeſty had ended thoſe few Words with
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0639300101:10"/>
me, my Lord Chamberlain, who was then
in the Gallery, ſpake alſo unto me to that
Purpoſe. It was unto me a Matter very
ſtrange, having heard before of ſome Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contentments
between that noble Couple;
but never imagining that Matters were
come to that Head. My Anſwer was alike
to both, <hi>That I did not know the Ground
whereupon they intended to move; but that if
I were to be a judge in any ſuch Queſtion, I
would pray, that other Biſhops, being near the
Town and Court, might be join'd with me.</hi> The
Perſons that were nam'd then, were, my
Lord of <hi>London,</hi> my Lord of <hi>Ely,</hi> and my
Lord of <hi>Litchfield,</hi> (for at that Time was
my Lord of <hi>Bath</hi> with the Queen's Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty
at <hi>Bath.</hi>) Beſides, I pray'd both the
King's Majeſty, and my Lord Chamberlain,
<hi>That before any ſuch Thing were enter'd into,
I might ſpeak privately with my Lord of</hi> Eſſex<hi>,
for the ſatisfying of mine own Mind</hi>; which
by both was permitted unto me. The Day
after, I ſent for the Earl, and having pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Speech with him, only about the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of his Body, and nothing elſe, I
found him generally much reſerv'd in Talk,
but only avowing the Ability of himſelf
for Generation; and that he was reſolv'd
never to lay any Blemiſh upon himſelf
that Way. I knew not well what to make
of this; for I did not then underſtand,
that ſome Lords had met before at <hi>White-Hall</hi>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:0639300101:11"/>
on both Parts, (the Lord Privy-Seal, the
Lord Chamberlain, the Earl of <hi>Southamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi>
and the Lord <hi>Knowles,</hi> as afterwards I
heard) to ſettle an Order by Conſent, how
this Proſecution ſhould be; that is to ſay,
That a Separation ſhould be made, and my
Lord's Honour every Way preſerv'd.</p>
               <p>Within a Day or two, coming to <hi>White-Hall,</hi>
I had ſpeech with the Lord Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlain,
in the Gallery going towards St.
<hi>James</hi>'s Park. I might not reveal all Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
of that which paſs'd in private;
but yet I told his Lordſhip, <hi>That I had ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
with the Earl of</hi> Eſſex, <hi>and I perceiv'd it
was like to be a Matter of great Difficulty, and
therefore wiſh'd his Lordſhip to be well advis'd,
before any thing was brought into Publick.</hi> I
told him, <hi>That he muſt proceed either upon
Confeſſion or Proof: That it was probable, the
Earl would not confeſs his own Impotency, for
then he blemiſh'd himſelf: That my Lady's
Oath in that Caſe, was not ſufficient; and how
other Proofs might be had, I could not conceive:
That the Earl in open Eſtimation was to be
thought an able Man: That his Father was not
thought in that Kind unſufficient.</hi> The Lord
Chamberlain reply'd, <hi>That, perhaps, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
Sin was puniſh'd upon the Son: That it
was Truth, that the Earl had no Ink in his
Pen: That himſelf had confeſs'd, that he could
not know a Woman, and that, before divers
Noblemen, and ſome of them his own Friends,</hi>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:0639300101:12"/>
                  <hi>naming, as I remember, the Earls of</hi> Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thampton
<hi>and</hi> Worceſter<hi>, and the Lord</hi>
Knowles. All this while I never dream'd
of <hi>impotentia verſus hanc,</hi> but conceiv'd, that
they would charge the Earl ſimply with
Diſability. The Lord Chamberlain then
ſeem'd unto me fully reſolv'd to procceed,
and told me whom he would have in the
Commiſſion, <hi>The Biſhops of</hi> London, Ely,
<hi>and</hi> Litchfield, <hi>the two Chancellors of the</hi> Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer
<hi>and</hi> Dutchy, <hi>my Judges</hi>; (for ſo he
call'd them) <hi>Sir</hi> Daniel Dun, <hi>Sir</hi> John
Bennet, <hi>Dr.</hi> James, <hi>and Dr.</hi> Edwards. I
told his Lordſhip, <hi>That I lik'd the Perſons
very well.</hi> The next News I heard, was
about a Day or two after, <hi>That the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
was out under the Great Seal</hi>; which I
wonder'd at, by Reaſon that I thought,
that my Words to the Lord Chamberlain
being well weigh'd, would have mov'd
ſome longer Conſideration. Well: The
Commiſſion is brought; it is accepted, and
Proceeding decreed; the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> is
call'd; the Libel is put in. When we ſaw
it, and that it contain'd <hi>impotentia verſus
hanc,</hi> moſt of us, who were not acquainted
with the Project before, were much amaz'd
at it. I told the Council for my Lady,
<hi>That they had laid a very narrow Bridge for
themſelves to go over:</hi> So ſaid my Lord of
<hi>London,</hi> and divers of the reſt; only my
Lord of <hi>Ely</hi> was ſtill ſilent. My Lord of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0639300101:13"/>
                  <hi>Litchfield,</hi> two ſeveral Times, utter'd Spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
as much grieving and repining at
this Controverſy: <hi>That he was Ordinary to
the Earl of</hi> Eſſex, <hi>and had been in his Houſe
at</hi> Chartely, <hi>which he ſaw to be well govern'd;
and the Earl did bear himſelf moſt religiouſly
therein, to his great Comfort: That his Wife
had the Honour to be Couſin Germain to the
Counteſs of</hi> Suffolk<hi>; and therefore he had no
Reaſon but to wiſh well to the Earl of</hi> Eſſex <hi>and
his Lady both. Yet if he had been worthy to
be conſulted withal, he ſhould have thought that
ſeven Years had been little enough to have deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berated,
whether it were fit to bring ſuch a
Buſineſs into Queſtion before the World.</hi> Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Time he told us, <hi>That it was very good,
that we ſhould proceed with great Warineſs in
this Cauſe; for,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the World looketh on
us what we do; and there were not more Eyes
upon the Earl's Father loſing his Head, than
there be upon the Earl now loſing his Wife.</hi> He
told me afterwards, <hi>That he had ill Will for
thoſe Speeches, and complain'd that ſome among
us did tell Tales of all that was ſaid and done.</hi>
(And ſo it appear'd afterwards, that Sir <hi>J.
Caeſar,</hi> and Sir <hi>Daniel Dun</hi> did.) Sir <hi>Thomas
Parry,</hi> in all his Speeches, privately mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur'd
againſt this Nullity, till he came
to <hi>Windſor</hi>; where, the Day that the
King heard us, the Lord Chamberlain,
in my Preſence, ſpake privately with him
and Sir <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> about this Matter;
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0639300101:14"/>
and from that Time forward, Mr. Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor
of the <hi>Dutchy</hi> was alter'd. My Lord
of <hi>Ely,</hi> alſo, for a great while, was in Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
of the Separation, (as I have credibly
heard he open'd himſelf to Sir <hi>Henry Savile</hi>)
until ſuch Time as the King ſpake with
him, and then his Judgment was reform'd.
But Truth it is, that among us he ſaid no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
               <p>Now the Earl's Anſwer is taken, which
appeareth. In it there were divers Things
very obſervable. He us'd no ill Speech of
his Lady, for which we all much commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
him. I gave him ſo ſtrict a Charge to
ſpeak the Truth, requiring him, as he
would anſwer me before God at the laſt
Day, to deliver nothing for Favour or Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
but to inform us in the Verity,
that it wrung from him ſomething which I
ſuppos'd he intended not to ſpeak ſo plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
He gave the Reaſon of his having no
Motions to know his Lady carnally, and of
his thinking that he never ſhould. <hi>When
I came out of</hi> France <hi>I lov'd her; I do not ſo
now, neither ever ſhall I.</hi> When he was to
anſwer to the Article, that ſhe was <hi>Virgo
incorrupta</hi>; he ſmil'd, and ſaid, <hi>She ſaith ſo,
and ſhe is ſo for me.</hi> Sir <hi>Daniel Dun</hi> catch'd
theſe Words, and bid the Regiſter ſet down
then, <hi>credit articulum eſſe verum.</hi> Theſe
Things gave me no great Encouragement
to the Buſineſs; but yet being at very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0639300101:15"/>
Leiſure, I let Matters go on, and in
mine own Part reſolv'd nothing. Then
the Witneſſes were depos'd, but not pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd.
The Inſpectreſſes were choſen, who
came moſt unwillingly unto it, and howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
Sir <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> and Sir <hi>Daniel Dun,</hi>
(whom we never ſuſpected to be as Parties
in the Cauſe, as afterwards they appear'd
to be) made all clear and fair Weather;
yet my Lord of <hi>London</hi> told us openly,
<hi>That he being with them, found that the Ladies
knew not well what to make of it; that they had
no Skill, nor knew not what was the Truth;
but what they ſaid, was upon the Credit of the
Midwives, which were but two, and I knew not
how tamper'd with.</hi> Then came the Lady
<hi>Francis,</hi> to take her Oath, with the ſeven
Compurgators. I noted therein ſome
Things. A Paper was brought, containing
<hi>Verbis praeciſis,</hi> what her Ladyſhip would
ſwear. We ſaw it, and conſider'd it, and
found it too bare and ſlight to enforce any
thing. The Commiſſioners advis'd, that
it ſhould be more full. Dr. <hi>Steward</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
drew it; but he muſt go forth to
the Lady, to know whether ſhe would
ſwear it. At laſt it was agreed unto.
When ſhe came to ſubſcribe it, after the
Oath taken, one or two of her Brothers
ſtanding at her Back, put her in Mind,
that ſhe muſt not write her Name <hi>Francis
Eſſex,</hi> which ſhe moſt willingly remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber'd,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0639300101:16"/>
and ſubſcrib'd <hi>Francis Howard.</hi> We
ſaw my Lord of <hi>Litchfield</hi>'s Wife to be one
of the ſeven. We were afterwards inform'd
very credibly, That the Lady <hi>Knevet</hi> had
declar'd her Sorrow, that ſhe was us'd in
ſuch an Action, and ſaid, <hi>That ſhe wept all
the Day about it.</hi> Theſe Things pleas'd me
little, that Nobody took Comfort in the
Buſineſs.</p>
               <p>Things go on in a Courſe 'till <hi>Midſummer-Day.</hi>
Then did the King deal with me
privately, as if he had receiv'd divers
Complaints againſt me. The firſt was,
<hi>That we delay'd the Proceeding, in as much as
the Meeting was put off, from the</hi> 18<hi>th of</hi>
June<hi>, 'till the</hi> 2<hi>d or</hi> 3<hi>d of</hi> July. My An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
was, <hi>We had rather gone too faſt: We
had ſate Forenoon and Afternoon: The Term
now grew to an End, and we had many Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
to diſpatch of the King's: That the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion-Day
for Cauſes Eccleſiaſtical was put off
for a Week, by Reaſon of</hi> Midſummer-Day
<hi>falling on a</hi> Thurſday<hi>; and conſequently, that
our Proceeding in this Cauſe, which commonly
attended the other Commiſſion, was of Neceſſity
to be defer'd.</hi> But my principal Anſwer
was, <hi>That we could not ſhorten it; for the
Council on both Parts, bad agreed upon that
Day in</hi> July<hi>, and ſo it was upon the Acts:
Howſoever, therefore, the Council for my La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
mov'd openly in Court to abreviate the Time,
yet the Council for my Lord would not renounce</hi>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:0639300101:17"/>
                  <hi>nor alter their Term probatory, but kept them
cloſe unto it.</hi> Another Objection was, <hi>That
I acquainted not the King, from Time to Time,
how Matters did go.</hi> I anſwer'd, <hi>That I
knew not my ſelf; for as yet there was no
Publication of Witneſſes. When any thing
came to my Knowledge, his Majeſty ſhould un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
it.</hi> It was added, <hi>That divers Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
repair'd unto me, who wiſh'd not well to the
Buſineſs. Belike,</hi> ſaid I, <hi>they mean the Earl
of</hi> Southampton<hi>, who came in the other Day,
when we were all ſitting together. But his Coming,
was about</hi> John Cotton'<hi>s Cauſe; and I never
had a Word with him in all my Life, touching
this Buſineſs. No,</hi> ſaid the King, and ſmil'd,
<hi>it is Sir</hi> Henry Nevile. <hi>Indeed,</hi> quoth I,
<hi>he was with me the other Day, and this very
Morning: But your Majeſty well knows what
was the Reaſon. It was touching that Cauſe,
which your Majeſty commanded me to ſend for
him about. I deliver'd him your Mind the one
Day, and he gave me an Anſwer the other.</hi>
At this Time, his Majeſty caſt out ſome
Words, as if he wiſh'd well to the Nullity;
but it was ſo obſcurely, that I did not
conceive that earneſtly he deſir'd it. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
this Day, the Complaints were many
which were made to the King againſt me,
and many Threats were us'd, and divers
Tricks were play'd, to urge me to yield to
the Nullity. One was, <hi>That I ſhould ſuffer
the Earl of</hi> Eſſex <hi>to go out of Town.</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0639300101:18"/>
                  <hi>He had made his Anſwer, and had his
Proctor, and it was our Cuſtom then not to ſtay
Men.</hi> His Majeſty commanded me to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire,
if his Preſence were not neceſſary;
and if it were, then I ſhould ſtay him. I
ſent to Sir <hi>Daniel Dun,</hi> to Sir <hi>John Bennet,</hi>
and to Dr. <hi>Steward</hi>; and they all agreed,
that there was no need of his Lordſhip's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in Town. And of this I ſent Word to
the Lord Chamberlain, and my Lord of
<hi>Eſſex</hi> was permitted to depart. One while
it was given out, that I was mov'd by the
Queen to croſs them; when, in Truth, I had
not ſpoke with her thereabout: Another
while, that I had ſpoke with the Earl of <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſex</hi>
at firſt, and hence his Lordſhip grew leſs
pliable; when they knew what about it
was, and were told of it before. And it
was not forgotten, that when I gave Charge
to the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> to anſwer truly to the
Poſitions in the Libel, I nam'd the Caſe of
my Lord of <hi>Devonſhire</hi> and the Lady <hi>Rich,</hi>
as if I had compar'd this Cauſe unto theirs.
When afterwards the Earl's Council took
Exception to the Libel, it was given out,
that they were animated by me to oppoſe;
whereas I never ſpake with them, nor
knew any thing of their Purpoſe. And
ever that was one, that there were Delays
us'd. Yea, it was to my Face deliver'd as
a Threat, that Arch-Biſhop <hi>Grindall</hi> had
been overthrown for not giving Conſent to
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0639300101:19"/>
the Divorce of Dr. <hi>Julio,</hi> as implying, that
the ſame would be my Caſe.</p>
               <p>About this Time, the Lords, and the
reſt of the Feofees, were to meet at Mr. <hi>Sut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>'s
Hoſpital, about the Settling of it.
The Day that we were to come thither,
my Lord Chamberlain in the Privy-Galle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
at <hi>White-Hall,</hi> ſhew'd his Anger towards
me, that we had not ſent for the Keys to
his Lordſhip, and that he might deliver
over the Cauſe. But when I came to the
<hi>Charter-houſe,</hi> there was deliver'd me a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
written all with my Lord's own Hand,
and directed to the Lord Arch-Biſhop, the
Lord Chancellor, and the Lord Privy-Seal;
wherein he did twice take Exception to me
by Name, and, in a Sort, brav'd me, that
ſo he might pick a Quarrel to me; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
I reply'd not, but bore it with Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience.</p>
               <p>A little before <hi>Whitſontide,</hi> his Lordſhip
was very kind to me, and of his own Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
proffer'd me a Chamber at <hi>Greenwich,</hi>
which my Lord, my Predeceſſor, had; but
after twice Proffering of it, and my Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting
of the ſame, his Lordſhip fell off
ſtrangely, and I never ſpake of it more.
Theſe Complaints and Threats made me to
ſuſpect all was not well; for what needed
theſe Things to me, in a Matter of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:0639300101:20"/>
The Time now grew on, that his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
was to go abroad in Progreſs on a
<hi>Sunday,</hi> which was the Day before the
Council for my Lord, were to put in their
Anſwers and Exceptions to the Libel.
The Lord Privy Seal ſhew'd me a Letter
of the King's to his Lordſhip, wherein he
was to expoſtulate with me, for delaying
the Buſineſs. I gave his Lordſhip Anſwer
what was done, and he profeſs'd that his
Lordſhip was ſatisfy'd, and that no Man
could do more than I did. On the <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,</hi>
the Council for my Lord, put in their
Anſwer, which was round and picquant.
The Lord Chamberlain had Notice of it,
and complain'd thereof to the King. I
ſent his Majeſty the Copy thereof, and
receiv'd from the King a Letter, written
all with his Majeſty's own Hand, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Diſlike thereof. At that Time, Sir
<hi>William Button</hi> threaten'd Sir <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
hard for that Anſwer, as the ſaid
Sir <hi>Daniel</hi> divers Weeks after told me.
The Commiſſioners conſider'd of the. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
and diſallow'd it, giving Order, that
no Record ſhould remain of it, but that
it ſhould be utterly defac'd. This was
very well accepted, and now my Lord of
<hi>Canterbury</hi> was a very honeſt Man. But
'till this was done, their Followers gave
out, that the King had in two Letters
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0639300101:21"/>
ſo ſchool'd the Arch-biſhop, as he was
never ſchool'd in all his Life.</p>
               <p>Things now being quiet, I call'd Sir
<hi>William Button</hi> one Commiſſion-Day unto
me, and ſpake thus to him: <hi>Sir</hi> William
Button, <hi>you have follow'd this Buſineſs from
the firſt, and have been preſent at the acting
of all Things. Have you ever ſeen me, in
Word or Deed, done any Matter that doth
not become me?</hi> (for indeed hitherto I had
no Way declar'd my ſelf, becauſe we were
not come to conſider of the Proofs.) <hi>What is
then the Cauſe that I am thus complain'd upon,
that I cannot one Day be quiet?</hi> His An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
unto me, was, <hi>That the Lord</hi> Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlain
<hi>was every way a kind Father to his
Children, but in this of his Daughter, he was
ſo Paſſionate, 'till it had an End, that he lay
as on a Grid-iron, broiling 'till the Matter
were accompliſh'd.</hi> Quoth I, <hi>It ſhall not be
delay'd by me.</hi> Now, the Council on both
Sides grew on to inform us, wherein I
noted, that whereas the Libel was laid
in Nature of <hi>Maleficium verſus hanc,</hi> my
Lady's Council upon the ſhutting up of
the Cauſe, would not apply themſelves
thereunto, neither would they willingly
hear of it; which ſeem'd ſtrange, ſince
all the Books which they brought,
particularly to the Cauſe, did mention
that; and Doctor <hi>Steward</hi> had publickly
and expreſſively ſaid, <hi>That it was that</hi>
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:0639300101:22"/>
                  <hi>which they did mean.</hi> This troubl'd me
ſomewhat, becauſe I perceiv'd that they
themſelves could not tell what to make
of it. But afterwards fell out another
Matter, which very much alienated my
Judgment from the Cauſe: It appear'd,
that Sentence could not be given, 'till
the Time that the King entring his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs,
was gone as far as <hi>Windſor,</hi> and then
his Majeſty was ſoon to depart to <hi>Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam.</hi>
Sir <hi>Daniel Dun</hi> told us, <hi>That he was
to attend the King in Progreſs; that he muſt
be at</hi> Farnam<hi>; that he was Old and Lame;
that it would be too great a Trouble for him,
to come back again at the Day of Sentence.</hi>
He therefore pray'd, <hi>That we would hear
him deliver his Judgment of the whole Matter.</hi>
This Proffer ſeem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d wondrous ſtrange to
moſt of us, and putting it by handſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
we reſolv'd not to trouble him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with:
And in this Opinion we aroſe. But
afterwards my Lord of <hi>Litchfield</hi> cometh to
my Study Door, where I and my Lord
of <hi>London</hi> were about another Buſineſs,
and telleth us, That my Lord of <hi>Ely,</hi> and
Mr. Chancellor of the Exchequer, were
very deſirous to hear Sir <hi>Daniel</hi> ſpeak;
and that he, for his Part, was of the Mind
that it would do very well, and therefore
he importun'd us both to give Conſent
unto it; we imagining no great harm
could come thereby, aſſented, and the next
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0639300101:23"/>
Day is appointed for that Purpoſe. There
Sir <hi>Daniel</hi> cometh with a formal Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
divided into ſix Parts, to every
one of which, he ſpake ſo largely, that
with a little replying of ours, it ſpent
a whole Afternoon. Matters which I moſt
obſerv'd therein, were theſe: He told us,
<hi>That by our Commiſſion, we might hear this
Cauſe ſummarily.</hi> He brought a Book, <hi>That
he who hath Power to hear a Matter ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily,
is in Nature of an Arbiter choſen by
both Parties, and therefore may judge in Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion,
as he ſhall think fit;</hi> and more to
that Purpoſe. I thought with my ſelf,
that this was ſtrange Doctrine in a Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Marriage; that as Arbitrators, we
might adjudge a Wife to her Huſband,
or not adjudge her, according to our Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion.
In his diſcourſing of my Lord's
Impotency, <hi>Verſus hanc,</hi> he beat upon the
Matter of <hi>Maleficium,</hi> and yet by no Means
he would have it to be that apparently.
He inſiſted much, <hi>That the Sentence was to
be given in General Terms, not naming any
particular Impotency.</hi> I told him, <hi>In ſuch
a Sentence, the World look that we ſhould yeild
a Reaſon of that which we did.</hi> He reply'd,
<hi>That it was fit to give no Reaſon. And
here,</hi> ſaid Mr. Chancellor of the Exchequer,
<hi>a Judge is not to give a Reaſon of his Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
but only to God. I would give no Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to any Prince in the World.</hi> I was once
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0639300101:24"/>
call'd before Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> about a Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
which I gave, and ſhe demanded
of me the Reaſon thereof; I told her,
<hi>A Judge was bound to give no Reaſon of
that which he pronounc'd, but only to God.</hi>
I marvell'd much at theſe Things, and
at laſt reply'd, <hi>Well, let it be, we acquaint
not the World with the Reaſon of that which
we do, yet is it not fit, that I who am the
Judge, and muſt pronounce the Sentence, know
the Ground of that which I am to pronounce.</hi>
Here, after a little pauſing, one of them
ſaid, <hi>Yes, for you may ſee that in the Books
and Depoſitions.</hi> Quoth I, <hi>But I cannot ſee
that there which may ſatisfy me. But Mr.
Chancellor ſaid, I, and Sir</hi> Daniel Dun<hi>, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners,
you perhaps be not driven to it,
yet I ſhall be forc'd of Neceſſity to tell Men
the Reaſon of the Sentence: For as ſoon as
this Cauſe is ſentenc'd, every Man who is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented
with his Wiſe, and every Woman
diſcontented with her Huſband, which can have
any reaſonable Pretence, will repair to me for
ſuch Nullities. If I yeild unto them, here will
be ſtrange Violations of Marriages; if I do
not, I must not tell them, that it was fit for
my Lord of</hi> Eſſex<hi>, but it is not ſo for you;
for the Law knoweth no, Perſons, but is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
to all. If I then repel them, I muſt
ſhew a Reaſon: Your Caſe is not like that of
my Lord of</hi> Eſſex<hi>; for his Caſe was thus,
yours is thus. And ſo muſt I deliver the</hi>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:0639300101:25"/>
                  <hi>Reaſon, or Men will not be anſwer'd.</hi> In
this Time of debating, I ask<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d Sir <hi>Daniel
Dun, I pray you Maſter of the Requeſts, what
Examples have we of any Nullity in</hi> England<hi>,
pronounc'd in this kind? Might a Man ſee
any Precedent of it? For I would be loath
to do a thing, that never was done before.
Yes,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>there be Precedents thereof.
In</hi> Anne <hi>of</hi> Cleve's <hi>Caſe, we have an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
and another in one</hi> Berry<hi>, which I
have here in my Book</hi>; and thereupon out
of a Note-Book of his own, he read now
a Line or two, and then two or three
other Lines in another Place, and ſo
forward. My Anſwer was, <hi>I did not think
that King</hi> Henry'<hi>s Separation from</hi> Anne
<hi>of</hi> Cleve<hi>, was for any ſuch Matter, but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a Precontract.</hi> I ſaid, <hi>King</hi> Henry <hi>the</hi>
VIIIth <hi>was a ſtrange Prince in that kind:
He put himſelf into many Marriages; and when
he began that with</hi> Anne <hi>of</hi> Cleve<hi>, he
fear'd leaſt the Emperor, and King of</hi> France<hi>,
ſhould combine with the Pope againſt him,
and therefore he was deſirous to ſtrengthen
himſelf with the Proteſtant Princes in</hi> Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many<hi>;
and for that he thought this Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
was much behoveful. But afterwards
growing into Peace, with one or both of thoſe
Princes, he grew ſoon weary of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
becauſe he lik'd not the Woman.</hi> But
then I promis'd to conſider further of theſe
two Caſes. This was the End of that
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0639300101:26"/>
Day's Labour, which, when at Night I
had recounted with my ſelf, I thought it
was an audacious Part, for ſuch a one as
Sir <hi>Daniel</hi> was, to teach us out of ſuch
poor Grounds, both what to do, and how
to do. I found by my Obſervation, that
it was a ſet Match, that thus he ſhould
be heard; that he was prepar'd for the
Purpoſe: For no Man upon the ſudden,
or one Day's warning, could deliver ſo
much, and ſo digeſted. And now I began
to aſſure my ſelf, that he did not ſhew
himſelf a Judge, but was a Stickler for
the Nullity. I much ſuſpected the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
of the Man, knowing him reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably
well before, both out of mine own
Eſtimation of him, and out of the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of my two Predeceſſors, the Lords
<hi>Whitgift</hi> and <hi>Bancroft,</hi> who held him for
a Man moſt corrupt. Yet the next Day
I ſent unto him for his Note-Book, and
I caus'd the Record of <hi>Anne</hi> of <hi>Cleve,</hi> to
be brought unto me. Reading over all the
latter, I found not one Word tending to
the preſent Caſe. <hi>Good Lord! thought I,
how doth this Man deceive me!</hi> Peruſing
his own Book for that of <hi>Berry,</hi> I found
it to be nothing but the Pleadings of
Advocates on both Sides, when about the
40 of <hi>Eliz.</hi> there was ſome Queſtion in
the Common Law Courts, about <hi>Berry</hi>'s
Land, <hi>Berry</hi> himſelf being dead many
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0639300101:27"/>
Years before. But I ſaw more in this
Book againſt the Cauſe now in hand,
than for it; and by ſome other Writings
in my Houſe, I diſcover'd that <hi>Berry</hi>'s
Divorce, <hi>Anno</hi> 1561, was for want of
his Stones, which Dr. <hi>Steward</hi> alſo,
being now of Council for my Lady, and
who formerly ſtood for <hi>Berry</hi>'s Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
againſt the ſuppos'd Son, publickly
acknowledg'd. Theſe Things made me
in my Heart much diſlike the Cauſe, and
procur'd in me a hard Opinion, touching
Sir <hi>Daniel Dun,</hi> who ſhould not have wrong'd
me, being my Officer, as Dean of the
<hi>Arches.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Within few Days after, the Meſſage
cometh to us, that we were all to attend
the King at <hi>Windſor.</hi> This accordingly
was done. The Morning before the Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
the Lord Chamberlain in my Preſence,
ſpoke firſt earneſtly with the Chancellor
of the Exchequer, and afterward with the
Chancellor of the Dutchy, who that Day
fell from us, as appear'd by the few Words
that he had before the King. Some few
Days before that, had Sir <hi>John Bennet,</hi>
by Sir <hi>William Button,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Edwards,</hi>
been otherwiſe dealt withal, earneſtly
to give Conſent to the Nullity; but that
Day we dealt in it more than three Hours.
His Majeſty propounding the Matter,
ask'd, <hi>How Things did ſtand?</hi> Sir <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:0639300101:28"/>
                  <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſaid, <hi>That Sir</hi> Daniel Dun <hi>was
beſt able to ſpeak unto it.</hi> And then, <hi>ex
compoſito,</hi> Sir <hi>Daniel</hi> begins, and tells a great
Tale, and eſpecially inſiſteth upon <hi>Non
potnit.</hi> When he had done, I anſwer'd
him, and ſhew'd the want of Ground for
that Concluſion, out of other the Earl's
evident Anſwers, <hi>That the</hi> Non potuit <hi>was
for lack of Love, and not for want of Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</hi>
I challeng'd Sir <hi>Daniel,</hi> for abuſing
the King with a falſe Report, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
for his two Precedents of <hi>Berry</hi>'s
Caſe, and that of <hi>Anne</hi> of <hi>Cleve.</hi> Amongſt
us, was divers ways ſhew'd the Inſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency
of the Proofs; that the Libel was
laid ſhort of the Cauſe, and the Proofs
were ſhort of the Libel: That we had
very many Times call'd upon the Council
for my Lady, that they ſhould look that
they rightly laid their Matter, and made
their Proof ſtrong; that in the End, they
complain'd not of the Judges, when the
Fault was in themſelves: (Where my
Lord of <hi>Litchfield</hi> added, <hi>That himſelf fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the worſt, had gone to the</hi> Doctors-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
<hi>and warn'd the Council for my Lady,
that they ſhould look to it.</hi>) Among other
Things there utter'd, Sir <hi>Daniel Dun</hi> ſaid,
<hi>What a Diſgrace will this be to my Lord
Chamberlain and his Daughter, if it ſhould
not now go forward?</hi> My Anſwer was,
<hi>They ſhould have look'd to that before they</hi>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:0639300101:29"/>
                  <hi>did begin it: We were not the Men that ſet
the Matter on Foot; if it were a Diſgrace,
they put it on themſelves. But,</hi> quoth I,
<hi>muſt I, to ſave any Man from Diſgrace,
ſend my Soul unto Hell, to give a Sentence
whereof, I ſaw no Ground? I will never do
it.</hi> My Lord of <hi>London,</hi> Sir <hi>John Bennet,</hi>
and Dr. <hi>Edwards,</hi> did carry themſelves well
that Day, altho' Sir <hi>John Bennet</hi> had much
Oppoſition from the King himſelf. When
we ſaw the King earneſt, I fell down on
my Knee, and with Tears in mine Eyes,
I ſaid, <hi>I beſeech your Majeſty, if ever I
have done you any Service, whom I do ſerve
with a faithful Heart, or may do you any
Service, rid me of this Buſineſs.</hi> I had ſaid
before, <hi>That I was the unfitteſt Man that
might be, to judge of ſuch a Cauſe; I was
no marry'd Man, I was no Lawyer, and
I had not had the Time, by reaſon of my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
Buſineſſes, to read ſo much of that Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
as other Men had.</hi> I obſerv'd that Day,
many Things in his Majeſty's Carriage,
of the Matter: He was Earneſt, but Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
and Moderate. He found Fault with
the Libel, and ſaid, <hi>That Complaints were
made, that we went too ſlow, but he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
we went too faſt.</hi> He marvell'd that
my Lord of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Knowles,</hi>
were not examin'd as Witneſſes. He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
profeſs<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d, <hi>That he believ'd that my
Lord of</hi> Eſſex, <hi>was Impotent for a Woman.</hi>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:0639300101:30"/>
He told us, <hi>That ſome of the Earl's Friends
had put a Woman to him, and he would not
touch her.</hi> His Majeſty ſaid, <hi>That the Earl
was once purpos'd to have gone to</hi> Poland,
<hi>to have try'd whither he might be unwitched.</hi>
To which Things my Reply was, <hi>I would
to God we might ſee theſe Things legally
prov'd. That his Majeſty much diſlik'd that
Courſe, and therefore he ſet the Courſe now in
Proſecution; and therefore if there were any
Error in it, he had done the Lord</hi> Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlain
<hi>wrong, and he muſt take it upon him.</hi>
In ſum, I found his Majeſty much troubled
what to do, as I gather'd, eſpecially by
theſe Words, If my Lord of <hi>Canterbury,</hi>
and my Lord of <hi>London,</hi> have a Negative
Voice, we muſt either begin all again,
and have a new Libel, or we muſt have
a new Commiſſion, and put other Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncts.
The Concluſion from his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
was, That we ſhould all meet at
<hi>Lambeth</hi> on the Morrow, and if we could
unanimouſly conſent, then go to the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence;
if not, we ſhould put it off unto
another Day, and certify him of it, and
ſo farther underſtand his Pleaſure. When
the King was riſen from his Chair, he
fell to inveighing againſt theſe Marry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of young Couples, before they be
acquainted one with another. He told us
the Inconvenience of it, how he knew in
<hi>Scotland,</hi> a Father who marry'd his only
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0639300101:31"/>
Child to a Man againſt her Will: That
ſhe withſtood it; yet her Father forc'd her
to marry him: That being gone Home
with her Huſband after a very few Days, ſhe
came run away from him: That her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
jerk'd her, and ſent her home again:
That not long after, ſhe poyſon'd her
Huſband, and was burnt for it, while the
King was in <hi>Scotland.</hi> After his Majeſty's
going out, I follow'd him, and told him,
I evidently perceiv'd, that it was in the
Earl of <hi>Eſſex Vitium Animi non Corporis.</hi>
His Majeſty ſwore he thought ſo. There
paſs'd ſome other Speech from the King to
me, touching his own Lying with the
Queen the firſt Night that he marry'd her.
But, at the laſt, I kiſs'd his Hand and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted.
After I was gone, the Lord Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlain
ſpeaking ſomewhat againſt me, the
King reply'd, <hi>The Arch-biſhop hath ſo adjur'd
me to be rid of this Matter, that I cannot tell
what to ſay to him.</hi> This did Sir <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi>
tell me that Day at Dinner, at <hi>Eaton
College,</hi> letting me know, that the King
found no Fault with me. But afterward,
the King coming to Dinner, after his
Meat had ſtay'd for him on the Table
more than a Quarter of an Hour, he ſate
him down in his Chair, and caſting his
Leg over one Side of it, he eat no Meat
for a great Space of Time, neither ſaid he
any Word, but ſate muſing to himſelf;
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0639300101:32"/>
which every Man obſerv'd. And it was
given out by ſome in the Court, that I
was gone away in the King's Diſpleaſure.
Within ſome few Days after, it was alſo
more Ways than one brought credibly to
my Ears, That the Arch-biſhop and my Lord
of <hi>London,</hi> ſhould be hereafter kept to
their Spiritualities, and ſhould meddle no
more in temporal Matters: And within a
while it came ſo far, as that they ſhould
have their Temporalities taken from them.
Sir <hi>John Bennet</hi> was at <hi>Windſor</hi> mov'd by
Sir <hi>Thomas Lake</hi> in the Lord <hi>Fenton</hi>'s Name,
and afterwards by the Lord <hi>Fenton</hi> himſelf,
That he ſhould alter his Opinion, and
make his Peace with the King, for his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
was not well pleas'd with him.</p>
               <p>As I came Homeward from <hi>Windſor</hi> in
my Coach, and all that ſame Night, two
Things did run much in my Mind; the
one of them was, What a ſtrange and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Thing it was, That his Majeſty ſhould
be ſo far engag'd in that Buſineſs: That
he ſhould profeſs, that himſelf had ſet the
Matter in that Courſe of Judgment: That
the Judges ſhould be dealt withal before,
and, in a Sort, directed what they ſhould
determine: That the like Example had
not been ſeen: That his Majeſty did win
himſelf much Honour in the Caſe of <hi>Sut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>'s
Hoſpital, that, notwithſtanding all
Importunity, he had ſuffer'd the Judges to
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0639300101:33"/>
do their Conſcience. This ſtrange moving
to the contrary, did make me marvelouſly
ſuſpect that it was no direct Matter;
and, as a dutiful Servant to my moſt gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Maſter, I wiſh'd in my Heart, that
his Majeſty's Hand might be taken off the
Buſineſs. The other Point was, That we
had all this while, in our Debatings, never,
or very little, meddled with Points of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity.
And I thought with my ſelf, that
much might be ſaid therein, againſt <hi>malefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cium,</hi>
and the Nullity to be pronounc'd
thereupon <hi>verſus hanc</hi>; for out of this we
could never get in all our Talking, though
they would never cleave faſt to it. I
therefore, having formerly revolv'd ſome
ſuch Things in my Mind, roſe early on
the Day that we were to debate Things at
large, and ſet down my Mind in writing
out of ſomething in Divinity. The Copy
of this appeareth. The Day after we
came from <hi>Windſor</hi> being <hi>Tueſday,</hi> we met,
and all the Forenoon we inſiſted on that
which I had briefly written: But to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
my Conſcience freely before God, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
no kind or ſhew of Satisfaction. My
Lord of <hi>Ely</hi> ſate little leſs than Dumb, as
if he had never dream'd of any ſuch Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
Divers of the Commiſſioners wonder'd
at him, that he, who had ſpent ſo much
Time in reading of the Canoniſts touching
this Queſtion, ſhould not think upon Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0639300101:34"/>
Briefly up and down by others ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
was ſaid, but nothing to Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
After Dinner, Sir <hi>John Bennet</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
Reaſons out of the Law, but
without any Satisfaction. I obſerv'd two
ſpecial Points that Afternoon: The one
was, That we all thought my Lord of <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſex</hi>
his Anſwer to the Libel, was neither
plain nor ſufficient. And now it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member'd,
that my Lord of <hi>Litchfield</hi> had
put to him certain Queſtions, that four
Things were neceſſary to Generation; <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brum
virile,</hi> Erection, Penetration, and <hi>Eja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culatio
Seminis</hi>; which, altho' they were
then ſmil'd at, and ſince that Time much
Sport had been made at the Court and in
<hi>London</hi> about them; yet now our marry'd
Men on all Hands wiſh'd that punctually
his Lordſhip might have been held to give
his Anſwer unto them. This inſtructed
me, that the Proofs were not full. A ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Thing was, that when towards the
Evening, I wiſh'd that a Reconciliation
might be labour'd between my Lord and
my Lady, that it ſhould beſt become us,
my Lord of <hi>Ely,</hi> who from the firſt Beginning
of the Proceſs, had been always very ſilent,
ſpake home about that, much diſliking
that any ſuch Thing ſhould now be ſought;
that it was too late; that it might be the
Cauſe of poyſoning and deſtroying one of
another, to bring them together again.
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0639300101:35"/>
Well, when we could not agree upon our
Concluſion, we were inforc'd to put all off
unto a longer Day; and as the King com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
I was to certify his Majeſty of it.
I wrote a Letter to the King, praying hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
that I might be freed from the Trouble
of this Cauſe, or, at leaſt, give no Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
in it, 'till I were a marry'd Man,
and ſo might better underſtand the Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
I incloſ'd alſo ſix Reaſons of Sir
<hi>John Bennet</hi>'s taking Exceptions in Law
againſt the Nullity. And withal I joyn'd
mine own Reaſons in Divinity, of which
I ſaid in my Letter, that I knew not where
to ſeek an Anſwer to them; meaning,
that the Commiſſioners had given me none.
Theſe Reaſons afterwards coſt me a great
deal of Trouble.</p>
               <p>The next Progreſs in this Controverſy,
was, that I was advertis'd, that it was his
Majeſty's Pleaſure that the Cauſe ſhould be
put off until the 18th of <hi>September</hi>; and
withal there was brought a new Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of Adjuncts, whereinto my Lords of
<hi>Wincheſter</hi> and <hi>Rocheſter</hi> were put. The
Day that I perceiv'd this, acquainting
the two Chancellors of the Exchequer and
Dutchy therewith, in the Gallery at
<hi>Lambeth,</hi> I told them, <hi>That I hoped now, that
for my Part, I ſhould be freed from any Trouble
therein farther, for I did deſire to be rid of it.</hi>
They both anſwer'd me, <hi>That they deſir'd in</hi>
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:0639300101:36"/>
                  <hi>like ſort to be quit of the Matter.</hi> A good
Buſineſs, thought I, that no Body taketh
Comfort of it, unleſs it be Sir <hi>Daniel Dun,</hi>
of whom I forgot before to note, that on
the Day of meeting, next after our coming
from <hi>Windſor,</hi> he, with a great deal of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolency,
challeng'd me for my Speech be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his Majeſty, the Day before. <hi>Do not
abuſe the King, Sir</hi> Daniel Dun. I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber'd
it was in mine own Houſe, and if I
had rattl'd him according to his Deſerts,
my Lord Chamberlain would have ſaid it
had been done for his Sake; and in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs,
Sir <hi>Daniel</hi> having the King's Ear,
would have made Things worſe than they
were; and I therefore forbore him with ſuch
Patience, that ſome of the Commiſſioners
told me afterwards, that they wonder'd
how I could endure thoſe Behaviours, at
the Hands of a Man of his Quality: But
yet they commended me for it. Now grew
I to conſider what were the Reaſons why
theſe two Commiſſioners were joined to us;
and therein I had many Advertiſements
from divers Friends, divers Ways. We re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd
for my Lord of <hi>Winton</hi>; that it was
ſuppos'd, that there was no great Amity
between him and me; that when I was
Dean there, there was ſome Diſagreement
between us, which they ſuppos'd yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd:
That he had an old Grudge to me,
for having the Archbiſhoprick, which his
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0639300101:37"/>
Lordſhip ſo much deſir'd. Beſides, it was
ſome Tickling unto him, that his Gravity
and Learning ſhould either win in the
Arch-biſhop, or lay ſome Blemiſh upon
him, if he ſtood out. Certain it is, that
Sir <hi>William Button</hi> was with him; and,
doubtleſs, would tell him how acceptable
this Service would be to his Majeſty. I
heard of good Credit and ſecretly, That he
was put in hope to be made a Privy-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellor;
and the Fame was general, That
for the Father's Labour, the Son ſhould be
made a Knight. It ſeemeth at the firſt,
that he had no great Fancy unto it; but
being wrought upon, he conſented; ſo that
he might be required by his Majeſty to be
preſent. This was done by a Letter from
<hi>Saliſbury,</hi> which, at his being at <hi>Lambeth,</hi>
he ſhew'd me; that I ſhould take Notice,
that he had not come, unleſs he had been
commanded. I leave him for the Time,
only ſignifying, that in the Vacation, he
ſent for divers Books from <hi>London,</hi> and had
Dr. <hi>Steward</hi> much with him, to inform him
in all Particulars. Yet I may not forget,
that while he held off his Conſent, ſome
hard Opinions were rais'd of him at Court;
as I found by a Letter from my Lord of
<hi>Litchfield</hi> to me. For there he was found
Fault with, that he attended not the King
at <hi>Farnham,</hi> or at <hi>Andover.</hi> And there
Blame was laid, that Mr. <hi>Love,</hi> who was
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0639300101:38"/>
ſo great with my Lord of <hi>Winton</hi> was like
to get the Warden's Place at <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> Dr.
<hi>Harmar</hi> being reported to be dead. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Biſhop of <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> it was well
known that he had open'd himſelf before
the King's going in Progreſs, that he lik'd
well of the Nullity. Coming once or twice
while we were about it, he, with ſome in
my Houſe diſputed earneſtly for it. He
was a great Dependant of my Lord of
<hi>Litchfield.</hi> This was a Way to make him
well eſteem'd, and to ariſe high in Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
But, in Truth, he ſhould not have
verify'd the Report which Arch-biſhop
<hi>Bancroft</hi> on his Death-Bed gave of him,
together with <hi>Butler</hi> and <hi>Carrier,</hi> to the
King by a Meſſage, unleſs he did ſome
ſuch Thing. When he was put into the
Commiſſion, he in divers Places ſeem'd to
be much offended, that he was made one.
His Grief was, that he was ſet in Oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
againſt me: He would never give his
Voice to it, unleſs I conſented. Theſe, and
the like Things, he ſpake, as elſewhere, ſo
to ſome of my Servants in my Houſe at
<hi>Croydon</hi>: For, under another Colour, he
came three Times in the Vacation to me;
but I never ſpake a Word with him about
that Matter, as knowing it would be an
Argument againſt me, that I labour'd to
draw away the King's Commiſſioners; and
the End ſhew'd, that I had no great Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0639300101:39"/>
to truſt him. Beſides theſe two Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncts,
the new Commiſſion it ſelf ſeem'd
very ſtrange unto me. There were eight
made of the <hi>Quorum</hi>; and it was ſo laid,
that if three of them, with two other, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented,
the Sentence might be given; ſo
that, by the Words thereof, if ſeven had
deny'd, five might have pronounc'd and
prevail'd. A Matter ſo uncooth, that, as
I credibly heard, my Lord of <hi>Winton</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
found much Fault therewith. Again,
there was a Clauſe, <hi>Legibus, Statutis, Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nationibus,
Conſtitutionibus quibuſcunque non
obſtantibus</hi>; ſo reſolv'd they were to have it
diſpatch'd. Every thing now ſtood at a
Pauſe; and my Lord of <hi>Ely</hi> (who, at firſt,
deliver'd his Judgment againſt it to Sir
<hi>Henry Savile,</hi> as I heard it avow'd upon
good Credit; but afterwards ſaid, he was
better inſtructed by the King) began to
hearken what Men ſaid of the Matter, as
appeared by Speech which he had with Sir
<hi>John Paiton</hi>; to whom, notwithſtanding,
he told ſome Things of the Inſufficiency
of my Lord of <hi>Eſſex.</hi> The Weather grew
fair; he hop'd the overflowing of the Iſle
of <hi>Ely</hi> would ceaſe; he would go down
in his Viſitation; he came and took his
leave of me, but not one Word of the
Nullity.</p>
               <p>Now was his Majeſty abroad, and I had
more Leiſure to conſider of this Queſtion.
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0639300101:40"/>
I read what I could; I confer'd with many
Men about divers Circumſtances, ſo to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
my ſelf the better. I pray'd fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
to God to direct me aright. I of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
perus'd the Depoſitions, but I found
little Satisfaction. I perceiv'd moſt of the
Lords had a great Diſlike of this Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
that the better Sort of Men had
generally a Deteſtation of it; that the
Judges and Lawyers much condemned it.
I heard many ſtrange Stories of the Lady's
Carriage. Something was freely ſpoken
of a Woman arraign'd at <hi>Bury</hi>; and how
to ſhut that up, and ſo to free the Earl,
this Courſe was conſented upon.</p>
               <p>Theſe Things, though out of Charity I
entertain'd not as abſolutely true, yet the
Concurrence of them from ſo many, made
me that I could not contemn them. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
now grew the Rumour ſtrong, that a
new Huſband was readily provided for
her: Whereof I call'd to Mind the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of Sir <hi>Henry Nevile,</hi> deliver'd to me
at <hi>Windſor</hi>; and I did not forget a Speech
of <hi>Overbury</hi>'s, once to me in that Kind. I
underſtood, that at <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> laſt, there
was a Reconciliation wrought between
the Earl and his Lady, howſoever it fell
out. Yea, that when the Lords met at
<hi>White-Hall</hi> about the Manner of Separation,
there was three Times that Day a Likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
to make them Friends; which we
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0639300101:41"/>
thought imply'd no Diſability of my Lord
of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> even in their own Opinion. I
farther underſtood, that whereas it was
whiſper'd among us, the Commiſſioners,
That at <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> laſt, my Lord of <hi>Eſſex</hi>
being in Bed with his Lady, ſhould labour
a quarter of an Hour carnally to know her,
and in the End ſhould ſay, Frankey, <hi>it will
not be,</hi> and ſo kiſs'd her, and bid her good
Night: That this was not true; but that
the Earl, the Night before his going from
<hi>London,</hi> at the End of <hi>Trinity</hi> Term, ſaid
with Tears in his Eyes, <hi>That when he went to
Bed to her at</hi> Chriſtmas <hi>laſt, he had forgiven
all Things as clearly as he wiſh'd that God
ſhould forgive him his Sins; but when they
were alone, ſhe revil'd him, and miſcall'd him,
terming him Cow, and Coward, and Beast:</hi>
And he added, <hi>that ſhe was as bitter a Woman
as any was in the World: Which Things ſo
cool'd his Courage, that he was far from know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or endeavouring to know her.</hi> Theſe
Matters, together with the ſmall Joy
which the Commiſſioners had to deal in
the Buſineſs, made me have no great Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
unto it. On the other Side, I heard
that my Lord Chamberlain, or his Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers,
gave out, that what was done,
was perform'd by the King's Direction,
otherwiſe it had not been begun; and
therefore, they expected that his Majeſty
ſhould ſee it effected; that they reſted
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0639300101:42"/>
themſelves on him. I was much griev'd
that they had this Advantage on my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
who being ſo engag'd, as I thought,
could not well go backward or forward:
And, to increaſe my Sorrow, I was private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
advertis'd from Court, that his Majeſty
did mean himſelf to give an Anſwer to my
Reaſons above-mention'd. I heard ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Way, that his Majeſty in the Progreſs
wrote much with his own Hands. From
another Friend I was told, That the King
with his Anſwer to the Reaſons, had writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
to me a ſharp Letter. Yea, by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
I learn'd the Contents of the Letter,
which was full of Sharpneſs.</p>
               <p>Theſe Things in the Summer kept me
full of Expectation of ſome great Diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment.
Yet my heart ſtill aſſur'd me,
that I was guilty of no Wickedneſs. I
found all Perſons with whom I ſpake of
my Mind, for the Diſlike of the Nullity.
In many Buſineſſes to and from the King
by Letters, I found nothing but well.
His Majeſty ſent me Warrants for three
Bucks, as formerly he had done, and with
ſome Kindneſs joyn'd.</p>
               <p>Thus I was toſſed in my Thoughts; and
in all my Troubles, I had Recourſe to God
in Prayer.</p>
               <p>By this Time, the 18th of <hi>September,</hi> draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
nigh, and I am inform'd, That my
Lord of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> the <hi>Tueſday</hi> before, was
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0639300101:43"/>
come to Town; and that beſides my La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy's
Council, Sir <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> and Sir <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel
Dun,</hi> did, at St. <hi>Mary Overy</hi>'s Houſe,
daily attend his Lordſhip. I expected no
great Good of this; only from the King I
heard nothing but well. For ſome few Days
before, his Majeſty had been at <hi>White-hall,</hi>
where I kiſs'd his Hand, and he did not
only look merrily upon me, but he gave me
Promiſe of the Biſhoprick of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> for my
Brother, as I underſtood it. Some other
Matters alſo paſs'd quietly in Speech, and I
found no Diſturbance. But on the 17th of
<hi>Septemb.</hi> the Day before our new meeting at
<hi>Lambeth,</hi> my Lord of <hi>Litchfield</hi> being ſent
from the King, bringeth divers Papers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
me, ſeal'd up. I open'd them, and found
there my Reaſons firſt, ſecondly, an Anſwer
to them, and, thirdly, a Letter, all writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
with the King's Hand unto me. I
read them all preſently, without any
abatement, whereunto I was help'd by my
Fore-knowledge, that ſuch Things would
come. I ſaid little unto it, only I ask'd
my Lord of <hi>Litchfield, Whether he knew what
thoſe Papers contain'd?</hi> He told me, <hi>That
the King had read unto him the Anſwers to the
Reaſons, and had given him the Letter to Seal
up in a Paper; but in Reverence to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,
he held it not his Duty to look into it.</hi>
Growing afterward in ſome Speech of our
next Days Buſineſs, I told him plainly,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0639300101:44"/>
                  <hi>That having ſpent much Time in this Vaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
in peruſing the Books, I could not find
any where, but eſpecially in the Anſwer of my
Lord of</hi> Eſſex<hi>, that which would give me Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment.</hi>
I read the Places, and my Lord
confeſs'd with me, <hi>That there was not enough.</hi>
He told me alſo, <hi>That unleſs I gave my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
to the Separation, that he would never
give his:</hi> So much Reverence in him did I
find both then, and divers Times before,
againſt this Divorcement. At laſt he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
one Thing which pleas'd me won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drous
well, and that was, That we ſhould
call for my Lord of <hi>Eſſex</hi> again, and new
examine him, upon ſome Points to be far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
declar'd, <hi>ad informandum animum Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicis.</hi>
For hence, either we ſhould know
ſo much as might perſwade us to decree a
Separation, or the World might be ſatisfy'd
that we had no Reaſon for it. Theſe
Things thus ſettled, his Lordſhip ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth.
Then I withdrew my ſelf to my
Study, and read over again and again, the
Papers from the King. I found them very
ſharp, and perceiv'd by the Time that they
arriv'd unto me, that they were detain'd
'till that Day, that I might be overwhelm'd
with them on the ſudden, and have no
Time to deliberate, before we were to come
the ſecond Time to ſit in Judgment. Theſe
things did much trouble me, ſo that I
did ſleep but a little that Night. I revol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0639300101:45"/>
many things, and much tumbling I
had in my Miud. It griev'd me infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that the King ſhould make himſelf a
Party therein; That ſome Unthankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and other Matters, were little leſs
then Reproaches unto me: Methought my
faithful Heart to my Maſter, deſerv'd no
ſuch Sharpneſs. I devis'd how I might
give the King Contentment, and it was
ſome Comfort to me, that we had thought
upon a Courſe of new examining my Lord
of <hi>Eſſex.</hi> But as things ſtood, I could not
force my Conſcience, which cry'd upon me,
<hi>That it was an odious Thing to GOD and
Men, to give ſuch a Sentence, without better
warrant.</hi> I here caſt what might befal
to the Church in my Diſgrace; how <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts</hi>
would ſcorn at it; how it might be
my own Ruin, and that divers ways; a
Hazard to my Friends, and to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners
which were of my Mind; how
my Lord of <hi>London,</hi> had a Wife and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
which might all be overthrown at
one Blow. But after Midnight ſleeping,
towards the Morning I conſider'd on the
other Side, That my Conſcience was more
unto me than all the World; that it was
a fearful thing, in Place of Judgment, to
give a Sentence againſt mine own Heart;
That <hi>Olivarius,</hi> the Chancellor of <hi>France,</hi>
upon ſuch an Occaſion, grew Mad, and
dy'd in it: That the Manner of our Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0639300101:46"/>
muſt be <hi>Solum Deum prae Oculis ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bentes,
a rei veritate inſpecta</hi>; all which,
and the like Meditations, did much pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponderate
with me. Then I ſlept again,
and now riſing, I found my Heart much
ſettled, to perſiſt in that which I held to
be Truth. I pour'd out earneſtly my Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
to God, and was now ſtrongly reſolv'd,
to leave all to God, remembring, That
he had preſerv'd me from my Mother's
Womb; that he had from Time to Time,
rid me out of all my Troubles; that his
Power was the ſame ſtill; that he would
never forſake me, if I turn'd not from
him. I forgot not, <hi>That the Hearts of Kings
were in the Hand of the Lord</hi>; that I had
Experience of the Graciouſneſs, both of
GOD and the King, the Year before;
when ſtanding earneſtly in a good Cauſe,
that Prince <hi>Henry</hi> ſhould not marry a
<hi>Papist,</hi> I receiv'd ſome ſharp Words from
the King for my Labour; but the next
Day his Majeſty us'd me very kindly
again. To this I added, That Poverty,
Impriſonment, Death it ſelf, were things
contemptible to a reſolv'd Mind: That
ſome of my Predeceſſors, as Arch-Biſhop
<hi>Cranmer,</hi> and my Lord <hi>Grindal,</hi> had given
good Examples of theſe Sufferings, and
they were recorded in the Catalogue of
the Righteous. Theſe Thoughts thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volv'd,
I read again the Letter from the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0639300101:47"/>
King, and drawing out into a Paper, all
the ſharp Words, I conſider'd them again
and again, and methought they were
not altogether ſo bitter as I apprehended
them; that they were wrung from his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
by my Lord Chamberlain's Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity;
that my Maſter had deſerv'd at
my Hands, that I ſhould bear patiently
twenty times more; and that all was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
ſo the Clearneſs of my Conſcience
might be preſerv'd. With theſe Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
on the <hi>Saturday,</hi> I came to <hi>Lambeth,</hi>
where I met with the News of <hi>Overbury</hi>'s
Death, and the ſound of ſome fearful Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions
thereupon, bruted about the
City. I made Trial of my Lord of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>'s
Conſtancy, telling him, <hi>aut cidendum,
aut cadendum.</hi> I found him moſt reſolv'd,
avowing unto me, <hi>That if he ſhould pronounce
for the Diſſolution of the Marriage, he thought
the Devil would that Night fetch away his
Soul.</hi> Yea, he was earneſt on me, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
where I began, telling me, <hi>That the
Eyes of the whole Church of</hi> England <hi>were
upon me, and expected of me, that I ſhould
ſhew my ſelf a worthy Man.</hi> At laſt we
came to ſit, where my Lords of <hi>Wincheſter</hi>
and <hi>Worceſter,</hi> took their Places. The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
was read, the Fact, and Manner of
the Proceſs was open'd, and nothing notable
done, ſaving that my Lord of <hi>London,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing,
that it was fit that my Lord of
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0639300101:48"/>
                  <hi>Eſſex</hi> ſhould be call'd to explain himſelf
farther, for the fiſhing out of the Truth, all
the Commiſſioners moſt willing aſſented
thereunto, (yea, my Lords of <hi>Wincheſter</hi>
and <hi>Worceſter</hi> expreſsly,) ſaving Sir <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius
Caeſar,</hi> who ſoftly declar'd his Diſlike
thereof, in my hearing. When the Court
was riſen, I ſpake with my Lord of <hi>Litch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field,</hi>
and not thinking fit to return any
thing to the King in Writing, I pray'd
him to acquaint his Majeſty how Things
ſtood; and to tell him, that upon this
Courſe of new calling my Lord of <hi>Eſſex,</hi>
I hop'd in the End, we ſhould give his
Majeſty Satisfaction. The <hi>Sunday</hi> I ſpent at
<hi>Croydon,</hi> and preach'd on that Text of
Chriſt's raiſing the Widow's Son of <hi>Naim,</hi>
to the great Comfort of mine own Heart.
That Day I conferr'd with a Friend, and
ſettled ſome Courſes, if any Trouble ſhould
befal unto me. I was alſo by a good Friend
inform'd, that my Lord of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> on that
<hi>Sunday</hi> Morning, having five or ſix Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
and Gentlemen of Worth in his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
and Speech being made of his Inabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
roſe out of his Bed, and taking up his
Shirt, did ſhew to them all, ſo able, and
extraordinarily ſufficient Matter, that they
all cry'd out Shame of his Lady, and ſaid,
That if the Ladies of the Court knew as
much as they knew, they would tread her
to Death.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:0639300101:49"/>
On the <hi>Monday</hi> we met at <hi>Lambeth</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
and Information was given on the
Part of my Lady. Theſe things paſs'd
quietly. When the Court was riſen, my
Lord of <hi>Litchfield</hi> told me, That he had
made his Majeſty acquainted with our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
on <hi>Saturday,</hi> but that his Majeſty
was ſtrongly againſt it, my Lord of <hi>Eſſex</hi>
ſhould any more be call'd, and that by no
means he would endure it; for that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure,
the ſaid Earl, either being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vok'd
by the late Challenge between him
and Mr. <hi>Henry Howard,</hi> or otherwiſe inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated
by the Earl of <hi>Southampton,</hi> might
ſpeak ſomewhat which might marr the
Buſineſs. This made me ſtill ſuſpect, that
all was not right, and I reply'd to my
Lord, <hi>If that be deny'd us, and we have no
farther Proof, I ſhall never give Sentence for
the Nullity: As good declare my Mind at firſt,
as at laſt, and I pray you ſo acquaint his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty.</hi>
When I went Homeward, I much
revolv'd this in my Heart, thinking, Good
Lord! What a Caſe is this? Shall any
Truth be kept from us? Are they afraid
to have all out? Do they only look to
attain their own Ends, and care not how
our Conſciences be intangled and enſnar'd?
On the <hi>Wedneſday</hi> we met again, and now
Dr. <hi>James</hi> is come to us, and by and by
cometh in my Lord of <hi>Ely,</hi> who, as it
ſeem'd, had meant to have kept him away,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0639300101:50"/>
but the King ſent an expreſs Meſſenger
for him, requiring him by a Letter, to be
there on the <hi>Tueſday</hi> Night. Now are we
<hi>plena Curia.</hi> Before we ſate down, Sir
<hi>Thomas Lake</hi> delivereth a Meſſage unto me
from the King, That his Majeſty deſir'd
a ſpeedy End of this Buſineſs; that it had
hung long, and the World was in expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it; that the Term grew on, which
would be full of Buſineſſes: That his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
on <hi>Monday,</hi> was to go to <hi>Windſor,</hi>
to meet the Queen, and my Lord <hi>Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain</hi>
with him; that therefore he would have
us to fall cloſe to our Work, not to trouble
our ſelves on the Morrow, to come ſee
the King, who would come late to <hi>White-Hall,</hi>
becauſe ſome Ceremonies were to be
perform'd, as upon the laſt Day of Hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
that we ſhould not attend his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
'till <hi>Friday,</hi> but that the Sentence muſt
be given on <hi>Saturday.</hi> My Anſwer was
publickly, <hi>That there ſhould be no Stay in me,
and that therefore on the Morrow, we would
ſit Forenoon and Afternoon, if the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners
ſo pleas'd; and if they thought good,
Is would not refuſe to ſit until Midnight.</hi>
But in mine own Heart I perceiv'd, that all
the Care was, that the Matter might be
diſpatch'd before the Queen ſpake with the
King, whom they ſuppos'd not to wiſh
well to the Buſineſs. We go to our Court,
and Sir <hi>Thomas Lake</hi> ſtay'd to hear the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0639300101:51"/>
Information on my Lord's Part. It was
ſtrange, to ſee how my Lord of <hi>Wincheſter</hi>
carry'd himſelf that Day, partly to play
his Prizes before Sir <hi>Thomas Lake,</hi> who
might make Report of it to his Fame,
and partly to ſhew his Ludi-magiſterial
Diſpoſition. He ſnapp'd up my Lord's
Council, that they could not ſpeak a
Word, but he catch'd it before it was out.
I know what you will ſay, when indeed
he knew not, neither was it any ſuch
Matter as he imagin'd. God Almighty
will tell you a Tale for that; <hi>I tell you,
Doctor</hi> Bennet<hi>, I have as much Law as you,
I am as good a Lawyer as you are.</hi> He fell
divers Times on my Lord of <hi>London</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally,
and would needs know of him
openly, <hi>How many times in a Year, a Man was
bound Carnally to know his Wife.</hi> In a Word,
with Scoffs, and imperious Behaviour, he
play'd the Advocate all that Day, to the
great Offence of the Standers by, ſo that
it was publickly ſpoke of in <hi>London,</hi> which,
I think, came to his Ears; ſo that ever
afterward, he carry'd himſelf more tracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
I was forc'd to bear it, becauſe of
avoiding new Complaints.</p>
               <p>The Point moſt obſervable that Day,
was, that both my Lord of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi>
and my Lord of <hi>Ely,</hi> did deny Maleficiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
ſo that by no Means they would
have this Queſtion to proceed in that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0639300101:52"/>
which I openly did thank them for,
and bound it upon, before all the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners
and Standers by, telling them, <hi>That
the ſame was my Opinion.</hi> But I aſk'd my
Lord of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> who ſate by me, <hi>What
be then held it to be.</hi> He told me private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<hi>That he held it to be a Natural Impotency,
which was before the Marriage.</hi> I aſk'd him,
<hi>What that might be, and whence he gather'd it.</hi>
He anſwer'd, <hi>I have heard divers Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
which are enough to perſwade me if they
be True. Yea,</hi> my Lord ſaid I, <hi>if they be
True, I have heard as many to the contrary.
I wiſh that we might examine, whether they
be True or no; that were fair Proceeding.
It is my Grief, that it is not permitted unto
us, to try whether all theſe Matters be ſo or
not. This might ſatisfy a Man's Conſcience.</hi>
So we parted that Night.</p>
               <p>On the <hi>Thurſday,</hi> at Ten of the Clock,
we met in <hi>Lambeth-Hall,</hi> where my Lady's
Council took on them, to anſwer ſome
Scruples objected by Dr. <hi>Ferrand.</hi> But Dr.
<hi>Martin,</hi> when no Body ſpake of it, fell
to wipe away that Objection, that my
Lord had not ſworn, <hi>Cum Septima mann.</hi>
Upon his Speech, the Commiſſioners took
hold of it, and it then being urg'd ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
my Lady's Council ſtood at firſt, as if
they had been blaſted with Lightning.
Afterward they grew extream angry with
Dr. <hi>Martin,</hi> that he had propos'd it, but
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0639300101:53"/>
the Iſſue was, there could no Anſwer be
given unto it; but in the Sight of all
the Standers by, this was broke off with
Shame and Confuſion of Faces. We din'd
not that Day, but about one or two of the
Clock, we withdrew our ſelves privately
into the Parlour. I had thought there to
have had Dr. <hi>Edwards,</hi> and the reſt who
lik'd not of the Nullity, to propound their
Doubts, and ſo in Order; and laſt of all,
I would have ſpoken. But there I found
a contrary Courſe reſolv'd, which my Lord
of <hi>Wincheſter</hi> ſeem'd much to diſlike. But
my Lord of <hi>Litchfield,</hi> Sir <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> and
Sir <hi>Daniel Dun,</hi> had ſet the Clock, and they
muſt have their Will. The ſix Reaſons are
produc'd, which Sir <hi>John Bennet</hi> had deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
the Day after we came from <hi>Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor,</hi>
and the Copy whereof, was by me ſent
to the King. All theſe muſt in their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
be debated. One was about the unper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectneſs
of the Libel, in which we all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
Satisfaction, that the Libel was well
to ſo much purpoſe as now they declar'd
they would have it. The other five, my
Lord of <hi>London,</hi> Sir <hi>John Bennet,</hi> Dr. <hi>James,</hi>
and Dr. <hi>Edwards,</hi> maintain'd: I allow'd of
three of them abſolutely<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the other
two, that was Inſpection of my Lord's Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
and a Time to be aſſign'd by the
Judge, to try whether they might Carnal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
know one another, I held to be fit,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0639300101:54"/>
when thoſe Reaſons were propos'd; but
now ſuch Flames and Quarrels were ariſen,
I thought not amiſs now to be forborn
My Lord of <hi>Litchfield,</hi> with a Pen, did
note what every Man reſolv'd, but prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally
my Words, with a Purpoſe to
ſhew them to the King, as I conceiv'd,
and afterwards I found it to be ſo. I was
deſirous therefore, that his Majeſty might
ſee I was not Obſtinate, but ſettled to yield
to Reaſon. And again, I ſuppos'd, that
this Candor of mine, would make ſome
of them yield to us, where they ſaw there
was unevitable Truth. But I found it far
otherwiſe, for our Afternoon's Work was,
that they gave ſhuffling and ſhifting An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers
to the Objections, ſuch as themſelves
had ſtudy'd all the Vacation; but no Care
was, whither they were True and Satisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
or not. And to what Sir <hi>Daniel</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd,
all Seven of them conſented, without
ſticking or ſcruple, ſo that I might ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
it was a ſet Play. Upon the firſt
Scruple debating, Sir <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> finding
the Difference of Opinions, and that our
Lawyers ſtuck ſtrongly unto it, <hi>Let us,</hi>
ſaith he, <hi>put it to the Queſtion, and let the
major Part of Voices determine it.</hi> When
I ſaw this to be the Proceeding, the Lord,
thought I, deliver me from ſuch Judges.
But yet obſerving their Manner, I poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs'd
my Soul in Patience. When it grew
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0639300101:55"/>
to be dark, that the King might underſtand,
that I was willing to allow time to all that
might be ſaid, I remember'd Sir <hi>John Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net</hi>
to read the Sentence of the <hi>Rota Romana,</hi>
where, in the Popes own Conſiſtory, about
the Year 1585, a Judgment was revers'd,
which an Arch-biſhop in <hi>Spain,</hi> had given
for a Nullity, in a Caſe being ours alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
becauſe, after the triennial Coha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation,
he had not aſſign'd a Time for
the marry'd Couple to make Trial again,
and to uſe Faſting and Prayer. This Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal
was read at large, and ſo was another
of the <hi>Rota,</hi> in the ſame Kind. But both
theſe were ſlighted, as Matters of Nothing,
and ſo I think had St. <hi>Paul</hi> been, if he
had been there. I urg'd that of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
III, That even in <hi>France</hi> it ſelf, no
Nullity had been allow'd; but that it was
<hi>Conſuetudo generalis Eccleſiae Gallicanae</hi>; and
that <hi>Eccleſia Romana,</hi> did know or practice
no ſuch thing. This was ſlighted like the
former, and I perceiv'd it was but in vain to
ſpeak to them, for they were reſolv'd, and
be it Good, or be it Bad, the Matter ſhould
be done.</p>
               <p>On the <hi>Friday</hi> Morning I went to <hi>White-Hall,</hi>
and looking ſomewhat heavily, the
King cometh to me, and to my Lord Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor,
and offereth us both his Hand to
kiſs. He might perceive by my Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
that I was not a little troubl'd, and
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0639300101:56"/>
that was perceiv'd by divers of the Lords,
who privately let me know their Minds,
that we had a foul and ſtrange Matter
in Hand at <hi>Lambeth.</hi> At laſt, the King
takes me aſide, and after propounding
three or four Buſineſſes, walking, he took
me to the Window, and aſk'd me, <hi>How
that great Cauſe did go forward?</hi> I told
his Majeſty, <hi>That I had no Liking of it;
that I had receiv'd a Letter and Writing from
him which very much troubled me, for I knew
my ſelf to be his dutiful Servant, and had not
deſerv'd Ill of him; that it was nothing to me
whether ſhe remain'd Wife to the Earl of</hi> Eſſex<hi>,
or were marry'd to another Man; but that I
might not give Sentence where I ſaw no Proof;
that I had liv'd fifty one Years, almoſt, and had
my Conſcience uncorrupted in Judgment; that
I knew not how ſoon I was to be call'd before
God, and I was loath, againſt that Time, to
give a Wound to mine own Soul; that all my
Grief was, that his Majeſty's Hand was in it;
that for other Men I car'd not; that I choſe
rather to die an honeſt Man than a wiſe Man;
that he muſt never afterward expect true Service
of me, for, how could I be true to him, who
was falſe unto God; that if he mark'd it
well, this was no Time to diſgrace his good
Servants:</hi> I told him, <hi>That if his Majeſty
pleas'd to let the Matter alone, as he did all
other Cauſes, I would make good my Part againſt
all</hi> England<hi>, on the Peril of my Head.</hi> The
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0639300101:57"/>
King anſwer'd, <hi>That I would have no Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers.</hi>
I reply'd, <hi>Yes, enough, There is not
an honeſt Lawyer in</hi> England <hi>that would not
be on my Side.</hi> His Majeſty aſk'd me, <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the reſt of the Commiſſioners, Yeſterday, did
not perſwade me.</hi> I told him, <hi>No; but their
Dealing, rather drove me the contrary Way.
For,</hi> (ſaid I) <hi>I came thither ingeniouſly to
yield to any Truth that ſhould be ſhew'd me; but
they, on the contrary Part, in a factious Courſe
went wholly together, and what one ſaid, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſaid, be it Well, or be it Ill, without any
Scruple.</hi> To my Speech, <hi>That it was an
Example that never had been in</hi> England;
the King ſaid, <hi>Yes,</hi> Berry'<hi>s Caſe.</hi> I beſeech'd
his Majeſty, <hi>That he would not believe that
Cauſe to be any ſuch Matter; for if he would
pardon me, it ſhould not be long before that I
would ſhew, that his Separation was for Lack
of his Stones.</hi> In this debating, the King
was very deſirous to know, what ſhould be
the Reaſons whereupon I ſtood, that I
might have Satisfaction. My Anſwer was,
<hi>That when I was in Place of Judgment, I would
not conceal the Reaſons of my Sentence, but it
was to no Purpoſe to ſpeak them now; it would
but put his Majeſty to a new Trouble to hear
them, and then ſome Man muſt anſwer them,
who look'd to his own End, and to make a plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
Anſwer, which would not content me,
without ground of Truth.</hi> A great Part of
the Time, that I had this Speech with the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0639300101:58"/>
King, my Eyes were full of Tears, which
I ſaw, much mov'd my gracious Maſter,
and eſpecially, my earneſt Deſire, <hi>That I
might do my Conſcience.</hi> I perceiv'd the King
was much overcome, by this my honeſt
Dealing: And then, whilſt his Majeſty
went to ſpeak with my Lord Privy-Seal,
and my Lord Chamberlain, who ſtood all
this while at the farther End of the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery;
and to whom, I conceiv'd, the King
told much of that which I had ſpoken; I
went my ways to <hi>Lambeth,</hi> to Dinner.
Now grew I confident to do my Conſcience
right, whatſoever came of it. That Day
I din'd privately, but yet, my Lord Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
of <hi>Bath</hi> was with me, whom, when I
had acquainted with ſo much of the Cauſe,
as I thought fit, I receiv'd no Diſcourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
from him. My Heart was much
eas'd, and now I thought I ſhould no more
be troubled. Yet, between three and four
a Clock, after Dinner, my Lord of <hi>Litch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field</hi>
cometh to me from the King, and
bringeth a written Treatiſe upon the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Argument, which was the Work of a
<hi>Scotchman,</hi> I know not who. I receiv'd it,
and promis'd that Night to read it; as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
I did, riding in my Coach to <hi>Croydon</hi>;
for thither I thought fit to withdraw my
ſelf, though it were late, for avoiding of
more Perturbation. This Treatiſe no way
pleas'd me, but I thought it the Work of
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0639300101:59"/>
ſome hungry Fellow, who lack'd twenty
Shillings to buy Food to his Belly. Here,
finding it the Day of the End of my Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
I ſettled much of my domeſtick Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
I forgot not to commend my ſelf,
and the whole Cauſe, to God by Prayer.
I meditated many Things in my Bed: In
the Morning I roſe early, and before Day,
in my Study, I ſet down ſome Heads, what
I would ſpeak unto. Then went I early
to <hi>Lambeth,</hi> and there ſupply'd my brief
Notes, digeſting my Matter of Sentence
into Order; being reſolv'd to ſpeak large,
and home to the Cauſe, without Touch of
any Perſon more than I muſt needs. By
this Time, moſt of the Commiſſioners were
come. I ſent for my Lord of <hi>London,</hi> Sir
<hi>John Bennet,</hi> Dr. <hi>James,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Edwards,</hi>
ſingly and ſeverally, into my Study: I
requir'd them, before God, not to ſpeak
any thing for reſpect to me, but to do that,
which in their Learning and Conſcience
they thought to be juſt, and to ſpeak that
<hi>intrepid,</hi> without Blemiſh to any Man,
but ſoundly to the Matter. I found them
all avowing, that in their Souls, they found
no Warrant for the Nullity. I then
wiſh'd ſeverally, Dr. <hi>James,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,</hi>
to deliver their Sentence, with ſome
Reaſons adjoyn'd, not many, but of the
ſtrongeſt. I told Sir <hi>John Bennet,</hi> that this
Day, I expected he ſhould ſhew himſelf a
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0639300101:60"/>
worthy Man; that he ſhould deliver his
Judgment <hi>per extenſum</hi>; that they had
labour'd to blemiſh his Skill, and to ſlight
his Learning eſpecially, therefore, both
for his Conſcience, and his Credit, he
ſhould ſhew what was in him, to maintain
an honeſt Cauſe. If Sir <hi>Daniel Dun,</hi> and
Sir <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> who came after him, ſhould
beſpatter him in their Choler, or lay any
Imputation upon him, he ſhould find that
ſome of us would take it off him. To my
Lord of <hi>London,</hi> I ſaid, <hi>We have three that
ſpeak firſt, who, I truſt, will lay ſuch a Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the Heart of the Hearers, as ſhall not
be remov'd. But the other Side have this Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
over us, they are ſeven of them Lawyers
and Biſhops, to anſwer what our three have
ſaid; and perhaps with weak Men, ſuch a Stream
of ſuch Perſons may much prevail: But let not
that diſmay you, my Lord, only take this Courſe;
Deliver, firſt, your own Meditations; and then,
having taken with your Pen, ſome of the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities,
which, in the Sentence, ſome of them
will deliver, blaſt thoſe, and let the Auditors
ſee, that by you the Stream is turn'd. Then
leave it to me, and I doubt not, in Almighty
God, but to batter their Nullity to Duſt. That
tho' they have it by the major part of Voices,
yet, the World ſhall ſee what the Cauſe is, and
they ſhall have little Comfort by it. I am very
well provided; I am no way afraid; and you
ſhall ſee, I will not be Tongue-ty'd.</hi> So confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0639300101:61"/>
was I in the Honeſty of the Cauſe,
and in the Helps of Almighty God, that I
was not now afraid of ten thouſands of
People; but did long to be at the Buſineſs,
as the Lord truely knoweth.</p>
               <p>When now I was alone, revolving my
Meditations, Sir <hi>J. Caeſar</hi> cometh into my
Study, to me, telleth me, <hi>That he wonder'd
that my Lord of</hi> Wincheſter <hi>was not come,
that it was even ten a Clock, that therefore it
was fit, that the Hour ſhould be continu'd from
ten to twelve.</hi> I aſſented thereto; and by
ſome of the Commiſſioners the Time was
prorogu'd. Then cometh in Sir <hi>Thomas
Lake,</hi> with a Meſſage from the King, which
he muſt not deliver 'till all the Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners
were come together. So he was forc'd
to ſtay. Between Ten and Eleven, cometh
in my Lord of <hi>Wincheſter</hi>; who, as afterwards
found, had been all the Morning at the
Court. I told him, <hi>We had ſtay'd for him
two Hours and a half.</hi> His Lordſhip ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
excus'd it. Then, in the Gallery, Sir
<hi>Thomas Lake</hi> told us, <hi>That his Majeſty had
ſent him unto us, to deliver two Things.</hi> The
one was, <hi>That in our Sentence, we ſhould take
heed of gauling of any Perſon.</hi> My Anſwer
was, <hi>That from the Beginning of this Proceſs,
we had ever been wary not to offend in that
Kind; and that he ſhould be much to Blame,
who, in the Concluſion, would tranſgreſs that
way.</hi> And ſo ſaid the reſt. The other was,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0639300101:62"/>
                  <hi>That we ſhould not in any long Manner, but
compendiouſly, deliver what we had to ſay.</hi> I
pray'd Sir <hi>Thomas Lake</hi> to explain that far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
whether we were only to ſay Yea or
or No, and no more: For I would obey the
King's Commandment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tu Regina jube, mihi juſſa capeſſere fas eſt.</hi>
He anſwer'd, <hi>That he could not ſay ſo, but that
we were to ſpeak briefly. Yea,</hi> but ſaid Sir <hi>Julius
Caeſar, I know the King's Mind; for I was Yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
with him, and he told me, that he expected that
we ſhould go no farther than Yea, or Nay, for
of Reaſons there would be no End. Yea,</hi> ſaith
he, <hi>The King told me he was promis'd ſo much.
By whom,</hi> ſaid I. <hi>I think,</hi> quoth he, <hi>by your
Grace. Not ſo,</hi> ſaid I: But I ſaid, indeed,
<hi>Let every Man deliver his own Conſcience, I
will not perturb the Sentence. No more indeed
will I.</hi> Then he replyeth, <hi>I know the King
expecteth we ſhould ſay no more, than I do like
this Sentence, or, I do not like it. And that
you know, Sir</hi> Daniel Dun<hi>, is the Manner of
the Delegates, and not to go farther. It is ſo,</hi>
ſaith Sir <hi>Daniel.</hi> Upon this, the Biſhops
all ſaid, <hi>We were beſt to proceed in that Faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
To which, I reply'd, <hi>I will not be
willful, but if it be agreed upon, and it be
the King's Pleaſure, I will obey. But look you
to it; for if any Man give a Reaſon, I am
no more bound than he, but that I will return
the Reaſon of my Opinion and Judgment.</hi>
They all ſaid, they would be obſervant of
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0639300101:63"/>
it. Thus Sir <hi>Thomas Lake</hi> was diſmiſs'd.
Then we call'd for the Sentences on both
Sides, which the Counſel had ready. They
diſlik'd that which was Abſolutory of the
Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> and we approv'd it. We
found Fault with the other Sentence,
Anullatory, both for the Whole, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe,
ſome Parts in it, in our Judgment,
were apparently falſe. But they perſiſted
in their Intention. So we went into the
Hall, where, my ſelf, my Lord of <hi>London,</hi>
Sir <hi>John Bennet,</hi> Dr. <hi>James,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,</hi>
freed my Lord of <hi>Eſſex.</hi> The Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
of <hi>Winton, Ely, Litchfield,</hi> and <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter,</hi>
together with the two Chancellors,
and Sir <hi>Daniel Dun,</hi> pronounc'd for the
Nullity, and ſubſcrib'd the Sentence, my
Lord of <hi>Winton</hi> pronouncing it. We per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
that they were afraid we ſhould at
large ſpeak our Reaſons openly, being the
laſt who were to ſpeak.</p>
               <p>The three Biſhops, of <hi>Winton, Ely,</hi>
and <hi>Litchfield,</hi> went immediately to the
Court, hoping to receive great Thanks for
their Service, but they waited a full Hour,
e'er they could ſpeak with the King; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they ſped afterward. And we were
glad that we were freed of the Trouble.
And now, I, who would not have given
the Sentence for all the Gold in <hi>India,</hi> do
expect God's Pleaſure, what will become of
this Buſineſs hereafter, and ſubmit my ſelf
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0639300101:64"/>
to God's Providence, who ever preſerveth
thoſe that truſt in him.</p>
               <closer>THIS Narration is wholly written with
mine own Hand, and was finiſh'd the ſecond
of <hi>October,</hi> 1613, being the eighth Day after
the giving of the Sentence. And I protest be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Almighty God, that I have not willingly
written any Untruth therein; but have deliver'd
all things fairly, to the beſt of my Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
helping my ſelf with ſuch Memorials
and Notes, as I took from Time to Time, that
if there were occaſion, I might thus at large

the Nullity, the Minds of Men
in their ſeveral Places, were
wonderfully diſtracted, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
one ſpake according to
their Fancies. But for the moſt part there
was a Deteſtation of the Thing, and a great
Diſlike of thoſe that gave the Sentence,
which was expreſs'd by all Courſes that
Men durſt adventure upon. On the other
Side, there was a ſtrange applauding and
commending, of thoſe who withſtood the
Separation; and from all Parts a Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
came unto them, That they had done
like Honeſt Men, albeit the only Scope
which they aim'd at, was the Diſcharge of
their Conſcience, and not vain Popular Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe.
The Arch-biſhop the Day after
the Sentence, went to the Court, to <hi>White-Hall,</hi>
and waited on the King to Chapel,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0639300101:66"/>
ſtanding alſo by him in the Cloſet, where
he was ſtrangely look'd on by the King,
as he was alſo by ſome of the Lords; but
nothing being ſaid unto him, he took no
Notice of it, but bore all patiently. This
Strangeneſs of the King held on at <hi>Hampton-Court,</hi>
and elſewhere; and it came to the
Arch-biſhop's Ear, that the King ſpake
divers Times hardly of him, but much
magnify'd them of the Affirmative Part,
and eſpecially my Lord of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> as
the worthieſt Man in the Kingdom. Some
things were done alſo in Recompence to
divers of them; as Sir <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi>'s Son
was made a Knight, my Lord of <hi>Winton</hi>'s
Son alſo had the ſame Reward, which ſome
merry Fellow blighted with the Name of
Sir <hi>Nullity Hilſon</hi>; and the Biſhop of <hi>Litch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field</hi>
muſt remove to <hi>Lincoln</hi>; and as for
<hi>Litchfield,</hi> it muſt be beſtow'd on Mr. Dean
of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s, that ſo Doctor <hi>Cary</hi> might be
preferr'd to the Deanery of <hi>Paul</hi>'s, for which
it was generally ſuppos'd, he ſhould pay
well. But now it run currant, that the
Arch-biſhop muſt no more have to do
with Naming any to Church-Livings, but
ſome Lords in Court ſhould diſpoſe of all;
and principally it muſt be provided, that
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Abbot</hi> muſt never be preferr'd, no, not
ſo much as to <hi>Litchfield,</hi> ſo far was he from
<hi>Lincoln,</hi> which was formerly promis'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him. Theſe things grew deteſtable to
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0639300101:67"/>
the People, who fear'd that even Religion
would ſmart for it; but the Parties moſt
malign'd, were ſilent and patient, expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
God's Leiſure, and Malice enough from
ſome other Men. The firſt thing of Bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs
that appear'd, was a Letter from
<hi>Royſton,</hi> under the King's Hand and Signet,
directed to the Commiſſioners in the former
Sentence, but brought to the Arch-Biſhop
about three Weeks after the Sentence. This
was a moſt ſharp Letter, complaining that
they of the Negative Part, for ſo they
were ſtil'd, had hinder'd the Act to be
made upon the Sentence; had ſolemnly
Proteſted againſt that which was done; had
given unto themſelves other Titles than
were in the King's Commiſſion; had glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify'd
themſelves in that which was done;
by which they laid an Imputation upon
the King's Conſcience, who had declar'd
himſelf for the Divorce, and other things
of the like Nature. This Letter being read
to the Commiſſioners, the Arch-biſhop ſaid,
That he knew not what it meant; for he
underſtood of no Man that Proteſted, nor
knew nothing of any Man's arrogating of
Titles to him, or glorifying himſelf: And
as for the Act, he ſuppos'd it to be made
up in common Form, and never heard ought
to the contrary, neither meddled with any
thing therein, but left it to the Regiſter,
and what he had done with it, he could not
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0639300101:68"/>
tell. Furthermore, he aſk'd all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners
particularly, if they knew what
this meant, or if any of them were able
to charge thoſe of the Negative, with
the Points quarrelled at; who all, with one
Conſent, deny'd that they could, and
expreſsly averr'd, that there was no ſuch
thing done at the Time of the Sentence,
as had been complain'd upon. When ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thus in Admiration, Sir <hi>Daniel Dun</hi>
took upon him to underſtand the Matter,
and ſaid, that if the Regiſter were call'd,
it would appear there was ſomething in it.
<hi>Barker,</hi> the Regiſter, is ſent for, and being
demanded whether he had made up the Act,
he ſaid that he had drawn it up in a Form
that he lik'd, but ſome other of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners
did diſlike it. And thereupon he
ſhew'd two Forms, the one more large,
the other more brief; but both of them ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
in it, that the Arch-biſhop, and the
reſt of the Negative Party, proteſted againſt
the Sentence. Here every Man wonder'd
at him, out of what Ground he ſhould do
this; and all the Commiſſioners with one
Conſent, very much rebuk'd him, profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,
that there was no ſuch Proteſtation
us'd. For the reſt of the Charge in the
King's Letter, <hi>Barker</hi> freed all in all things,
ſave only Dr. <hi>Edwards,</hi> who was abſent by
reaſon of his ſore Eyes. The Arch-biſhop
upon this, deſir'd the Commiſſioners to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:0639300101:69"/>
their Judgment touching Dr. <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,</hi>
'till he might anſwer for himſelf,
ſaying, that Honour, Juſtice, and Charity,
requir'd ſo much in his Behalf; and adding
withal, that he doubted not but it would
prove ſome miſtaking of the Regiſter's Part,
to whom it was apparent, that ſmall Credit
was to be given, ſince he had ſo groſsly ſet
down of them, that they Proteſted, when
all the Commiſſioners could witneſs the
contrary. Moreover he deſir'd Mr. Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor
of the Exchequer, and Sir <hi>Daniel Dun,</hi>
to certify the Lord Chamberlain, how free
and innocent from thoſe Aſperſions, the
reſt were found, and that from Top to Toe,
it was nothing but Miſpriſion. Before this
Truth was diſcover'd, it was known that a
Gentleman of the Earl of <hi>Northampton</hi>'s,
had ſaid to Sir <hi>John Leviſon,</hi> and that, as
from his Lordſhip, <hi>That there was ſomething
deſcry'd, which would break the Arch-biſhop</hi>'s
<hi>Back</hi>; ſuch Account was made of his Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs.</p>
               <p>Thus Things paſs'd ſilently until the
next Week, when upon the <hi>Thurſday,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
High Commiſſion Day, Dr. <hi>Edwards</hi>
being amended, repair'd to <hi>Lambeth.</hi> His
coming was watched; and then was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
to the Arch-biſhop a ſecond Letter
from the King, commending the Concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of all to the Act, to be made up in
common Form; but requiring the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0639300101:70"/>
to convene Dr. <hi>Edwards</hi> and the
Regiſter before them, and to charge them
with all the fore-remember'd Matters, and
to learn where the Fault did lie. It was
alſo commanded, that they ſhould require
the ſaid Doctor and Regiſter, to ſet down
in Writing what had paſs'd between them;
and if it were found that Dr. <hi>Edwards</hi> were
to blame, he ſhould be ſuſpended 'till the
King's Pleaſure were farther known.</p>
               <p>Theſe Things are fallen upon; and Dr.
<hi>Edwards</hi> ſhew'd that the Regiſter had
wronged him, and that no Part of the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation
was true, <hi>in modo &amp; forma,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealing
to the Commiſſioners, what Faith
might be given to <hi>Barker</hi> conteſting againſt
him; when it had been manifeſtly proved,
that he had forged the Matter of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation
againſt my Lord of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> my
Lord of <hi>London,</hi> and the reſt. Time is aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned
to them to deliver in their Writings,
and accordingly, about two Days after,
Dr. <hi>Edwards</hi> bringeth to the Arch-biſhop
his Anſwer, denying the Points whereon
he was accus'd. But <hi>Barker</hi> brought no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
till a Fortnight after; and then, by
Candle-light, when the High-Commiſſion
was riſen, and the Commiſſioners were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted,
he delivereth a long Writing to the
Arch-biſhop, who could not read it that
Night; but reproved him for detaining
it ſo long.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:0639300101:71"/>
On the Morrow, my Lord of <hi>Canterbury</hi>
perus'd this Declaration; as as he found it
to be uncertainly and diffidently ſet down
for ſome other Circumſtances, ſo he diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
there one Thing much to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
and that was, that <hi>Barker</hi> delivered,
That ſome few Days after the Sentence,
the Lord Chamberlain ſent for him, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Fault that the Act was not made up.
And there Speech was, That ſome deſir'd
to have their Titles put in, as well as the
Titles of others; and for that, <hi>Barker</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
Sir <hi>John Bennet.</hi> Whereunto the Lord
Chamberlain ſaid, <hi>I know no Title that he
hath</hi>: <hi>Yes,</hi> ſaid <hi>Barker, he is Judge of the
Prerogative Court of</hi> Canterbury. But <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker</hi>
concludeth the Narration, That him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
finding that he had named Sir <hi>John
Bennet</hi> unjuſtly, therefore was in mind to
excuſe him, and was about to ſay, that he
had done him Wrong; but the Lord Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlain
was ſo angry, that he could not bring
it forth; but went his Way, leaving the
Lord in that Opinion.</p>
               <p>By this it was deſcry'd, that in the firſt
Letter Sir <hi>John Bennet</hi> was aim'd at, as
well as Dr. <hi>Edwards,</hi> to put ſome Diſgrace
upon him, which made Men wonderouſly
marvel at the vindicative Mind of ſome
Men, who ſought for an Occaſion to do
other Men Diſgrace. The End of the
Matter was, That no Man could be touch'd;
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0639300101:72"/>
and therefore the Arch-biſhop, taking Sir
<hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> with him, acquainted the King
(who was now return'd from <hi>Royſton</hi>) with
the State of the whole Matter; informing
his Majeſty, that Fault fell on no Man
ſave the Regiſter; and therefore, if his
Highneſs were pleaſed to have him pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd,
it might be ſo: But for the Thing
itſelf, ſince the Report was more than
there was Cauſe, Mr. Chancellor of the
<hi>Exchequer</hi> ſaid, It was better to let it die,
and ſtir in it no farther. To this the
King aſſented, being not willing that any
Puniſhment ſhould be laid on the Regiſter;
whereby it appeared, that the Intendment
was, in the ſtirring of theſe Coals, to
have burnt ſome greater Perſons than <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,</hi>
the Regiſter.</p>
               <p>All this while it was confidently given
out, That becauſe the Sentence had been
oppos'd, there ſhould a Book be written in
the Defence of it; and one while it ſhould
be by a Divine, and that ſometimes was
my Lord of <hi>Winton,</hi> and ſometimes my
Lord of <hi>Ely</hi>; and it was ſaid, they were
earneſtly about it: Another while, it
ſhould be by a Civilian, and then Sir <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel
Dun</hi> muſt do it: But at other Times it
muſt be by a <hi>Scotchman,</hi> who had written
ſomewhat of that Argument before the
Sentence; and other while two <hi>Scotchmen</hi>
muſt join together about it: And to make
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:0639300101:73"/>
the Thing the more probable, the Lord
<hi>Felton</hi> ſent to the Arch-biſhop for the Copy
of the <hi>Scotch</hi>-man's Writing, which was
ſent unto him; and after copying of it out,
it was return'd to my Lord of <hi>Canterbury</hi>
again. This Speech of a Book continu'd
about nine Weeks in all; but at laſt Dr.
<hi>Stuart,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Bird,</hi> were ſent for to the
Lord Chamberlain, and their Judgment
was ask'd concerning that Point. Their
Advice was, That it ſhould by no means
be medled withal, but that Things ſhould
die of themſelves: But no Queſtioning
by Writing; for ſo it might go on to the
World's End: For one Book might breed
another; and ſo, they whom it concern'd
ſhould never be in reſt. This was reſolv'd
on; and afterwards there was no more
Speech of Writing, ſaving only faintingly
and whiſperingly, but nothing to the
Purpoſe. It ſeem'd that the Commiſſioners
who were for the Nullity had enough of it,
and deſir'd no more to bring themſelves
on the Stage, being ſo by all Men ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim'd
upon for that which they had
done.</p>
               <p>The Biſhop of <hi>Winton,</hi> after the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
went down with great Jollity, full
of Hope and Glory; but within a while
after, he grew much daunted, as ſome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
him, and namely his own Daughter,
reported; for he heard many Ways of the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0639300101:74"/>
ſtrange Deteſtation which the World had
of the Deed; and the nick-naming of his
Son, much affected him: But his Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſements
from Sir <hi>Richard Norton,</hi> his Son-in-Law
did much trouble him: For Sir <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard</hi>
wrote divers Times from <hi>London</hi> to
his Wife, That he could come in no Place,
but his Father-in-Law was rail'd upon:
That Men told him, that he thought he
had a Wife, but it was no longer than my
Lord of <hi>Winton</hi> pleas'd; for whenſoever he
offended him he could make a Nullity
between them. Beſides, the ſaid Sir <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard</hi>
told Mr. <hi>John More</hi> of <hi>Lincoln</hi>'s-Inn,
divers Times, <hi>That it was ſuch a Diſgrace
unto him to hear how the World talk'd of that
Sentence, that although my Lord of</hi> Winton
<hi>promiſed to give him, his Wife, and Family,
their Diet and Entertainment ſo long as he
lived, yet he would get him to his own Houſe,
and live there, where he had Means ſufficient,
and not be ſubject to that perpetual Scorn which
would follow him ſo long as he remain'd in his
Father-in-Law's Company.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By theſe, and the like Paſſages, it was
gueſs'd, that the reſt of the Commiſſioners,
who were for the Sentence, had little Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
in themſelves of that which they had
done. On the other Part, the Arch-biſhop,
and thoſe who ſtood with him, had their
Honeſty and Juſtice ſounded out every Day
more and more; and many Meſſages were
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0639300101:75"/>
brought them, and divers Letters written
unto them, or ſhew'd them by ſome Friends,
from ſundry of the Biſhops in the Land,
from the Univerſities, from many godly
Preachers out of all Parts, which was an
exceeding Conſolation unto them, among
the many Frowns which they did bear,
That there was an univerſal Concurrence
of all honeſt Men to approve that which
they had done. And the Arch-biſhop had
privately, from many great ones in Court,
and Nobles, and worthy Perſonages elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where,
ſuch Significations of their good
Acceptance which he did, that it cheer'd
him much inwardly, and he was nothing
diſmay'd.</p>
               <p>Now, about the Middle of <hi>November,</hi> the
Wheel was turn'd about: For ſince nothing
could be gain'd by ſpeaking hardly of the
negative Part, they thought they would
make Uſe of them another Way, and that
ſhould be by making the World believe,
that they had now given Approbation of
the Fact. And thereupon it was, in Court
and <hi>London,</hi> aſſeverantly given out; and
the Fame of it went far and near, That
the Arch-biſhop, and the reſt, after more
mature Deliberation, had teſtify'd their
Concurrence with the reſt of the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners,
and all now were of one Mind.
Men did not haſtily believe this; but yet
divers of good Rank came and ſent to the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:0639300101:76"/>
Arch-biſhop and the reſt, to know whether
thoſe things were ſo or no. And when it
was found to be but a Jargon, it gave a
great deal of Contentment, and remov'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
much Scandal which formerly was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.
Yet again afterward it was bruted,
the ſecond Time, That my Lord of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury</hi>
had given the King Satisfaction in
the Matter; and my Lord of <hi>London,</hi> on
ſuch a <hi>Sunday,</hi> had come and ſubmitted
himſelf to my Lord Chamberlain, and the
reſt had relented. Nay, it went ſo far,
that in <hi>Yelverton,</hi> the King's Solicitor, and a
great Dependent upon the Houſe of <hi>Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk,</hi>
told Mr. <hi>Pye</hi> the Counſellor, and Mr.
<hi>Cholmeley</hi> the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi>'s Solicitor, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
unto him about Books to be drawn
up, for paſſing back the Jointure of the
Lady <hi>Frances</hi>'s Part, and the Portion of
the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi>'s Part, <hi>That the gainſaying
Commiſſioners were now conſenting, and the great
Man beyond the Water was come over</hi>; which
he knew ſo aſſuredly, that <hi>he had ſeen it ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify'd
by the Subſcription of the Arch-biſhop and
the reſt.</hi> Yea, farther, he added, that <hi>there
was great Reaſon, at the firſt, wherefore my
Lord of</hi> Canterbury<hi>, and the others, ſhould
ſtand againſt the Separation; for they had juſt
Cauſe, at the firſt, to fear that this Fact might
be drawn into Example, and ſo Marriages ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
be violated; but now it was reſolv'd that
no more ſuch ſhould be permitted, and thereupon</hi>
                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:0639300101:77"/>
                  <hi>they aſſented.</hi> Theſe Things were inforc'd to
be endur'd with Silence, for the avoiding
of Clamour, and making of Trouble.</p>
               <p>But now behold an admirable Device of
the Biſhop of <hi>Litchfield,</hi> which ſheweth
what his own Opinion was of the Validity
of the Sentence. I will ſet it down as it
came to be acted.</p>
               <p>On the 26th of <hi>November, Searle</hi> the
Proctor cometh to my Lord of <hi>Canterbury</hi>
at <hi>Lambeth,</hi> and bringeth with him a Writ
of <hi>Certiorari</hi> out of the Chancery, direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the Commiſſioners in the Cauſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Lady <hi>Frances</hi> and the Earl of
<hi>Eſſex.</hi> The Arch-biſhop was pray'd to
open it, and ſo he did, and there found
that four of them, <hi>ſub ſigillis veſtris</hi> were, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
to certify <hi>Recordum Sententiae,</hi> into
the Chancery. The Arch biſhop aſked
<hi>Searle, If this were an uſual Thing?</hi> Who
anſwered, <hi>No, he had not known any ſuch
Thing before:</hi> It is reply'd, <hi>What then ſhould
be the Reaſon thereof?</hi> Anſwer was made,
<hi>That ſince the Matter was controverſed in the
Sentence, leaſt there ſhould be Queſtion of the
Marriage afterwards, the Earl of</hi> Somerſet
<hi>would have the Sentence lying by him under the
Great Seal of</hi> England <hi>ratify'd.</hi> The Arch-biſhop
thought that to be but a weak Hold,
yet charged <hi>Searle</hi> to ſee ſuch an Inſtrument
drawn, and a Certificate ſhould according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be made. On the <hi>Wedneſday</hi> after, <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker</hi>
                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:0639300101:78"/>
the Regiſter, cometh to <hi>Lambeth,</hi> and
ſheweth a Form of a Draught in Paper,
how the Certificate ſhould be return'd in
the Names of all the Commiſſioners ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
put down. The Arch-biſhop, in the
Reading of it, found five or ſix Lines ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a black Line drawn under them; and
thereupon, the more marking the Words
contained in them, found that which he
liked not. Thereupon he aſk'd <hi>Barker,</hi>
                  <hi>who lined thoſe Words? Barker</hi> ſaid, <hi>He him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
did.</hi> The other aſked, <hi>What was the
Reaſon of it?</hi> And it was anſwer'd, <hi>Becauſe
Sir</hi> John Bennet <hi>and ſome other of the Doctors
with him had diſliked that Sentence.</hi> Quoth
the Arch-biſhop, <hi>And they had Reaſon for it:
Who put them firſt in?</hi> Barker ſaid, <hi>None
but himſelf.</hi> Quoth the Arch-biſhop then,
<hi>May not the Certificate ſtand as well without
thoſe Words as with them?</hi> To which <hi>Barker</hi>
anſwer'd, <hi>Yes.</hi> Then ſaid the Arch-biſhop,
<hi>Let them be ſtricken out.</hi> Here the Regiſter,
with ſomewhat ado, faintly made Anſwer,
<hi>That the Commiſſioners on the other Side would
by no Means have them out.</hi> The Arch-biſhop
ſaid, <hi>Then I perceive it is a Device to entangle
us: I am ready to certify the Sentence as the
Writ requireth, but I will none of this.</hi> Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker<hi>,
I am firſt in the Commiſſion, and for my
Place ſake, I would have looked, that I ſhould
have been conferr'd withal, what had been fit
to return, and not to have had this Trick put</hi>
                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:0639300101:79"/>
                  <hi>upon me, that either I muſt certify that which
croſſeth my Judgment at the Time of giving
the Sentence, or I muſt be forced not to certify
at all.</hi> So <hi>Barker</hi> departed, and all was
quiet until the <hi>Monday</hi> after; at which
Time the Arch-biſhop was early at
<hi>White-Hall,</hi> the Council ſitting that Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.
There, in the waiting Chamber, at
the End of the Privy-Gallery, the Biſhop
of <hi>Litchfield</hi> cometh to him, and ſaith, <hi>My
Lord, we have receiv'd a Writ of</hi> Certiorari
<hi>out of the Chancery, to certify the Sentence for
the Nullity. Yea,</hi> ſaith the Arch-biſhop, <hi>and
I am ready to certify it. But,</hi> ſaith the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop,
<hi>He who framed the Writ, hath made it</hi>
ſub Sigillis veſtris, <hi>and doth not know that
there is a Seal of Office for the Delegates; it
ſhould have been</hi> ſub Sigillo Communi. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Arch-biſhop could reply, in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
the Lord Chancellor, and to him
cometh out of the next Chamber the Lord
Chamberlain; and then thoſe two Lords,
together with the Biſhop of <hi>Litchfield,</hi>
drew themſelves to a Window, and there
had they ſecret Communication about
the altering of the Form of the Writ,
as the Effect declared; for that After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon,
a Cauſe being to be heard touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Alimony,</hi> from Sir <hi>Pexal Brocas</hi> to his
Lady; and the Committees in it being the
Biſhop of <hi>Litchfield,</hi> and Mr. Chancellor of
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:0639300101:80"/>
the Dutchy, and my Lord of <hi>Canterbury</hi>
being Umpire; before Mr. Chancellor was
come, <hi>Bembo,</hi> Deputy to the Clerk of the
Crown, came into the Parlour at <hi>Lambeth,</hi>
and had private Speech with the Biſhop of
<hi>Litchfield.</hi> The Arch-biſhop going out into
the Garden, <hi>Litchfield</hi> follow'd him, and told
him, <hi>That Mr.</hi> Bembo <hi>had brought another
Form of a Writ</hi>; and thereupon ſhewed
him the Words <hi>ſub communi ſigillo.</hi> The
Arch-biſhop bid him do as he thought
good, and withdrew himſelf into the low
Stone-Gallery, whither <hi>Litchfield</hi> follow'd
him, and uſed theſe Words: <hi>My Lord,
here is a Form of a Certificate, which hath
been thought fit to uſe in the Buſineſs of my
Lord Chamberlain; and I hear your Grace ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
Exception to ſome Things in it.</hi> Then
he pull'd out the very Paper which <hi>Barker</hi>
formerly had ſhew'd. The Arch-biſhop
anſwer'd, <hi>My Lord, have I not Reaſon to
take Exception to theſe Words, that</hi> poſt om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimodam
Veritatis diſquiſitionem<hi>,</hi> poſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bationes
idoneas &amp; de jure requiſitas<hi>, we gave
ſuch a Sentence? For, to ſubſcribe this, were
to proclaim my ſelf a diſhoneſt Man upon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord:
For if theſe Things be true, why did I
deny to join in the Sentence?</hi> Quoth <hi>Litchfield,
This here is true; for it cannot be deny'd, but
ſome</hi> probationes idoneae<hi>,</hi> &amp; de jure requiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tae
<hi>were uſed; and we do not ſay that all were.</hi>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:0639300101:81"/>
The Arch-biſhop anſwered, <hi>You ſhall do
well, therefore, to certify</hi> poſt probationes
aliquas<hi>, and I will joyn with you; but as it
ſtandeth now indefinitely, it will be taken as if
all had been uſed; I pray you therefore to alter
the Certificate, and make Things plain. My
Lord,</hi> quoth <hi>Litchfield, I will deal plainly with
you; becauſe the Words were in, and doubt was
made, whether they ſhould paſs or no: The King's
Majeſty hath been acquainted with the Buſineſs;
and he, by a Letter from Sir</hi> Thomas Lake<hi>, hath
ſent Word expreſsly, that he will have them in.</hi>
The Arch-biſhop ſaid, <hi>Let them then certify who
will avow thoſe Words, for I cannot condeſcend
unto them. And hath not that Perſon done a
good Office, who hath informed the King hereof;
that Diſtraction may ſtill be among the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners,
and there may never be an End of
Difference.</hi> The Biſhop ſaid, <hi>My Lord, I
could wiſh that you would yield unto the King,
and ſo give him Satisfaction.</hi> The Arch-bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
anſwer'd, <hi>What would you have me do?
I gave the Sentence as I was perſwaded in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
and ſince that Time I have been ſilent,
and meddle no way in the Matter: I did what
I did upon long Deliberation; and I may not in
Private, upon no Ground ſince appearing to
me, croſs that which I have done in Publick.</hi>
It was farther added, <hi>That there was Reaſon
to ſuſpect, that they did ill Offices, who held
thoſe Things ſtill on Foot: That there never was</hi>
                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:0639300101:82"/>
                  <hi>any Man, who ſought to grace himſelf by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gracing
others, but it met him at the Lane's
End, at one Time or another.</hi> Theſe Things
paſſed then; and after the Cauſe heard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Sir <hi>Pexal Brocas</hi> and his Wife, the
Biſhop of <hi>Litchfield</hi> ſaid to the Arch-biſhop
at his Parting, <hi>My Lord, you will give us
leave to certify then as we purpoſe?</hi> To which
the Arch-biſhop anſwer'd, <hi>Yea, with all
my Heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The next Morning, the Arch-biſhop re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member'd,
that by the Carriage of Things
in ſuch Faſhion as was pretended, he might
be trick'd: For if the Names of all the
Commiſſioners were put into the Certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate,
and four of them might certify un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a common Seal, it ſhould not be
known hereafter, but that he and his Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
concurr'd therein, and that, with the
Words which were excepted againſt: He
therefore ſent for <hi>Barker,</hi> and in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of Sir <hi>John Bennet,</hi> and two Servants,
being Publick Notaries, he expoſtulated
with <hi>Barker,</hi> as ſerving Mens Turns, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than caring for Peace; and then pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually
he deliver'd theſe Things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>The Writ requireth me to certify the
Sentence, and I am ready to do it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>If the whole Proceſs be deſir'd, I
am willing to certify that alſo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:0639300101:83"/>
Thirdly, <hi>For the Words in Queſtion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they were put in without my Privity, and
they may as well be left out as put in, by your
own Saying, I pray to be forborn for returning
of them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>I require you to conceal theſe
Things as much as you may, that the World
take no new Alarm of any Difference between
the Commiſſioners.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Arch-biſhop ſpake of returning the
whole Proceſs, becauſe he had heard, that
at the firſt, it was meant it ſhould be ſo;
but Dr. <hi>Stuart,</hi> and, perhaps, ſome other of
the Civilians, diſſuaded that by all Means;
leaſt, if the whole were on Record in the
Chancery, every Man that liſt, hereafter,
might cenſure that Sentence, and ſift
the Grounds whereon the Commiſſioners
proceeded; it was good, therefore, to take
away that Occaſion.</p>
               <p>When Matters were thus reſolv'd, the
Biſhop of <hi>Litchfield,</hi> who meant to play
his Prizes in this Service, ſpeaketh to <hi>Bem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bo,</hi>
to draw ſome Preface, or Concluſion, to
add to the Certificate; that it might not
only be ſign'd with the great Seal, as af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Form of an <hi>Inſpeximus</hi>; but that
his Majeſty might add a Confirmation to
it: And when Mr. <hi>Bembo,</hi> as unacquainted
with this Faſhion, did not fit the Biſhop's
Humour, his Lordſhip took on him to do
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:0639300101:84"/>
it himſelf. He drew up, therefore, a
ſtrange Writing, as was inform'd by a cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible
Perſon that ſaw it, containing bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous
Latin, and no good Congruity of
Senſe. But the Matter of it was, that his
Majeſty having the Authority of the Pope
now in himſelf, and in <hi>ſcrinio pectoris,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Power to ratify, did, <hi>ex plenitudine
poteſtatis,</hi> confirm that Divorce to all In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents
and Purpoſes. In an Evening Dr.
<hi>Martin</hi> was ſent for to the Lord Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain,
and there was the Biſhop with his
Papers. The Doctor, as it hath been ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibly
deliver'd, being ſhew'd that Writing,
and his Opinion thereupon being aſk'd,
did utterly diſlike it, and ſaid, <hi>That the
King claim'd nothing of the Pope's Power; but
took that as his own, which the Pope had uſmp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
That the King had ſpoke before by his
Judges Delegate, and had nothing more to do:
That if the Sentence were not good already, no
Confirmation could make it good.</hi> And when
the Biſhop was earneſt in Defence of his
Device, there was a little Heat ſtricken be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Doctor and him, ſo that theſe
Words paſſed from the ſaid Doctor: <hi>You do,
as much as in you lyeth, ſpit in the Face of the
King our Maſter, by laying on him all the
Matter; whereas the Scandal that hath already
been, is this, that his Majeſty is ſaid to deal
ſo much in the Matter. My Lord, you are to</hi>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:0639300101:85"/>
                  <hi>blame to enter into theſe Things without Advice
of Men ſkilful in the Law: Hath Dr.</hi> Stuart
<hi>or Dr.</hi> Bird <hi>been acquainted herewithal?</hi> The
Biſhop ſaith, <hi>No; but for this Matter, I
know as much Law at the beſt of you all.</hi> Dr.
<hi>Martin</hi> reply'd, <hi>No: Your Lordſhip thinketh,
that becauſe you have read two or three Chapters
of the Canon-Law about this late Buſineſs, you
know as much as we do, who have ſpent all our
Lives in that Profeſſion: I tell your Lordſhip,
I have ſtudy'd the Law theſe two and thirty
Years; and therefore, you ſhall give me leave to
believe that I know more therein than you can.
I am the King's Advocate, and therefore may
ſuffer nothing with my Conſent to paſs diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
to my Maſter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon theſe Conteſtations, the Lord
Chamberlain was much troubled, ſaying,
<hi>What a Matter is this, that Men ſhould be of
ſuch contrary Opinions! What ſhall we do?</hi>
When the Biſhop murmur'd much that his
Conceit was not follow'd, Dr. <hi>Martin</hi> ſaid
thus: <hi>My Lord, in a Buſineſs of this Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
I will not wiſh your Lordſhip to follow
my ſingle Advice, but let this be done; to Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
let Sir</hi> William Button<hi>, in your Lordſhip's
Name, come to</hi> Doctors-Commons<hi>; and let
him get together Sir</hi> Daniel Dun<hi>, Dr.</hi> Stuart<hi>,
and Dr.</hi> Bird<hi>, and I will attend them; and
then we will conſult jointly what is fit to be
done.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:0639300101:86"/>
This Advice was much liked; and on
the Morrow, being <hi>Friday,</hi> they all aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,
and, for two Hours, all Points were
debated; but the Concluſion was, <hi>That
there ſhould be no farther Confirmation: For
this was to proclaim, that the Sentence was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective
in itſelf, which would make a great
Buzz in the World:</hi> And therefore, the
Counſel was in general, <hi>That too much had
been done, and for the Time to come, the Care
muſt be, how to lay it aſleep fairly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Reſolution being taken, the next
Knack was, that ſo many of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners
as were for the Sentence, ſhould
be call'd together; and they ſhould be
made acquainted with this, that the Biſhop
might be fairly put off. On the <hi>Saturday</hi>
Night, therefore, in the Dark, at Sir <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius
Caeſar</hi>'s Houſe in the <hi>Strand,</hi> met the
Biſhops of <hi>Ely, Litchfield, Rocheſter,</hi> the two
Chancellors of the Exchequer and Dutchy,
and Sir <hi>Daniel Dun,</hi> and well near for an
Hour, they privately debated what they
thought fit, but, as it ſeemeth, reſolv'd as
before, and ſo departed.</p>
               <p>A Friend being the next Day with
the Lady <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and knowing of the Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
aſked her, <hi>What about it was?</hi> She
anſwer'd, <hi>It is ſomething about the late Nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity;
but what it is, I do not know. It ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
that they who were the Doers in it, think</hi>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:0639300101:87"/>
                  <hi>ſomewhat is amiſs. They ſuppoſe all is not well
about it, and I, for my part, think ſo alſo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A Man would have ſuppoſed, that all
theſe Things ſhould have contented the
Biſhop of <hi>Litchfield</hi>; but he was ſo far in
Love with his own Invention, that yet he
would not be beat off; and therefore, to
merit the more, he once again moveth the
Lord Chamberlain to ſend to Sir <hi>Francis
Bacon,</hi> and to Mr. <hi>Yelverton,</hi> being of the
King's learned Council, to know their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion:
Which being done; and they two,
for the Reaſons above named, concurring
with the Civilians: The Biſhop, as it
hath been credibly related, ſaid of them,
together with the reſt, <hi>They are all Fools,</hi>
And ſo ended this Stratagem; but the
Worker thereof was not yet for an End.</p>
               <p>From the Beginning of this whole Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Nullity, the Biſhop of <hi>Litchfield</hi>
had carry'd himſelf variouſly, ſometimes
being vehement in Words, publickly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Separation, and other Times in
Deed, giving Furtherance to it. Many
Speeches he had privately with the Arch-Biſhop,
making ſhew of much Honeſty and
Reſpect to him, which the Arch-biſhop e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
warily obſerv'd; thinking, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
that theſe had been Teſtimonies
of the working of his Conſcience, conflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in it ſelf, but not reſolv'd what to do.
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:0639300101:88"/>
In the mean Time, from the Court, from
London, and out of the Country, the Arch-biſhop
was ſtill call'd upon by divers wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
Friends, <hi>That he ſhould take heed of that
Biſhop; that he was ever, and in all Things
naught: That he did all the worſt Offices that
poſſibly he could, and was ſtill ſtirring the
Coals, to procure to himſelf a Reputation;
that he was zealous of the Houſe of</hi> Suffolk.
The Arch-biſhop forgot not thoſe many
Warnings, but carry'd himſelf very warily
towards him: Yet out of Charity, it ſtill
came in his Mind, <hi>He is a Biſhop, I know no
Evil of him; I ought not to condemn a Man
upon a Generality; I have no particular Proof
of his Miſbehaviour in this behalf, although
he dealt ill with the late Lord Treaſurer, and
moſt falſly with the Arch-biſhop</hi> Bancroft <hi>in
his Life-time, and after his Death; and for
that Cauſe was deteſted by both of them; yet
an honeſt Man may think, that Experience hath
reform'd him, and now he is amended.</hi> Yet it
much affected the Arch-biſhop, that all
Men ſpake ſo ill of him; and one Speech of
an old Courtier, a very honeſt Knight,
enter'd far with him. For about a Fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night
before the Marriage, the ſaid Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier,
ſpeaking privately with the Arch-Biſhop,
among other Words, he us'd this.
<hi>I know not what the Biſhop of</hi> Litchfield
<hi>doth among you; but he hath made a ſhift</hi>
                  <pb n="83" facs="tcp:0639300101:89"/>
                  <hi>to be taken for a Knave, generally with us
in the Court.</hi> Now, whether the next Prank
will verify ſo much or no, let the Reader
judge. Eight Days before the Marriage,
on a <hi>Saturday</hi> Morning, that Biſhop com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to <hi>Lambeth,</hi> and in private Conference
with the Arch biſhop, he telleth him, <hi>That
out of his Love and Reſpect to his Grace, he
was come voluntarily, as of himſelf, to know
his Mind about one Matter, and it was this.
On St.</hi> Stephen's <hi>Day,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the Lord
Chamberlain meaneth to have this great Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
go forward: Now it may, perhaps, be
deſir'd, that a Licence ſhould be given by you,
that the Banes may not be aſk'd, which if you
like not to grant, I may be the Means to free
you from being mov'd to it.</hi> The Arch-biſhop
ſaid, <hi>What have I to do with grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of a Licenſe; it belongeth not to me:
But wherefore ſhould there be any Need of
a Licenſe; the Marriage is intended to be
Publick; Masks and Shews are made for the
ſame; all</hi> England <hi>taketh Notice of it, and
therefore it were good, that the Banes were
openly aſk'd, as the Manner is of ſuch Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages
as are made in the King's Chapel. Yea,
the Lady</hi> Elizabeth <hi>herſelf, had her Banes
aſk'd. My Lord,</hi> ſaith Litchfield, <hi>there is
ſome Cauſe why it ſhould be done without
publiſhing the Banes: For peradventure ſome
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>dy may ſtep up, and make a Diſturbance.</hi>
                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:0639300101:90"/>
                  <hi>You know what a mad, naked Fellow, came in
to St.</hi> James's<hi>, after the Death of the Prince;
if ſuch a one ſhould come in now, what a
Work would it make?</hi> The Arch-biſhop won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
within himſelf, to hear ſuch a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,
and thought ſurely, that it was no
mad Body that they ſhould need to ſtand
in fear of, but they ſuſpected ſomewhat
elſe. But his Anſwer was, <hi>My Lord, there
come no ſuch into the King's Chapel; there
be Doors and Officers to keep ſuch out. But
if it ſhould be ſuſpected, that any would op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
it is beſt the Banes be aſk'd, for then
there will be ſome warning of the Gain-ſaying;
whereas, otherwiſe, if at the Time of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
one ſhould ſuddenly ſtart up, it would
make a greater Trouble.</hi> Notwithſtanding
the Biſhop went on, <hi>That a Licenſe would
cut off all the Doubt.</hi> The Arch-biſhop an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd,
<hi>But what have I to do with grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Licenſe in the King's Chapel: It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth
to the Ordinary of the Place, and that
is my Lord of</hi> Bath<hi>, as Dean of the Chapel.</hi>
Litchfield reply'd, <hi>He never granted any, and
he hath no Seal for that Office. It was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd,
He never granted any, becauſe no Body
ever deſir'd it; but the Manner was, that the
Banes were publiſh'd. But as for the Seal of
the Office, who doth not know that any Seal
will ſerve; and none better than his Biſhop's
Seal, it being ſaid,</hi> Datum ſub ſigillo noſtro
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:0639300101:91"/>
Epiſcopali, quo in hoc caſu<hi>; or</hi> hoc Tempore
utimur. <hi>King</hi> James <hi>at the firſt, did uſe
the Seal of Queen</hi> Elizabeth<hi>, 'till a new one
was made.</hi> The Biſhop proceedeth, <hi>Yet it
would be fit that you granted the Licenſe, if
it be requeſted.</hi> To this the Arch-biſhop
ſaid, <hi>I ſhall do that which never any of my
Predeceſſors did. Yes,</hi> quoth Litchfield, <hi>If
you would ſeek your Records, you ſhould find
ſome ſo granted.</hi> The Arch biſhop anſwer'd,
<hi>I have enquir'd of my Officers, and they tell
me, That no ſuch thing was heard of, in</hi>
Omni Hominum Memoria. <hi>But</hi> my Lord<hi>,
I know that my Lord of</hi> Bath <hi>hath it under
the Great Seal of</hi> England <hi>excluſively, to the
Arch-biſhop; ſo that in direct Words there is
a Reſtraint, that he may not meddle there.
Yea, but,</hi> quoth Litchfield, <hi>you have an Act
of Parliament, enabling you to grant Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations
to the King and his Children; and
therefore it belongeth to you.</hi> Said the Arch-biſhop,
<hi>Do not you think that I underſtand
the Act of Parliament as well as you?</hi> My
Lord<hi>, Do you think that that Statute was
made for theſe ordinary Graces and Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations?
Why, is not your Lordſhip able, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
your Dioceſs, to grant a Licenſe, that a
Marriage may be ſolemniz'd, and not the Banes
aſk'd? Yes,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I may: Nay, every
Arch-deacon may do it within his Juriſdiction.
Then my Lord,</hi> quoth the Arch-biſhop, <hi>muſt</hi>
                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:0639300101:92"/>
                  <hi>an Act of Parliament be made to grant the
Arch-biſhop Power to do that which every
Arch-deacon may do within his Precinct?
There is ſurely ſome other Matter in it. But
I marvel, my Lord, that you are now ſo
earneſt for the Arch-biſhop's Licenſes, when,
as I have heard, in the Days of my Predeceſſor,
when you were Biſhop of</hi> Rocheſter<hi>, you would
not ſuffer the Arch-biſhop's Licenſes to paſs
within your Dioceſs: No,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>it was for</hi>
Weſtminſter <hi>that I did ſtrive, not for the
Dioceſs of</hi> Rocheſter. <hi>And it is true, that
there be Records in that Church, that the
Monks did contend with the King about di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
Queſtions. I had Reaſon therefore, to
ſtand for the Privileges of my Church.</hi> It was
anſwer'd, <hi>So hath my Lord of</hi> Bath <hi>to ſtand
for the Rights of the King's Chapel.</hi> The
Arch-biſhop ſeeing how earneſt the Man
was, in ſo unreaſonable a Thing, ſaid
farther, <hi>My Lord,</hi> you have mine Anſwer,
but let me now tell you one thing. <hi>It
is ſix Weeks agone, that I heard from the
Court, and many Times ſince I have had it
reiterated, that ſuch a Trick ſhould be put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
me: That although it needed not, yet I
ſhould be mov'd for granting this Licenſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
thereby I ſhould be conſtrain'd, either to
grant it, and ſo croſs my former Sentence, and
involvedly give my Conſent to the Nullity, or
I ſhould deny it, and ſo grate once again up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:0639300101:93"/>
                  <hi>the King's Diſpleaſure. You ſee now I
have given you a fair Anſwer, which may free
me from both. But, my Lord, I pray God
you do good Offices in this Buſineſs. I fear
you put your ſelf into many Things, which
may be better forborn. But let me tell you,
there was never any Man, who ſought to
raiſe himſelf by wronging another, but at one
Time or other he had enough of it. It is
now almoſt three Months ſince this Sentence
is given, and ſince that Time, I have not
meddled with the Matter, for offending the
King. I am ſilent, and no way oppoſe, and
Men have their End; yet cannot I be quiet.
I would have you know, that God beholdeth
theſe things, and remembereth them. And for
my Part, I am not blind, I ſee well what is
done; and I ſhall not always be ſilent. The
Time will come, that I muſt ſpeak; and it ſhall
appear I am not Tongue-ty'd.</hi> This made
the Biſhop not ſo forward as before, but
Occaſion of a farther Speech being offer'd;
the Arch-biſhop went on, and ſaid, <hi>The
Sentence which I gave, was in the Fear of God,
and according to my Conſcience: And if that
had been done, which was convenient, and we
called for, there needed not to have been any
Diviſion in Judgment. For, my Lord, you may
remember when you came to me at</hi> Croydon<hi>,
and brought theſe Papers from the King, after
the reading whereof, I ſlept little that Night,</hi>
                  <pb n="88" facs="tcp:0639300101:94"/>
                  <hi>how deſirous I was to give his Majeſty Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction;
and therefore pray'd you, fetching out
the Proceſs unto you, to tell me whereupon I
ſhould ground my Sentence. You ſhew'd me one
Article,</hi> that he had not known her, nor
he thought that he never ſhould. <hi>I told
you then, Yea, that was for want of Love,
for he ſaid,</hi> When I came out of <hi>France,</hi> I
lov'd her; I do not ſo, neither ever ſhall I.
<hi>It is want of Love.</hi> To this the Biſhop
ſaid, <hi>Yea, and the Earl added,</hi> That he had
done his Beſt oftentimes, Carnally to know
her, but he found an Imperfection in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.
The Arch-biſhop reply'd to this, <hi>Oh,
my Lord! Never ſay ſo; for his Lordſhip's
Anſwers upon his Oath, are to the contrary:</hi>
He found no Defect or Impediment in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.
<hi>And if I ſhall ſpeak my private Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
although I would not have you believe it,
I think the Earl as able a Man for a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
as any is in</hi> England. <hi>And I think to
the contrary,</hi> Quoth Litchfield. The Arch-biſhop
went on: <hi>But, my Lord, when your
Lordſhip and I had theſe Difficulties in our
Mind at</hi> Croydon<hi>, you told me of one thing
which I embrac'd as an Oracle from Heaven.
And that was, that to rid our ſelves of theſe
Diſtractions, we had no other Way, but to call
the Earl of Eſſex again upon his Oath, that ſo
giving us a fuller Anſwer, we might either have
good Ground to pronounce for the Nullity, or</hi>
                  <pb n="89" facs="tcp:0639300101:95"/>
                  <hi>Matter to give Reaſon why we might not
condeſcend unto it. I approv'd this, and you
know how the next Day, in publick Court, it
was mov'd, and my Lords of</hi> Wincheſter<hi>,</hi> Ely<hi>,</hi>
Rocheſter<hi>, and your ſelf, gave very good
liking to it; and no Man ſaid any thing
againſt it, except Mr. Chancellor of the Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer,
who ſoftly ſpake,</hi> I know not whether
that will be permitted. <hi>But you may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,
you were intreated to deliver this to
the King at</hi> Theobalds<hi>, from whom you brought
Word,</hi> That it ſhould not be granted, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> being partly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vok'd
by his falling out with Mr. <hi>Henry
Howard,</hi> and partly being counſelled by
the Earl of <hi>Southampton,</hi> would ſpeak all
things to hinder the Nullity. My Anſwer
then was, <hi>That he was to ſpeak upon his
Oath, and we would moſt ſtrictly examine him.</hi>
When that was deny'd, which ſhould have
led us to the Truth, I muſt confeſs I had
never any mind to pronounce for the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration.
The Biſhop ſeem'd to take no
great Pleaſure to hear theſe things thus
repeated, but fared, as if he could have
wiſh'd, that they all had been forgotten.
The Concluſion of all was, that the Biſhop
ſeem'd to be well ſatisfy'd, that no Licenſe
was given, and promis'd the Arch-biſhop,
to take Care that he ſhould no farther be
troubled with it, aſſuring him, <hi>That he did</hi>
                  <pb n="90" facs="tcp:0639300101:96"/>
                  <hi>ever good Offices to him, whereof the King could
give Witneſs, and would; and he would ever
make the beſt of things.</hi> To which the Arch-biſhop
ſaid, <hi>If he did, he would take it for
a Kindneſs at his Hands,</hi> and ſo he depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
               <p>Accordingly, the next Day the Banes
were aſk'd in the Chapel, and there was
nothing but fair Weather, the Arch-biſhop
attending the King in the Cloſet. On the
<hi>Monday</hi> the King went to <hi>Hampton</hi>-Court;
and that Day the Biſhop of <hi>Bath</hi> and <hi>Wells</hi>
came to <hi>Lambeth:</hi> He told the Arch-biſhop,
that he had a direct Meſſage unto him from
the King, and that was, That his Majeſty
did much marvel, that he ſpake not with
him about the Sentence: That the King
expected Satisfaction and Submiſſion. His
Lordſhip added, That he perceiv'd that the
King had ſome Scruple in his Mind, which
he wiſh'd ſhould be remov'd before his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Communion on <hi>Christmas</hi> Day.
The Arch-biſhop knew not that the Biſhop
of <hi>Litchfield</hi> had dealt any Way treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly
with him, and therefore was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd
to anſwer, in general, that he
knew not what to ſay to his Highneſs.
He perſuaded himſelf, that in giving of
the Sentence he had done his Duty, and
therefore could not tell how to make a
Submiſſion where he conceiv'd no Fault.
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:0639300101:97"/>
If in any Circumſtance he had err'd, he
was ready to teſtify his Sorrow for it; but
he knew no ſuch Thing; yet, if his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty
was diſpleas'd at him, to ſignify his
Obedience to his King and Sovereign, to
whom he was ſo much bound, he would
not refuſe, if the King were pleas'd to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain
him of his Liberty, and lay him in
the Tower all the Days of his Life, to
ſubmit himſelf unto it patiently, without
Murmuring.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, he pray'd the Biſhop of
<hi>Bath,</hi> and (who, on the Morrow, was to go
to <hi>Hampton</hi> Court) to ſignify, humbly to
his Majeſty, That he had nothing in this
World more precious than his Life; and
that he wiſh'd, that he had given that
Life as a Redemption, that the King's
Hand had never been in that Buſineſs.
And withal, he ſaid, that at the coming
of the King, he would attend his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty.</p>
               <p>On <hi>Wedneſday</hi> Night, the King came to
<hi>White-Hall</hi>; and on the <hi>Thurſday,</hi> after
Dinner, my Lord of <hi>Canterbury</hi> went to the
Court, where they were all buſy about
Plate and Jewels againſt the Marriage. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding,
he had haſtily Speech of
divers Matters with the King; and in
the End, he ſaid privately unto his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<hi>May it pleaſe your Majeſty, I underſtand,</hi>
                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:0639300101:98"/>
                  <hi>by my Lord of</hi> Bath and Wells<hi>, That your
Majeſty expects that I ſhould give you an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
about the Matter of the Lord of</hi> Eſſex,
<hi>and the Lady</hi> Frances<hi>: I can ſay nothing more
than this, That I was put into the Commiſſion
as a Judge, and at the Time of Sentence, I did
my Conſcience; and ſince I have not meddled
with the Matter. Yes,</hi> ſaith the King, <hi>I hear
you deny'd a Licenſe to be granted, for not
aſking of the Banes; which I wonder you
would do, ſince the Sentence was paſs'd. No,</hi>
ſaid the Arch-biſhop, <hi>I deny'd no Licenſe;
but I advis'd, that the beſt Courſe was, that the
Banes ſhould be aſk'd according to the Cuſtom
us'd in the Chapel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, I ſaid, <hi>That if any Licenſe ſhould
be granted, it belong'd not to me to give it,
but to the Ordinary of the Place, the Dean of
the Chapel, who hath it under your Majeſty's
Great Seal, excluſive to the Arch-biſhoprick.
Yea,</hi> ſaid the King, <hi>My Lord of</hi> Bath <hi>ſaid
ſo; but I am told it is otherwiſe.</hi> The
Arch-biſhop reply'd, <hi>Nay, it is ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thirdly, ſaid he, <hi>My Anſwer was,
That never any of my Predeceſſors granted
Licenſe for any Thing done in the King's
Chapel: I have receiv'd Information ſo,
from my Officers. It had then been Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption
in me, to attempt that which
belong'd not unto me. This is another</hi>
                  <pb n="93" facs="tcp:0639300101:99"/>
                  <hi>ther Matter,</hi> ſaith the King, <hi>Were theſe your
Anſwers? I was told otherwiſe. But I will
take ſome other Time to ſpeak with you.</hi>
The Arch-biſhop, after this, attended half
an Hour, and nothing being ſaid, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted.</p>
               <p>The ſame Night, a Friend coming to
<hi>Lambeth,</hi> told my Lord, <hi>That he had been
that Day with the Lord</hi> Knowles<hi>, where he
found, that the Biſhop of</hi> Litchfield <hi>had
exceedingly wrong'd my Lord of</hi> Canterbury:
<hi>For he had reported all the Speech about the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe,
in a ſpiteful Manner, ſaid, it was abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
deny'd: That the Arch-biſhop gave out,</hi>
That the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> was very Potent for
a Woman; and that he intended to que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
this new Marriage, at one Time or
other, that it ſhould never take effect.</p>
               <p>This ſaid, the Gentleman made a great
Stir among them; and the Arch-biſhop
was much blamed, that he would never
make an End: But they were much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
at it, as fearing themſelves, that all
was not ſure. <hi>But,</hi> quoth he, <hi>when I had
told them, that this was ſome ill Office of the
Biſhop of</hi> Litchfield<hi>, who had every Day new
Inventions to puzzle them, that he might ſo much
the more indear himſelf unto them, by ſignify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Zeal for them; and that I knew how
fairly my Lord of</hi> Canterbury <hi>had anſwer'd
him,</hi> (for ſo indeed he did) <hi>and that he was</hi>
                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:0639300101:100"/>
                  <hi>ſo far from diſturbing the Marriage, that he
intended to be preſent at it; they were not
only appeaſed, but ſeem'd much content, that
his Grace would be there: And this I aſſure
you to be true.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When the Arch-biſhop heard this, he
was now ſatisfy'd, that the Man who had
done him all the Wrong, was the Biſhop of
<hi>Litchfield</hi>; from whom he reſolv'd after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
to be very wary how he truſted him.
Yet, profeſſing that he forgave him with
all his Heart, on the <hi>Chriſtmas-Day</hi> he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
the King, and receiv'd the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
with his Majeſty; and ſo, coming
Home to Dinner, Sir <hi>Charles Cornwallis</hi>
came along with him. This Gentleman is
one, to whom, for his Love, the Arch-biſhop
was much beholden; and after
Dinner they grew privately into Speech
of all theſe fore-remember'd Stirs; where
the Knight found much Fault that ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Tricks were put upon the Arch-biſhop;
blam'd infinitely the Biſhop of <hi>Litchfield</hi>;
promiſed to acquaint ſome of his great
Friends with his Qualities, and aſſured to
make, Things be rightly underſtood; and
took away with him that Report, wherein
he ſeemed much to joy, that the Arch-bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
would be at the Marriage.</p>
               <p>On the Morrow, being St. <hi>Steven</hi>'s Day,
the Arch-biſhop went to the Court, atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:0639300101:101"/>
the King to Chapel, went down to the
Marriage, (where, not the King, but the
Lord-Chamberlain, gave the Bride) had a
Pair of Wedding-Gloves, and ſo came
Home to Dinner, where he ſate with
much Comfort, as being glad, that ſince
Things muſt be ſo, they were come to an
End: And ſo pray'd God to bleſs his
Church, the King, and Kingdom, and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;
that he might be free from ſo many
Vexations, as for a long Space undeſervedly
had follow'd him.</p>

of the Commiſſioners, I
have had a great Contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Deliberation with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
my ſelf, in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
I ſhould utter my Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in this preſent Cauſe,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:0639300101:103"/>
ſince, after the Speech of thoſe Three
who firſt began, ſo great a Stream and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence
together of the reſt, (my Lord
excepted, who ſpoke laſt) have given their
Opinions for the annulling of the Marriage.
But yet I hold not my ſelf concluded thereby,
but that I may declare my Judgment, having
learned that <hi>Suffragia</hi> among Wiſemen are as
well <hi>appendenda</hi> and <hi>ponderanda,</hi> as <hi>numeranda:</hi>
And it was no ſhame for <hi>Phocion</hi> in <hi>Athens,</hi>
upon good Ground, to contradict the whole
City; neither was <hi>Paphnuſius,</hi> in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
of <hi>Nice</hi> the leſs reſpected, when he
ſtood againſt the whole Synod; nay, it was
his Honour, that by delivering of his Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
he altered the Reſolution which
that whole Aſſembly had intended to take,
which I freely acknowledge I have no hope
to affect at this Time. And yet, though I
have not that hope, but might very well
ſpare this labour, yet my Conſcience tell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
me, that it becometh me to ſpeak in a
Matter of this importance, becauſe, not
only, <hi>Deum timeo,</hi> I fear God, which I
doubt not but all of this Company doth;
but I am afraid of God, leaſt he ſhould be
angry with me if in this Caſe I be ſilent.
And I think it is expected of me, ſince I
am here preſent, that I ſhould not ſit as an
Idol, and only fill a room; for that were to
lay an Imputation on my ſelf, that I had
undertaken a Cauſe, which in publick I
durſt not offer to maintain.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="99" facs="tcp:0639300101:104"/>
I muſt acknowledge, that in delivering
of my Mind in this Buſineſs of ſo great
Weight, I do find two defects, that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
ſo pertinently ſpeak unto the Purpoſe
as divers of the Judges here: The one is,
That I am no Lawyer; and the other is,
That I am no married Man; by both which
I am diſabled, that I cannot ſpeak with
that Confidence concerning ſome Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
as moſt of you, the Commiſſioners,
are able to do; but in lieu thereof, I have
endeavoured to furniſh my ſelf ſome other
way concurrent to this Purpoſe. As by
reading, by conferring with ſome whom I
do truſt, with pondering thereupon, ſo that
it hath loſt me much ſleep at ſeveral Times,
with frequent Prayer unto God, that he
would direct me aright; which I have more
begged of God in this Cauſe, than ever in
any that was before me in Judgment. And
beſides, I bring with me <hi>animum candidum,</hi>
a Mind devoid of Paſſion, or any Perturba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which inclineth to no part for fear,
or for favour, for ſpleen or for hatred:
From which, I thank God, in pronouncing
of Sentence, I ever have been free, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring
that Judges are in the Place of
God; and as <hi>Jehoſophat</hi> ſaid, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.
<hi>Non hominis judicia exercetis ſed Domini, &amp;
quicquid judicaveritis in vos redundabit.</hi> He
then who ſitteth in the Place of God, and
in pronouncing of Sentence will vary from
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:0639300101:105"/>
Juſtice, he leaveth God, and ſheweth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
worthy to lye in the flames of Hell,
for abuſing of the Truſt which is commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
unto him, which I hope I ſhall not do.
And <hi>cui boni?</hi> to what end ſhould I tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs
in Judgment for either ſide, when I
have no reaſon to be partial for either, ſince
it is indifferent to me in any particular,
whether this Queſtion receive one or other
determination.</p>
                     <p>Where leaſt I ſhould be miſtaken, I
think it not amiſs, as publickly I have done
divers Times before, to let the World
know what my Judgment is concerning the
Impotency of a Husband towards his Wife.
That ſince Marriage in young Couples is
for carnal Copulation and Procreation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon,
and that it is the intendment of
thoſe which contract Matrimony to receive
Satisfaction in that Kind, that if this No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleman
be not able to perform thoſe mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Rights unto his Lady, he doth unto her
a very great Injuſtice to retain her as his
Wife; and we ſhall perform a great part of
Injury and Cruelty towards her, if we do
not free her from this Burthen and Yoke.
We are bound in Conſcience to do it, ſince
it is in truth no Marriage, but a pretended
Matrimony, that Conſummation being
wanting which was one of the firſt Things
in Intention when they two came together:
For <hi>impoſſibilitas officii,</hi> by a received Maxim,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:0639300101:106"/>
                        <hi>ſolvit vinculum Conjugij.</hi> But the Point is,
that before this Separation be pronounced,
it muſt appear unto the Church, that there
is good Cauſe for the ſame; which muſt not
be upon light Surmiſes, or queſtionable Sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions,
but upon evident Declarations and
Proofs, which may give full Contentment
to the Conſcience of the Judge. The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
was overt and in the Face of the
Church, whereby they were joyned into
one; let the Reaſon of Separation be as
clear as that was, if it poſſibly may be; or
let it be ſo apparent, that the Church may
well know, that there is ground to ſtand
upon for pronouncing of a Nullity. Now
this is it which I doubt will not fall out in
this Caſe of my Lord of <hi>Eſſex</hi>; there is
not proof ſufficient to inform the Minds
of the Judges that this knot ſhould be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved,
and themſelves ſet at liberty,
the one from the other. And then you
underſtand what the general Rule is,
<hi>Quod dubitas ne feceris.</hi> And in this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy
there ſeems in my Judgment ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Reaſons of doubting, that the Separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
deſired ought not to be granted. You
ſhall hear ſome few of them.</p>
                     <p>1. The firſt Scruple which ariſeth in my
Mind, is from the uncertainty of that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding,
which we have had in this Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs.
For in the handling of it formerly,
we had it propounded, that there muſt be
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:0639300101:107"/>
a Nullity <hi>propter maleficium verſus hanc.</hi>
That was it which we debated, and for the
which we turned our Books; that the
Counſel for my Lady did ſtill inſiſt upon,
not naming the Words indeed, but by a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riphraſis,
or Circumlocution, deſcribing the
ſame. And it cannot be forgotten, how
Dr. <hi>Stuard,</hi> being told by one, or more of
the Commiſſioners ſitting then in Court,
that his whole Speech did ſtill point out
<hi>maleficium,</hi> he anſwered, it is true, that is
it which we intend. The Authorities al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
brought out of the Canoniſts were in
direct Terms upon <hi>maleficium,</hi> the Proofs
intended nothing elſe. And we all under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand,
that to have an Impotency unto a
Man's own Wife, and an Ability unto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and that incurably, and that for ſome
Latent Reaſon, which cannot be known, is
the Caſe of <hi>maleficium</hi>; and that is the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
alledged in the Libel, and whereupon
my Lord is examined. And yet, now ſince
we ſit upon the ſecond Commiſſion, <hi>male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficium</hi>
is diſclaimed. One
of my Lords<note place="margin">My Lord of <hi>Wincheſter.</hi>
                        </note> hath avowed
it, that he diſlikes that
<hi>maleficium</hi>; that he hath
read <hi>Del-Rio,</hi> the Jeſuit, writing upon
that Argument, and doth hold him an idle
and fabulous Fellow; that he rather ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
it to be God's own handy Work, than
any Thing from the Devil. Another of
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:0639300101:108"/>
my Lords<note place="margin">My Lord of <hi>Ely.</hi>
                        </note> hath aſſented
thereunto, and <hi>maleficium</hi>
muſt be gone. Now I for
my part will not abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
deny, that Witches by God's Permiſſion
may have a Power over Men, to hurt all,
or part in them, as by God they ſhall be li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted;
but how ſhall it appear that this
is ſuch a Thing in the Perſon of a Man?
The Queſtion is, <hi>An factum ſit,</hi> and how
it ſhall be diſcovered. But to make it a
Thing ordinary, as the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Writers do
beyond the Seas, I take it to be a Fable,
acknowledging that for Truth, which a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
well verſed in that Argument did late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
write, that Maleficiation is the very gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bage
of Popery; a Thing ſo baſe, that we
who have learned Chriſt aright, ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe
and contemn, allowing it no place a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
us. Which Courſe it were a ſhame
if we ſhould not obſerve, ſince the Papiſts
themſelves grow very weary of it; and
that even in <hi>France,</hi> where there hath been
more ado with this Maleficiation than in
any other Country; for there the common
Sort at the Time of their Marriages, were
wont to be afraid to have the Words of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
in Matrimony to be ſpoken aloud,
<hi>Quos Deus conjunxit nemo ſeparet,</hi> or the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nediction
to be publickly given, leſt ſome
Witch or Sorcerer in the ſame Inſtant
ſhould tye a knot upon a Point, or play
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:0639300101:109"/>
ſome other ſorcering Trick, whereby the
new Bridegroom ſo long as that knot laſted,
ſhould be diſabled from actual Copulation
with her whom he had married. And for
avoiding of that hazard, they had there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
their Matrimonies celebrated in the
Night Time, and in ſome private Place,
where none came but ſuch Friends as they
dared to truſt. This Superſtition grew ſo
common, and Men were ſo abuſed by the
fright that came thereof, that the Prelates
of <hi>France,</hi> about Thirty Years ſince, in a
Council at <hi>Rheimes,</hi> made this Decree a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
it. <note place="margin">

Rag of Popery. And yet I do now find,
that in the very Sentence which is this Day
to be given, it falleth directly upon the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription
of <hi>maleficium verſus hanc.</hi> So that
what ſhould I think of this Caſe of my
Lords, which is built on ſuch a Foundation
as no Man will ſtand to? We are on it, and
off it, and avow it we dare not, yet fly
from it we will not. This moveth Scruple
in me, how I ſhould aſſent to that whereof
I can learn no certainty from the Council of
my Lady, nor from you that be the Judges,
who ſpeak for this Nullity: I dare not reſt
my Building on ſuch a ſandy Foundation.</p>
                     <p>2. Another Matter which troubleth my
Mind, is the Novelty of that which is now
ſet on Foot; a Thing unheard of in our
Church, and unknown in our Kingdom.
We have many Stories, Old and New, of
Things done in this Land; we have Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
extant in every Dioceſe; we have Acts
and Records which ſpecify thoſe Accidents
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:0639300101:111"/>
which have fallen out in the Days of our
Fore-fathers. I have cauſed ſearch in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Places to be made, and ſo I know have
ſome of you, the Commiſſioners; and I
have called upon you for the ſame, but I
can have no Precedent of any ſuch Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
that hath paſſed in our Kingdom. No
Memory of Man can expreſs unto me the
Name of that Perſon, whoſe Marriage was
annull'd for Impotency towards his Wife,
when he found an Ability of carnal Copu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
with any other Woman. It is this
Year, 1613. that hath ſet Abroad this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Imagination, for the former Ages
knew it not. It is ſafe walking in the Ways
which are treaded out unto us. We have
great Reaſon for our doings in theſe Human
Actions, when we do thoſe Deeds which
formerly were done by our Predeceſſors. I
have had many worthy Men, which have
gone before me in the Place which I now
hold, Men learned, Men judicious, great
diſcoverers of Impoſtures; Men that have
done great Services for the Nation where we
live; but of them never any had ſuch a
Caſe before them, they never gave Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
for a Nullity of Marriage upon ſuch
an inability. I know not whether it be a
happineſs or unhappineſs, that I muſt be
the firſt to ſit in a Commiſſion for determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
ſuch a Controverſy.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="107" facs="tcp:0639300101:112"/>
I know to meet with this Objection, it is
whiſpered ſometimes, that there is an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
and that is <hi>Bury</hi>'s Caſe, which is
urged as a Precedent unto this now in Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion.
But indeed, that is no Pattern of this,
the diſſimilitude is great between the one
Caſe and the other, for <hi>Bury</hi> had his Stones
ſtricken off with an Horſe, that nothing
but a little part of one of them remained.
I will read you the very Caſe, which if any
Man doubt of, ſhall be avowed unto him.
Thus then it doth follow.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>John Bury,</hi> Eſquire, was lawfully ſeiſed
in his Demeanes as of Fee, of, and in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
Mannors, Lands and Tenements, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the County of <hi>Devon.</hi> The ſaid <hi>John
Bury,</hi> did the 20th Day of <hi>November,</hi> in
the firſt Year of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> marry one
<hi>Willimot Gifford,</hi> and they lived together
Three Years; and the ſaid <hi>Bury</hi> could not
<hi>carnaliter cognoſcere dictam Willimotam.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Afterwards, <hi>viz.</hi> the 17th of <hi>May</hi> 1561,
the ſaid <hi>Willimot</hi> called the ſaid <hi>Bury</hi> before
the Eccleſiaſtical Judge, and charged him
to be <hi>impotentem ad coeundum cum dicta</hi> Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limota,
<hi>propter vitium perpetuum, &amp; incura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bile
impedimentum ad generationem, &amp; ejus
inhabilitatem,</hi> &amp;c. and thereupon deſired
to be divorced, In the Proceeding before
the Judge, it was proved by divers Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
of which two were Phyſicians, that
the ſaid <hi>Bury</hi> had but one little Stone, and
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:0639300101:113"/>
that no bigger than a Bean. It was alſo
depoſed by divers Matrons, that the ſaid
<hi>Willimot Gifford</hi> remained a Virgin, and
incorrupt; and the ſaid <hi>Bury</hi> confeſſed no
leſs: Upon which Proof, and Confeſſion
of <hi>John Bury,</hi> the Eccleſiaſtical Judge pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
Sentence of Divorce, and did
thereby ſeparate them.</p>
                     <p>Afterward the ſaid <hi>John Bury</hi> took to
Wife one <hi>Philip Monjoy,</hi> his firſt Wife,
<hi>Willimot Gifford,</hi> being then alive; and the
ſaid <hi>Philip</hi> had a Son in the Time of their
continuing together, <hi>John Bury</hi>'s firſt Wife
being alive.</p>
                     <p>Afterwards, the ſaid <hi>Willimot</hi> being ſtill
living, the ſaid <hi>Monjoy,</hi> of her own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,
without any Sentence of Divorce,
forſook the ſaid <hi>John Bury,</hi> and married one
<hi>Langeden,</hi> with whom ſhe continued. The
ſaid <hi>John Bury,</hi> and his firſt Wife <hi>Willimot</hi>
died, the ſaid <hi>Monjoy</hi> and <hi>Langeden</hi> then li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
married together.</p>
                     <p>The Queſtion is, Whether <hi>John Bury,</hi>
being divorced from <hi>Willimot Gifford</hi> for
Impotency, the ſecond Marriage, ſolemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
between the ſaid <hi>John Bury,</hi> and <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy,</hi>
during which Time the Iſſue Male was
born, be in Law a Marriage or not.</p>
                     <p>It appeareth by the Proceſs made in the
Cauſe, and the Words of the Sentence
grounded upon the ſame Proceſs, that the
firſt Marriage was pronounced to be void,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:0639300101:114"/>
                        <hi>Propter defectum &amp; vitium teſticulorum,</hi>
which made the ſaid <hi>John Bury, impoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem
&amp; ineptum ad actum generandi, &amp;
coitum conjugalem.</hi> And ſo in all Reſpects,
this ſecond Marriage with <hi>Monjoy</hi> is void,
and of no effect: For either this Cauſe of
the Diſſolution of the firſt Matrimony is
true, which is always to be preſumed, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
the contrary do appear, and then the
ſame Cauſe doth make the ſecond Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
void alſo; or elſe, if it any ways ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
this Cauſe of the Diſſolution of the

                     <p>Whether this be true or no, I appeal to
Dr. <hi>Stuard,</hi> who is here in Preſence, and
of Counſel for my Lady, who, I know,
will affirm it, becauſe, not long ſince, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
asked by me of it, he confeſſed the

<pb n="110" facs="tcp:0639300101:115"/>
Counſel for my Lord, who was uſed—for
his Advice in this Caſe of <hi>Bury</hi>; and Dr.
<hi>Hone</hi> is yet living, who can teſtify the
ſame. For I will ſuppoſe, that a Man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
forget ſuch a famous Caſe as that was,
wherein himſelf was employ'd; but if all
theſe were dead, I know where Records,
be, which ſtill will continue. If this then
were the Matter in Queſtion touching <hi>Bury,</hi>
                        <hi>defectus teſticulorum,</hi> what is this to the
great Controverſy now depending before
us? And if this be the only Precedent, that
ſhould be the Inducement, that the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
to be given in this Cauſe is not new,
but the like hath been heard of before; I
am where I was: We are now to act a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty,
a thing ſtrange, and unheard of in
this Church of <hi>England,</hi> whereof let other
Men be the Managers, I may have no
hand in it.</p>
                     <p>But perhaps it will be ſaid, that in ſome
other Countries, and eſpecially in <hi>France,</hi>
theſe things are well known, and the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
of one Kingdom, eſpecially being
ſo near unto us, may be an Inducement for
us to do the like, ſince the Reaſon is the
ſame. My Anſwer thereunto is, That I
that live in <hi>England,</hi> am to frame my ſelf
to thoſe things, which I find in the Church
of <hi>England,</hi> whereof I ſee no reaſon, but
there ſhould be as great Eſteem, as of any
Church in the World. In the Days of our
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:0639300101:116"/>
Fore-fathers, as our Nation was held a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
noble Nation, ſo was the Church of
<hi>England</hi> held a very famous Church. <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia
Anglicana,</hi> as might eaſily be ſhewed
out of <hi>Matthew Paris,</hi> and by divers things
in ſome later general Councils, did carry
a greater Sway. And why ſhould we at
this time, in any thing, yield unto any
Church in the World, ſince it is a thing
well known, that the Knowledge of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
doth abound here, beyond all other
Nations? and Men of this Land have beat
down the Power of the Pope, and made e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident
divers Queſions in Matters of The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ology,
beyond all the Parts of Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom!
But beyond this, I do know, that
the Cuſtoms of Churches, even by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination
of the Pope himſelf, ought to
be the Rule of Judgment in this Nature.
We have a famous Place interſerted into
the Body of the Law, written by Pope <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi>

By this we do find, that the Church
of <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf doth grant no Separations in
Matters of Matrimony, where the Church
of <hi>France</hi> doth; and if the Pope permit in
<hi>France</hi> it ſelf, that a Divorce ſhould be
made, it is but a Toleration, and not this
neither, but where it is <hi>conſuetudo generalis
Eccleſiae Gallicanae</hi>; which if you will apply
unto this Cauſe in Queſtion, you muſt ſhew
me, that in <hi>England</hi> it hath been a general
Cuſtom, that a Nullity in Marriage
may be pronounced <hi>propter impotentiam
verſus hanc</hi>; which if you cannot ſhew,
as indeed you cannot, nor give any true
Example, that ever hath been of any ſuch
Separation within this Church; I may both
in Law and Conſcience conclude, that I
dare not introduce any Novelty, and ſo
conſequently pronounce for the Nullity of
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:0639300101:118"/>
this Marriage. Many things are done in
<hi>France,</hi> whereof if we in <hi>England</hi> had the
Examination, we ſhould peradventure find
the Fact different from that which they
conceiv'd; or if we agree in the Fact, we
ſhould give another Sentence. It is not
unknown how, within the Space of one
Year, there hath been much a-do in <hi>France,</hi>
about two Women, <hi>Magdalen</hi> and <hi>Louyſe,</hi>
pretended to be poſſeſſed with a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Devils, and how <hi>Verrine,</hi> a principal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit

the Maſs, Invocation of Saints, Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of Images, and a great many other
Points of the Groſſneſs of Popery; and a
Book hereof hath been printed and reprint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in <hi>Paris,</hi> with Approbation of the State,
and Allowance of learned Men; in which
the Church of <hi>England</hi> would certainly
diſſent, and proclaim the whole Buſineſs to
be but an Impoſture; as the very like was
in the Days of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> when the
Devils of <hi>Denham</hi> were ſaid to poſſeſs
<hi>Sarah Williams</hi> and her Siſter, and ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Perſons; and much a-do was made of
it, and divers fond People believing
thoſe Knacks, turn'd Papiſts thereupon;
yet the Iſſue of all was, that it proved no
better than a ſhameful Deluſion, and a
great abuſing of credulous and light-belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Perſons.</p>

3. But now to proceed farther; if it ſhall
be ſaid, It is not the Novelty, nor the
Want of Cuſtom here in <hi>England,</hi> which
ſhould prejudice the Truth; <hi>valeat veritas,</hi>
whereſoever or whenſoever it appears:
The Proofs are evident whereupon we do
ſtand, and that will enforce the Sentence.
My Anſwer thereunto is, let that be made
manifeſt, and clear and perſpicuous, unto
the Conſcience of an underſtanding Man,
and I ſhall concur with you; but how ſhall
I find this in a Matter of this Quality?
Becauſe it is nothing elſe but Truth which
we do aim at, it were fit that all Probati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
if not which are poſſibly, yet at the
leaſt which reaſonably may be had, ſhould
be got together to enforce a Concluſion of
this Conſequence. My Books tell me, <hi>In

                        <hi>It is the
Honour of a King to find out a

their Time better in a Point of Difficulty,
than to ſearch and ſearch again, by all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
and good Means, to know what is the
Bottom of that which lieth ſecret, that ſo
they may ſatisfy their own Conſcience, and
the Conſcience of others, in the Sentence
which they give, and leave no kind of
Scruple, which may trouble their own
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:0639300101:120"/>
Thoughts? Whether theſe things have
been done in this preſent Caſe, I appeal to
your own Conſciences; whether the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
do not mention divers things; whether
the Council for my Lord have not ſpoke
of ſundry Matters; whether we that be the
Judges, have not thought of divers Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
convenient to be held; of all which, no
Piece or Parcel hath been permitted unto
us. The Proofs then which we have had,
do ariſe only out of the Depoſitions, and if
there be not Proof ſufficient, where ſhall
we ſeek for it? Let us then conſider them.
I will tell you my Opinion of them. I find
nothing in them all, which is not in Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
contained in the Anſwers of my
Lord of <hi>Eſſex</hi>; a noble Perſonage ſaith,
that in the hearing of divers things, the
Earl hath ſaid, that he was not able to
know his Lady carnally; the Earl think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this to be true. But this is but a Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Wonder ſpoken extrajudicially;
and therefore for the underſtanding of the
Truth therein, we are to have Recourſe
unto that, which by the ſaid Earl is judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
depoſed. Divers Witneſſes do ſpeak,
that the Earl and the Lady have lived and
lain together for divers Years, my Lord
doth acknowledge it in his Anſwer; the
Matrons and Mid-wives do declare, that
in their Judgment, my Lady is a Virgin,
and therefore that ſhe was never known
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:0639300101:121"/>
carnally by the Earl; himſelf confeſſeth
that he did never know her. So that now,
all in Subſtance depending upon his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip's
Anſwer, it ought to be our Labour
to ſcan that exactly, and to judge of it
circumſpectly. Doth not he then ſay, <hi>in
reſponſione ad quartum</hi>; that tho' divers
times, in the firſt Year of their Cohabita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
he did attempt to know her (which
divers times may be twice or thrice, and
no more) yet in the two latter Years, he did
never attempt it? But doth he not ſay plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<hi>in reſponſione ad tertium</hi>; that ſince the
time of his Marriage, he had not, nor
hath any Sickneſs or Impediment, to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
him, but that he might have had, and
may have carnal Knowledge with a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.
This is for the General, that he
hath no Impediment; but <hi>in reſponſione ad
quintuni,</hi> doth he not deſcend more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
unto his own Lady; that it is true
that he did never carnally know the ſaid
Lady <hi>Frances?</hi> Mark now what followeth;
but that to the Act of carnal Copulation,
he did not find any Defect in himſelf. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
he was not able to penetrate into her
Body; but he layeth the Faults of that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
her, as may be ſeen in his Anſwer unto
the 7th Article. And it may not be forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
that in the End of the Anſwer to the
4th Article, he ſaith, that ſometimes ſhe
refuſed him; theſe things are evident, and
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:0639300101:122"/>
cannot be denied. The only Matter which
maketh ſhew againſt this, is, that he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth
that he hath lain by her, and
hath had no Motion to have carnal Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of her; but eſpecially, that in the
End of his Anſwer unto the 6th Article;
and believeth he never ſhall. Theſe Words
are the Shield and Buckler of the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
part; but how eaſily do they vaniſh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
or fall to the Ground! For I appeal
unto you all, who were preſent at the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aminations
(and thoſe were ten of us in
Number, who now ſit here preſent) whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Earl did not openly ſubjoin that
to his Anſwer; <hi>When I came out of</hi> France,
<hi>I did love her, but I do not ſo now, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ever ſhall I.</hi> I appeal unto the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
of you all, except my Lord of
<hi>Winton,</hi> and my Lord of <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> who
were not then Commiſſioners, whether
this be ſo or no; here then is the Matter,
it is the Want of Love, which reſtraineth all
Motions of carnal Concupiſcence, and not
any Impotency; it is <hi>defectus voluntatis,</hi> and
not <hi>defectus poteſtatis.</hi> Let Diſcontentment
be removed, and there will be an End of
all the Inability: Married Men beſt
know theſe things; but out of common
Reaſon, there can be no great Longing,
where there is no great Liking; many
things they ſay fall out between Man and
Wife, that for ſome good Space of time,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:0639300101:123"/>
there is no carnal Conjunction, and yet no
Impotency concluded thereby may be. The
Caſe is famous of <hi>Pulcheria,</hi> Siſter unto the
Emperor <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the younger, who having
vowed Virginity, was notwithſtanding af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward,
for great Reaſon of State, thought
fit to be marry'd unto <hi>Martianus,</hi> who
thereupon was choſen Emperor; ſhe would
not condeſcend thereunto, till ſhe had Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
from him, that her Virginity ſhould
be preſerved, and with ſuch a Promiſe he
did marry her, ſo that they lived toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in Shew as Man and Wife; but indeed
as a Brother and a Siſter. Our Stories do
make mention, that he who was called Saint
<hi>Edward</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> I mean King <hi>Edward</hi>
the Confeſſor, did marry a Lady, the
Knowledge of whoſe Body he never had,
neither did this wedded Couple ever en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to break their Virginity. The
Writers do declare no other Reaſon hereof,
but that they had an Opinion, that to live
in Virginity, was the more meritorious, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Superſtition of thoſe times.
Now were it not a ſtrange Argument, to
conclude in this manner, that becauſe <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianus</hi>
had not conjugal Copulation with
<hi>Pulcheria,</hi> therefore he was a Man impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent;
or, becauſe King <hi>Edward</hi> had not
carnal Knowledge of his Wife, therefore
he could not know her. I know the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
of this preſent Queſtion do
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:0639300101:124"/>
differ from thoſe, but the Ground of the
Argument is the ſame. Want of Act up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
private Reaſon, will never enforce a
Want of Power. And this is our Caſe, as
I underſtand it, which maketh me unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to conſent to this Nullity.</p>
                     <p>4. There followeth now another Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which I ſhall deliver briefly. We
have always agreed, that the Chapter in
the Law, which containeth our Caſe, is
the Chapter <hi>Litera de frigidis &amp; malefici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atis</hi>;
for if it be not there, it is no where
to be found. When we have deliver'd ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
things appertaining to this Cauſe out
of the beſt Writers of the former Ages, or
of our own time, as that my Lord ſhould
be inſpected, or that Phyſicians ſhould uſe
their Art to diſcern and remove Impoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
if any were to be found, or that Faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Prayer, and Alms ſhould be exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to over-come this Evil, and divers other
Points of like Nature; it hath ſtill been
anſwered to us, to ſay the Interpreters,
but it is not in the Law; or it is in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees
which bind not, but it is not in the
Decretals; or it is a Council and Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
but it is no Mandate or Injunction.
I now therefore mention ſome things, which
is in the Law, and in the very Body of this
Law, and it is the Pope's Mandate; and
that is, that my Lord ſhould have given
his <hi>juramentum cum ſeptima manu,</hi> as well as
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:0639300101:125"/>
my Lady; for Want whereof, the whole
Proceeding is annullated. This is the
Pope's Commandment, <hi>Quocirca manda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi>
and it requireth the Oath of both, <hi>ip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis
cum ſeptima propinquorum manu firmanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus
juramento, ſe commiſceri carnaliter ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiviſſe,</hi>
then <hi>proferatis divortii ſententiam
inter eos.</hi> This is a thing ſo clear, that
when on <hi>Thurſday</hi> laſt, by chance, there
fell mention of it; the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
for my Lady<note place="margin">Dr. Stuard, Dr. Byrde.</note> were ſo far
from giving Anſwer to it, that
to ſpeak plainly, they ſtood as
Men blaſted or blighted with a Lightning,
and knew not which way to turn them; as
was manifeſt not only unto us, but to all
the Standers by; which I do not utter to
do them any wrong, for they are worthy
Men, both learned and faithful to the Cauſe
which they undertake; but the Note is,
that this Objection can receive no true An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.
I know, that ſince that time, there
hath been Labour made, to give a Salve to
this Sore, but no Man's Wit can do it. I
ſaid, and ſay ſtill, that no Man's Loquence,
neither any Man's Eloquence, can perſwade
me, that <hi>ipſis firmantibus juramento</hi> is of the
ſingular Number. I know there hath been
tumbling and turning of Books, to find
ſome Shew to meet with this Objection,
but nothing can be found, which will hold
out this Water. The Proceeding there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:0639300101:126"/>
doth appear to be unperfect and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective
in that, which is mainly required by
the Law, which makes me to conclude in
this faſhion againſt ſome unperfect Speech
touching my Lord of <hi>Eſſex</hi>; his affirming
or denying of his own Inability towards my
Lady; that either he doth confeſs it or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
it: If he do acknowledge it, where is then
his Oath <hi>cum ſeptima Manu,</hi> which the Law
impoſeth? If he do deny it, where is then
your Proof of his Inability, ſince you
ground the whole Subſtance of the Nullity
upon his Lordſhip's Anſwer, <hi>That he could
not know her carnally.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I muſt yet crave Patience to go a little far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
One other Exception which I take unto
this Nullity, is the manner of the Sentence,
which by us is to be given, which hath ever
been reſolved ſhould be in general, not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing
any Reaſon particular wherefore
we do give it. To ſay that my Lord is <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potens
in genere verſus hanc,</hi> and not to tell
wherein, is to propound a Riddle to the
World, which no Man underſtandeth. It
were a ſtrange Thing in Learning, to ſay,
that ſuch a Creature is Animal, and not to
tell whither it be a Man, or a Horſe, or a
Fiſh, or a Bird. And although it hath been
ſaid, and ſtrongly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd,<note place="margin">Sir Julius Caeſar, Sir Daniel Dun.</note>
                        <hi>That it is enough in
a Sentence to pronounce a
Thing in general, and that</hi>
                        <pb n="122" facs="tcp:0639300101:127"/>
                        <hi>the Judge is bound to give no Reaſon of it</hi>;
yet I would be glad to know whether, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
I will conceal the particular Reaſon
from the Hearers or Standers by, yet were it
not fit, that I who am the Judge, and muſt
give the Sentence, or at leaſt conſent unto
it, ſhould know the Ground whereupon I
do give it. Give me leave to ſpeak my
Conſcience, I think ſuch a Sentence, that
<hi>propter latens aliquod impedimentum,</hi> which is
<hi>perpetuum &amp; incurabile verſus hanc,</hi> is nothing
but a device to ſerve a preſent Turn, which
we muſt deliver in ſuch obſcure Words, to
blind Poſterity that comes after, and to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſe
thoſe which will inquire into it, as if
we had known ſomething which we held
not fit to utter, when in Truth we know
nothing. I find the Texts of the Law do
ſtill ſet down the Reaſon, and give a Caſe
particular, as Frigidity, or Section, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitneſs
of the generative Part, or ſome ſuch
other Matter; but for an Inability, <hi>propter
latens impedimentum,</hi> my dulneſs is ſuch,
that in the whole Book I cannot diſcover it:
And it is a Myſtery that cannot enter into
me, how a Man ſhould be potent unto
other Women, and impotent to his Wife,
if it be not in Caſe of Phrenſy, which is not
<hi>latens impedimentum,</hi> and which alſo find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<hi>lucida intervalla.</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Cap. Litterae.</note> It
was the Aſſertion of him
in the Law, <hi>That he did not</hi>
                        <pb n="123" facs="tcp:0639300101:128"/>
                        <hi>know his Wife, but that he had a Power to know
other Women.</hi> But what wiſe Man doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
him? Or what is there in the Text
which doth declare it to be true? I will end
this Point with that of our Saviour in the
29th of St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> That there are three
Sorts of Eunuchs, or Men unfit to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
the one is of God's making, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
is of Mens making, and the third is
of their own making. The firſt are they
that are paſt from their Mother's Belly, who
either are <hi>frigidi,</hi> or ſuch as have not Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
fit for Generation, or ſome apparent
Debility. The ſecond are thoſe who are
caſtrated by Men, or by ſome violence have
that hindred in them, whereunto by Nature
they are fit in reſpect of Procreation. I will
not here diſpute that idle <hi>Maleficium,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
your ſelves are flown from it. The
third hath no coherence with this Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.
Let me know then, in which of the
former two you do place it. Is he paſt
from his Mother's Womb? why then do
you give him leave to marry again? that
he who hath deluded and fruſtrated one,
may alſo delude another. If he be in the
ſecond Rank, why do you not tell us what
the Violence is which he hath ſuſtained
from Men, or from any other Creature.
Let us have, I pray you, ſome kind of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction,
and let not this Aenigma in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
blind us, leaſt the World ſhould ſay,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:0639300101:129"/>
that wilfully we ſhut our Eyes againſt the
Truth.</p>
                     <p>6. One Reaſon I have more, why I yield not
to this Nullity, and then I have done. It is
drawn from the Inconveniencies which will
follow thereupon, if we diſſolve the Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
in ſuch Caſe as is now deſired. I
look firſt on the detriment and harm which
will follow, if the Marriage do continue in
force, and in vigour, and I do find, that all
the inconvenience doth redound but to one
Perſon. Between a Lady and her Husband
there is ſome diſcontentment, which Time
and God's Grace may eaſily remove: There
is then an end of that Controverſie. Or if
the diſagreement ſhall never be appeaſed,
it is no more but one Lady doth want that
Solace which marital Conjunction would
afford unto her; which many a good Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
is enforced to endure, and yet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
no Sin, neither labours to violate the
Laws of the Church: For ſuppoſe the
Husband be ſick of ſome long Diſeaſe, or
languiſhing Weakneſs, muſt not the Wife
ſuſtain it with patience and quietneſs? Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
the Husband be Captive in ſome For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Nation, or Priſoner in his own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
whereby occaſion of marital Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xion
is taken from the Wife, no Divine
will pronounce, that a Separation is in this
Caſe to be ſought. Let a Woman do that
in Modeſty which others are inforced to do
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:0639300101:130"/>
out of Neceſſity; and let her expect God's
leiſure, in Faſting and in Prayer, and in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Humiliation. This is all the Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience
which ariſeth to one Perſon, if ſhe
have not the Performance of conjugal Duty.</p>
                     <p>But look on the other ſide, what are the
Incongruities, or rather Abſurdities which
will eaſily follow, if ſuch Diſſolutions of
Marriages be permitted. I will name only
two. The firſt is the hazard of violating
and annulling of Marriage by an ordinary
Practice; for if the Gap be open, who will
not run in: And the Judge muſt diſpenſe
the Law indifferently to all, if the Proofs
be accordingly; for we may not ſay, that
it is for noble Perſonages, and great Peers
in the State, and not for others of inferiour
Rank. Whatſoever Couple therefore have no
Children, and live diſcontented, come pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
to take part of this general Jubilee:
And, albeit they know in their Conſciences,
that it which they attempt is unlawful; yet
to ſatisfy their Fancy, they will collude the
one with the other, and enter a Proſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſecretly agreed upon, howſoever in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
ſhew they ſeem to differ the one from
the other: And who can doubt, but for
Money or Favour, they may procure Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,
and others who are to be uſed by
the formality of the Law, to teſtify and
depoſe ſo much as ſerves the Turn. By
which means we are at a fair paſs, when
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:0639300101:131"/>
not only the Marriage Bed ſhall be defiled,
and Adulteries made frequent, which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the ſecond Table of the Law, but
Perjury ſhall be committed, and God's
Name taken in vain, which is repugnant
unto the firſt Table.</p>
                     <p>A ſecond Inconvenience is the Danger,
leaſt both Parties which are freed from
their Matrimony, ſhould divers Years after
be returned to it again, when perhaps the
Husband by a ſecond Wife hath Children,
and the Wife by a ſecond Husband hath
ſtore of Iſſue alſo; for there is no doubt in
the Law, but if a Man ſuppoſed to be <hi>frigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,</hi>
and therefore divorced, ſhall after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
Marry, and by begetting of Children
ſhew himſelf not to be impotent, but apt
for Generation, this Man is to be taken
from his ſecond Woman, and returned to
his firſt Wife, and the Woman for whoſe
Marriage a Nullity was pronounced in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of the Inſufficiency of her Mate, muſt
be now taken from her ſecond Companion,
and returned to the firſt. Of this the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
is apparent, <hi>quia decepta eſt Eccleſia,</hi>
they adjudged him to be impotent upon
wrong Information, whom Experience and
Truth hath declared to be potent. And
what Man can foretel, how variety of Times
may produce other Judgments. There may
be Queſtion of Land or Inheritance, of Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimation
or Illegitimation; and a wiſe
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:0639300101:132"/>
Man would be unwilling to bring it on the
Stage when he is dead and gone, and to
make it the Fable of the World, whether
his Children be born lawfully, or to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
in the Rank of Baſtards. The World
is ſubject to much mutability, and Judges
of future Times may peradventure be led
with the Power of ſome great Perſons, and
perhaps may think upon other Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
that it is but a Conceit, that a Man
ſhould be potent unto another Woman, and
impotent to his Wife; or that the Common
Law doth not know any <hi>Maleficium,</hi> or that
they do not believe, that there may be <hi>la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens
impedimentum perpetuum,</hi> and <hi>incurabile
verſus hanc,</hi> when they ſee that the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
is in ſhew of the World, a luſty, able
Man, and hath well proved his Potency,
by begetting Three or Five, or Seven, or
Ten Children upon another Woman. Theſe
are pretty Things, if a Man do well conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
them, and will ſerve to make diſtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
between Kinſman and Kinſman, and
make work for the Lawyers, and keep the
Courts at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> that they ſhall not be
idle; which if we could not learn other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
yet <hi>Bury</hi>'s Caſe before remember'd
doth teach us, who was divorced from his
Wife in the 3d or 4th Year of Queen <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth,</hi>
and when his Brother had enjoyed
his Land until the 40th Year of the ſaid
Queen, then was he thruſt out of it, and
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:0639300101:133"/>
the queſtion'd Son, or his Heir, was put
into Poſſeſſion of it by Trial of Law; a
great deal of Money being ſpent in that
Contention, and both Civilians and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Lawyers in great Numbers were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd
of both Sides; and yet the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy
was not ſo appeaſed, but that of
my certain Knowledge, within theſe three
Years it had been raiſed again, and a ſtrong
device was laid how to bring this about a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain;
only my ſelf withſtood it, and would
not give way unto it, when I was divers
Times conſulted thereabout; conceiving
very well, that it would not be long before
ſome Prohibition would come out of ſome
of the King's Courts, becauſe the common
Law diſliked, that Mens Inheritance, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
after Judgments, ſhould be diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
when the Parties whom moſt of all it
concerned, are dead long before, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
anſwer for themſelves; whereas, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure,
if themſelves had been living,
they could have anſwered that for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
which other Men know not. And
there ought to be a ſettled Courſe in all
Things appertaining to Inheritance.</p>
                     <p>By this Time, I hope you ſee, that it is
not out of willfulneſs, or prejudicate Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit,
that I have impugned this Nullity,
but out of ground of Reaſon, and out of
ſcruple of Conſcience, which is it that muſt
accuſe me, or excuſe me, before the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>living
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:0639300101:134"/>
God. I know you have heard what
other Men have ſaid, and they have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
for themſelves. Upon all which
Grounds I make this Concluſion, That
howſoever this Matter of Separation with
great earneſtneſs hath been perſued, yet
it is the ſurer and the ſafer way to leave it
as we find it, and in no Caſe to diſſolve it.
I oft remember that Saying, which is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
among the Canoniſts; <hi>Tolerabilius eſt
aliquos contra ſtatuta hominum dimittere copu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latos,
quam conjunctos legitimè contra ſtatuta
Domini ſeparare.</hi> That concerneth us who
be the Judges, and for the Parties them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
who perhaps can be content to be
ſevered, and to Marry elſewhere, let them
know this from me, that they may beſt
expect a Bleſſing from God when they live
in that State where feweſt ſcruples ſhall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe
in their Mind: From which, whether
they ſhall be free in leaving their old Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction,
and betaking themſelves unto a
new, I refer to their wiſer Thoughts, when
in all probability, if any croſs or thwart
ſhall ariſe in their new intended Matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
this perplexity and anguiſh will ſtill
follow their Souls, that they have done
that, whereof in their trueſt Meditations
they have no ground of Conſcience, and
therefore that it is the Hand of God upon
them, who giveth not a Bleſſing unto that
which was unduly ſought.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="130" facs="tcp:0639300101:135"/>
You have thus at large heard my Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
againſt the annullation of this Marriage.
Now, if you ask me, what would you then
have done concerning this Couple of noble
Perſonages: my Anſwer is, that I would have
a Reconciliation by all means to be labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
and although that be difficult to bring
about, yet it is the more Honour when it is
effected. Charity will forgive, and forget
the higheſt Offences. It is St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi>'s
Judgment, <hi>That in the greateſt Breaches be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Man and Wife, Reconciliation is the
beſt; and the worthieſt Pains that can be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow'd,
is to bring that about.</hi> There want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
only one or more good Mediators, and
then great Things will be compaſſed. The
diſagreement was inconceivable between
God and Man, yet Chriſt, that great Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator,
did take it away. The Breach was
very bitter between <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> yet
our moſt bleſſed Soveraign, as a gracious
Interceſſor, did give an end unto it. Let
Divines be uſed now, as much as Lawyers
have been uſed heretofore. Take the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Counſel of the one, which will be given
freely, as you have taken the Advice of the
other with much expence of Money. This
I wiſh for, this I pray for, and if my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel
had been uſed, before Things grew to
this height, I would have uſed my beſt
means to have wrought an Atonement.
But becauſe there is no hope thereof, and
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:0639300101:136"/>
this doth expect a legal Deciſion, proceed
you that pleaſe unto this Separation. Give
your Sentence in <hi>ſcriptis,</hi> as you have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
your Opinion in <hi>verbis.</hi> Five might
have ſerved the turn by the Words of the
Commiſſion, if ſeven had diſſented, but
you have ſeven Suffrages, and therefore
proceed; only this I crave of the Regiſter,
that he do make his Act, that this Sentence
is given, <hi>Joanne Epiſcopo</hi> London, D. <hi>Joanne
Bennet milite,</hi> D. <hi>Franciſco James,</hi> D.

Point is added thereunto, as appeareth unto

your Papers, which the Biſhop
of <hi>Litchfield</hi> brought me, I found
it very neceſſary that I ſhould
make anſwer thereunto at my firſt lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure;
for whereas, before, at my laſt meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with you, ye ſeemed to me to be only
as yet unreſolved what Sentence to give in
this Buſineſs till you had heard it throughly
diſputed, that by that means ye might be
fully informed of the State of the Cauſe:
it appears now by theſe Papers, that you
have, after your laſt Days conſultation, put
on a negative Reſolution, grounded upon
Fundaments of Divinity and Conſcience,
as you think, which hath mov'd me to ſend
you herewith my Judgment upon your Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments,
in regard that I did ever hold it
neceſſary that in a Matter of this Weight
all my Commiſſioners ſhould be as near of
one Mind, as might be, and therefore I
would be ſorry that your private Conceits
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:0639300101:138"/>
ſhould ſo blind your Judgment, as to make
you and your Followers draw the <note n="*" place="bottom">Perplex or torment.</note> Cathar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows
againſt your Yoke-fellows; for, that I
may now open plainly my Heart unto you,
at my firſt reading of your Papers from the
Biſhop, I chance to caſt mine Eye firſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Paper of your Arguments before I
had looked upon your Letter, and lighting
upon your firſt Words, <hi>In as much as we do
firmly believe,</hi> &amp;c. I proteſt I thought it had
been ſome ſtrange Confeſſion of Faith, that
you had intercepted amongſt ſome of the
Sectaries; but when I had read out the reſt
of that firſt Article, God is my Judge, I
thought that Paper had been ſome Paſquil
made againſt this Divorce, which coming
to your hands ye had ſent me, and therefore
without reading any farther therein, I look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon your Letter, which reſolv'd me of
all theſe Doubts; but after that I had fully
peruſed, and rightly conſider'd of all your
Papers, I found your Principles ſo ſtrange,
and your Doubts ſo far ſought, that I thought
it neceſſary, as I have already ſaid, to ſet
down unto you my Obſervations upon them.
But to conclude my Letter with that plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
that becometh one of my Quality, I
muſt freely confeſs, that I find the Grounds
of your Oppoſition ſo weak, as I have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to apprehend, that the Prejudice you
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:0639300101:139"/>
have of the Perſons, is the greateſt Motive
of breeding theſe Doubts into you; which
Prejudice is the moſt dangerous Thing that
can fall in a Judge for miſleading of his
Mind. And the Reaſon moving me to this
Apprehenſion, is partly grounded upon
your laſt Words to me at your parting from
<hi>Windſor,</hi> and partly upon a Line ſcrap'd
out in your Paper of Doubts, for I am ſure
you think me not ſo blunt a Secretary, but
that I can read a Line ſo ſcraped out. In
your laſt Speeches with me, you remember
you told me what Aſſurance you had of the
Earl's Ability out of his own Mouth, which
you ſaid you could not but truſt, becauſe he
was ſo religious a Nobleman. But when I
told you of the other Party's contrary Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation,
you remember how you uſed the
Word of Iniquity, and how far your inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lined
Line ſeems to have a Harmony with
this Word, your ſelf can beſt judge. Now
then, if I would ask you what Proof you
have of the one's Religion more than the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's,
you muſt anſwer me, by judging upon
the Exterior; and how deceivable that Gueſs
is, daily experience teaches us. But with a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Proteſtation that I never knew any Thing
but good in the young Earl. Was not this
the Ground of Maſter <hi>Robert Bruſe</hi>'s Incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity,
becauſe he knew the Earl of <hi>Gowry</hi>
to be truly Religious; and did not beg a
Regiſter. <hi>Bothwel</hi> in his Preface of his Book
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:0639300101:140"/>
                  <hi>De viris Illuſtribus.</hi> And as for your Judgment
of the other Party, <hi>Chriſt's Precept</hi> is the
beſt Anſwer unto you, <hi>nolite judicare.</hi> But
if the Queſtion were to judge of the Earl's
Inclination, whether is it likely that you or
I could beſt judge of it; I, he having been
bred with my late Son, and ſerv'd him ſo
long, or you that never ſpoke with him but
once or twice in your Life, and never knew
either good or evil of him but out of his
own Mouth. I will conclude therefore,
with inverting the Argument; that if a
Judge ſhould have a Prejudice in reſpect of
Perſons, it ſhould become you rather, to
have a kind of Faith implicit, in my Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as well in reſpect of ſome Skill I have
in Divinity; as alſo that I hope no honeſt
Man doubts of the uprightneſs of my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience;
and the beſt thankfulneſs that you
that are ſo far my Creature, can uſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
me, is, to reverence, and follow my
Judgment, and not to contradict it, except
where you may demonſtrate unto me that I

                     <p>TO the firſt Article, that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
directly, or by Conſequence
doth contain ſufficient Matter to decide all
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:0639300101:158"/>
Controverſies, eſpecially in things appertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Church; this in my Opinion is
<hi>propoſitio erronea,</hi> and one of the Puritan's
Grounds, without a better Diſtinction or
Explanation. For the Orthodox Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is, That the Scripture doth directly, or
by Conſequence, contain in it ſelf ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Matter to decide all Controverſies in
Points of Faith and Salvation; of which
ſort a Nullity in Marriage cannot be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
for one; and therefore your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
upon the former Propoſition muſt
fail.</p>
                     <p>For farther Satisfaction to your former
Queſtion, I ſay, your own Second Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
doth anſwer it: For if there be a War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
in Scripture for pronouncing a Nullity,
<hi>propter frigiditatem,</hi> then all the Means,
which may make him <hi>frigidus verſus hanc,</hi>
muſt be comprehended therein. For why
doth our Church juſtly condemn as inceſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
the Marriage of a Man with his Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter's
Daughter, or the Marriage of Two
Siſters, but <hi>à Paritate Rationis?</hi> for none
of them is in <hi>terminis</hi> prohibited by the
Scripture, only the Concluſion is gather'd
<hi>à Paritate Rationis.</hi> For if it be not lawful
to marry your Father's Wife, becauſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
you diſcover your Father's Shame; nor
his Siſter, becauſe ſhe is his Kinſwoman;
nor your own Siſter, becauſe thereby you
diſcover your Father, and Mother's Shame:
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:0639300101:159"/>
It can no more be lawful to marry your
Siſter's Daughter; for thereby you alſo
diſcover your own Shame. As alſo that
the ſame Reaſon ſerves for aſcending or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending,
in Points of Conſanguinity, <hi>quia
par eſt Ratio.</hi> The like is in this Caſe, for
altho' Chriſt ſpake only of three ſorts of
Eunuchs, yet <hi>ratio eſt quia non potest eſſe co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pula
inter Eunuchum &amp; mulierem,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
St. <hi>Paul</hi> in the 6th of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi>
telleth us clearly, that it is no <hi>Conjunction
ſine copula:</hi> I conclude therefore, <hi>à paritate
rationis,</hi> that Chriſt did comprehend under
thoſe three ſorts of Eunuchs all Inability,
which did perpetually hinder <hi>Copulam ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
hanc,</hi> whether it were natural or acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental.
For what Difference is there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
cutting off of the Hand, and being
made impotent thereof? <hi>Amputatio &amp;
mutulatio Membri,</hi> is all one in the Civil
Law, and it is alike defrauding of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
when either he who is to be her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
is gelded, or when the Uſe of that
Member towards her is by any unlawful
Means taken from him. Neither is it any
way needful to crave the particular War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of Nullity, <hi>propter Maleficium,</hi> out of
the Scripture, no more than there is War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
in that Place for any Nullity at all.
For Chriſt doth not directly ſay, that a
Marriage ſo made ſhall be null; neither
doth he teach us what Form of Proceſs ſhall
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:0639300101:160"/>
be uſed in it; neither maketh he mention
of a triennial Probation, no more than he
forbiddeth Marriage within the Fourth
Degree, without Leave obtained of the
Biſhop of the Dioceſs. It is therefore ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to all moderate Chriſtians, to be
taught out of the Word, that Marriage is
null <hi>ſine Copula,</hi> and that the Word <hi>Quos
Deus conjunxit,</hi> is never found in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
where <hi>erunt</hi> 
                        <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> doth not
precede, (<hi>viz. they ſhall be one Fleſh.</hi>) But
whether the Impediment be univerſal, or
<hi>verſus hanc</hi> only, and whether the Fault
thereof have been born with him, or done
to him by Violence, or fallen by Diſeaſe,
or by Diſproportion, or Ineptitude betwixt
the Parties, or by unlawful or unnatural
Practices, it is ever <hi>par ratio:</hi> He is <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuchus
verſus hanc</hi>; for he ought to be <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuchus
verſus omnes alias,</hi> ſeeing to her only
he was married; and therefore <hi>à Paritate
Rationis,</hi> ſuch Nullities are grounded upon
the aforeſaid Warrant of Scripture; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
had Chriſt then any Occaſion to ſpeak
to the <hi>Jews</hi> concerning <hi>Maleficium</hi>; for as
it is apparent, that God made King <hi>Abime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lech</hi>
and his Family unable to abuſe <hi>Sarah,</hi>
                        <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Wife; and ſo was he made by
God himſelf <hi>Eunuchus verſus hanc:</hi> is it not
improbable, that the Devil being God's
Ape, ſhould imitate God's Work by his
filthy Witchcraft, by making ſuch as God
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:0639300101:161"/>
will permit him, <hi>inhabile verſus hanc,</hi> tho'
it may be, that it was long after that time,
before the Devil put that Trick in uſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Earth.</p>
                     <p>As to your Third and Fourth Queſtions,
What mention the Fathers, and Councils
make of <hi>Maleficium verſus hanc?</hi> Firſt, I
anſwer, That it may be, if they be well
ſearched, that either ſomething to this
purpoſe ſhall be found in them; or at leaſt
<hi>aliquid analogum,</hi> which <hi>à paritate rationis,</hi>
or by Conſequence, may ſerve to decide
this Queſtion. But leaving this to the
Search, my main Anſwer is, That we muſt
diſtinguiſh of Times. For in all the firſt
Ages, as long as Perſecution lay heavy up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Church, and before that the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
became Chriſtians, the Church did
not meddle with Queſtions of Marriage;
for the Civil Judges determined them,
who would not ſuffer the Church to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
with any thing which drew a Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
after it of Poſſeſſions, and Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
as Marriage doth. Nay, even di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
hundred Years, after the Converſion
of the Emperors, the Judgment and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſions
of all ſuch Queſtions did ſtill remain
in <hi>foro Civili,</hi> till the Popedom began to
wax great, and aſſume, or rather uſurp to
her ſelf a Power of Supreme, or Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Judicatory in all Eccleſiaſtical Cauſes:
And therefore the Fathers, and Councils
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:0639300101:162"/>
had no Occaſion to make mention of that
which was not <hi>eorum fori</hi> at that time. And
beſides that, it is an evil Argument to ſay,
that ſuch a thing is unlawful, becauſe the
Fathers, and firſt Councils make no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it. For you know much beter than I,
that divers main Points in Controverſy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the Papiſts and us, are never men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
by the Fathers, becauſe they could
never have dreamt that ſuch Queſtions
would ariſe; and therefore we only find
the Fathers exact in ſuch Queſtions, as
were moſt agitated, and upon the Stage in
their time; as <hi>de Trinitate: de duabus in
Christo Naturis,</hi> and ſuch like. It is
therefore ſufficient, that there can be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
found in them, which may be juſtly
underſtood to contradict this Opinion; and
it is very probable (as I ſaid before) that
this Trick of <hi>Maleficium</hi> had not then been
put in Practice in the World, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
not known, nor mentioned by them;
for why may not the Devil find out as well
new Tricks of Witchcraft, when God
will permit him, as he doth daily new ſorts
of Hereſies? for his Malice can never end,
till the End of Times.</p>
                     <p>To your Fifth Argument my former
Anſwer doth alſo ſerve. For till the Nine
Hundredth Year of God, it may be, that
that deviliſh Trick came never to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered,
and you know the old Proverb,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:0639300101:163"/>
                        <hi>Ex malis moribus bonae leges,</hi> and it is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely
that that Time of Darkneſs gave the
Devil occaſion of deviſing of ſuch new
Tricks. Look my <hi>Demonology,</hi> and yet
was that Law, for which you cite <hi>Hincma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus
Epiſcopus Rhemenſis,</hi> made by <hi>Charles the
Great,</hi> who in many great Points, as you
know, had ſo great Light, as I dare ſcarcely
term his Time a Time of Blindneſs. But
how great and palpable ſoever that Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
was in Points of Superſtition, I will
ſtill maintain it, as I have ever done, that
for Matter of Order and Policy, all the
World ſhall never be able to find out any
other ſo good, and ſo old an Order of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
to be put in the place of it. In
ſign whereof, there is no well governed
Commonwealth in the Chriſtian World,
where the Canon Law is not received to
judge in Queſtions of that Nature; and it
is certain, that this Queſtion in hand is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a Queſtion of Order and Policy; for the
Grounds of this Queſtion, <hi>That the eſſential
Point of Matrimony cannot be accompliſhed, ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
Copula,</hi> is warranted by expreſs Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and confeſſed by your ſelf.</p>
                     <p>To your Sixth Argument, or rather
Hope, I fear that Hope ſhall prove contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to Faith. For as ſure as God is, there
be Devils, and Devils muſt have ſome
Power, and their Power is in this World,
(for <hi>Satan</hi> is the Prince of this World:)
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:0639300101:164"/>
Neither are the Elect exempted from his
Power; <hi>Job</hi> was not; St. <hi>Paul</hi> was not:
Chriſt ſaith to all his Diſciples, <hi>Cribravit
vos Satanas.</hi> And if the Devil hath any
Power over the Elect, it is over their Fleſh;
and if over the Fleſh, rather over the
fleſheſt, and moſt ſinful part thereof; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
original Sin is ſo tyed, as God, both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
and under the Law, to ſhew the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
of purging Mans original Sin, ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the amputation of the Fore-skin of that
Member. And to exempt thoſe of our
Profeſſion from the Power of Witchcraft,
is a Paradox never yet maintained by any
Learned, or Wiſe Man. That the Devils
Power is not ſo univerſally unbridled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
us, that I freely confeſs, but that it
is totally reſtrained, <hi>quoad nos,</hi> how then
was a Miniſter of <hi>Geneva</hi> bewitched to
Death? And how are the Witches daily
puniſhed by our Laws? Surely if they can
harm none but the Papiſts, we are too Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable
to labour for avenging them only.
<hi>Satan</hi> is permitted to puniſh Man as well for
the breach of the Second, as the Firſt Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
and thereof are we no leſs Guilty
than the Papiſts are. And if the Power of
Witchcraft may reach to our Life, how
much more to a Member? eſpecially to a
Member ſo governed by the Fantaſie,
wherein the Devil hath his principal Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and he may ſo eſtrange the Husband's
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:0639300101:165"/>
Affection from the Wife, as he cannot be
able to perform that Duty unto her. For
it is a common Thing in many Mens Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that they cannot do that Act but
where they Love, nor Fight but when they
are Angry. God keep us therefore from
putting the Trial of our Profeſſion upon
Miracles; let the Miracle-mongers live by
their own Trade.</p>
                     <p>To your Seventh Argument touching the
Remedies, what do you know whether both
Parties, or either of them, have uſed both
thoſe Remedies or not? And that that ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Remedy of Faſting and Prayer ſhould
be uſed publickly for them, I can ſee no
neceſſity. For <hi>non intereſt Reipublicae nec Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiae.</hi>
And private Perſons are command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to uſe their Faſting and Alms ſecretly,
and in private; beſides, that no ſuch Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
or Cure is likely to ſucceed well, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
the Parties own Heart and Deſire be
ſet upon it.</p>
                     <p>And as for your Concluſion upon the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodum,</hi>
either in theſe Perſons, or in
the Example, I can ſee none in either; for
as to this Couple, (betwixt whom Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
was never truly accompliſhed,) they
will peradventure both of them by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claratory
of this Nullity, be made capable
to accompliſh lawful Marriage with others,
(which they could not do betwixt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves)
wherein they may live to the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:0639300101:166"/>
of their Hearts, and enjoy the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of Procreation of Children. And as
to the Example, the Law ſhall be fulfilled
by due Adminiſtration of Juſtice, which
cannot ſerve for an Example or Preſident
of counterfeited Nullites in Time to come;
for, <hi>Notoritas facti,</hi> or rather <hi>non facti,</hi> is
<hi>luce clariorie</hi> in this Caſe. Beſides the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
legal Probations and Confeſſions of the
Parties, which have been taken in this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs;
whereas by the contrary, if they ſhall
be forcibly kept together, their Names,
or ſhadows may well be kept together, but
never their Perſons or Affections; and they
ſhall be forced to live either in perpetual
Miſery and Scandal, or both: And what
ſuch a forced Continency can avail, the
Monks Continency can teach us. And for
a Preſident in time to come, it can reach no
further than to open a way of lawful Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
for any Parties who ſhall chance to be
diſtreſſed in that ſort. <hi>Hac eſt mea ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. And, as for the Extract of our late
Divines Opinions upon this Queſtion, I
confeſs, I cannot gueſs what your intent
was in ſending them unto me, for they all
agree in <hi>Terminis</hi> with my Opinion, that
there is ſuch a Thing as <hi>Maleficiati verſus
hanc</hi>; and your very interlined Paſſages
prove it clearlieſt. As for their Advice
concerning the Remedies, that is, <hi>Conſili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi>
                        <pb n="162" facs="tcp:0639300101:167"/>
                        <hi>non jus, nec Decretum</hi>; not impoſing a
neceſſity; but is to be uſed by diſcretion,
as occaſion ſhall ſerve, or require it.</p>
                     <p>1. As for the legal Doubts of formality,
they concern none of your Calling. If
your Conſcience be reſolved in the Points
of Divinity, it is your part to give your
conſent to the Nullity, and let the Lawyers
take the burthen of making it formal.</p>
                     <p>And as for the triennial Probation, I hope
no Man can be ſo blind as to make a double
triennial, both <hi>Ante &amp; poſt litem conteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam.</hi>
And in Concluſion, our new Divines
Solution of this Queſtion proveth clearly,
that their Reſolution upon this Doubt,
(howſoever it was firſt conceiv'd in blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
as you think,) yet is it now approved
in the time of the greateſt Light, and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the Profeſſion of the Goſpel.</p>
                     <p>To conclude then, if this may ſatisfy
your Doubts, I will end with our Saviour's
Words to St. <hi>Peter, Et cum converſus eris,
confirma fratres tuos.</hi> But I muſt add, <hi>vel
(ſi opus fuerit) converte fratres tuos.</hi> For on
my Conſcience, all the Doubts I have yet
ſeen made in this Buſineſs, are nothing but
<hi>Nodos in Scirpo quaerere.</hi>

               <p>The Midwives appointed to make Inſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction

                     <p>IT is by theſe Preſents declared, That
whereas <hi>Robert,</hi> Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> and
the Lady <hi>Frances Howard,</hi> Contracted by
ſhew of Marriage, did Co-habit in one
Houſe, and lie together in one Bed, <hi>Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus

that the ſaid Lady <hi>Frances</hi> did ſhew her
ſelf prompt, ready to be known of him;
and that the ſaid Earl neither did, nor
could have Knowledge of her, although
he did think himſelf able to have Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of other Women. And that the
ſaid Lady <hi>Frances,</hi> by inſpection of her
Body by Midwives, expert in matter of
Marriage, was prov'd to be apt for carnal
Copulation with Man, and yet a Virgin.
Therefore we the ſaid Judges deputed in
the Cauſe, firſt invocating the Name of

do Pronounce, Decree, and Declare,
That the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> for ſome ſecret,

carnally know, or was, or is able
carnally to know, the Lady <hi>Frances How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard,</hi>

                        <hi>de Facto,</hi> between them, to have

and ſo ought to be free, and at Liberty,
from any Bond of ſuch pretended Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
<hi>de facto,</hi> Contracted, and Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niz'd.
And we do pronounce, That ſhe

                        </note> CECIL, Earl of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisbury,</hi>
that great Engine of the State,
by whom all Wheels moved, held an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate
Correſpondence with the Houſe of
<hi>Suffolk,</hi> which he had ſtrengthned with an
Alliance; marrying his eldeſt Son, the
Lord <hi>Cranborn,</hi> to <hi>Katharine,</hi> the eldeſt
Daughter of that Family. And being
mindful of the Aſperity and Sharpneſs
that was betwixt him and the late Earl of
<hi>Eſſex,</hi> he thought it a good Act of Policy
and Piety not to ſuffer Malice to become
Hereditary, and therefore he was a great
Means in marrying the young Earl of
<hi>Eſſex</hi> to the Lady <hi>Frances Howard,</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of thoſe Siſters, that the Father's
Enmity might be cloſed up by the Son's
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:0639300101:173"/>
Nuptial Fraternity. The Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi>
was Fourteen Years of Age, and ſhe
Thirteen, when they married; too young
to conſider, but old enough to conſent:
Yet by the Advice of Friends ſeparated
after Marriage, ſhe under her Mother's
Wing, and he viſiting <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi>
till Time ſhould mature and ripen a
happy Co-union. The Court was her
Neſt, her Father being Lord Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain;
and ſhe was hatch'd up by her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
whom the ſowr Breath of that Age
(how juſtly I know not) had already taint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
from whom the young Lady might
take ſuch a Tincture, that Eaſe, Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and Court Glories, would more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain
and impreſs on her, than any way
wear out and diminiſh. And growing to
be a Beauty of the greateſt Magnitude in
that Horizon, was an Object fit for Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirers,
and every Tongue grew an Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
at that Shrine.</p>
                     <p>The Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> now in his Puber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
ſent many loving Glances, as Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors
of his good Reſpects; and amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Expreſſions are fit Subjects for jealous
Reproaches to work on. Her Husband
having been now Three or Four Years
beyond the Seas, (ſick with Abſence from
her whom his Deſires longed after) came
over again, and found that Beauty, which
he had left Innocent, ſo faded and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſticated,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:0639300101:174"/>
with ſome Court Drug which
had wrought upon her, that he became
the greateſt Stranger at home. His Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
made way for him a while, and
he bore up with a gentle Gale againſt the
Stream of this Woman's Affections, which
ran altogether (unknown to him) into a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
Channel. Nor was her Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
yet become ſo robuſt, (being of a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Growth) to ſtrike his Ears with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches;
and therefore he imputed her
ſly Entertainments to a Maiden baſhful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
till ſurfeited with that dull Potion
(upon better Advice) he went to the
Earl of <hi>Suffolk</hi> (her Father) and demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his Wife, thinking himſelf capable to
enjoy both her and her Love. The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that thought there had been an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timacy
betwixt them ſuitable to their
Conjugal Knot, made uſe of his Paternal
Power to reduce his Daughter to the Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
of a Wife. But while theſe
Things were ſtruggling for, a moſt violent
Diſeaſe of a poyſonous Nature, imputed
to, but far tranſcending, the Small-Pox,
ſeized on the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi>; and had not
the Strength of Youth, and that Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Power that orders all things, wrought
out the Venom of it, the Earth (as
probable wiſh'd by her) had been his
Marriage-Bed.</p>

                        <pb n="170" facs="tcp:0639300101:175"/>
For this Lady being taken with the
growing Fortunes of ROBERT CAR, Viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<hi>Rocheſter,</hi> and grounding more
Hope upon him than the uncertain and
hopeleſs Love of the Prince, ſhe caſt her
Anchor there, which the Prince ſoon diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd,
and ſlighted her accordingly.
For dancing one time among the Ladies,
and her Glove falling down, it was taken
up, and preſented to him, by one that
thought he did him acceptable Service;
but the Prince refus'd to receive it, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
publickly, He would not have it, it
is ſtretcht by another, meaning the Viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count:
This was an Aggravation of Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
betwixt the King's Son and the
King's Friend.</p>
                     <p>The Counteſs of <hi>Eſſex</hi> having her Heart
alienated from her Husband, and ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Viſcount, had a double Task to
undergo, for accompliſhing her Ends:
One was, to hinder her Husband from
enjoying her; the other was to make the
Viſcount ſure unto her: For diſhoneſt
Love is moſt full of Jealouſy. Her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
ſhe look'd upon as a private Perſon,
and to be carried by him into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
out of her Element, (being Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
of Glory, and a Beauty covetous of
Applauſe) were to cloſe (as ſhe thought)
with an inſufferable Torment; though he
was a Man that did not only every way
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:0639300101:176"/>
merit her Love, but he lov'd her with an
extraordinary Affection, having a gentle,
mild, and courteous Diſpoſition, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
to Women, ſuch as might win upon
the rougheſt Natures. But this fiery
Heat of his Wife's mounted upon the
Wings of Luſt, or Love, (call it what
you will) carried her after ſo much Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief,
that thoſe that ſaw her Face,
might challenge Nature of too much Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſy,
for harbouring ſo wicked a Heart
under ſo ſweet and bewitching a Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</p>
                     <p>To ſtrengthen her Deſigns, ſhe finds
out one of her own Stamp, Mrs. <hi>Turner,</hi>
a Doctor of Phyſick's Widow, a Woman
whom Prodigality and Looſneſs had
brought low; yet her Pride would make
her fly any Pitch, rather than fall into
the Jaws of Want. Theſe two conſult
together, how they may ſtop the Current
of the Earl's Affection towards his Wife,
and make a clear Paſſage for the Viſcount
in the Place. To effect which, one Doctor
<hi>Forman,</hi> a reputed Conjurer, (living at
<hi>Lambeth</hi>) is found out: The Women de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
to him their Grievances; he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
ſudden Help; and to amuſe them,
frames many little Pictures of Braſs and
Wax, ſome like the Viſcount and Counteſs,
whom he muſt unite and ſtrengthen; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
like the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> whom he
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:0639300101:177"/>
muſt debilitate and weaken; and then
with Philtrous Powders, and ſuch Drugs
he works upon their Perſons. And to
practiſe what Effects his Art would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce,
Mrs. <hi>Turner,</hi> that lov'd Sir <hi>Arthur
Manwaring</hi> (a Gentleman then attending
the Prince) and willing to keep him to
her, gave him ſome of the Powder, which
wrought ſo violently with him, that,
through a Storm of Rain and Thunder,
he rode Fifteen Miles one dark Night to
her Houſe, ſcarce knowing where he
was till he was there. <hi>Such is the Devil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh
and mad Rage of Luſt, heighten'd with
Art and Fancy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe Things matur'd and ripen'd by
the Cunning of this Jugler <hi>Forman,</hi> gave
them Aſſurance of happy Hopes. Her
Courtly Invitements, that drew the Viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
to obſerve her, ſhe imputed to the
Operation of thoſe Drugs he had taſted;
and that Harſhneſs, and ſtubborn Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment
ſhe expreſſed to her Husband,
making him (weary of ſuch Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments)
to abſent himſelf, ſhe thought
proceeded from the Effects of thoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
Potions and Powders that were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred
to him: So apt is the Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to take Impreſſion of thoſe Things
we are willing to believe.</p>
                     <p>The good Earl finding his Wife nouſſed
in the Court, and ſeeing no Poſſibility to
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:0639300101:178"/>
reduce her to Reaſon, till ſhe were eſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
from the Reliſh and Taſte of the
Delights ſhe ſuck'd in there, made his
Condition again known to her Father.
The old Man being troubled with his
Daughter's Diſobedience, imbitter'd her,
being near him, with weariſome and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
Chidings, to wean her from the
Sweets ſhe doted on, and with much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do,
forc'd her into the Country. But
how harſh was the parting, being rent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
from the Place where ſhe grew and
flouriſh'd? Yet ſhe left all her Engines
and Imps behind her; the old Doctor,
and his Confederate, Mrs. <hi>Turner,</hi> muſt
be her two Supporters: She blazons all
her Miſeries to them at her departure, and
moiſtens the Way with her Tears. <hi>Chart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi>
was an hundred Miles from her Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs,
and a little time thus loſt is her
Eternity. When ſhe came thither (tho'
in the pleaſanteſt time of Summer) ſhe
ſhut her ſelf up in her Chamber, not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
a Beam of Light to peep upon her
dark Thoughts: If ſhe ſtir'd out of her
Chamber, it was in the Dead of Night,
when Sleep had taken Poſſeſſion of all
others but thoſe about her. In this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable,
ſad, diſcontented Humour, ſhe
continued ſome Months, always mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring
againſt, but never giving the leaſt
civil Reſpect to her Husband; which the
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:0639300101:179"/>
good Man ſuffer'd patiently, being loath
to be the Divulger of his own Miſery:
Yet having a Manly Courage, he would
ſometimes break into a little Paſſion, to
ſee himſelf ſlighted and neglected by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;
but having never found better from
her, it was the eaſier to bear with her.</p>
                     <p>While ſhe was at <hi>Chartley,</hi> ſhe writ to
her Confederates, That <hi>her Husband found
little Operation in their Drugs, complaining
of his Luſtineſs and her Miſery: For</hi> (ſhe
ſaid) <hi>the Viſcount would never love her, if
her Husband did meddle with her, which
with Difficulty ſhe yet impeded, but how long
ſhe ſhould reſiſt his Violence, ſhe knew not;
therefore ſhe implor'd their Aſſiſtance, if they
would not ſee her the moſt deſpicable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
in the World: And for Satisfaction, they
ſhould make their own Price.</hi> With this
kind of Stuff ſhe fill'd her Letters, which
were after found in <hi>Forman</hi>'s Cloſet. Theſe
Inſtigations made him active; and the
Man being skilful in Natural Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick,
did uſe all the Artifice his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty
could deviſe, really to imbecili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
the Earl; for no Linnen came near
his Body, that was not rinſed with their
Camphire Compoſitions, and other faint
and waſting Ingredients; and all inward
Applications were foiſted on him by cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
Servants, to leſſen and debilitate
the Seminal Operations: which <hi>Venefici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi>
                        <pb n="175" facs="tcp:0639300101:180"/>
is one great part of Witchcraft, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive
to Nature, and horribly abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
to be practiſed. And this in time
wrought ſuch Effects upon his Perſon,
that he found himſelf unable with her,
tho' ſhe permitted him; yet when he had
been from her ſome reaſonable time, to
renovate his Spirits, by ſhaking off thoſe
Artificial Applications, then his Abilities
made her unwilling and refractory. Tho'
ſome are of Opinion, that he was not
much debilitated, but that ſhe got (by
her virtuous Agents) an Artifice too im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modeſt
to be expreſs'd, to hinder Pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration.
And thus ſhe tormented him,
till he was contented to let her ſteer her
own Courſe, which after run her on
Ground.</p>
                     <p>For coming to <hi>London</hi> next Winter
with this full Sail, loaden with Luſt, ſhe
found the Viſcount much prepar'd for
her; who being at firſt faſten'd on the
Object, Abſence, and all thoſe little Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifices
that miſchievous Women and cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Impoſtures could deviſe, had advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
him as much in his Deſires, as they
had hindred the other. We could
diſpute the Nature of theſe Operations,
how far they are contingent, and how
the Fancy works with them, tho' igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of them, making their Impulſions
more active, being the Sparks that kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:0639300101:181"/>
this combuſtible Matter; for we will
never allow there was any other Diabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical
Means uſed, Nature being ſtrong e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enough
for ſuch a Production; but being
not pertinent to the Story, will leave it,
and follow them that found the Effects of
it, and had Affections ſuitable to it, which
they made uſe of with an unbridled Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite,
yet meeting cloſely in Corners,
(Sin being at firſt ſhame-fac'd) but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
they grew more bold; and every
Hour that the Viſcount could ſteal from
his Royal Maſter, he dedicated it to his
diſloyal Miſtreſs: Being caught in this
Net of Adulation, he becomes a willing
Priſoner; Luſt only getting Liberty to
all Looſeneſs and Licentiouſneſs: Places
of frequent Meetings are daily renew'd;
Perſons fitted for ſuch Practices are em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd;
and when Nature was exhauſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
Art, her ſubtle Imitator, brought in
her Store, to contribute new Spirits,
purchaſed at any rate. All outward A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dornment,
to preſent Beauty in her full
Glory, were not wanting on both ſides,
being Luſt's Fuel, which tended to the
Conſumption of all Reaſon: And among
the reſt, yellow Starch, the Invention
and foil of Jaundice Complexions, with
great cut-work Bands, and Piccadillies,
(a thing that hath ſince loſt the Name)
crouded in and flouriſh'd among us, Mrs.
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:0639300101:182"/>
                        <hi>Turner</hi> being nominated to be the firſt
Contriver, happily in <hi>England,</hi> but the
Original came out from <hi>France</hi>; which
Faſhion and Colour did ſet off their lean
and ſallow Countenances. Thus did the
Viſcount get the Conqueſt of two, the
King, and this Lady, but could not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due
his own luſtful Appetite.</p>
                     <p>However, the King's Affections were
not ſo monopoliz'd, but that his crafty
Servant the Earl of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> had a good
Hole, as well in his Councils as Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure:
And being not well pleas'd to ſee
himſelf bearded by a Youth, new ſtarted
into the Affairs of the World, and moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the Wing of Love, not of Merit,
he caſt out many Miſts before him, to
hinder and damp his Paſſage ſo, that
the Viſcount could not riſe to that Pitch
(during his Life) that he afterwards ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd
at.</p>
                     <p>On the 6th Day of <hi>November,</hi> Death
depriv'd us of the King's eldeſt Son,
Prince <hi>Henry,</hi> a Prince as eminent in No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs
as in Blood, and having a Spirit
too full of Life and Splendor, to be
long ſhrouded in a Cloud of Fleſh.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anno.</hi> 1613. The Viſcount <hi>Rocheſter,</hi>
all this while (tho' plung'd in Luſt) was
held up by the Chin in the Glories of the
Court; and the Prince (that interpoſed
betwixt him and the Beams of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty)
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:0639300101:183"/>
being remov'd, the Earl of <hi>Salis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi>
(another Obſtacle) dying Six Months
after the Prince, in the Way from the
<hi>Bath</hi>; he now took full Poſſeſſion of the
King's Favours alone. He executes the
Place of Principal Secretary, receiving
all Pacquets, and diſpatching Anſwers
without the Knowledge of the King or
Council; or if the King did know, his
Love had hoarded up ſuch a Confidence
in him, as he laid all out upon that Stock.
<hi>Rochester</hi>'s greateſt Aſſiſtant was a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Gentleman, one Sir <hi>Thomas Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi>
by whoſe Compaſs he ſteer'd his
Courſe, who (being a Man of Parts and
Abilities) had wrought upon the Viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
ſo, as not only to keep him in, and
cloſe with the King, but to make him ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of managing the higheſt Affairs, if
he had kept himſelf within the Circle
drawn to his Hand. This Intimacy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
them, ſpake <hi>Overbury,</hi> an Actor in
all his Privacies. And when he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
by the Viſcount his Intention of
Marriage with the Counteſs of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> he
oppos'd it with all the powerful Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
he could uſe: For tho' he might
be ſo active, in his Initiation of Favour
with the Viſcount, to be Aſſiſtant to his
Pleaſures, and for carrying forward ſome
of his dark Contrivances, (thoſe Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries
being always the greateſt Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites)
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:0639300101:184"/>
yet having now gotten good foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in his Affection, and building his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
thereon, his Reaſon might tell him,
there could be nothing more deſtructive
to both their growing Hopes, than to lay
a Foundation upon ſo much publick In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice,
as to marry another Man's Wife,
her Husband living; therefore he paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionately
perſwaded him to caſt his
Thoughts upon a more honourable Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
and not one, whoſe Diſloyalty (in
her preſent Condition) was ſo much
branded with Infamy, that the Marks of
it would be viſible on his Face. But the
Viſcount, bewitched with the Entice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of his Soul-raviſhing Miſtreſs, (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable
of good Counſel) doth not only
call home his Affections from <hi>Overbury,</hi>
that had been long Leiger with him,
(denouncing Enmity) but incites his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
againſt him alſo; who muſtering
up all her Paſſions, with the greateſt A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crimony,
that a Feminine Malice could
deviſe, ſhe never left, till ſhe had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charg'd
all the Vollies of her Rage upon
him. And the better to do it, ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults
with her Uncle, the Earl of <hi>North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ampton,</hi>
aggravating <hi>Overbury</hi>'s Offence,
as tending to the Diſhonour of their
whole Family: That he (a petty Fellow)
ſhould dare to raiſe ſuch Scandals againſt
her Innocency. The Earl of <hi>North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ampton,</hi>
                        <pb n="180" facs="tcp:0639300101:185"/>
that knew of the Endearments
betwixt the Viſcount and his Niece, (ſo
baſe and mercenary was his Spirit)
thought it good Policy to ſtop all Paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
that it might not come into the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Mouth: For being in a Sphere elated
above others, it was a Sin of a high Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption,
for any of an inferior Orb to
move but in its own Place, or meddle with
what is above them. He therefore cloſes
with the Viſcount, (whom in his flattering
Acclamations by Letters, he makes a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Deity) and after ſome Diſpute of the
manner how to be revenged of <hi>Overbury,</hi>
they conclude to diſpatch him by Poiſon,
which could not be done ſo well in a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
way; and therefore they ſubtilly
contrive to exaſperate the King a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him, that being a Priſoner, and
ſhackled by them to a Place, he might
be a more ſettled Mark for their enve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nom'd
Arrows.</p>
                     <p>About the ſame time, the King think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
fit to ſend an Ambaſſador into <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi>
to the Arch-Duke (ſome ſay, into
<hi>France</hi>) the Viſcount recommended Sir
<hi>Thomas Overbury</hi> to the King for that
Service, (extolling his Abilities, and Fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
for the ſame, publickly, that more
Notice might be taken of the Affront) and
the King made choice of him for that
Employment, Which done, the Viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:0639300101:186"/>
(under the Shadow of Friendſhip)
imparts to <hi>Overbury,</hi> what Intentions the
King had towards him; but he thought
it would not be ſo convenient for him to
accept of it, becauſe he ſhould not only
loſe his Converſe and Company by ſuch
an Alienation, (which he highly valued)
but many a fair Opportunity of impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
his Reſpects to him, in ſome better
way of Advancement. <hi>Overbury</hi> had
not been ſo little a Courtier, or a Man of
ſo mean Reaſon, but that he was ſenſible
what Diſpleaſure he ſhould pull upon
himſelf, by refuſing the King's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands:
And therefore he told the Viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
that betwixt the King's Favours,
and his Friendſhip, he had a great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict
in his Spirit, being willing to retain
both; but how he ſhould refuſe the
King's Commands with Safety, he knew
not. But the Viſcount, with fair Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes,
prevail'd with him to ſet up his
Reſt at home, upon higher Expectation,
(ſuch a ſweet Bait is Ambition!) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſting
to take off the Aſperity of the
King's Anger from him, and ſmooth his
Way ſo, as ſhould be for his better Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.
When he had wrought <hi>Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi>
in this Forge, he goes to the King,
and blows the Fire, incenſing him with
all the Aggravations he could; ſo that
the poor Gentleman, for his Contempt
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:0639300101:187"/>
was forthwith committed to the <hi>Tower.</hi>
And to prepare all things for his Recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
there, Sir <hi>William Wade,</hi> the late
Lieutenant, was remov'd, and Sir <hi>Jervis
Ellowis,</hi> a Perſon more ambitious than in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digent
(having made his Way by Mony,
the common Merit) was admitted to the
Place.</p>
                     <p>Now the Counteſs, like another <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecto,</hi>
drove furiouſly, her Chariot ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
two Wheels, which ran over all Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments:
One was, to ſue a Divorce
betwixt her and her Husband, that ſhe
might marry the Viſcount: The other
was, to take away <hi>Overbury,</hi> the Blemiſh
in her Eye, and that laid ſuch a Stain
upon her, that nothing but his Blood
could expiate. For theſe ſhe hath ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Engines; the one muſt be acted O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertly;
the other Covertly, in dark
Corners; and ſhe and her Agents find
fit Miniſters for both.</p>
                     <p>The Earl of <hi>Northampton</hi> reſenting his
Nieces Grievances, makes the King ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with her Maiden Baſhfulneſs,
how loth ſhe is to divulge her Husband's
Infirmities, and how long it is ſince her
Marriage, and yet ſhe hath not enjoyed
the Happineſs of a Wife; that her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band's
Inability muſt needs be an unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Conjunction, ſuch as neither Law
nor Reaſon can admit of; and that there
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:0639300101:188"/>
was a great Affection betwixt the Viſcount
and her, ſo as there ſeem'd to be a more
excellent Sympathy, and ſweet Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
of Soul in them, more ſuitable to
Reaſon and Nature, than in the State
ſhe was in Which was ſeconded by the
Viſcount's humble Submiſſions to the
King's great Wiſdom, who (he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd)
had not only raiſed him to what
he is, but may yet make him more hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,
by uniting him to a Lady of ſo much
Honour and Virtue.</p>
                     <p>The King, that took Delight to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
the Happineſs of them he lov'd,
commanded the Biſhops to ſue out a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce
between the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> and
his Lady, that the Viſcount might
marry her: For he had been practis'd
formerly in <hi>Scotland,</hi> in his Minority,
with the like Experiment. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi>
Daughter to the Earl of <hi>Athol,</hi> being
married to the Earl of <hi>March,</hi> under
pretence of Impotency, but merely for
Luſt, (as the <note n="*" place="bottom">Vid. <hi>Johnſton</hi>'s Hiſt. of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
                        </note> Author reports) was Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorced
from her Husband, and married
to the Earl of <hi>Arran,</hi> (the King's Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite)
who had been before a Partner in
her Adulterous Sheets, (ſo current is the
Parrallel, and ſo equally are Luſt and
Ambition yoked together, that they both
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:0639300101:189"/>
(with full Violence) draw one and the
ſame Way.)</p>
                     <p>The Biſhops and others, having a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
under the Great Seal of <hi>England,</hi>
to convene the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> and his
Counteſs before them, ſent out their
Summons, and they made their Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
accordingly. But before they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded,
they cauſed a Jury of Twelve
diſcreet Matrons to be impanell'd, to
ſearch the Counteſs, whether ſhe were
(as ſhe pretended to be, and was repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted)
a Maid ſtill; for if ſhe were a Maid,
they could faſten upon a Nullity, and ſo
ſeparate them for the more Honour of
her Virginity. The Counteſs being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſham'd,
and baſhful, to come to ſuch a
Trial, would not expoſe her Face to the
Light; but being to appear before the
Matrons under a Veil, another <note n="*" place="bottom">Said to be one of Sir <hi>Thomas Monſon</hi>'s Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, for the Counteſs was reported to have had a Child in the Earl's Abſence.</note> young
Gentlewoman, that had leſs offended,
was fobbed into the Place; and ſhe paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
in the Opinion, both of Jury and
Judges, to be a Virgin.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Biſhops, and the reſt of the
Judges, could not be ignorant what ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous
Reports of this Lady's Actions
flew up and down, from Lip to Lip;
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:0639300101:190"/>
which, however ſweeten'd by the Parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,
carried an ill Savour with them in
every honeſt Underſtanding, who were
not blinded with Wilfulneſs, or deafned
with Prejudice, which made the Biſhops of
<hi>Canterbury,</hi> and <hi>London,</hi> decline the Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
though nominated in the Patent.
But Kings will never want fit Miniſters in
corrupted Times, both in Church and
Commonwealth, as long as there are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
and Places of Aſcent to clime to.
And though theſe Things floated a while
upon the Streams of Greatneſs, yet there
is one above that moves the Waters;
who did not only ſee what paſs'd in the
Biſhop's Palace, but in the cloſeſt Priſon,
which he diſcover'd to the Shame and
Ruin of the Actors.</p>

his Behaviour light, his Carriage un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeemly;
in his Place nothing ſo coſtly; no
Attire ſo uncouth, but at all Coſts and Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
he obtains it for the increaſe of Favour;
new Faſhions are produced, that ſo he
might ſhew more beautiful and fair, and
that his favour and perſonage might be
made manifeſt to the World; and to this

criſped, friſled, ſlicked Skins, open'd Breaſts,</hi>
beyond accuſtomed <hi>modeſty,</hi> with many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
inordinate <hi>Attires,</hi> were worn on both
ſides, to the ſhew of the World; ſo that
for the increaſe of diſhoneſt Appetites,
they were abundantly practiſed; ſurfeiting
thus upon their <hi>Pleaſure,</hi> having been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
accuſtomed unto hardineſs, cauſeth
him to fall into all manner of forgetfulneſs,
letting all Things go to wrack, careleſs in
<hi>Attendance,</hi> neglecting <hi>State Affairs,</hi> igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of his own Worth, ſubjecting himſelf
to the luſtful Appetite of an evil Woman;
accounting no Time well ſpent, nor Hour

Diſcourſes paſs between them, either
in Words or Writing.</p>

Time could no longer conceal theſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
Meetings, but at length the Marriage
of the Viſcount and Counteſs were brought
to light, which when made publick, every
one declaimed againſt her, but extoll'd the
Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi>; however, an Order was
forthwith ſent to him to repay her Portion
of 5000<hi>l,</hi> to do which he was forced to ſell
part of his Eſtate, thereunto willingly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting,
that he might get rid of her. The
King nevertheleſs continues his Favour to
the Viſcount, and inſtall'd him Earl of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſet.</hi>
But at laſt the joint Wickedneſs of
all theſe Accomplices broke out in the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of <hi>Overbury,</hi> upon which occaſion, the
following Letters found in Dr. <hi>Forman</hi>'s
Cloſet after his Death, were produc'd in
Court at Mrs. <hi>Turner</hi>'s Arraignment, by the
Doctor's Widow.</p>

There were alſo ſhewed in Court certain
Pictures of a Man and Woman in Copulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
made in Lead, as alſo the Mould of
Braſs, wherein they were caſt, a black
Scarf alſo full of white Croſſes, which Mrs.
<hi>Turner</hi> had in her Cuſtody; at the ſhewing
of theſe, and inchanted Papers and other
Pictures in Court, there was heard a crack
from the Scaffolds, which cauſed great fear,
tumult, and confuſion among the Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
and throughout the Hall, every one
fearing hurt, as if the Devil had been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
and grown angry to have his Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip
ſhewed, by ſuch as were not his
own Scholars; and this Terror coming, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
a quarter of an Hour after ſilence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed,
the reſt of the cunning Tricks
were likewiſe ſhewed.</p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Forman</hi>'s Wife being Adminiſtratix of
her Husband, found Letters in Packets, by
which much was diſcovered; ſhe was in
Court, and depoſed that Mrs. <hi>Turner</hi> came
to her Houſe immediately after her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band's
Death, and did demand certain Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures
which were in her Husband's Study;
namely, one Picture in Wax, very ſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
apparalled in Silks and Sattins, as alſo
one other ſitting in form of a naked Woman,
ſpreading, and laying forth her Hair in a
Looking-glaſs, which Mrs. <hi>Turner</hi> did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently
affirm to be in a Box, and that ſhe
knew in what part or room of the Study
they were.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="195" facs="tcp:0639300101:200"/>
Mrs. <hi>Forman</hi> further depoſeth, that Mrs.
<hi>Turner</hi> and her Husband would be ſometimes
three or four Hours locked up in his Study
together. She did depoſe further, that her
Husband had a Ring would open like a
Watch.</p>
               <p>There was alſo a Note ſhewed in Court,
made by Dr. <hi>Forman,</hi> and written in Parch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
ſignifying what Ladies loved what
Lords in the Court, but the Lord Chief Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
would not ſuffer it to be read openly in
the Court.</p>
               <p>Mrs. <hi>Turner</hi> ſent <hi>Margaret,</hi> her Maid, to
Mrs. <hi>Forman,</hi> and wiſhed that all ſuch Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
and Papers as concerned the Earl of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſet,</hi>
or the Counteſs of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
great Perſonages, ſhould be burned,
telling her that the Council's Warrant ſhould
come to ſearch the Study, and that all his
Goods might be ſeized; whereupon ſhe and
her Maid <hi>Margaret,</hi> with the Conſent of
Mrs. <hi>Forman,</hi> burnt divers Letters and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
but yet ſhe kept ſome without their
privity.</p>
               <p>There were alſo Inchantments ſhewed in
Court, written in <hi>Parchment,</hi> wherein were
contained all the Names of the Bleſſed Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
mentioned in the Scriptures; and in
another Parchment, + <hi>B.</hi> + <hi>C.</hi> +. <hi>D.</hi> +
<hi>E.</hi> and in a third likewiſe in Parchment were
written all the Names of the Holy Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
as alſo a Figure, in which was written
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:0639300101:201"/>
this word, <hi>Corpus,</hi> and upon the Parchment
was faſtned a little piece of the Skin of a
Man.</p>
               <p>In ſome of theſe Parchments, the Devils
had particular Names, who were conjured
to torment the Lord <hi>Somerſet,</hi> and Sir <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thur
Manwaring,</hi> if their Loves ſhould not
continue, the one to the Counteſs, the other
to Mrs. <hi>Turner.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Finally, Theſe faithful Servants of the
<hi>Devil</hi> obtain'd the due Reward of their
Deeds. Mrs. <hi>Turner</hi> was ſerv'd firſt, who
being found guilty of the barbarous Murder
committed upon Sir <hi>Thomas Overbury,</hi> was
Condemn'd for the ſame, and Hang'd at
<hi>Tyburn</hi> on <hi>Wedneſday, November</hi> 10. 1615.
Sir <hi>Jarvis Ellowis</hi> was likewiſe Hang'd for
the ſame on <hi>Monday, November</hi> the 20th
following. The Viſcount and Counteſs
were likewiſe found guilty of the ſaid Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
for which they were committed to the
<hi>Tower</hi>; and although the King pardon'd
them, they in a ſhort Time pined away
their Lives, dying in the utmoſt Diſgrace.
At this Time my Lord of <hi>Somerſet</hi> little
thought to have been laid in the <hi>Tower,</hi> and
made Heir of <hi>Overbury</hi>'s Bed-chamber;
but by this Courſe we may ſee, That <hi>all
Things are in the Hands of God.</hi>
