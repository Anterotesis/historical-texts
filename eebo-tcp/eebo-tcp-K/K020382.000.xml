            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <q>BY DUE PROCESS OF THE LAW,</q> (and that "WITHOUT DELAY,") is a "COMMON RIGHT," ſo indiſpenſably due to all <hi>innocent Perſons,</hi> that it cannot be ſet aſide, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn from any <hi>that are ſo,</hi> (who demand it,) without <hi>fundamentally ſubverting the political Conſtitution,</hi> or <hi>legal Eſtabliſhment of theſe Kingdoms,</hi> and thereby rendering the Adviſers and Promoters of ſuch a Meaſure <hi>guilty of</hi> HIGH-TREASON!</p>

            <head>TO THE PEOPLE OF ENGLAND.</head>
            <p>COMMON CHARITY will induce us to believe that the advocates for an occaſional <hi>ſuſpenſion</hi> of the <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> laws are not really aware of the dangerous tendency of ſuch a meaſure; and therefore when the author of this Proteſt (in the following pages) charges the adviſers and promoters of the ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion with <q>high-treaſon againſt the king and ſtate,</q> he profeſſes to aim the ſeverity of his cenſure chiefly againſt <hi>the meaſure itſelf,</hi> (in order to expreſs the <hi>real danger</hi> and <hi>malignity</hi> of its ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,) rather than againſt the <hi>perſons</hi> of thoſe men who, inadvertently, or through inattention to the <hi>fundamental</hi> or <hi>indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſable principles of law,</hi> have promoted
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0665701600:3"/>
it: and therefore to <hi>thoſe</hi> perſons, joint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with all the other People of England, (as being equally intereſted with the reſt in the effects of ſuch a meaſure) the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of this Proteſt now addreſſes himſelf, not to promote a ſpirit of vengeance and perſonal reſentment, but merely for the purpoſes of warning and inſtruction to <hi>all parties,</hi> that they may cordially unite in reſtoring the <hi>due limitations</hi> of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, on which depends the common ſafety both of king and people.</p>
            <p>The Advocates for an occaſional <hi>ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion of the law,</hi> perhaps, will alledge, that the new <hi>temporary</hi> powers (whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they may happen to be) which would thereby be thrown into the hands of the perſons intruſted with the adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of government, are by no means intended to take effect againſt <hi>the People of England,</hi> that are reſient <hi>in</hi> this iſland, but only againſt ſuch perſons as
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0665701600:4"/>
have <hi>been guilty of treaſon in foreign parts</hi> (in <hi>America,</hi> let us ſuppoſe, for inſtance) or <hi>on the high ſeas, or for piracy;</hi> and therefore they conceive, that the free inhabitants of this iſland could not be injured by ſo limited a <hi>ſuſpenſion</hi> of the laws, eſpecially if they ſhould admit in their bill an additional clauſe of limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, propoſed even by an oppoſite par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, by way of ſecurity; which we will ſuppoſe to be couched in the following terms, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>That nothing herein is intended, or ſhall be conſtrued, to extend to the caſe of any other priſoner or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners than ſuch as ſhall have <hi>BEEN OUT OF THE REALM AT THE TIME OR TIMES OF THE OFFENCE OR OFFENCES</hi> wherewith he or they ſhall be charged, or of which they ſhall be ſuſpected.</q> Such a clauſe as this ſeems, on a ſlight examination, to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the inhabitants of this iſland from the danger of an <hi>unlimited</hi> power, againſt
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0665701600:5"/>
which all true Engliſhmen ought to be ever upon their guard: but, alas! ſo dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous is it to ſtop the ordinary courſe of <hi>juſtice</hi> and <hi>common right,</hi> or to alter the <hi>"due proceſs of the law,"</hi> in any ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes whatſoever wherein <hi>perſonal liberty</hi> (the higheſt and moſt valuable <hi>temporal</hi> object of Engliſhmen) is concerned, that, if we ſhould <hi>ſuppoſe</hi> the caſe of ſuch a <hi>ſuſpenſion of the laws</hi> as courtiers in general would endeavour to obtain, were they to be intruſted with <hi>the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piling of a bill</hi> for that purpoſe, and then carefully compare the ſaid <hi>ſuppoſed bill</hi> with the abovementioned <hi>clauſe of limitation,</hi> we ſhould ſoon have reaſon to be convinced that the ſecurity of the latter is only <hi>imaginary;</hi> and that mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of his majeſty's <hi>innocent</hi> and <hi>peaceable</hi> ſubjects would be ſtill liable to be oppreſſed, and be denied the benefits of <hi>public juſtice</hi> and <hi>common right,</hi> by ſuch a <hi>ſuſpenſion of law,</hi> if they ſhould happen
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0665701600:6"/>
to incur the diſpleaſure of perſons in power, or be miſrepreſented to them by any ſecret enemy.</p>
            <p>The propoſed clauſe leaves unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected all the nobility, gentry, and other perſons whatſoever, that have made any excurſions into <hi>France, Italy, Germany, Flanders, &amp;c.</hi> or even to <hi>Ireland,</hi> ever ſince the commencement of the troubles (whatever they might be) which occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned an <hi>imaginary neceſſity,</hi> or plea, for SUSPENDING THE LAWS. And this, perhaps, might be extended three or four years back, and might thereby exclude from the protection of the limiting clauſe a great multitude of the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectable people of the kingdom, who might happen to have travelled abroad during ſuch a period. Neither does the clauſe protect the merchants, traders, and other perſons, that have arrived from the Weſt-Indies, Ireland, or any other
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0665701600:7"/>
country, within ſuch a ſuppoſed period. And they are, ſurely, too numerous and reſpectable a body to be thus <hi>outlawed!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Add to this, that all <hi>ſeafaring Perſons without exception</hi> (though they are the moſt valuable ſubjects of this maritime ſtate) would be left unprotected by ſuch a clauſe, and of courſe would be rendered ſubject to the <hi>unlimited</hi> WILL <hi>of man,</hi> (ARBITRIUM <hi>hominis,</hi> which is the true definition of ARBITRARY POWER,) <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead</hi> of LAW! And, laſtly, all other perſons whatſoever are liable to ſuffer the ſame inconveniences, if they have not kept a diary, or have not memory or memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randums, to enable them to produce ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient evidence of their being actually WITHIN THIS REALM at any period of time that might be fixed upon within the laſt three or four years; ſo that not only perſons <q>
                  <hi>ſeized and taken</hi> OUT OF THE REALM</q> would be made liable to
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0665701600:8"/>
the effects of ſuch a <hi>ſuſpending act,</hi> but all the other perſons abovementioned, though they are actually RESIENT WITHIN THE REALM.</p>
            <p>In order to ſtate the caſe for my argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as clearly as I am able, I have here ſuppoſed the adoption of ſuch a <hi>ſuſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bill</hi> as we might naturally conceive to be propoſed by any ſet of men in power, who are warmed by the ſunſhine of court-favour till they forget that their own real intereſt is inſeparably connected with that of the public, and that the increaſe of power, which they promote, may poſſibly fall into ſome other hands than their own. But the hands of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment muſt be ſtrengthened, they would probably ſay; and, for this purpoſe, they would be very apt to inſert in their bill ſome diſcretionary powers to enable the king and his miniſters to impriſon not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſons <q>ſeized and taken out of the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0665701600:9"/>
realm,</q> 
               <hi>but alſo perſons</hi> 
               <q>who ſhall be committed in any part of his majeſty's do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions for the ſaid crimes,</q> I mean, any crimes which I have before ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in ſtating this caſe, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>High-treaſon in any of his majeſty's colonies or plantations in America, or <hi>ON THE HIGH SEAS,</hi>
               </q> 
               <hi>(which will include our own coaſts any where beyond low-water mark,)</hi> 
               <q>or the crime of piracy,</q> without any deſcription or limitation of place whatſoever! So that if any inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent man (who happens not to be able to prove an <hi>alibi</hi> for every day, and even every hour, ſince theſe troubles began) ſhould be maliciouſly <hi>"charged with"</hi> the crime of <hi>treaſon</hi> or <hi>piracy</hi> committed within half a mile of the Britiſh coaſts, he may be ſeized and impriſoned, <q>without bail or mainprize,</q> at the <hi>will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure</hi> of the king and council, for <hi>many months;</hi> and, at the expiration of the <hi>limited</hi> time, (without any farther exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0665701600:10"/>
or opportunity of being heard at all by his country,) his term of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement is prolonged by another <hi>ſuch act,</hi> and perhaps another after that, (as <hi>evil</hi> examples beget others,) till the time of his relief by <q>due proceſs of the law</q> becomes totally <hi>uncertain</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definite!</hi> — A deplorable condition this! which, in our common law, is deemed <hi>"wretched ſlavery;"</hi> — for, <q>Miſera eſt ſervitus</q> 
               <hi>(ſays the maxim)</hi> 
               <q>ubi <hi>JUS</hi> eſt vagum aut incertum.</q> (<hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipia leg. &amp; Aeq. p.</hi> 61.)</p>
            <p>But the condition of the <hi>deluded</hi> ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects will be rendered ſtill more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely <hi>uncertain</hi> and <hi>wretched,</hi> if the compilers of the ſuppoſed ſuſpending act ſhould endeavour to avail themſelves of <hi>vague</hi> terms and expreſſions: — for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, — (in the body of the bill,) — <hi>"Such crimes"</hi> (referring to the crimes particularly named in the former part)
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0665701600:11"/>
inſtead of <hi>"the ſaid crimes:"</hi> — for, as <hi>"Nullum ſimile eſt idem,"</hi> — <q>( LIKE <hi>is not</hi> THE SAME,)</q> — the expreſſion, <hi>"ſuch crimes,"</hi> ſignifies only <hi>ſimilar crimes,</hi> and not <hi>the ſame crimes</hi> before expreſſed, whereby the power of the act would be liable to an arbitrary exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion at the <hi>will</hi> of the magiſtrate!</p>
            <p>Whenever perſons in power ceaſe to be <hi>duly limited</hi> by a free parliament, they will pay but very little regard to the groſſneſs of the propoſitions which they tender to that, <hi>once,</hi> auguſt aſſembly; and therefore, if ſuch an <hi>illegal</hi> power ſhould ever be uſurped by any ſet of men, we may then expect to find many more <hi>vague</hi> expreſſions in our public acts! — We may in that caſe, without improbability, ſuppoſe the penning of a <hi>ſuſpending act</hi> to be — not only <q>for ſuch crimes, <hi>OR ANY</hi> of them,</q> — but alſo <q>for <hi>SUSPICION</hi> of <hi>SUCH
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0665701600:12"/>
 CRIMES,</hi> or any of them, by any ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate,</q> 
               <hi>&amp;c. viz.</hi> any trading ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, penſioned Middleſex juſtice, or other wretched time-ſerver, that may happen to be entruſted with a power of committing to priſon. — And in ſuch times it will afford a ſufficient handle againſt any perſon whatſoever, if they are but <hi>"charged with"</hi> ſuch crimes, whether they be guilty of them or not; or even if they be but <q>
                  <hi>CHARGED WITH</hi>
               </q> the <q>
                  <hi>SUSPICION</hi> of <hi>SUCH</hi> crimes, or any of them, by <hi>ANY</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, </q> 
               <hi>&amp;c.</hi> — Nothing more <hi>arbitrary</hi> or <hi>capricious</hi> can eaſily be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed; and yet, alas! my <hi>ſuppoſed bill</hi> by no means exceeds the bounds of probability; for, when the baneful practice of <hi>bribery</hi> becomes triumphant, and the very foundations of government are thoroughly <hi>corrupted,</hi> we may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that <hi>probability</hi> will ſtill go farther, and that the above <hi>ſuppoſed</hi> extraordinary
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0665701600:13"/>
powers will be farther augmented by a <hi>"non obſtante,"</hi> to trample down at once, not only the <hi>Habeas Corpus Act,</hi> but all the other fences of Britiſh <hi>liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> national <hi>juſtice,</hi> and <hi>common right,</hi> on which the ſafety of Engliſhmen de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends! <hi>viz.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>The clauſe is indeed a common one, for the repeal of uſeleſs or indifferent matters; but, when the effect extends to annul all the laws of <hi>perſonal protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and the <hi>common right</hi> of Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to <hi>"the due proceſs of the law,"</hi> (which is, to be tried <hi>without delay</hi> by their country, <hi>[per legem terrae,]</hi> and, <hi>if innocent,</hi> to be reſtored to freedom,) — ſuch a <hi>ſuſpenſion,</hi> I ſay, of <hi>common juſtice</hi> and <hi>common right</hi> is ſo fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentally ſubverſive of the Britiſh conſtitution of ſtate, that no authority
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0665701600:14"/>
of parliament can make it <hi>legal;</hi> becauſe it it is <hi>high-treaſon</hi> againſt the king and people! and all the abettors and promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of ſuch an act would thereby render themſelves <hi>"eternally infamous"</hi> in the eye of the law! — which is declared by a conſtitutional maxim: — <q>LEGEM TERRAE <hi>amittentes</hi> PERPETUAM IN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FAMIAE NOTAM <hi>inde merito incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt.</hi>
               </q> (3. inſt. p. 221.)— <q> 
                  <hi>Thoſe men, who ſet aſide</hi> THE LAW OF THE LAND,</q> (which is certainly the caſe of thoſe who vote for <hi>ſuſpending</hi> it,) <q>

Some ſtreſs has been laid on the circumſtance in the above caſe, that <hi>"the piece of paper,"</hi> which the preſs-maſters ſhewed to Hugget, &amp;c. <hi>"was not a ſufficient warrant."</hi> This is, indeed, readily allowed; and we may ſafely add, that, if the <hi>lord admiral himſelf</hi> had attended to aſſiſt his <hi>preſs-maſters,</hi> his authority in this caſe would have been as inſignificant as that of any other man; ſince the baneful clauſe of <hi>"Non obſtante ſtatuto"</hi> in the <hi>lord admiral's patent</hi> is declared <hi>null and void:</hi> and, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven if <hi>the king,</hi> at that time, and the <hi>lords of the privy-council</hi> had alſo attended in perſon, with the BEST WARRANT they could make, it would ſtill have been <hi>"an inſufficient warrant"</hi> to juſtify any ſuch vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent attacks upon the liberty of innocent ſubjects! and the ſame <hi>judgement in law</hi> muſt inevitably have been given (ſuppoſing the LAW to be DULY MAIN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TAINED) as in the recited caſe: becauſe the <hi>meaneſt ſubjects</hi> are as much entitled to <hi>the protection of the law</hi> as a king is to <hi>his crown,</hi> and conſequently are <hi>equally</hi> juſtified in defending it, and in reſiſting <hi>unlawful</hi> force with force, according to the <hi>firſt foundation of the Engliſh law</hi> as already recited. For it is a maxim in law, that <hi>"the king can order nothing"</hi> (i. e. nothing of legal proceſs) <q>except by a court legally appointed.</q> 
                  <q> Rex nil poteſt jubere niſi per curiam legitime conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam. </q> Now, as all pretence of <hi>legal power</hi> (in the capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a court of law) is taken from the <hi>king and council</hi> by expreſs act of parliament, it would be abſurd to attribute to their <hi>warrants and orders,</hi> or the <hi>admiralty preſs-warrants,</hi> (which are founded on no other autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,) the leaſt <hi>legal</hi> authority as <hi>"a ſufficient warrant"</hi> to juſtify the <hi>taking</hi> and <hi>impriſoning</hi> any man whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; becauſe they are not, nor cannot be conſidered as, any part of "THE DUE PROCESS OF THE LAW," which alone can juſtify the <hi>taking</hi> and <hi>impriſoning</hi> Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh ſubjects! And, therefore, as <hi>preſs-gangs</hi> (officers as well as men) are manifeſtly employed in an <hi>unlawful</hi> buſineſs, acting WITHOUT LAW, there is no crime in <hi>beating,</hi> or even in <hi>killing,</hi> them, if they cannot other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be repelled, which muſt neceſſarily be deemed a <hi>juſtifiable manſlaughter,</hi> "SE DEFENDENDO;" becauſe it is a maxim, that— <q>where there is <hi>NO LAW</hi> there is no <hi>TRANSGRESSION.</hi>
