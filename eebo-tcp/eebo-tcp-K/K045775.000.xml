            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0206200600:8"/>to human Bodies, as thoſe extraneous Bodies, Vapours, or Effluviums are more or leſs unwholſome and of a different Nature; I ſay, ſince Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Bodies are thus diſpoſed and liable to be ill affected and diſordered by the various Qualities of the Air we breathe, it is not only neceſſary but requiſite we ſhould conſider, the different Qualities of that Air, and what Extraneous Bodies, Vapours, or Effluviums it may be impregnated and endowed with; and what alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations or ill Effects theſe may occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and produce, either at the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, or for the future; and how far they may be prejudicial and perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious to Mankind.</p>
            <p>To determine and enable us to judge of the different Qualities of the Air, and what Extraneous Bodies or Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours it may be Impregnated and Endowed with, we are to conſider, how many Ways it may be furniſhed with ſuch Vapours or Effluviums;
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0206200600:9"/>which muſt be, either from foreign Globes, far diſtant from the Earth we live in, and from the Superficies of our Atmoſphere; from extrane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Bodies, or Vapours emitted or riſing from Bodies on the Superficies of our Globe; or from Vapours and Effluviums tranſuding and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending out of the Bowels of the Earth.</p>
            <p>As for thoſe Globes which are vaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſtant from the Earth we live in, and far remote from the Superficies of our Atmoſphere, theſe are either the Stars, the Moon or the Sun.</p>
            <p>The Stars are ſo many Thouſand Miles diſtant from us, and ſeparated by ſuch a ſpacious and boundleſs Aether or Medium, that we can but juſt perceive the Glimmering rays of thoſe Celeſtial Bodies, which are ſufficient to convince us that there are ſuch Stupendious Effects of an Infinite Power; but they are ſo ſmall,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0206200600:10"/>that they can have but little Effects in altering the Qualities of the Air we Breathe; much leſs are they able to inform us, of the Nature of thoſe diſtarit Globes; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently cannot afford us any know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge what Alterations ſuch can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce; only we may conclude, that where the Cauſes are ſmall and ſcarce perceivable, the Effects muſt be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable; and therefore can do little good, except as Luminaries, or produce not much ill; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently cannot contribute much to pervert it or deprave the Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of our Air or Atmoſphere.</p>
            <p>As for the Moon, though that is much nearer than any of the Stars, yet it is alſo placed at a great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from the Superficies of the Earth, and ſeparated by a vaſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of fine Aether, which interpoſes betwixt that Globe and ours, and prevents it from any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Effects upon the Air we live
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0206200600:11"/>in; and though ſeveral Effects are attributed to it, becauſe the Periods ſeem to keep time with its different Poſitions, yet it is contrary to all known Laws Statical or Hydroſtatical, that it ſhould have any Effect upon any Bodies contained within our At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſphere, as having no immediate contact with terrene Bodies, but only upon that Aether, which equally encompaſſes and compreſſes the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies of our Vortex, and the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Extent of the Globe we live and breathe upon or in; for the Air or Atmoſphere may be properly ſaid to be a part of our Globe though the moſt fluid and rarify'd Superficial covering of Earth and Water, and though Lunaticks, or thoſe Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers which grow worſe at certain periods, ſeem to be equal in diſtance with the ſeveral Poſitions of the Moon, yet it cannot be demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated, that thoſe Effects are owing to it as a Cauſe, ſince other periodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Diſtempers keep an equal diſtance
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0206200600:12"/>betwixt their Periods, which depend upon Cauſes contained within the Limits of our own Bodies; and as for the Ebbing and Flowing of the Sea, that muſt proceed from ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Cauſe, both Statical and Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>droſtatical Rules excluding it any ſhare in theſe different Motions of that fluid Element; but not to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter upon Diſputes of that Nature, which are foreign to our preſent pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, we ſhall only obſerve, that the Beams of the Moon, which illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate our Globe; are only reflected Beams of the Sun tranſmitted into our Atmoſphere, and not the proper Emanations or Effluviums of that Globe; and for as much as the Beams of the Sun reflected from other Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances within our Globe, do not tranſmit to us the Nature of thoſe Bodies they are reflected from, but are only variouſly modifyd and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fracted in the Superficies of thoſe Bodies, which different refractions variouſly affect our Senſory, or the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0206200600:13"/>Organ of Sights, and produce the Senſation of different Colours or Refractions, and which only affect the Senſe of Seeing, as they are ſtronger or weaker: Conſequently we cannot expect, that the Beams of the Sun, reflected from the Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficies of the Moon, ſhould convey to us the Qualities of that Body or Globe, eſpecially ſince they are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe convey'd through ſo fine a Strai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as the interpoſed Aether, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fracted and altered alſo in paſſing through the great and lofty expanded part of our Atmoſphere, which is reckoned, or computed, to be Seven Miles perpendicular in height, boying up a Pillar of Quickſilver in a Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-Glaſs, ſuch a conſiderable height, till it amounts to an Aequilibrium, or equal Weight of a Pillar of Air, of the ſame Diameter and thickneſs, preſſing upon the Baſis, or Bottom of that Pipe the Mercury or Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilver is contained in.</p>
            <pb n="9" facs="tcp:0206200600:14"/>
            <p>As for the Sun, it is evident, that it acts upon all Bodies within our Atmoſphere by Virtue of its Heat, ſince in the Summer time, when it is near enough, it rarifies, expands and digeſts the Superficial Juices of the Earth, as well thoſe in our Bodies, which when fermented, attenuated and rarify'd, are preſſed by the force of the incumbent Atmoſphere in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Roots of Plants and Trees, and riſe higher, as further rarify'd, preſs'd and expanded in the Veſſels of each Plant, which being variouſly fermented and ſtrained through dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Veſſels along with Specifick Juices, are aſſimilated and converted into the proper Juices of thoſe Plants.</p>
            <p>The Sun Beams alſo affect other Bodies on the Superficies of the Earth, and by their active Parts, put the Parts of other Subſtances in Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and cauſes them to emit Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours and Effluviums, which, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their different Natures
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0206200600:15"/>variouſly alter and affect the Air we breathe, and render it more or leſs wholeſome and pernicious, Healthful or Deſtructive: But though the Sun hath ſuch conſiderable Effects upon this Globe, when near us, yet when but a little further off in the Winter, we ſee that it hath little or no apparent Effects upon the Climate we live in; and if ſo ſmall a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference can extinguiſh the obvious Effects of ſo bright a Body as the Sun, we can ſcarce imagin, that the Moon or Stars which are much fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther off and Shine but faintly, ſhould have any conſiderable Effects, or indeed any at all, eſpecially ſince they cannot be perceived.</p>
            <p>It appearing hence, in a great Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, how the Air we breathe may be altered by Foreign Globes far diſtant from our Earth, we are next to conſider how the Air we breathe in may be altered and depraved by Vapours and Effluviums emitted,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0206200600:16"/>and ariſing from the Superficies of the Globe we inhabit, which appears from the vaſt variety of different Subſtances which may be obſerved on the Superficies of the Globe we live upon, which deprave the Natural Temper and Diſpoſition of the Air, and conſequently variouſly affect the Maſs of Humours circulating through the minute and ſmall Veſſels con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in and diſperſed through the Subſtance of the Lungs, ſuch as pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trify'd Bodies, and the conſtant E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manation of Vapours occaſioned by ſtanding Waters, and the unwhole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Stenches which naturally flow from the products of Art, as well as Nature, which more particularly affect thoſe Perſons employed in ſuch Arts, and more immediately exerciſed about them; thus we ſee the ſtrange decay in thoſe Perſons which work in Pot-houſes, Chymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Elaboratories, and other employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, where they are expoſed to unwholeſome Vapours and preternar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0206200600:17"/>Fumes. And theſe are further improved to an ill purpoſe, and grow more pernicious and unwhole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, and deprave the wholeſome Diſpoſiton of the Air, when more forceably put in Action by the united force and heat of the Sun Beams.</p>
            <p>But the greateſt and moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Alteration which the Air receives from the Extraneous mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Vapours and Effluviums, ſeems to be from ſuch as tranſude and aſcend out of the Bowels of the Earth, whether of a Mineral kind or of any other Nature. And as ſuch ſort of Vapours and Effluviums are moſt likely to produce great and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Alterations, ſo cones<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently thoſe Alterations are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably moſt pernicious, and of the worſt conſequence, and apteſt to oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion the worſt of Accidents in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Bodies.</p>
            <pb n="13" facs="tcp:0206200600:18"/>
            <p>From ſuch kind of Vapours dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fervently agitated and put in Action by the nearer approach, or greater diſtance of the Sun, ſeems to ariſe that great variety of Climates, not only in the ſame Latitude, but ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Parts of the Terreſtrial Globe; for accordingly as the Air is variouſly affected with ſuch Effluviums of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent kinds, theſe Vapours being put in Action by the heat of the Sun Beams produce different Effects, and render the Air in ſuch Climates more or leſs wholeſome, pernicious and depraved: Thus Agues are more frequent in <hi>Kent,</hi> and other Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers more common and custom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary in different Parts of the World.</p>
            <p>When by the Conſtant and Cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary tranſmiſſion of particular Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours and Effluviums, any Country is frequently or conſtantly ſubject to ſuch Diſeaſes; theſe Diſtempers are ſaid to be Endemical or proper to that particular Climate; but when
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0206200600:19"/>Contagious or Malignant Diſtempers happen to rage more than commonly or accidentally in any Place, ſuch Diſorders are called Epidemical, or ſpreading at ſome particular Times, ariſing from the accidental Diſcharge and Aſcenſion of particular Vapours out of the Bowels of the Earth at that Time.</p>
            <p>The Temper of the Air in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Climates is alſo altered dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently according to the Quantity as well as Quality of ſuch Vapours, and as the Air is more plentifully or ſparingly impregnated with ſuch pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternatural Vapours, which alſo in the ſame Climates exert themſelves more or leſs vigorouſly according to the different Seaſons of the Year. Thus in Summer time Contagious or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant Diſtempers rage more vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly and univerſally and are leſs Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demical in the Winter.</p>
            <pb n="15" facs="tcp:0206200600:20"/>
            <p>And as the Temper and Diſpoſition of the Air varies according to dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Climates, the various quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities of Mineral Effluviums, and the different Seaſons of the Year; ſo we find a vaſt difference according to the Nature and Qualities of ſuch Mineral Vapours. Some Minerals afford very wholeſome and Salutiferous Steams, whilſt others are dangerous and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious. Thus the Mines in <hi>Cornwall</hi> make the Country wholeſome and healthful, whilſt others produce Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious and Peſtilential Qualities, which render ſuch Countries frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſubject to ſuch Diſtempers.</p>
            <p>Thoſe Mineral Effluviums or Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours which produce Peſtilential Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, are of a moſt pernicious kind, and are attended with very violent and moſt fatal Symptoms, and ſuch are eſteemed, by that moſt Worthy and profound Judge of the Works of Nature, the Honourable <hi>Robert Boyle,</hi> to be of an Arſenical
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0206200600:21"/>kind, producing Effects of the moſt Malignant and Poiſonous Nature, being moſt offenſive and deſtructive to Human Bodies.</p>
            <p>It appearing then from what we have ſaid, that the Temper of the Air, and its moſt Unuſual Qualities, which are likewiſe moſt deſtructive and dangerous, chiefly depend on the Effluviums or Vapours riſing out of the Bowels of the Earth, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we find the Temper and Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of any Climate to vary and differ from what it commonly does in ſuch Climates, we have good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to conclude, that the Air is Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnated with ſome unuſual Efflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viums out of the Bowels of this Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtrial Globe, which being mixed with and diſperſed through the Air produce that uncommon Indiſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition.</p>
            <p>And ſince we are conſtantly obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to breathe the Air we live in, and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0206200600:22"/>to impregnate our Blood with ſuch Heterogeneous and offenſive Particles, which perverting the Courſe of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture may produce ill Effects in human Bodies, we ought to be very careful to guard our ſelves againſt ſuch Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents as may be Deſtructive, and ſo prejudicial to Mankind, and to make uſe of neceſſary precautions to prevent ſuch ill Accidents, as ſuch Inconveniencies may render us liable to.</p>
            <p>It cannot be out of our Memory what fatal Conſequences have lately happened Abroad, eſpecially in the South Parts of <hi>France;</hi> and how many Thouſands have been deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the fatal Effects of an ill diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed Temper of the Air, ſo Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal and Epidemical. And as other Parts of the World may be likely to ſuffer by Accidents, and may be liable to the ſame approaching Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, by hidden Vapours and Efflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viums tranſmitted from the inward
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0206200600:23"/>Parts of the Earth, and by Mineral Effluviums of a Malignant kind; whenever we find any unuſual Quality in the Air, we have a great deal of Reaſon to be afraid of ſome unuſual Accidents, and to make uſe of all neceſſary precautions to prevent them. If ſuch ill and Malignant Qualities ſhould be convey'd from the inward Parts of the Earth into our Atmoſphere, ſuch cautionary Preparations would arm us the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter againſt their ill Effects; and tho' no ſuch danger, as we might juſtly fear, ſhould happen, yet at leaſt we ſhould reap this advantage by our jealous ſurmiſes, that we ſhould free our Bodies of ill diſpoſed Humours, and put our ſelves in a better State and Condition of Health; ſo that our Labour would not be ill beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and fruitleſs, nor our Pains ill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded; the juſt Cautions to arm our ſelves againſt the greateſt of Dangers, would at leaſt ſecure us againſt leſs Evils.</p>
            <pb n="19" facs="tcp:0206200600:24"/>
            <p>And that at the preſent, we have very probable Grounds and ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Reaſons to fear ſome impending Evil, and future Danger, which may too ſuddenly happen in our Climate, and conſequently we ought to make uſe of proper Methods to prevent ſuch Events, will in a great meaſure appear, if we conſider the Steps arid Progreſs of Malignant or Peſtilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Diſtempers in former Times, and alſo the Intemperies of our Climate for ſome time paſt, and at the preſent time; which may give us ſufficient grounds to ſuſpect the conſequential Intemperature of the Air for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or time to come.</p>
            <p>As for the Steps and Progreſs of Malignant or Peſtilential Diſtempers, formerly it hath been obſerved, that the Peſtilence took its Courſe ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively through ſeveral Parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> beginning firſt in <hi>Aſia,</hi> and then runing through <hi>Italy, Germany, Denmark, Sweden, England,</hi> &amp;c. In
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0206200600:25"/>
               <hi>Turkey</hi> it is Endemical, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly appears every Year; but this in a great meaſure depends on the exceſſive Heats of the Climate, and their way of living; their Blood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too much phlegmated to ſupport and ſupply a ſufficient Diaphoreſis or Swear, in the Time of exceſſive Heat, and this is, in a great meaſure, occaſioned by their Abſtinence, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s Laws, from Spiritous Liquors, which might ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently attenuate the Serum of the Blood, and render it apt for Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration, ſo that when the Maſs of Humours begin to be fermented with Hear, the phlegmatick Parts of the whole are too great in Quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and too groſs in Quality to be diſcharged according to the ordinary Courſe of Nature.</p>
            <p>But it appear'd lately in <hi>France</hi> without any Mask or Excuſe to hide the Evident Cauſe of its Malignancy, it plainly appearing to proceed from
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0206200600:26"/>Contagious Parts of Matter diſperſed through the Air, which, from what hath been ſaid, appear to be ſupply'd by Subterraneous Mineral Effluviums, or Vapours, proceeding out of the Bowels of the Earth, Which God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty preſerve us from!</p>
            <p>But it is too much to be feared, that ſome Heterogeneous Particles, or Malignant Vapours and Effluviums have, and are, too much diſperſed through our Atmoſphere, or the Air which we now breathe in our Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate; and this will appear too likely, if we obſerve, that near the whole Twelve Months laſt paſt, the Nitrous Parts of the Air have almoſt been to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally overpower'd, and hindered from producing their Natural Effects as uſual in this Climate: For we may obſerve, that moſt of the laſt Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer was not only hot and dry, but that moſt of the laſt Winter ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared more like Summer than Winter Weather, there being little
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0206200600:27"/>appearance of either Froſt or Snow, to what is uſual in this Climate; and we at the preſent find, that the Heat of the Weather hath ſome time exceeded what it hath for ſeveral Years laſt paſt, which if it ſhould encreaſe proportionally, as the Sun ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, it muſt render the hotteſt Seaſon of the Year exceſſively ſo; and conſequently muſt produce ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Malignant Diſtempers, if not Peſtilential.</p>
            <p>And that we may reaſonably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that ſuch Intemperatures of the Air proceed from Subterraneous Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours, or Effluviums, which not only over-power the Nitrous Parts of the Air, but are put and excited into a preternatural Fermentation by the heat of the Sun; I ſay, we may reaſonably deduce this Concluſion, ſince the Sun would have its conſtant and certain effect at the ſame Diſtance, and conſequently, that the Differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces muſt proceed from ſome Hetero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geneous
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0206200600:28"/>Particles, which concur to produce ſuch Alterations and Differences in the Natural Diſpoſition of the Air in one Climate.</p>
            <p>And that the Air is too much Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnated with ſome Heterogeneous Vapours, is evident from the Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies which have lately afflicted ſeveral Perſons, as particular Feveriſh Heats and Indiſpoſitions, attended with Pains in the Head and dizzineſs, and other Symptoms much different from thoſe which appear in Phthiſis or any uſual Diſtempers.</p>
            <p>If then, as we may well conclude, or, at leaſt ſuſpect, the Air we breathe, is impregnated with Heterogeneous Particles, as it ſeems to appear, not only from what we have mentioned, but the ſudden and ſurpriſing Death of ſeveral Perſons, especially of lare, ſince we continually ſuch in, and imbibe theſe Heterogeneous Particles into our Blood in Reſpiration, it
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0206200600:29"/>ſeems worth our while to conſider what Methods are proper to prevent their ill Effects, it either it ſhould happen, that the Air ſhould be more plentifully impregnated with ſuch Particles, or by long breathing them into our Lungs, the Maſs of Blood ſhould be more ſtrongly impregnated with them, ſo as to enable them to produce their ill Effects more vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly.</p>
            <p>In order to aſſign proper Methods to this purpoſe, it will be requiſite to conſider, what Cauſes commonly concur to produce Malignant Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lential Diſtempers, front whence it will appear, what Methods may be proper and moſt expedient to prevent ſuch Maladies, and to ſecure Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind from ſuch Dangers as may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, without the over-ruling hand of Providence to divert ſuch pernicious Qualities which may be more plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully emitted out of the Bowels of
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0206200600:30"/>the Earth, and diſperſed through the infected Air we breathe in.</p>
            <p>And, firſt, From what hath been ſaid, it appears ſufficiently, that the Antecedent Cauſe of Malignant or Peſtilential Diſtempers depends on, and is compoſed of extraneous ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant Mineral Vapours, or Exhala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions riſing out of the Bowels of the Earth and Impregnating the Air we breathe with pernicious Particles.</p>
            <p>Theſe Mineral Effluviums or Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours, Firſt and Primarily affect Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Bodies, and being ſucked into the Lungs in Breathing gradually im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnate the whole Maſs of Blood with their Poiſonous Steams.</p>
            <p>Theſe Poiſonous Particles of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Vapours, at the firſt are ſo ſmall in quantity, that they are not able to produce any ill Effects, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lodged and harboured amongſt the more Phlegmatick and groſs Parts
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0206200600:31"/>of the Animal Humours; but being gradually collected to a greater quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity they exert themſelves more powerfully, and the groſs Parts of the Blood being attenuated and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiliſed by their corroſive Qualities, or at leaſt ſome part of them, they are no longer able to cloak and skreen them from ſhewing their corroſive Qualities.</p>
            <p>The Maſs of Blood being thus gradually more ſtrongly impregnated with theſe depraved and Heteroge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous Particles, and ſome Parts of the Maſs of Humours attenuated by their corroſive Qualities, they begin to diſcover thoſe Qualities; run them into a more fluid form by their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſive Faculty, and ſeparating them from the reſt, the perfect Mixture of the Maſs of Humours is by this means broke, and made an imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected Mixture, the groſſer Parts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing caſt off and ſeparated from the thinner, and by this means rendered
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0206200600:32"/>unapt and unfit for Circulation; the groſſer Parts occaſion Obſtructions in the ſmall and minuteſt Veſſels, whilſt the more thin and corroſive corrode and deſtroy the continuity of the Veſſels, whoſe joint Effects make ſuch a ſad Cataſtrophe in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Bodies, and putting the whole fabrick into diſorder, produce thoſe ill Symptoms in Peſtilential and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignat Diſtempers; as Tumours, Ulcers, Inflammations, Deliriums, Mortifications and Death: In the Glandulous Parts they produce Buboes, in the fleſhy Pares Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buncles and Blotches, in the Nervous Parts, eſpecially the Membranes of the Brain, Inflammation, Delirium and Phrenſy, in the Glandulous Parts of the Brain, and other noble Parts, violent Symptoms and ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Death.</p>
            <p>Theſe Malignant and Peſtilential Diſtempers being thus formed, and the Blood ſtrongly Impregnated with
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0206200600:33"/>deſtructive Vapours as well as the Air, the Diſtemper begins to be more contagious and ſpreading; the ill Effluviums heaped up in human Bodies now exerting themſelves powerfully, and breaking out of thoſe Repoſitories, unite with thoſe contained in the Air, and more ſtrongly affect thoſe Perſons about them; and thus the Infection is ſpread and promoted Secondarily, theſe Effluviums from human Bodies u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niting with thoſe contained in the Air, and thoſe already collected in the Maſs of Blood.</p>
            <p>But beſides theſe Primary and Secundary Antecedent Cauſes to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce Malignant and Peſtilential Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers, there are other acceſſory and Concurring Cauſes requiſite; for ſince all are not equally ſubject to them, but ſeveral continue a long time amongſt ſuch Perſons without prejudice, till at the laſt their Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions are gradually depraved and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0206200600:34"/>more ſtrongly affected with the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemous Exhalations.</p>
            <p>This Acceſſory concurring Cauſe, muſt be a particular Diſpoſition in the Blood, to retain, and be affected by theſe Infectious Vapours or Efflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viums of the Earth, and human Bodies; otherwiſe all People would be equally ſubject to be Infected at the ſame time. To diſcover this Diſpoſition, we are to conſider, that whatever is contained in the Maſs of Blood, as long as is thin enough to circulate through the Veſſels, there is no danger of Obſtruction, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently there can no, damage happen, except it be too thin, and corroſive, and opening the Extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, or otherwiſe corroding and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying the Continuity of the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels occaſions an Extravaſation; but even to produce that Effect, the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours muſt be very ſharp before they can break the Veſſels, as long as they circulate freely, ſince they ſtay not
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0206200600:35"/>long enough in any Part to produce that Effect, and therefore we may well conclude that there muſt be Viſcocity alſo in the Blood, and that thoſe viſcous Parts being either too thick to circulate, or ſeparate from the reſt, firſt cauſe an Obſtruction and detain theſe corroſive Humours, the perfect Mixture of the Blood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing firſt broke and deſtroy'd by thoſe Contagious Parts.</p>
            <p>Indeed when the Veſſels are too much crouded and extended with Humours, as in Plethorick Bodies, Corroſive Particles crouded and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled by the force of Circulation into the ſmall Pores of the Veſſels, may too much extend them and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to ſeparate and divide the continuity of their Parts; but ſince there is Naturally a Viſcocity in the Blood and Serum, and this may be, and frequently is too great; this u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited with thoſe Corroſive Qualities, and retaining them, will give them
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0206200600:36"/>a greater opportunity of Corroſion. Thus a Viſcous Phlegm retaining a ſharp Humour upon the Top of the Stomach or Ventricle, where there is a plentiful Diſtribution of Nerves, cauſes a corroding Pain at the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, called Heart-burn; and in the Membranes, about the Muſculous Parts, occaſions Rheu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick Pains, eſpecially where they are moſt Senſible and incapable of Extenſion; and the Membranes of the Joints corroded with a ſharp or Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtere Viſcous Matter produce thoſe exceſſive Pains of the Gout, where the Obſtruction ſo much retains thoſe ſharp Humours that they corrode the Veſſels in pieces, and occaſion ſuch an extravaſation of this Viſcous Matter as to produce and form Nodes.</p>
            <p>From hence it plainly appearing that a prediſpoſition in the Blood is an accerſſory concurring Cauſe, and that this prediſpoſed Humour, is a
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0206200600:37"/>Viſcous groſs Humour, which retains and heaps up the Contagious Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of the Air we imbibe, and draw in with our Breath, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently follows, that the Conjunct Cauſe, or Matter of the Diſeaſe is, Contagious Particles lodged firſt in a Viſcous Humour, which was an acceſſory Antecedent Cauſe, and diſengaged or ſeparated from the ſharp Humour, and cauſing Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, becomes along with that ſharp Contagious Humour, a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junct Cauſe, and both together make up the Material Cauſe, or the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bifick Matter of the Diſorder and Diſtemper, which according to the Degrees, produces more Malignant Diſeaſes, and when abounding in an extraordinary! degree, even the Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, which is ſo obnoxious and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal to Mankind.</p>
            <p>And that a Viſcous Matter, along with the Contagious Particles, is the Conjunct Cauſe, and produces Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0206200600:38"/>and Peſtilential Diſtempers, is evident from hence, ſince all Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are not equally ſubject to ſuch Diſtempers, and ſome never have any at all, though they live in a Contagious Air, and amongſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected Perſons; and that a Viſcous prediſpoſition of Blood is neceſſary as a concurring Cauſe is manifeſt; for as long as the Humours are ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently attenuated, though ſharp corroſive Particles are imbibed into the Blood, and mixed with it in Reſpiration, they are ſoon diſcharged and ſeparated from it again, by the common Emunctories and diſcharges of Nature, as by Sweat, Tranſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, Urine or Stool, before they can have any time or power to alter and corrupt the Blood by deſtroying its Texture and Mixture, for the conſtant Agitation and Circulation of the Blood preſerves its Mixture along time when kept in perpetual Motion; but when the Blood is too thick it retains a greater Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0206200600:39"/>hinders the Natural Diſcharge, and conſequently tends to heap up Infectious Particles.</p>
            <p>Beſides, when the Blood abounds with Viſcous Parts, it produces a larger Diſcharge or Separation of Phlegmatick Parts, when its Texture and Mixture is imperfect, which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion Obſtructions, and concur to produce Malignant Symptoms, when thrown Critically upon the minute Veſſels or Glands of any Part.</p>
            <p>When any ſuch Critical Diſcharge is made, and a Malignant or Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lential Diſtemper is formed, and properly in <hi>eſſe</hi> or <hi>factu,</hi> that is, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly formed, the Antecedent, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junct and Acceſſory Cauſes along with the Symptoms produced, make up the formal Cauſe, which is the Diſeaſe and its Symptoms.</p>
            <p>But to compleat this, there is one Cauſe acceſſory, which is the Proca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tartick
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0206200600:40"/>Cauſe, or that which puts the Antecedent Cauſes in Action; as any ſudden Paſſion of the Mind, and the ill uſe of Non-Naturals, or the force of Imagination; but that which is chiefly ſo and External, is the approaching Heat and Activity of the Sun Beams, which put thoſe Contagious Effluviums, Vapours or Exhalations, in Action more briskly, by encreaſing the Degrees of Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation or Digeſtion, the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of which we may juſtly fear and dread; for if ſuch Conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Effluviums are in the Air, and ſhould encreaſe, it may reaſonably be feared, that Contagious Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers may happen more or leſs Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant, if not Peſtilential, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Degrees of the Primary Antecedent Cauſe, <hi>Viz.</hi> Extraneous Mineral Exhalations, Vapours or Effluviums, from which God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, or Art, muſt preſerve us, if they ſhould by the courſe of Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Cauſes break forth.</p>
            <pb n="36" facs="tcp:0206200600:41"/>
            <p>From what hath been ſaid, it appears what juſt cauſe we have to dread the ill Conſequences of Contagious Vapours, which we may too reaſonably ſuſpect. It may therefore be requiſite to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, what Methods are moſt proper to prevent and avert the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, and Conſequences of ſuch dreadful Cauſes; which may eaſily be deduced from what hath been ſaid: For if Contagious Vapours are retained by a Viſcous Indiſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of Blood, and ſharp Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſive Humours or Vapours, col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected and run into a Fluor, deſtroy the Texture and Mixture of the Blood, and by this Means produce the Symptoms of Malignant or Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lential Diſtempers, the proper In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions to prevent ſuch Accidents, muſt be to Correct and Diſcharge that Viſcous Matter which retains Contagious Vapours, as well as to correct and prevent the ill Effects of thoſe Infectious Effluviums; it being
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0206200600:42"/>impoſſible either to prevent Mineral Exhalations, which is the Primary Antecedent Cauſe, or to hinder and obſtruct the Sun's approach, which is the Principal Procatartick Cauſe, though ſometimes the Antecedent Cauſe, when encreaſed to a great Degree, and plentifully heaped up, may alſo be a Procatartick Cauſe, and put it ſelf in Action.</p>
            <p>Since then the Principal Intentions to prevent Malignant or Peſtilential Diſtempers are to remove the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Indiſpoſition, which retains Contagious Vapours, and to correct thoſe Vapours, or Malignant Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles which deſtroy the Texture of the Blood, and produce ſuch fatal Conſequences, we are to conſider what is moſt reaſonable to be done.</p>
            <p>As for the Air, it is of ſuch vaſt Extent, and the Superficies of the Earth ſo large, that it will be hard to deal with ſo extenſive a Subject
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0206200600:43"/>Phyſically, but in the Compaſs of a human Body we may be more likely to deal with them.</p>
            <p>As for the Prediſpoſition of the Blood which renders human Bodies moſt likely to retain them, and to heap up Contagious Particles, ſince that is a Viſcous Humour, it is obvious to thoſe who have taken Pains in Phyſick, what Intentions are requiſite to that purpoſe; as Bleeding and Purging, for Bleeding emptying the Veſſels makes room for Fluids to dilute and thin the reſt, and Purging diſcharges a groſſer Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour than paſſes off by any other Natural way, which Nature makes uſe of.</p>
            <p>And to correct thoſe Contagious Vapours which may already be heaped up in the Blood, or may hereafter be contracted, ſince they wou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

               </gap>uct them, without
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0206200600:44"/>deſtroying the Texture of the Blood, ſince thin Humours flow beſt off by Diaphoreſis, or through the Pores of the Skin, when the groſs Humours are removed by Bleeding and Purge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Alexipharmick Diaphoreticks, ſeem moſt proper for that purpoſe, which may correct thoſe Malignant Vapours and diſcharge them, and conſequently preſerve the Texture and due Mixture of the Blood, and prevent thoſe Malignant and fatal Conſequences.</p>
            <p>As for particular forms for this purpoſe, I need not direct Phyſicians, they being able to preſcribe for themſelves; but every Body not being Phyſicians, or able, or willing to employ them, as too expenſive, I ſhall recommend ſome Medicines convenient for that purpoſe, to the uſe of thoſe who think it worth their while to preſerve their Health, and guard themſelves from future ill Conſequences.</p>

            <p>And, as I ſaid before, it may not be amiſs to purſue ſuch meaſures, for they will at leaſt have this advantage, that if Peſtilential Diſtempers hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen not; they will ſtill guard them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from the Dangers of Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Diſtempers, which will be worth their while, and reward their Care of their Health, and preſeve a good Conſtitution.</p>
            <p>Indeed for the ſake of thoſe who cannot afford to imploy a Phyſician I ſhould have laid down forms for their uſe, that they might apply themſelves to Apothecaries, but ſome of them are too apt to adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Medicines, and leave out any Ingredients that are dear, though moſt uſeful and neceſſary; beſides in the ſeveral Books I have already writ, I have been ſo free that way, that ſeveral, though they have made uſe of them to their Advantage, yet they have not had the Civility to acknowledge the freedom, in a way
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0206200600:46"/>cuſtomary to thoſe who have been educated in Phyſick, though it hath been the whole buſineſs and ſtudy of my Life, ſince I left School Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
            <p>If therefore any one ſhall think it worth their while to take care of their Health, and guard themſelves from future ill Conſequences, after Bleeding to attenuate the Humours, to diſcharge the Viſcous Humour, though I hate any thing that looks like common Quackery, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the Art of Phyſick was built upon it, I ſhall recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend particular Medicines for that purpoſe already prepared, with Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections for their Uſe. Yet if any ſhall apply themſelves to me for Adviſe, I ſhall not ſcruple to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe, let them make uſe of who they pleaſe. But to proceed from this accidental Digreſſion.</p>
            <p>The propereſt Purge which I ſhould recommend upon this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, is Dr. <hi>Sagittary</hi>'s Elixir, a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0206200600:47"/>of Excellent Uſe, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging obnoxious Humours with a great deal of Safety. This ought to be taken once or twice a Week, working gently, and by making a gradual diſcharge without too much force upon Nature, and therefore moſt agreeable to human Bodies; I have no Intereſt in recommending this Excellent Medicine, but only the good of Mankind.</p>
            <p>Thoſe Days which are free from Purging, they may take an <hi>Anti-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant</hi> and <hi>Antipeſtilential Tincture,</hi> which will correct thoſe Contagious Vapours, and expel them out of the Blood, gently through the Pores of the Skin, without the trouble or force of immoderate Sweat, or any ſenſible ſweating at all, taking a Spoonful every Morning, and at Night going to Bed, in a Glaſs of Wine and Water, or Wine only, or in Beer, if any ſhall like it ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <pb n="43" facs="tcp:0206200600:48"/>
            <p>It alſo preſerves the due Mixture and Craſis of the Maſs of Blood and Humours, preſerving human Bodies from Contagious Infection, whether from thoſe more Malignant or Peſtilential Effluviums, or Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours diſperſed through the Air, from the Superficial or Subter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raneous Parts of the Earth, or from the Bodies of Infected Perſons.</p>

            <p>It will likewiſe, if frequently mad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ood of ſo wholeſome a Diſpoſition, by clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0206200600:49"/>it of its Impurities, that if it does not totally prevent them, yet it will render them leſs virulent, or much milder and leſs dangerous, and prevent the unneceſſary hazard and danger of Inoculation, a new con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived Practiſe which only foreſtalls future by preſent Sickneſs, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtens on that Inconveniency which would be effected or happen at a greater diſtance of Time, or perhaps not at all.</p>
            <p>And that the Small-Pox depends on a particular Diſpoſition of the Air, which deſtroys the due mixture of the Maſs of Blood, and makes an Alteration in its Texture is very evident, ſince we ſee, that this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe is often times Epidemical, and rages more univerſally at one time than another.</p>
            <p>And that the Diſpoſition of the Air, in this Caſe, deſtroys the Tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Blood, appears from the Symptoms of it, for we ſee, that the groſſer Particles of the Blood, in
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0206200600:50"/>that Diſeaſe, are not only ſeparated from the reſt, but that they are cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically caſt off in the Glands of the Skin; which evidently appears, ſince as the Air is impregnated with par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Vapours, milder, or more ſharp and biteing, the Pox are of a benign kind, or Corroſive, and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion Pits, or Exulcerations which leave disfiguring Marks behind them.</p>
            <p>But in this Diſtemper there is not only a depraved Indiſpoſition in the Air, but likewiſe a Prediſpoſition in the Maſs of Humours is requiſite which from the Symptoms appears to be Viſcous, and to depend per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps on the faults of Digeſtion, and Crudities thus congeſted in their Infancy, but this we have not time or room to conſider thoroughly.</p>
            <p>I ſhall only add, that to prevent this Diſtemper the Purgeing Elixir may be uſed once a Week, and the Tincture before-mentioned thoſe Days that are free from Purgeing, and for ſome time after, which are alſo
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0206200600:51"/>frequently to be repeated; the Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity to be proportioned according to the Perſon's Age, Directions for which will be given along with that Tincture.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Of the Differences of Contagious Vapours.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Since in the foregoing Sheets we have taken Notice, that Malignant and Contagious Diſtempers depend on, and are occaſioned by pernicious Vapours and Exhalations riſing out of the Bowels or the Superficial Parts of the Earth, impregnating the Air we breathe, and acting upon Bodies pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>indiſpoſed, and furniſhed with Viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous depraved Humours; we ſhall briefly add ſomething of the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of thoſe Contagious Vapours and Exhalations which produce theſe different Effects; the Effects varying, as we before took notice, according to the variety of the Cauſes.</p>
            <p>And firſt Watry Exhalations ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Air thick and moiſt, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to Athmatick Perſons, and thoſe that have moiſt Lungs; theſe
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0206200600:52"/>with Nitrous acid Effluviums occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Agues, The Famous Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> Obſerving that a particular Acid mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a Volatile, produces a Cold Effervency; In the Small-Pox, the Mixture of the Blood is Broke by Vitriolick Vapours or Effluviums, which appears from the Curdling Effects, which produce Tumours in the Skin, and alſo from the Nauſeous Smell attending that Diſeaſe. Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Fevers depend on a higher degree of corroſive Mineral Salts, producing a higher degree of Crudities, and much more than Nature can digeſt; throw off or diſcharge. In Peſtilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Diſtempers the Effluviums are of a more Malignant kind, and rather of an Arſenical Nature, producing Symptoms of a proportionable De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Malignancy and more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious.</p>
            <p>How theſe Malignant Effects may be prevented, we have already obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and where this Tincture may be had, I ſhall annex by way of Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
