            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>WHEN we undertake to clear up the hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of an animal, our firſt buſineſs is to examine, with a critical eye, the various names which it has received in different lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, and at different times; and to endeavour, as much as poſſible, to diſtinguiſh the ſeveral ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies to which theſe have been applied. This is the only way of reaping benefit from the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge acquired by the ancients, and of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necting it uſefully with the diſcoveries of the moderns; and conſequently, the only way of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:1084500102:9"/>
making real progreſs in Natural Hiſtory. For how could, I ſhall not ſay one man, but a whole generation, or even a ſucceſſion of generations, complete the hiſtory of a ſingle animal? Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all animals fear man and fly from him. The character of ſupremacy, which the Moſt High has ſtamped on his brow, inſpires them with terror rather than reſpect. They ſhrink from his eye; they ſuſpect his ſnares, and they dread his arms. Even thoſe that are able to defend themſelves by their ſtrength, or reſiſt an attack by their bulk, retire in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to deſerts for which we diſdain to contend, or entrench in the faſtneſſes of impenetrable foreſts. The ſmall animals, ſecure in eſcaping our vigilance by their diminutive ſize, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boldened by their weakneſs itſelf, live in the midſt of us, in ſpite of our endeavours to extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate them, feed at our expence, and ſometimes even prey on our own ſubſtance, though not on that account better known. Among the great number of intermediate claſſes included between theſe two extremes, ſome dig for themſelves ſubterraneous retreats, ſome plunge into the depths of the ocean, others diſappear in the aërial expanſe, but all of them fly from the tyrant of Nature. How then is it poſſible, in a ſhort ſpace of time to view all the animals in all the ſituations neceſſary for diſcovering com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely their inſtincts, their diſpoſitions, their habits, and in a word, the principal facts of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:1084500102:10"/>
their hiſtory. It is well to collect at great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence numerous ſeries of theſe animals, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve carefully their external coat, to add their ſkeletons artfully combined, to give each indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual its proper attitude and native air, but all this only repreſents the ſurface of nature dead and inanimate. If ſome monarch would adopt the truly grand idea, of contributing to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of this beautiful part of ſcience, by forming vaſt collections, and aſſembling, under the eyes of obſervers, a great number of living ſpecies, we ſhould ſtill acquire but imperfect ideas. Moſt animals, intimidated by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of man, teaſed with his obſervations, and further tormented by the uneaſineſs inſeparable from captivity, would exhibit manners that are altered, conſtrained, and hardly worthy the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of a philoſopher, who admires Nature only when free, independent, or even wild.</p>
               <p>To ſtudy animals with accuracy then, we ought to obſerve them in the ſavage ſtate, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company them into the retreats which they have choſen for themſelves, to follow them into the deep caverns, to attend them on the frightful precipices, where they enjoy unbounded liberty. Nor ſhould we be perceived by them while we contemplate their habits; for the eye of an obſerver, if not concealed from their view, would, in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, diſconcert their motions. But there are few animals, eſpecially of the winged tribe, that
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:1084500102:11"/>
can be thus ſurveyed: it requires a ſucceſſion of ages, and innumerable fortunate occurrences, to aſcertain all the neceſſary facts; and it needs the cloſeſt attention to refer each obſervation to its proper ſubject, and conſequently to avoid the confuſion of names. Without theſe precautions the moſt profound ignorance ſhould be preferred to a pretended ſcience, which at bottom is but a web of uncertainty and error. The Great Buſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tard is a ſtriking inſtance. The Greeks named it <hi>Otis</hi>; and Ariſtotle mentions it by this name in three places<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <bibl>Hiſt. Anim. lib. ii. 17.; lib. v. 6.; lib. ix. 33.</bibl>
                  </note>; and his deſcription perfectly agrees with our Great Buſtard. But the Latins, deceived probably by the reſemblance of the words, confounded it with <hi>otus,</hi> which is a noc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnal bird. Pliny, after properly ſaying that the bird named <hi>otis</hi> by the Greeks, is called <hi>avis tarda</hi> in Spain, which character applies to the Great Buſtard, ſubjoins, that its fleſh has a rank taſte<note n="†" place="bottom">Pliny's words are: <q rend="inline">Proximae eis ſunt, quas Hiſpania aves tardas appellat, Graecia otidas, damnatas cibis. Emiſſa enim oſſibus medulla, odoris taedium ſequitur.</q> Next to theſe (he was ſpeaking of the black grous) we may rank what are termed in Spain the <hi>ſlow birds,</hi> and in Greece, the <hi>otides,</hi> which are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected as food; for as ſoon as the marrow is detached from the bones, a loathſome ſmell is exhaled. <bibl>Lib. x. 22.</bibl>
                  </note>, which agrees with the <hi>otus,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Ariſtotle and
to fact, but has no reference to the Great Buſtard; and this miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take can
be the more eaſily ſuppoſed, ſince <pb n="5" facs="tcp:1084500102:12"/> Pliny, in the
following chapter, evidently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founds the <hi>otis</hi> with the
<hi>otus</hi>; that is, the Great Buſtard with the Eared Owl.</p>
               <p>Alexander the Myndian, as quoted by Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <bibl>Hiſt. Nat. lib. ix.</bibl>
                  </note>, falls into the ſame error, aſcribing to the <hi>otus</hi> or <hi>otis,</hi> which he takes for the ſame individual bird, the circumſtance of having hairy feet; which is true of the <hi>otus,</hi> or eared owl; in which, as in moſt of the nocturnal birds, the legs and feet are covered with hair, or rather clothed to the nails with feathers, that are parted into threads; and not to the <hi>otis,</hi> which is our Great Buſtard; and in which, not only the foot, but the lower part of the leg, immediately over the tarſus, is quite bare.</p>
               <p>Sigiſmundus Gelenius, having found in Heſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chius the name of <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

               </p>
               <p>Schwenckfeld pretends that the <hi>tetrix,</hi> noticed by Ariſtotle<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <bibl>Hiſt. Anim. lib. vi. 1.</bibl>
                  </note>, and which was the <hi>ourax</hi> of the Athenians, is alſo our Great Buſtard. But what little Ariſtotle mentions with reſpect to the <hi>te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix,</hi> does not apply to the Great Buſtard. The <hi>tetrix</hi> builds its neſt among low plants, and the Great Buſtard among growing corn; which Ariſtotle probably did not mean to include in the general expreſſion, "low plants." Secondly, This great philoſopher explains himſelf in this manner: <q rend="inline">The birds which fly little, as the partridges and quails, do not conſtruct neſts, but lay their eggs on the ground, on ſmall heaps of leaves which they gather; the lark and <hi>tetrix</hi> do the ſame.</q> The leaſt attention to this paſſage will convince us, that it alludes to thoſe tardy birds which fly little; and that the lark and <hi>tetrix</hi> are mentioned, becauſe they neſtle on the ground like theſe, though apparently more agile, ſince the lark is of the number. If Ariſtotle had meant our Great Buſtard by the name <hi>tetrix,</hi> he would certainly have ranged it as a ſluggiſh bird with the partridges and quails, and not with the larks, which, from their lofty flight, have merited, according to Schwenckfeld himſelf, the epithet of <hi>coelipetes.</hi>

relates of his <hi>tetrax,</hi> with what we know of our Great Buſtard, two
diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct differences: 1. The <hi>tetrax</hi> appears tame from ſtupidity,

                     <bibl>WILLOUGHBY.</bibl> 
                  </note>. 2. The <hi>tetrax</hi> built its neſt at the foot of the
Apennines; whereas Aldrovandus, who was an Italian, aſſures us
poſitively, that the Great Buſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tards are never ſeen in Italy, except when
they are driven thither by a guſt of wind<note n="**" place="bottom"> 
                     <q rend="inline">Italia noſtra has aves niſi forte ventorum turbine advectas non habet.</q>

                  </note>. It is <pb n="8" facs="tcp:1084500102:15"/> true, indeed, that Willoughby
ſuſpects they are not rare in that country; becauſe, when he paſſed
through Modena, he ſaw one in the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket. But I ſhould conceive that a
ſingle Great Buſtard brought to market in ſuch a city as Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dena, agrees
better with the aſſertion of Aldro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vandus than with the conjecture of
Willoughby.</p>
               <p>Perrault imputes to Ariſtotle the ſtory that the <hi>otis</hi> of Scythia does not ſit on its eggs like other birds, but covers them with a hare's or fox's ſkin, concealing them at the root of a tree, on whoſe top it is perched. Yet Ariſtotle does not apply this at all to the Great Buſtard, but only to a certain Scythian bird, probably a bird of prey, which could tear off the ſkins of hares and foxes, and which was only of the ſize of a Buſtard, as Pliny and Gaza<note n="*" place="bottom">In Scythis avis magnitudine <hi>otidis</hi> binos parit, in leporina pelle ſemper in cacuminibus ramorum ſuſpenſa. <bibl>
                        <hi>Hiſt. Nat.</hi> lib. x. 33.</bibl>
                  </note> tranſlate it; beſides, however little Ariſtotle was
acquainted with the Buſtard, he could not fail to know that it never
perches.</p>
               <p>The compounded name <hi>trapp-gantz,</hi> which the Germans have beſtowed on this bird, has given riſe to other miſtakes. <hi>Trappen</hi> ſignifies to walk; and cuſtom has connected to its derivatives the acceſſory idea of tardineſs, in the ſame manner as in the caſe of the Latin word <hi>gradatim</hi> and the Italian <hi>andante</hi>; and hence the epithet <hi>trapp</hi> can, with propriety, be applied to the Buſtard, which, when not purſued, walks ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

               <p>Belon pretends that the <hi>tetras alter</hi> of Pliny<note n="§" place="bottom">
                     <bibl>Hiſt. Nat. lib. x. 22.</bibl>
                  </note> was the Great Buſtard; but there is no founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for this opinion, ſince Pliny mentions the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:1084500102:18"/>
                  <hi>avis tarda</hi> in the ſame place. It is true, that Belon, ſupporting this error by another, aſſerts, that the <hi>avis tarda</hi> of the Spaniards and the <hi>otis</hi> of the Greeks mean the owl. But he ought to have prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: 1. That the Great Buſtard inhabits lofty moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, as Pliny affirms of the <hi>tetras alter, (gignunt eos Alpes,)</hi> which contradicts the aſſertions of all the naturaliſts with reſpect to this bird, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept Barrere<note n="*" place="bottom">Barrere admits two ſorts of Buſtards in Europe; but he is the only perſon that has repreſented them as inhabitants of the Pyrennees. The author was born at Rouſſillon, and referred to his native mountains all the animals bred in the adjacent provinces.</note>. 2. That the owl, and not the Great Buſtard, has really been known in Spain by the name of <hi>avis tarda,</hi> and in Greek by that of <hi>otis</hi>; but this is totally inadmiſſible, as it is contrary to the teſtimony of almoſt all writers. What may have deceived Belon is, that Pliny mentions his ſecond <hi>tetras</hi> as one of the largeſt birds after the oſtrich, which, according to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon, is true only of the Great Buſtard. But we ſhall find in the ſequel, that the wood grous ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times exceeds in bulk the Great Buſtard; and ſince Pliny ſubjoins, that the fleſh of this <hi>avis tarda</hi> has a rank taſte, which correſponds much better with the <hi>otus,</hi> the long-eared owl, than with the <hi>otis,</hi> the Great Buſtard, Belon ſhould have ſuſpected that the naturaliſt confounds here the <hi>otis</hi> with the <hi>otus,</hi> as I have before remarked; and that he aſcribes to the ſame ſpecies the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of two ſpecies widely different from each
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:1084500102:19"/>
other, though expreſſed in his compilation by nearly ſimilar names; but he was not entitled to conclude that the <hi>avis tarda</hi> was really the long-eared owl.</p>
               <p>The ſame Belon would believe, that his <hi>aedic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemus</hi> was an <hi>oſtardeau,</hi> or <hi>ſtone-curlew</hi>; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed this bird has only three toes, all of them an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior, like the Great Buſtard; but its bill is widely different, the tarſus thicker, the neck ſhorter, and it ſeems to have more analogy to the plover than to the Great Buſtard. But we ſhall after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards conſider this ſubject more fully.</p>
               <p>Finally, We may obſerve that ſome authors, deceived probably by the reſemblance of words, have confounded the name <hi>ſtarda,</hi> which in Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian ſignifies a buſtard, with the name <hi>ſtarna,</hi> which in the ſame language ſignifies a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridge.</p>
               <p>From theſe diſcuſſions we may conclude, that the <hi>otis</hi> of the Greeks, and not <hi>otus,</hi> is our Great Buſtard; that the name <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

               <p>To perceive the importance of this inveſtiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we need only figure in our imaginations the ſtrange and ridiculous idea which a beginner would form of the Great Buſtard, who had col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected indiſcriminately and with blind confidence all that has been aſcribed to this bird by authors, or rather to the different names by which it is
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:1084500102:21"/>
diſtinguiſhed in their works: at one time a diur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal bird, at another a nocturnal; ſometimes an inhabitant of the mountains, at other times an inhabitant of the plains; ſometimes a native of Europe, at other times a native of America; now a land bird, then an aquatic one; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times granivorous, at other times carnivorous; ſometimes extremely large, at other times very ſmall: in a word, a monſter and a chimaera. But, to diſcriminate the true qualities, it is neceſſary, as we have done, to draw a critical compariſon between the deſcriptions of former naturaliſts.</p>
               <p>But we have dwelt long enough on words; it is now time to proceed to things. Geſner exults in being the firſt who perceived that the Great Buſtard might be referred to the gallinaceous claſs. It is true indeed, that it reſembles this claſs in its bill and its weight; but it differs in its thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; in its legs, which have three toes; in the ſhape of its tail; in the lower part of its legs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing naked; in the great aperture of its ears; in the beards of feathers which hang under its chin, in place of thoſe fleſhy membranes with which the gallinaceous tribes are furniſhed; not to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the difference of the internal ſtructure.</p>
               <p>Aldrovandus is not more fortunate in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures, when he takes the frugivorous eagle, mentioned by Aelian<note n="*" place="bottom">Lib. x. According to Aelian, this eagle was called the <hi>Eagle of Jupiter.</hi> It was ſtill more a frugivorous bird than the Buſtard, which eats earth-worms; for the eagle deſtroyed no living creature.</note>, for a Buſtard, becauſe of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:1084500102:22"/>
its ſize: as if the attribute of magnitude were alone ſufficient to conſtitute the idea of an eagle. It appears to me much more probable, that Aelian<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>meant the great vulture, which is a bird of prey, as well as the eagle, and even ſtronger than the common eagle, and which feeds on grain in caſes of neceſſity. I opened one of theſe birds which had been wounded by a ſhot, and which had paſſed ſeveral days in fields of growing corn, and I found nothing in the ſtomach but a green liquor, which was evidently half-digeſted herb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age.</p>
               <p>We can more eaſily trace the characters of the Great Buſtard in the <hi>tetrax</hi> of Athenaeus, which is larger than the biggeſt cocks, (and we know that ſome of theſe are of a prodigious ſize in Aſia,) has only three toes on the feet, has beards hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on each ſide of the bill, a mailed plumage, a deep cry, and whoſe fleſh has the taſte like that of the oſtrich, which reſembles the Great Buſtard in many other reſpects<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <q rend="inline">Otis avis fidipes eſt, tribus inſiſtens digitis, magnitudine gallinacei majoris, capite oblongo, oculis amplis, roſtro acuto, linguâ oſſeâ, gracili collo.</q> 
                     <bibl>GESNER. </bibl>
                  </note>. But this <hi>tetrax</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be the Great Buſtard, ſince,
according to Athenaeus, it is a bird nowhere mentioned in the writings of
Ariſtotle; whereas this philoſopher ſpeaks of the Great Buſtard in
ſeveral places.</p>
               <p>We might alſo ſuſpect with Perrault, that thoſe partridges of India mentioned by Strabo as equal to the gooſe in ſize, are a ſpecies of Buſtards.
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:1084500102:23"/>
The male is diſtinguiſhed from the female by the colours of its plumage, which are differently diſtributed and more vivid; by thoſe beards of feathers which hang from both ſides of the neck, which it is ſurpriſing that Perrault has not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, and with which Albin has improperly ornamented the figure of the male; by its ſize, which is almoſt double that of the female, a greater diſproportion than has been remarked in any other ſpecies.</p>
               <p>Belon, and ſome others who were not acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the caſſowary, the touyon, the dodo, or perhaps the great vulture, conſidered the Great Buſtard as a bird of the ſecond magnitude, and as the largeſt next to the oſtrich. But the peli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican, which was not known to them, is much larger, according to Perrault. Perhaps, however, Belon only ſaw a large Buſtard and a ſmall pelican; and in that caſe, his miſtake will be the ſame with that of many others, the aſſerting with reſpect to ſpecies, what is true but of an indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual.</p>
               <p>Edwards accuſes Willoughby of being groſsly deceived, and of drawing Albin, who copied him, into the ſame error, in aſſerting that the Great Buſtard is ſixty inches in length, from the point of the bill to the end of the tail. In fact, thoſe which I have meaſured were only three feet and a half; and ſuch was that of Briſſon. The one examined by Edwards, was three feet and a half long, or three feet nine inches from the point
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:1084500102:24"/>
of the bill to the extremity of the tail. In the <hi>Britiſh Zoology,</hi> it is ſtated at four Engliſh feet. The expanſion of the wings varies more than one half in different ſubjects. It is reckoned ſeven feet four inches by Edwards, nine feet by the authors of the <hi>Britiſh Zoology,</hi> and four French feet by Perrault, who declares that he never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined the males, which are always larger than the females.</p>
               <p>The weight of this bird admits of conſiderable variations; ſome are only ten pounds, others twenty-ſeven or even thirty. But it alſo varies in its proportions; and the individuals of the ſpecies ſeem not all formed after the ſame model. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rault obſerved ſome whoſe neck was longer, and others where it was ſhorter, than the legs; ſome whoſe bill was more pointed, others whoſe ears were ſhaded with longer feathers; and all of them had a much longer neck and legs than thoſe examined by Geſner and Aldrovandus. In the ſubjects deſcribed by Edwards, there were on each ſide of the neck two naked ſpots, of a violet colour, but which appeared covered with fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, when the neck was much extended; a circumſtance that has been remarked by no other obſervers. Finally, Klein mentions that the Great Buſtards in Poland are not exactly like to thoſe in France and in England; and indeed we find, by comparing the deſcriptions, ſome dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences in the colours of the plumage, in the bill, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:1084500102:25"/>
In general, the Great Buſtard is diſtinguiſhed from the oſtrich, the caſſowary, the touyon, and the dodo, by the circumſtance, that its wings, though little proportioned to its maſs, are yet able to raiſe it from the ground, and ſupport it for ſome time in the air; whereas theſe four birds are totally incapable of flying. It is alſo diſcriminated from all the others by its ſize; its feet, which are furniſhed with three toes, that are parted and without membranes; its bill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fembling that of the dodo; its roſe-coloured down, and the nakedneſs of the lower part of the feet; not indeed by any one of theſe cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, but by the conjunction of them all.</p>
               <p>The wing conſiſts of twenty-ſix quills, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Briſſon; and of thirty-two or thirty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>three, according to Edwards, who perhaps in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes thoſe of the falſe wing. The only thing I have to remark on theſe quills, and which can hardly be perceived from the inſpecting of the figure, is that, at the third, fourth, fifth, and ſixth feathers of each wing, the exterior webs become at once ſhorter, and conſequently theſe quills are narrower, where they project from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the coverts.</p>
               <p>The quills of the tail amount to twenty, and the two middle ones differ from all the reſt.</p>
               <p>Perrault<note n="*" place="bottom">

                  </note> imputes to Belon the aſſerting that the upper part of the wings of the Great Buſtard
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:1084500102:26"/>
is white, contrary to the obſervations of the aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demicians, and to what is commonly remarked in theſe birds, in which there is more white on the belly and the under part of the body, and more brown and other colours on the back and wings. But I am inclined to think, that Belon may be eaſily juſtified on this head; for he ſays exactly what the academicians do, that <hi>the Great Buſtard is white under the belly and below the wings</hi>; and when he deſcribes the upper part of the wings as black, he undoubtedly means thoſe quills of the wing which are next the body, and which are really over the wing when it is cloſed and the bird in an erect poſture. But in this ſenſe the aſſertion is true, and conformable to the deſcription of Edwards, where the twenty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſixth quill, and thoſe that follow, incluſive to the thirtieth, are perfectly white.</p>
               <p>Perrault has made a more accurate obſervation. It is, that ſome feathers of the Great Buſtard are covered with down, not only at their baſe, but even at their extremity; ſo that the middle of the feather, which conſiſts of cloſe connected webs, is ſituated between two parts, where there is no down. But what is very remarkable, the down at the origin of all theſe feathers, except the quills at the end of the wing, is of a bright red, approaching to roſe colour, which is a character common to the Great and the Small Buſtard. The end of the quill is alſo of the ſame colour.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:1084500102:27"/>
The foot, or rather the <hi>tarſus,</hi> and the lower part of the foot, which articulates with the tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, are covered with very ſmall ſcales, thoſe of the toes being long narrow tablets; they are all of a grey colour, and ſheathed with a cuticle, which it caſts like the ſlough of a ſerpent.</p>
               <p>The nails are ſhort and convex, both above and below, like thoſe of the eagle, termed <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaetos</hi> by Belon; ſo that a ſection perpendicular to their axis, would be nearly circular.</p>
               <p>Salerne was miſtaken, in aſſerting, that the Great Buſtard, on the contrary, had nails con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cave below.</p>
               <p>Under the feet, we can perceive behind a callous prominence, which ſerves inſtead of a heel<note n="*" place="bottom">Belon and Geſner.</note>.</p>
               <p>The breaſt is thick and round<note n="†" place="bottom">Belon.</note>; the width of the aperture of the ears is probably ſubject to variations; for Belon found, that it was larger in the Great Buſtard than in any other land bird<note n="‡" place="bottom">

The tongue is hard, and terminates in a point; but is not forked, as alleged by Linnaeus, who, with others, has undoubtedly been miſled by a wrong punctuation in Aldrovandus<note n="†" place="bottom">

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:1084500102:29"/>
that it enlarges only as it approaches the gizzard<note n="*" place="bottom">Geſner, Aldrovandus, and Perrault.</note>.

               <p>The true oeſophagus, where it expands, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet with glands regularly arranged. The gizzard, which comes next, (for there is no craw,) is about four inches long and three inches broad: it is as hard as that of ordinary hens; which is not owing, as in theſe, to the thickneſs of the fleſhy part, which is here very thin, but to the internal membrane, which is extremely hard and thick, and folded and interwoven in various di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, ſo as to increaſe much the bulk of the gizzard.</p>
               <p>This internal membrane appears not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuous, but only connected cloſely to that of the oeſophagus. Further, this is white, while the internal membrane of the gizzard is yellow like gold<note n="†" place="bottom">

Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rault ſays only, that the right one, which mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures about a foot, is a little longer than the left.</p>
               <p>Near an inch from the <hi>anus,</hi> the inteſtine contracts and then expands, forming a bag, which could admit an egg, and into which are inſerted the ureters and the <hi>vas deferens.</hi> This inteſtinal bag, called Fabricius's purſe<note n="*" place="bottom">From the name of <hi>Fabricius of Aquapendente,</hi> who firſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved it.</note>, has alſo its <hi>caecum,</hi> two inches long and three inches broad; and the hole by which they communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate is covered by a fold of the internal mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane, which ſerves for a valve<note n="†" place="bottom">Perrault.</note>.</p>
               <p>It follows from theſe obſervations, that the Great Buſtard, far from having ſeveral ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machs, and a great extent of inteſtines, like the ruminating animals, has, on the contrary, a very ſhort and narrow alimentary canal, and which is furniſhed with only a ſingle ventricle. The opinion of thoſe, therefore, who pretend that this bird ruminates, would be refuted by this circumſtance alone<note n="‡" place="bottom">Athenaeus, Euſtachius.</note>. Nor can we believe with Albert, that the Great Buſtard is carnivorous, that it feeds on dead bodies, and even wages
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:1084500102:31"/>
war againſt the feeble kinds of game; and that it never eats herbage or grain but in caſes of extreme want: far leſs ought we to conclude from theſe ſuppoſitions, that the bill and claws are hooked. Theſe errors, collected by Albert from a paſſage of Ariſtotle which is miſunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, have been admitted by Geſner, with ſome modifications, but rejected by all the other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turaliſts<note n="*" place="bottom">Pennant, and others.</note>.</p>
               <p>The Great Buſtard is a granivorous bird; it lives on herbs, grain, and every kind of ſeed; on the leaves of coleworts, of dandelions, of turnips, of mouſe-ear, of vetches, of ſmallage, of carrots, and even on hay, and on thoſe large worms which, during the ſummer, ſwarm be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſun-riſe on downs. In the depth of winter, and when the ground is covered with ſnow, they feed on the bark of trees; and at all times, they ſwallow ſmall ſtones, or even bits of metal, like the oſtrich. The academicians, on open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſtomach of one of the Great Buſtards which they obſerved, found it filled partly with ſtones, ſome of which were of the ſize of a nut, and partly with <hi>doubloons,</hi> to the number of ninety, all worn and poliſhed where they were expoſed to the attrition, but without the leaſt appearance of eroſion.</p>
               <p>Willoughby found in the ſtomach of theſe birds, which were killed in the harveſt ſeaſon,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:1084500102:32"/>
three or four grains of barley, with a large quantity of hemlock ſeed; which indicates a decided preference, and ſhews that theſe ſeeds would make the beſt bait for enſnaring them.</p>
               <p>The liver is very large; the gall-bladder, the pancreas, the number of pancreatic ducts, their inſertion, and that of the hepatic and cyſtic ducts, are liable to ſome variation in different ſubjects.</p>
               <p>The teſticles are ſhaped like a ſmall white al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond, and pretty firm; the <hi>vas deferens</hi> is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted in the lower part of the ſac of the <hi>rectum,</hi> as I have already mentioned; and, on the upper margin of the <hi>anus,</hi> we find a ſmall appendix, which ſupplies the place of a yard.</p>
               <p>To theſe anatomical obſervations, Perrault adds this remark: That among all the ſubjects diſſected by the academicians, not a ſingle fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male occurred; but we have already anticipated, at the article of the oſtrich, what reflections we ſhould here make.</p>

When the anxious mother dreads the viſits of the ſportſmen, ſhe takes her eggs under her wings, (it is not deſcribed how,) and tranſports them to a ſafe place<note n="‡" place="bottom">Klein.</note>. She commonly chooſes fields of corn in the ear, from an inſtinct which prompts all animals to bring forth their young in ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that ſupply the proper food. Klein pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends, that ſhe prefers oats as having the ſhorteſt ſtalks, and that while ſhe ſits on her eggs, her head is ſo elevated as to glance along the plain and notice what is going forward. But this aſſertion agrees neither with the general opinion of naturaliſts, nor with the inſtinct of the Great Buſtard, which, as it is wild and timid, muſt ſeek for ſafety rather by concealing itſelf in tall corn, than by over-topping it, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to obſerve the ſportſmen at a diſtance, and incur the danger of being itſelf diſcovered.</p>
               <p>She ſometimes leaves her eggs in queſt of food, and if, during her ſhort abſence, one handle or even breathe on them, it is ſaid that ſhe perceives it on her return, and abandons them.</p>
               <p>The Great Buſtard, though a very large bird, is exceſſively timorous, and ſeems neither

conſcious of its ſtrength, nor animated by the proper ſpirit of exerting it. Sometimes they aſſemble, to the number of fifty or ſixty; but they gain as little confidence from their multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, as from their ſtrength or their ſize; the ſlighteſt appearance of danger, or rather the leaſt novelty, alarms them; and they can hardly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for their ſafety, but by flight. Dogs they dread moſt, eſpecially as theſe are generally uſed to hunt them; but they are alſo afraid of the fox, the pole-cat, and every other animal, however ſmall, which has courage to attack them. They ſhrink from the ſierce animals, and even the birds of prey. So daſtardly they are, that, though only ſlightly hurt, they die through fear, rather than from the effect of their wounds<note n="*" place="bottom">Geſner.</note>. Yet Klein aſſerts that they are ſometimes irritated, and inflate a looſe ſkin, which hangs below the neck.

Every kind of ſnare, how artleſs ſoever, muſt ſucceed, if it is true, as Aelian affirms, that in the kingdom of Pontus, the foxes attract them by lying on the ground, raiſing their tail, and moving it like the neck of a bird; the Buſtards, he ſays, miſtake this object for one of their own ſpecies, advance to it without heſitation, and become the prey of the inſidious animal.

                  </note>. But though it can live in cold countries, and, according to ſome
authors, is a bird of paſſage, it would ſeem that it has never migrated
into America by the north; for though the accounts of travellers are filled
with Buſtards found in the New Continent, it is eaſy to perceive that
theſe pretended Buſtards are aquatic birds, as I have before remarked, and
entirely dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from that which we at preſent conſider. Barrere
mentions, indeed, in his Eſſay on Ornithology, a cinereous Buſtard of
America, which he ſays he obſerved; but in the firſt place, it does not
appear that he had ſeen it in America, ſince he takes no notice of it in
his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of Equinoctial France; in the ſecond place, he is the only one,
except Klein, who ſpeaks of an American Buſtard; and that of Klein, the 
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:1084500102:39"/> 
                  <hi>macucagua</hi> of Marcgrave, has not the characters
that belong to the genus, ſince there are four toes on each foot, and the
lower part of the leg is feathered to its articulation with the
<hi>tarſus</hi>; it wants the tail, and bears ſcarcely any relation to the
Great Buſtard, unleſs that it is heavy, and never flies or perches. With
reſpect to Barrere, his authority is not ſo great in natural hiſtory,
that his teſtimony can outweigh that of all others. And, finally, his
cinereous Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican Buſtard is probably the female of the African Buſtard,
which, according to Linnaeus<note n="*" place="bottom">The <hi>Otis Afra</hi> of
Linnaeus.</note>, is of an aſh-colour.</p>
               <p>It will be perhaps aſked, how a bird, which, though bulky, is furniſhed with wings, and ſometimes makes uſe of them, has never mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grated into America by the ſtraits on the north, as many quadrupeds have done? I would anſwer, that though it flies, this is only when it is purſued; that it never makes a diſtant ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſion, and, according to the remark of Belon, has an averſion to water, and therefore could never venture to croſs the wide expanſe of the ocean; for, though the continents approach each other towards the north, the interval is ſtill prodigious, compared with the ſhort and tardy flight of the Buſtard.</p>
               <p>The Great Buſtard may then be conſidered as a bird appropriated to the ancient continent,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:1084500102:40"/>
but attached to no particular climate; it inhabits the burning ſands of Lybia, and the frozen ſhores of the Baltic, and occurs in all the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate countries.</p>
               <p>Its fleſh is excellent. That of the young ones, after being kept a ſhort time, is remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably delicate; and if ſome writers have main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the contrary, this ariſes from their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding <hi>otis</hi> with <hi>otus,</hi> as I have before ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved. I know not why Hippocrates forbids perſons ſubject to the falling ſickneſs to taſte it. Pliny recommends the fat of the Buſtard to allay the pain in the breaſts after child-birth. The quills of this bird, like thoſe of the gooſe and the ſwan, are uſed for writing; and anglers are eager to fix them to their hooks, becauſe they believe that the little black ſpots with which they are mottled, will appear to the fiſh as ſo many little flies, and attract them by this deception. <note n="A" place="bottom">The ſpecific character of the Great Buſtard, <hi>Otis-tarda:</hi>—<q rend="inline">The head and neck of the male is tufted on both ſides.</q> It is ranged in the order of the <hi>Gallinae.</hi>

               <p>THIS bird is diſtinguiſhed from the Great Buſtard only by ſome variations in the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours of its plumage, and in being much ſmaller. Like the Great Buſtard, alſo, it has received the epithet of duck <hi>(cane),</hi> though it has no ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy to that aquatic bird, and is never found near ſtreams or marſhes. Belon pretends that this name has been applied, becauſe it ſquats on the ground as the ducks do in the water<note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Cane-terre,</hi> changed into <hi>canepetiere.</hi>
                  </note>; and Salerne imagines that it is on account of its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling in ſome meaſure the wild duck, and flying in the ſame manner. But theſe etymo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logical conjectures are vague and uncertain; they reſt on a ſingle point of analogy, and are inconſiſtent with each other; and the name is therefore apt to convey a falſe idea. The epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thet
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:1084500102:42"/>
which we have adopted is not liable to the ſame objections.</p>
               <p>Belon ſuppoſes that this bird is the <hi>tetrax</hi> of Athenaeus; reſting his opinion on a paſſage of the ancient, where it is compared, in point of ſize, to the <hi>ſpermologus</hi>

                     <q rend="inline">The <hi>tetrax,</hi>
                     </q> ſays Alexander Myndius, <q rend="inline">is a bird of the bulk of the <hi>ſpermologus,</hi> of the colour of potters clay, variegated with ſome dirty ſpots and great white lines: it lives on fruits, and after it has young, it utters a cry that conſiſts of four parts.</q> 
                     <bibl>ATHENAEUS, lib. ix. </bibl>
                  </note>, which he takes for the <hi>freux,</hi> a kind of large crow; but
Aldrovandus affirms, on the contrary, that the <hi>ſpermologus</hi> is a
ſpecies of ſparrow, and conſequently cannot ſignify the Little
Buſtard: and Willoughby even aſſerts that this bird had no name among the
ancients.</p>
               <p>Aldrovandus too informs us, that the fiſhers at Rome gave the name of <hi>ſtella,</hi> for what rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon he does not know, to a bird which at firſt he took for the Little Buſtard, but afterwards, on more minute inſpection, he diſcovered to be different. Yet, notwithſtanding this expreſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, Ray and Salerne ſay, that the Little Buſtard and the <hi>ſtella avis</hi> of Aldrovandus appear to be the ſame ſpecies, and Briſſon places it without heſitation among the ſynonyms; he ſeems even to allege that Charleton and Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loughby had the ſame idea, though theſe authors have been very attentive not to confound the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:1084500102:43"/>
two kinds of birds, which it is moſt probable they had never ſeen<note n="*" place="bottom">Charleton makes two different ſpecies; the ninth, of his <hi>phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivori,</hi> which is the Little Buſtard; and the tenth, which is the <hi>avis ſtella.</hi> In the former he copies Belon, and in the latter he refers to Johnſton. Willoughby keeps the names of <hi>ſtella</hi> and <hi>canepetiere</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely diſtinct.</note>. On the other hand, Barrere, claſſing it with the rail, beſtows on it the name of <hi>ortygometra melina,</hi> and gives it a fourth toe to each foot; ſo true is it, that the multiplicity of ſyſtems, without increaſing our real knowledge, only ſerves to give birth to new errors.</p>
               <p>This bird is a real Buſtard, as I have ſaid, but formed on a ſmaller ſcale; and for this reaſon Klein terms it <hi>tarda nana, dwarf buſtard.</hi> Its length, from the point of the bill to the end of the nails, is eighteen inches, or it is leſs than half that of the Great Buſtard. This meaſure will ſerve as a ſtandard of compariſon, from which all the other dimenſions may be deduced; but we muſt not conclude with Ray, that its bulk is to that of the Great Buſtard as one to two; it is as the cubes of theſe numbers, or as one to eight. It is nearly the ſize of a pheaſant<note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <q rend="inline">To have an idea of the Little Buſtard, conceive a quail much ſpotted, and as large as a middling pheaſant.</q> 
                     <bibl>BELON. </bibl>
                  </note>, and it has, like the Great Buſtard, only three toes on each
foot. The lower part of its leg is naked, the bill is ſimilar to that of the
gallinaceous tribe, <pb n="37" facs="tcp:1084500102:44"/> and there is a roſe-coloured down
under all the feathers on the body; but it has two <hi>pennae</hi> fewer in the
tail, one more in each of the wings; and when theſe are cloſed, the laſt
ones ſtretch almoſt as far as the firſt, or thoſe moſt remote from
the body. Further, the male has not thoſe beards of feathers as the male of
the great ſpecies; and Klein adds, that its plumage is not ſo beautiful as
that of the female, contrary to what is moſt uſually remarked in other
birds. Excepting theſe ſlight differences, the two ſpecies are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
analogous; they have the ſame ſhape, the ſame internal diſpoſition of
parts, the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtincts, the ſame habits; and it would ſeem that the
ſmall one was produced from the egg of the large, when it had not force
ſufficient to effect a complete developement.</p>
               <p>The male is diſtinguiſhed from the female by a double white collar, and by ſome other va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieties in point of colour; but the plumage on the upper part of the body is almoſt the ſame in both ſexes, and, as Belon has remarked, is much leſs liable to vary in different individuals.</p>
               <p>According to Salerne, they have a particular call in the love ſeaſon, which begins in May. It is the ſound, <hi>broo</hi> or <hi>proo,</hi> which they repeat the whole night, and are heard at a great diſtance. The males fight obſtinately, and contend for the dominion of a certain tract; one male takes a number of females under his protection, and the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:1084500102:45"/>
place of their amours is trodden like a barn floor.</p>
               <p>The female lays, in the month of June, three, four, or even five eggs, which are extremely beautiful, and of a ſhining green. When the young are hatched, ſhe leads them as a hen does her chickens. They begin to fly about the middle of Auguſt; and when they hear a noiſe, they lie flat on the ground, and ſuffer themſelves to be cruſhed, rather than ſtir from the ſpot<note n="*" place="bottom">Salerne. That writer does not quote his authorities. There is ſome reaſon to ſuſpect that he confounds the <hi>tetrix,</hi> or wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cock, with the <hi>tetrax,</hi> or Little Buſtard; eſpecially as he is the only naturaliſt who deſcribes minutely the amours of the Little Buſtard.</note>.</p>
               <p>The males are caught in ſnares, into which they are decoyed by a ſtuffed female, whoſe cry is imitated. They are often hunted by means of the falcon; but in general it is difficult to get near them, for they are always on the watch on ſome riſing ſpot in fields of oats; though never, it is ſaid, among thoſe of rye or wheat. To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the cloſe of the ſummer ſeaſon they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare to quit the country, and are then obſerved to aſſemble in flocks, and the young ones are no longer diſtinguiſhable now from the old<note n="†" place="bottom">Salerne.</note>.</p>
               <p>According to Belon, they feed like thoſe of the great ſpecies on herbs and grain, and alſo on ants, beetles, and ſmall flies; but Salerne main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains that they live chiefly on inſects, and only
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:1084500102:46"/>
eat ſometimes in the ſpring the moſt tender leaves of the ſow-thiſtle.</p>
               <p>The Little Buſtard is not diſperſed through ſo wide a range as the large ſpecies. Linnaeus ſays, that it is found in Europe, and particularly in France. This aſſertion is rather vague; ſince there are ſome extenſive countries in Europe, and even large provinces in France, where it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known. We may refer the climates of Sweden and Poland to the number of ſuch as are unfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable to its nature; for Linnaeus takes no notice of it in his <hi>Fauna Suecica,</hi> nor Rzaczynzki in his Natural Hiſtory of Poland; and Klein ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſaw more than one at Dantzic, and it came from the <hi>menagerie</hi> of the Margrave of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reith.</p>
               <p>Nor can it be more common in Germany; ſince Friſch, who undertakes to deſcribe and figure the birds in that country, and who is minute on the ſubject of the Great Buſtard, never mentions a word of this ſpecies; and Scwenckfield never names it.</p>
               <p>Geſner only inſerts its name in the liſt of thoſe birds which he had never ſeen; and what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſhews this is, that he ſuppoſes its feet are hairy as thoſe of Attagas, which affords a ſuſpicion that it is at leaſt very rare in Switzerland.</p>
               <p>The authors of the Britiſh Zoology, whoſe view it was to take notice of no animal but what was Britiſh, or at leaſt of Britiſh origin, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that they would not have conformed to
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:1084500102:47"/>
their plan, if they had deſcribed a Little Buſtard that was killed in Cornwall; but which they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider as a ſtray bird, and by no means a native of Great Britain. So totally unknown is it in that country, that a ſpecimen being preſented to the Royal Society, none of the members then preſent could recogniſe it, and they were obliged to apply to Edwards to diſcover its ſpecies<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <bibl>Edwards' Gleanings.</bibl>
                  </note>.</p>
               <p>On the other hand, Belon informs us, that, in his time, neither the ambaſſadors from Venice, Ferrara, and the Pope's dominions, to whom he ſhewed one, nor any in their train, could decide what it was, and that ſome of them even took it for a pheaſant. From this circumſtance he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly infers that it muſt be at leaſt very uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in Italy; and the concluſion is ſtill very probable, though Ray, in paſſing through Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dena, ſaw one in the market. We may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore reckon Poland, Sweden, Great Britain, Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many, Switzerland, and Italy, as countries where the Little Buſtard is not found. It is even likely that the range is confined with in narrower limits, and that France is the region peculiar to this bird, and the only climate ſuited to its nature; for the French naturaliſts deſcribe it the beſt, and all the others, except Klein, who ſaw one, mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly copy Belon. Nor muſt we conclude that the Little Buſtard is equally common in every part of France; there are large provinces in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom where it is never ſeen. Salerne informs us,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:1084500102:48"/>
that it is pretty common in Beauce (where it is only a bird of paſſage); that it arrives about the middle of April, and retires on the approach of winter: he ſubjoins, that it delights in poor ſtoney lands, and from this circumſtance it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives the epithet of <hi>canepetrace,</hi> or <hi>rock duck.</hi> It alſo occurs in Berri, where it receives a ſimilar name<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Canepetrotte.</hi>
                  </note>. It muſt be common in Maine and Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy; ſince Belon, judging of the other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces from theſe with which he was beſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted, aſſerts, that <hi>there is not a peaſant in the country who does not know its name.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Little Buſtard is naturally cunning and ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picious; inſomuch that it has given riſe to a proverb. When it is apprehenſive of danger, it immediately quits the ſpot, and, keeping cloſe to the ground, flies ſwiftly 200 or 300 paces forward, and then runs ſo faſt that a man can hardly overtake it<note n="†" place="bottom">Belon.</note>.</p>
               <p>The fleſh of the Little Buſtard is black, and is excellent food. Klein aſſures us, that the eggs of the female in his poſſeſſion were very palat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and that the fleſh was better than that of the female of the black grous.</p>
               <p>Its internal ſtructure is nearly the ſame, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Belon, as that of the common grani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorous birds. <note n="A" place="bottom">

                  <p>THE bird which the Arabians call <hi>Lohong,</hi> and which Edwards firſt figured and deſcribed, is nearly the ſize of our Great Buſtard, and, like it, has three toes on each foot, turned the ſame way, only rather ſhorter; the feet, the bill, and the neck are longer; and, on the whole, it is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more taper-ſhaped.</p>
                  <p>The plumage on the upper part of the body is browner, and ſimilar to that of the wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cock; or it is tawny and radiated with deep brown with white ſpots, in the form of a creſcent, on its wings. The lower part of the body is white, as alſo the margin of the upper part of the wing. The crown of the head, the throat,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:1084500102:50"/>
and the fore ſide of the neck, are marked with tranſverſe bars of a dull brown on a cincreous ground. The lower part of the leg, the bill, and the feet, are of a bright brown, and yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowiſh; the tail droops like that of the partridge, and is ſtained with a croſs black bar; the great quills of the wing and the creſt are alſo of the ſame colour.</p>
                  <p>This creſt forms a remarkable character in the Arabian Buſtard; it is pointed, directed back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and much inclined to the horizon: from its baſe it ſends off two black lines, of which the longer one paſſes over the eye, and makes a kind of eye-lid; the other, which is much ſhorter, ſtretches under the eye, but does not reach it; the eye is black, and placed in a white ſpace.</p>
                  <p>When we take a profile view of this creſt at a little diſtance, we might fancy that we ſee ears pretty cloſe to the head, and leaning backwards; and as the Arabian Buſtard was undoubtedly bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter known to the Greeks than ours, it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that they named it <hi>otis,</hi> on account of theſe kind of ears, in the ſame way that they have called the long-eared owl <hi>otus</hi> or <hi>otos,</hi> by reaſon of two ſimilar tufts which diſtinguiſh that ſpecies of nocturnal birds.</p>
                  <p>An individual of this kind, which was brought from Moka, lived ſeveral years at London, in the poſſeſſion of Sir Hans Sloane; but Edwards, who has given us a coloured figure of it, has preſerved no account of its diſpoſitions, its
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:1084500102:51"/>
habits, or even of its manner of feeding; he ought at leaſt to have not confounded it with the gallinaceous tribes, from which it differs ſo widely, as I have ſhewn in the article of the Great Buſtard. <note n="A" place="bottom">Linnaeus characteriſes the Arabian Buſtard <hi>Otis Arabs,</hi> by its <q rend="inline">erect tufted ears.</q> It inhabits Arabia Felix, and penetrates in Aſia as far as the Caſpian Sea.</note>

                  <p>THIS is what Linnaeus makes his fourth ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies; it differs from the Arabian Buſtard by the colours of its plumage, the black predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minating; but the back is cinereous, and the ears white.</p>
                  <p>In the male the bill and feet are yellow, the crown of the head aſh-coloured, and the exterior margin of the wings white; but the female is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely cinereous, except the belly and thighs, which are black, as in the Indian Buſtard.</p>
                  <p>This bird is found in Ethiopia, according to Linnaeus; and it is extremely probable that the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:1084500102:52"/>
one mentioned by the navigator Le Maire, by the name of <hi>flying oſtrich</hi> of Senegal, is the ſame; for though the account given by him be ſhort, it partly coincides and is entirely conſiſtent with the deſcription of the naturaliſt. Its plumage is grey and black, its fleſh delicious, and its ſize is nearly the ſame with that of the ſwan. Our conjecture receives additional force from the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Adanſon; that intelligent naturaliſt hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing killed one of theſe flying oſtriches at Senegal, and examined it narrowly, aſſures us, that, in many reſpects, it is analogous to the European Buſtard, but differs in the colour of its plumage, which is generally of a grey-aſh in the greater length of its neck, and alſo by a kind of creſt on the back of the head.</p>
                  <p>This creſt is evidently what Linnaeus calls the <hi>ears,</hi> and the grey-aſh colour is exactly that of the female; and as theſe are the principal cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters by which the African Buſtard of Linnaeus and the flying oſtrich of Senegal are diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the European Buſtard, it would ſeem that we may conclude that they have a great analogy: and for the ſame reaſon we may apply to both what is obſerved with reſpect to each individual; for example, that they are nearly as large as our buſtard, and have a longer neck. The laſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned circumſtance, noticed by Adanſon, is a point of reſemblance to the Arabian Buſtard, which inhabits almoſt the ſame climate; and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the contrary can be inferred from the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:1084500102:53"/>
ſilence of Linnaeus, ſince he gives no meaſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at all of the African Buſtard. With regard to bulk, Le Maire makes that of the flying oſtrich equal to that of the ſwan; and Adanſon repreſents it as the ſame with that of the Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pean Buſtard: ſince, while he mentions that the reſemblance is complete in many reſpects, and ſtates the principal differences, he omits that of the ſize; and alſo as Ethiopia or Abyſſinia, which is the native region of the African Buſtard, and Senegal, which is that of the flying oſtrich, though widely differing in longitude, are of the ſame climate; I conceive that there is great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability that theſe two birds belong to the ſame identical ſpecies. <note n="A" place="bottom">The ſpecific character of the African Buſtard, <hi>Otis Afra,</hi> is:—<q rend="inline">That it is black, its back cinereous, its ears white.</q> It is call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>korr-haen</hi> by the Dutch at the Cape of Good Hope.

                  <p>THIS Buſtard is not only ſmaller than the European, the African, or the Arabian ſpecies, but it is taller and more ſlender. It is twenty inches high, from the crown of the head to the plane on which it ſtands; its neck ſeems to be ſhorter in proportion to its feet; but in other reſpects it is entirely analogous to the Common Buſtard. It has three ſeparate toes on each foot; the lower part of the leg is not fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered; the bill is ſomewhat hooked, though more elongated. I am at a loſs to conceive why Briſſon referred it to the genus of plovers.</p>
                  <p>The diſtinguiſhing character between the plovers and the buſtards conſiſts, according to that naturaliſt, in the form of the bill; which, in the latter, is an arched cone, and in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer it is ſtraight, and enlarged near the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity. But in the Indian plover the bill is curved rather than ſtraight, and not at all ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling near the point as in the plovers; at leaſt ſo
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:1084500102:55"/>
it is repreſented in a figure of Edwards, which Briſſon allows to be exact. I may add, that this property is more remarkable than in the Arabian Buſtard of Edwards, the accuracy of which figure is alſo admitted by Briſſon; and yet he has not heſitated to claſs it with the buſtards.</p>
                  <p>We need only caſt a glance on the figure of the Indian Buſtard, and compare it with thoſe of the plovers, to be convinced that it differs totally in its appearance and proportions: its neck is longer, its wings ſhorter, and its ſhape more expanded; and beſides, it is four times the bulk of the largeſt plover, whoſe extreme length is only ſixteen inches, while that of the Indian Buſtard is twenty-ſix<note n="*" place="bottom">This is conſiſtent with the meaſure I have ſtated above, that it is twenty inches from the crown of the head to the plane on which it ſtands; for the bill and toes are not then taken into ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</note>.</p>
                  <p>Black, fulvous, white, and grey, are the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant colours of its plumage, as in the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropean Buſtard; but they are differently diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted. The black is ſpread on the crown of the head, on the neck, the thighs, and the lower part of the body; a bright yellow occupies the ſides of the head and the circuit of the eyes; a browner yellow, and one more ſhaded with black, ſtains the back, the tail, that part of the wings next the back, and the top of the breaſt, where it forms a broad belt on a dark
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:1084500102:56"/>
ground; the white appears on the coverts of the wings fartheſt from the back, and white mixed with black on the intermediate ſpace; the deepeſt gray is laid on the eye-lids, the extremity of the longeſt quills of the wing<note n="*" place="bottom">As in ſome of the European Buſtards. <bibl>PERRAULT.</bibl>
                     </note>, of ſome of the middle and ſhorteſt ones, and on ſome of their coverts; laſtly, the brighteſt gray, which verges on white, is ſpread on the bill and the feet.</p>
                  <p>This bird is a native of Bengal, where it is called <hi>Churge.</hi> We may remark, that the cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate of Bengal is nearly the ſame with that of Arabia, Abyſſinia, and Senegal, where the two preceding Buſtards are found; and we may term it the <hi>Middle Buſtard,</hi> becauſe it holds the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termediate rank between the large and the ſmall ſpecies. <note n="A" place="bottom">Specific character of the Indian Buſtard, <hi>Otis Bengalenſis:</hi>—<q rend="inline">It is black; the ſpace about the eyes duſky; the back, the rump, and the tail, duſky, but gloſſed.</q>

                  <p>WE have found, among the Great Buſtards, that ſome are creſted and others not; and we ſhall diſcover that the ſame diſtinction pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails in the Little Buſtards. That which the people of Barbary call <hi>Houbara,</hi> is actually de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corated with a creſt or ruff. Dr. Shaw, who gives us a figure of it, aſſerts poſitively, that it has the ſhape and plumage of the Great Buſtard, but is much ſmaller, not exceeding the ſize of a capon; for this ſingle reaſon, that intelligent traveller, who was certainly not acquainted with the little ſpecies which inhabits France, finds fault with Golius for tranſlating the word <hi>Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baary</hi> by Buſtard.</p>
                  <p>It lives like ours on vegetable ſubſtances and inſects, and generally inhabits the borders of the deſert.</p>
                  <p>Though Dr. Shaw takes no notice of the ruff in his deſcription, there is one in the figure to which he refers; and it appears bending back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and pendant. It is formed by long fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers

                  <p>THE Rhaad is diſtinguiſhed from the Little Buſtard of France by its creſt, and from the Houbaara of Africa by the defect of the ruff. It is however of the ſame ſize with the latter; its head is black; its creſt deep blue; the upper part of the body and the wings yellow, ſpotted with brown; the tail of a brighter brown, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diated tranſverſely with black; the belly white, and the bill ſtrong, as well as the legs.</p>
                  <p>The Little Rhaad differs from the Great one by its ſize, (being no larger than a common hen,) by ſome varieties in the plumage, and by the want of a creſt. But it may ſtill poſſibly be of the ſame ſpecies with the other, and differ only by its ſex. My reaſons for this conjecture are theſe: 1. It inhabits the ſame climate, and is called by the ſame name. 2. In almoſt all birds, except the carnivorous kinds, the male ſeems to have more power of development, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in their greater height, the ſtrength of their muſcles, and in certain excreſcences, as fleſhly
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:1084500102:60"/>
membranes, ſpurs, &amp;c. or by tufts, creſts, and ruffs, which proceed, as it were, from the luxuriancy of organization, and even by the brightneſs of the colours of their plumage.</p>
                  <p>At any rate, both the Great and the Little Rhaad are termed <hi>Saf-ſaf.

               <p>THIS bird, though a domeſtic, and the moſt common of all, is ſtill, perhaps, not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently known.

               <p>But if the Cock be too little known by the bulk of men, what embarraſſment muſt it give to the methodical naturaliſt, who is never ſatisfied till he refer every object to his claſſes and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nera?

is undoubtedly of the gallinaceous tribe, and of an ancient family; ſince it
can be traced to the time of Columella, who mentions it as a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
breed<note n="*" place="bottom"> 
                     <q rend="inline">They are reckoned the moſt noble which have

                     <bibl>COLUMELLA, lib. viii. 2.</bibl>
                  </note>? If he forms the Cock into a
ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate genus, diſtinguiſhed by the ſingular ſhape of its tail,
where will he place the Cock that has no rump, and conſequently no tail, but
which ſtill belongs to the ſame family? If he admits that the legs clothed
with plumage to the heels, is a generic character, will he not be puzzled in
claſſing the rough-footed Cock, which is fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered to the origin of the
toes, and the Japa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſe Cock, which is feathered as far as the nails?
Laſtly, If he would refer the gallinaceous birds to the granivorous tribe,
and infer, from the number and ſtructure of their ſtomachs and
inteſtines, that they were deſtined to feed on grain and vegetable
ſubſtances, how will he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for the fondneſs which they diſcover
for earth-worms and minced-meat, whether raw or cooked? But perhaps, while he
imagines that the long inteſtines and double ſtomachs in poul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try prove
that they are granivorous birds, he would alſo conclude, from the hooked
ſhape of their bill, they are alſo vermivorous, or even carnivorous. What
abſurdities and contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions! Such are the feeble efforts of a little 
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:1084500102:64"/> mind, which being unable to comprehend the extenſion and
grandeur of the univerſe, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to confine it within the tramels of
ſyſtem! And to what trifling and vague ſpeculations do theſe attempts
give riſe? For our parts, we ſhall not attempt to connect the birds by a
ſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tific chain; we ſhall only join thoſe together that ſeem the
moſt analogous; but we ſhall endeavour to mark their characteristic
features, and note particularly the leading facts in their hiſtory.</p>
               <p>The Cock is a heavy bird, whoſe gait is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed and ſlow. His wings are very ſhort, and hence he flies ſeldom, and ſometimes his ſcreams indicate the violence of the effort. He crows either in the night or day, but not regularly at certain hours; and his note differs widely from that of the female. Some hens make a kind of crowing, though fainter and not ſo diſtinctly articulated. He ſcrapes the ground to ſeek his food, and ſwallows, with the grains, little peb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, which rather aſſiſt digeſtion. He drinks, by taking a little water into his bill, and raiſing his head at each draught. He ſleeps ofteneſt with one foot in the air<note n="*" place="bottom">The thigh on which the body reſts is commonly more fleſhy than the other; and our epicures know well how to diſtinguiſh them.</note>, and his head covered by the wing on the ſame ſide. In its natural ſituation, the body is nearly parallel to the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:1084500102:65"/>
ground, and ſo is the bill; the neck riſes verti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, the forehead is ornamented with a red fleſhy comb, and the under-part of the bill with a double pendant of the ſame colour and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; this however is neither fleſh nor mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane, but of a peculiar nature, different from every thing elſe.</p>
               <p>In both ſexes the noſtrils are ſituated on either ſide of the upper mandible, and the ears on either ſide of the head, and below each ear a white piece of ſkin is ſpread. The feet have commonly four toes, ſometimes five, but always three of them placed behind. The feathers riſe two and two from each ſhaft; a remarkable character, which has been noticed by few na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turaliſts. The tail is nearly ſtraight, but admits of a ſmall elevation and depreſſion. In thoſe gallinaceous tribes where it is ſingle, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts of fourteen feathers, which are parted into two unequal planes that join at their upper mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, making an angle more or leſs acute. But what diſtinguiſhes the male is, that the two fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in the middle of the tail are much longer than the reſt, and are bent into an arch; that the feathers of the tail and rump are long and narrow, and that the feet are armed with ſpurs. It is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed true, that ſome hens alſo have ſpurs, but this rarely occurs; and in ſuch hens there are many other points of reſemblance to the male; their comb and tail are arched the ſame way; they imitate the crowing of the cock, and would even
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:1084500102:66"/>
attempt to perform his office<note n="*" place="bottom">

               <p>A good Cock is one whoſe eyes ſparkle with fire, who has boldneſs in his demeanour, and freedom in his motions, and all whoſe proportions diſplay force. Such a bird would not indeed ſtrike terror into a lion, as has often been ſaid and written, but would command the love of the females, and place himſelf at the head of a numerous flock of hens. To ſpare him, he ought not to be allowed more than twelve or fifteen. Columella recommends that theſe ſhould not exceed five; but, though the Cock ſhould have fifty a-day, it is ſaid<note n="†" place="bottom">Aldrovandus.</note> that he would not neglect one. Yet no one can be certain that all his embraces are efficatious, and ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to fecundate the eggs of the female. His luſt ſeems to be as fiery as his gratifications are frequent. In the morning, the firſt thing he does, after he is let out from his rooſt, is to tread his hens. Food ſeems to him only a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condary want; and if he is deprived for ſome time of the company of his family, he makes his addreſſes to the firſt female that he meets,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:1084500102:67"/>
though of a very different ſpecies<note n="*" place="bottom">A croſs-breed is produced between a Cock and the hen-partridge, which through time grows like the female. <bibl>ARISTOTLE, lib. ix. 49.</bibl>
                  </note>, and even courts the firſt male that occurs. The firſt fact is mentioned by Ariſtotle; the ſecond is proved by an obſervation of Edwards<note n="†" place="bottom">Having ſhut up three or four Cocks in a place where they could have no commerce with any hen, they ſoon laid aſide theïr former animoſity; and, inſtead of fighting, each tried the other, though none ſeemed willing to ſubmit. <bibl>

               <p>The hens muſt be ſelected for the Cock, if we would have a genuine race; but if we want to vary and improve the ſpecies, the breed muſt be croſſed. This obſervation did not eſcape the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients: Columella expreſsly mentions, that the beſt poultry is produced by the union of a Cock of a foreign family with the ordinary hens; and we find in Athenaeus, that this idea was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, a cock-pheaſant being given to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon hens<note n="‖" place="bottom">

                     </bibl> I am aſſured that the Guinea Cock alſo treads the hens, if educated together, but that the breed are rather barren.</note>.</p>
               <p>In every caſe we ought to chuſe thoſe hens which have a lively eye, a flowing red comb, and
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:1084500102:68"/>
have no ſpurs. The proportions of their body are in general more ſlender than the males; yet their feathers are broader, and their legs ſhorter. Sagacious farmers prefer black hens, becauſe they are more prolific than the white, and more eaſily eſcape the piercing ſight of the birds of rapine which hover near the farm-yard.</p>
               <p>The Cock is extremely watchful of his fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males, and even filled with inquietude and anxie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; he hardly ever loſes ſight of them; he leads them, defends them, and threatens them with his menaces; collects them together when they ſtraggle, and never eats till he has the pleaſure of ſeeing them feeding around him. To judge from the different inflexions of his voice, and the various ſignificant geſtures which he makes, we cannot doubt but theſe are a ſpecies of lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage that ſerves to communicate his ſentiments. When he loſes them, he utters his griefs. Though as jealous as he is amorous, he abuſes not his wives, but turns his rage againſt his rivals. When another Cock is preſented, he allows no time for feduction; he inſtantly ruſhes forward, his eyes flaſhing fire, and his feathers briſtled, and makes a furious attack on his rival, and fights obſtinately till one or the other fall, or the interloper leave the field. The deſire of poſſeſſion, ever exceſſive, not only prompts him to drive away every rival, but to remove the moſt inoffenſive obſtacles; he beats off and ſometimes kills the chickens, that he may enjoy the mother more at his eaſe. Is
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:1084500102:69"/>
this appetite the ſole cauſe of his furious jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy? In the midſt of a ſubmiſſive ſeraglio, how can he apprehend any bounds to his gratifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? But how ardent ſoever be his paſſions, he ſeems to be more averſe to ſhare the pleaſures than eager to taſte them; and as his powers are greater, ſo his jealouſy is more excuſable and better founded than that of other ſultans. Like them alſo, he has his favourite female, whom he courts with greater aſſiduity, and on whom he beſtows his favours as often nearly as on all the reſt together.</p>
               <p>What proves that in Cocks jealouſy is a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion founded on reflection is, that many of them are perpetually fighting with each other in the court-yard, while they never attack the capons, at leaſt if theſe are not in the habit of following the hens.</p>
               <p>Man, who is dexterous in drawing amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from every quarter, has learnt to ſet into action that invincible antipathy which Nature has implanted in one Cock to another. So much have they foſtered this native hatred, that the battles of two domeſtic birds have become ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacles fit to attract the curioſity of people even in poliſhed ſociety; and at the ſame time, theſe have been conſidered as the means of calling forth or maintaining that precious ferocity, which is, they ſay, the ſource of heroiſm. Formerly, and even at preſent in more than one country, men of all ranks crowd to theſe groteſque com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bats,

ſtronger, and better fighters than the others, were not ſo ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent for the

becauſe their fire was extinguiſhed in the conſtrained ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude in
which they were accuſtomed to live, or becauſe their rage, being too often
rouſed, had ſtifled in them the ſofter paſſions, which, however, were
at firſt the principle of their cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and the ſource of their hoſtile

the females leſs prolific and more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolent, both in laying eggs and
watching their chickens.—So ſucceſsful has Art been in degrading

               <p>Hens need not the embrace of the Cock to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure eggs; theſe are continually detached from the bunch in the ovarium, which grows independent of the union with the male.

Theſe eggs are all that the prolific quality of the female can produce alone and unaſſiſted; ſhe exudes an organized body, indeed, ſuſceptible of a kind of life, but not a living animal ſimilar to the mother, and in its turn capable of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing the race. This requires the union of the male, and intimate mixture of the ſeminal li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors of both ſexes; but when once this has taken place, its effects are durable. Dr. Harvey obſerved, that the egg of a hen, which had been ſeparated twenty days from the Cock, was not leſs prolific than one laid newly after treading, and that the embryo was not on that account more advanced, and required the ſame length of incubation; a certain proof that heat alone can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not produce or promote the developement of the chick, but that the egg muſt be formed, or at leaſt placed where it can perſpire, in order that the embryo incloſed may be ſuſceptible of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubation, otherwiſe all the eggs which remain in the oviduct twenty-one days after fecunda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would hatch, ſince they would have the proper time and heat; and, in this caſe, hens would be ſometimes oviparous, ſometimes vivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parous<note n="*" place="bottom">I know of no perſon, except Dr. Michael Lyzeruts, who ſaw a viviparous hen.

               <p>Hens lay through the whole year, except the time of moulting, which generally laſts ſix weeks or two months, about the end of autumn and the beginning of the winter. This moulting is nothing but the ſhedding of the old feathers, which are detached like the old leaves of trees and the antlers of ſtags, being excluded by the growth of the new. The Cocks alſo ſuffer this renovation; but it is remarkable that the new feathers ſometimes aſſume a different colour. One of our obſervers has noticed this fact in a hen and a cock, and every perſon may remark it in many other kinds of birds, particularly in thoſe that are brought from Bengal, which change their tints at almoſt every moulting; and, in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, the colours of the firſt feathers, in by far the greateſt number of birds, are different from what they afterwards become.</p>
               <p>The ordinary fecundity of hens is limited to the laying an egg each day. There are ſome, it is ſaid, in Samogitia<note n="†" place="bottom">

                  </note>, and other places, that lay twice a-day. Ariſtotle mentions certain hens of Illyria, which laid ſo often as thrice a-day;
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:1084500102:77"/>
and it is probable that theſe were the ſame with the Adrian or Adriatic hens, of which he ſpeaks in another place, and which were noted for their prolific quality. Some add, that there is a peculiar mode of feeding common hens, which gives them this prodigious fecundity. Heat is very favourable; hens can be brought to lay in winter by keeping them in a ſtable, where there is always warm dung on which they can ſit.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as an egg is laid it begins to perſpire, and loſes every day ſome grains of its weight by the evaporation of the more volatile juices: in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, it thickens, hardens, and dries; or it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts an offenſive ſmell, and becomes totally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit for hatching. The art of long preſerving eggs conſiſts in checking the perſpiration<note n="*" place="bottom">The <hi>Journal Economique</hi> for the month of March 1755 men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions three eggs, fit for eating, found in Italy, in the heart of a wall built 300 years ago.

of ardent deſire; that he darts upon the hen, who receives him, bending her legs, ſquatting on the ground, and laying aſide the two fans of feathers which compoſe her tail; that then he ſeizes with his bill the creſt or tuft on the head of the female, either by way of careſſing her, or of keeping his balance; that he bends the hind part of his body, where his double yard is lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and applies it briſkly where the correſpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing orifice is placed; that this copulation laſts the ſhorter time the oftener it is repeated, and that the Cock ſeems to boaſt of his performance by clapping his wings, and by a kind of crowing of joy or victory; that he has teſticles, and that his ſeminal liquor is contained, like that of the quadrupeds, in ſpermatic veſſels. I have aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, by my own obſervations, that the ſemen of the hen is lodged in the <hi>cicatricula</hi> of each egg, as that of the female quadrupeds is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in the glandular bodies of the teſticles; but I am uncertain whether the double <hi>penis</hi> of the Cock, or only one of them, penetrates the female orifice, and even whether there is a real inſertion or only a ſtrong compreſſion or mere contact.

She has entruſted this charge chiefly to the mother, by inſpiring the inſtinct of cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the eggs. In moſt hens this propenſity is felt as ſtrongly, and marked by as ſignificant ſigns as copulation, to which it ſucceeds in the order of nature, and even though it is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited by the preſence of an egg. A hen that has juſt laid, is kindled with tranſports that are communicated to others which are only mere ſpectators, and they all join in the repeated clamorous burſts of joy; either becauſe the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den ceſſation of the pains of delivery is always accompanied with a lively pleaſure, or that the mother then anticipates all the delights of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geny. Whatever be the cauſe, certain it is, that when ſhe has laid twenty-five or thirty eggs, ſhe deliberately prepares to ſit on them. If they be continually taken from her, ſhe will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps lay twice or thrice as many, and become exhauſted by the mere exceſs of fecundity. But the time at laſt comes, when ſhe is driven by the force of inſtinct to ſeek to hatch, and expreſſes her wants by a particular ſort of clucking, and by certain unambiguous motions and attitudes.

                  </note>. It may perhaps be worthy of remark, that the condition of
ſitting hen, however inſipid it appears to us, is perhaps not a tedious
ſituation, but a ſtate of continual joy, the more delicious as it is the
more choice; ſo much has Nature connected raptures with whatever relates to
the multiplication of her creatures!</p>
               <p>The effect of incubation is confined merely to the development of the embryo of the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:1084500102:83"/>
chick, which, as we have already ſaid, exiſts al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready formed in the <hi>cicatricula</hi> of the fecundated egg. The following is nearly the order in which this developement is made, or rather as it appears to the obſerver; and as I have elſewhere given a pretty full account of the facts relating to this ſubject, I ſhall only repeat the more important circumſtances.</p>
               <p>At the end of five or ſix hours, the head of the chick is diſtinctly ſeen joined to the dorſal ſpine, ſwimming in the liquor, with which the ſpeck in the centre of the <hi>cicatricula</hi> is filled; and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the cloſe of the firſt day, the head is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready bent back by its enlargement.</p>
               <p>On the ſecond day are perceived the firſt traces of the <hi>vertebrae,</hi> which are like ſmall globules diſpoſed on the two ſides of the middle of the ſpine; the wings and umbilical veſſels alſo begin to appear, diſtinguiſhed by their dull colour; the neck and breaſt are unfolded, and the head conſtantly increaſes; the outlines of the eyes, and the three encircling coats, as well as the ſpine and membranes, are now ſeen. The life of the foetus is decided; the heart beats, and the blood circulates.</p>
               <p>On the third day, the whole is more diſtinct and expanded. It is remarkable, that the heart hangs out of the breaſt, and beats three times in ſucceſſion; once, in receiving from the auricle the blood contained in the veins; a ſecond time, in diſcharging it into the arteries; and a third
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:1084500102:84"/>
time, in forcing it into the umbilical veſſels; and this motion continues for twenty-four hours after the embryo has been ſeparated from the white of its egg. We alſo diſcover the veins and arteries on the veſicles of the brain, and the rudiments of the ſpinal marrow beginning to extend along the <hi>vertebrae.</hi> Laſtly, we ſee the whole foetus enveloped in a part of the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounding liquor which has acquired a greater conſiſtence than the reſt.</p>
               <p>On the fourth day the eyes are conſiderably advanced; we can diſtinguiſh the pupil, the cryſtalline lens, and the vitreous humour. We alſo perceive in the head five veſicles filled with a fluid which, approaching each other, and gradually coaleſcing on the following days, form at laſt the brain inveſted with its coats. The wings grow, the thighs begin to appear, and the body to acquire bulk. On the fifth day the whole body is covered with an unctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous fleſh; the heart is confined by a very thin membrane, which ſpreads over the cheſt; and the umbilical veſſels riſe out of the abdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men<note n="*" place="bottom">The veſſels which ſpread in the yolk of the egg, and which are conſequently without the abdomen, ſoon retire into the cavity, according to the remark of Steno. <bibl>

                     </bibl>
                  </note>.</p>
               <p>The ſixth day the ſpinal marrow, being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into two parts, continues to ſtretch along the trunk; the liver, which was before whitiſh,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:1084500102:85"/>
is now become of a duſky colour; the heart beats with its two ventricles; the body of the chick is covered with a ſkin, and even the feathers begin to ſprout.</p>
               <p>It is eaſy, on the ſeventh day, to diſtinguiſh the bill; the brain, the wings, the thighs, and the legs, have acquired their perfect ſhape; the two ventricles of the heart appear like two bubbles, contiguous and joined above to the ſubſtance of the auricles. Two ſucceſſive mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are obſerved in the ventricles, as well as in the auricles, which reſemble two ſeparate hearts.</p>
               <p>About the end of the ninth day the lungs appear, and are of a whitiſh colour. On the tenth day the muſcles of the wings are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely formed, and the feathers continue to ſhoot. It is not till the eleventh day that we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the arteries, which were before at a diſtance from the heart, cohere to it; and this organ is now perfect and united into two ventricles.</p>
               <p>The following days are ſpent in the farther expanſion of the parts, which continues till the chick breaks its ſhell; and this happens com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly the twenty-firſt day, ſometimes the eighteenth, and at others, the twenty-ſeventh.</p>
               <p>All this train of phaenomena, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents ſo intereſting a ſpectacle to the obſerver, is the effect of incubation by a hen; and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man induſtry has found it not beneath its no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice to imitate the proceſs. Formerly, the rude
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:1084500102:86"/>
peaſants of Egypt, and in our own times phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers, have ſucceeded in hatching eggs, as well as the moſt careful ſitter, and have given birth to amazing numbers at once. The whole ſecret conſiſts in keeping the eggs at a tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which nearly correſponds to the warmth of the hen, and in preventing every kind of humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity and pernicious exhalations, ſuch as thoſe of charcoal, burning fuel, and even that of tainted eggs. By obſerving theſe two conditions, and being attentive in repeatedly ſhifting the eggs, and varying the place of the oven or ſtove where the baſkets are placed, ſo that not only each egg, but every part of it may enjoy alike the requiſite heat, we ſhall ſucceed in hatching mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of chickens.</p>
               <p>Every kind of heat is favourable; nor is the warmth of the hen better than that of any other animal, not even excepting man<note n="*" place="bottom">When Livia was pregnant, ſhe cheriſhed an egg in her boſom, with a view of foretelling the ſex of her expected child from that of the chicken which would be hatched. It was a cock, and ſhe had a boy. The augurs turned the accident to their advantage, and endeavoured to convince the incredulous of the reality of their art. But what was better proved is, that the heat of the human body is ſufficient for the incubation of eggs.</note>, nor than the ſolar or terreſtrial fires, or the heat of a bed of oak-bark or dung. The eſſential point is to be able to regulate the heat; to increaſe or dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh at pleaſure. We can always know the degree by means of good thermometers placed in different parts within the oven or ſtove; we
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:1084500102:87"/>
can preſerve the heat, by ſtopping the openings and ſhutting the regiſters of the lid; we can augment it with warm aſhes, if it be an oven, or by adding wood, if a ſtove; or uſing chafing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſhes, if it be a bed; and we can diminiſh it, by opening the regiſters to give acceſs to the external air, or at leaſt by introducing into the oven cold bodies, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But, whatever attention be beſtowed in regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating the furnace, it is hardly poſſible to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain conſtantly, and without interruption, the 32d<note n="*" place="bottom">104°, Farenheit.</note> degree of heat, which is that of the hen. Fortunately, this limit is not very determined; and a heat varying from the 38th<note n="†" place="bottom">117°½, F.</note> to the 24th<note n="‡" place="bottom">86°, F.</note> degree, is found to occaſion no incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience. But it is to be obſerved, that the exceſs is more to be dreaded than the defect, and that a few hours at the 38th degree, or even the 36°<note n="§" place="bottom">113°, F.</note>, is more injurious than ſome days at 24°. And a proof that a ſtill leſs heat would occaſion no inconvenience is, that a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridge's neſt being diſcovered in a meadow that was mowing, they were kept in the ſhade for thirty-ſix hours, (no hen being found during that time to cover them,) and yet they all hatched at the end of three days, except thoſe which were opened to perceive what condition they were in. They were indeed very far ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:1084500102:88"/>
and it undoubtedly required a greater degree of heat at the beginning than near the cloſe of the incubation, when the heat of the little chick was almoſt alone ſufficient for its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velopment.</p>
               <p>With regard to humidity, as it is very hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to the progreſs of incubation, we muſt be furniſhed with certain means of diſcovering whether it has penetrated into the oven, and be able to expel it, if it has penetrated, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent its return.</p>
               <p>The hygrometer, which is the ſimpleſt and fitteſt for eſtimating the humidity of the air in theſe ſorts of ovens, is a cold egg introduced and kept ſome time, till it acquire a proper heat. If, at the end of a quarter of an hour or more, the egg is covered with a light dew, ſuch as that formed by the breath on poliſhed glaſs, or what falls on the outſide of a tumbler in which a freez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mixture is made, this is a proof that the air of the oven is too humid; and the more ſo, the longer time the moiſture takes to diſſipate. This happens chiefly in a tan-bed, and in dung com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſts incloſed in a confined place. The beſt way to remedy this inconvenience is to renew the air, where it is cloſe, by means of currents produced by oppoſite windows; or, inſtead of theſe, by fixing ventilators proportioned to the ſpace. Sometimes the mere perſpiration of the immenſe number of eggs occaſions an exceſs of humidity in the oven itſelf: in this caſe
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:1084500102:89"/>
the baſkets with the eggs ought to be taken out, for a few minutes, every two or three days, and fanned with a hat, waving it in different di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections.</p>
               <p>But it is not enough that the moiſture which collects within the oven be expelled; we muſt prevent the entrance of humidity from without, by lining the inſide with ſheet-lead, good ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, plaſter, a proper mixture of pitch and tar, or at leaſt by ſpreading it over with ſeveral coats of oil, and allowing this to dry, and glu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the interior ſurface ſtripes of bladder or of grey paper.</p>
               <p>To theſe few eaſy practical operations is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the whole art of artificial incubation; and hence are deduced the ſtructure and dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the ovens or ſtoves, the number, ſhape, and diſtribution of the baſkets, and all the little manoeuvres which the circumſtances require, or the occaſion ſuggeſts, which have been deſcribed with a profuſion of words, but which we ſhall compriſe in a few lines, without omitting any thing eſſential.</p>
               <p>The ſimpleſt oven is a caſk lined within with glued paper, and ſtopped at the head with a cover which joins into it, and which is perforated in the middle by a large opening, that ſhuts with a grooved lid, to allow an opportunity of exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining the oven. There are ſeveral other ſmall holes round this, which ſerve as regiſters to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate the heat, and which can alſo be ſtopped
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:1084500102:90"/>
with grooved covers. This caſk is buried three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourths of its height in warm dung. In the inſide there are placed, one above another, at proper diſtances, two or three wide-ribbed baſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets, in each of which two rows of eggs are piled, taking care that the upper layer be thinner than the lower, ſo that this may be eaſily ſeen through the other. Small holes may be made, if we chuſe, in the centre of each baſket; and well-graduated thermometers ſuſpended there, and others placed in different parts of the circumference. Thus the requiſite heat may be maintained, and the chickens uſhered into life.</p>
               <p>If we would be oeconomical of heat, and draw utility from what is commonly loft, we may employ, for artificial incubation, that of the ovens for bakers and paſtry-cooks, of forges, and glaſs-houſes, and even that of a chamber-ſtove, or a kitchen-grate, conſtantly keeping in mind that the ſucceſs will depend chiefly on the equal diſtribution of heat, and the total exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of humidity.</p>
               <p>When the ovens are large and well-managed, they exclude thouſands of chickens at a time. This profuſion would be rather inconvenient in a climate like ours, if we had not as well diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered a method of rearing the brood indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently of the aſſiſtance of the hen, as of hatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them without her incubation. This conſiſts in a more or leſs perfect imitation of the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:1084500102:91"/>
in which the mother treats her young after they have emerged from the ſhell.</p>
               <p>We ſhall eaſily conceive, that the mother which ſhews ſo ſtrong an inclination to cover her eggs, ſits on them with ſuch unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting aſſiduity, and takes ſo lively a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern for embryos that have yet no being, will not cool in her attachment after her chickens are hatched. Her affection is heightened by the ſight of theſe little creatures, that owe to her their exiſtence; it is every day increaſed by the repetition of cares which their feebleneſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires. Continually employed in watching over them, ſhe ſeeks food, merely to ſatisfy their craving wants. If ſhe cannot find it, ſhe ſcrapes the earth with her nails to extract the nouriſhment concealed in its boſom, and freely beſtows it on her young. She recals them when they wander, ſpreads her wings over them to defend them againſt the inclemency of the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and broods a ſecond time. She enters into theſe tender concerns with ſo much ardour and anxiety, that her health is viſibly impaired, and ſhe can be diſtinguiſhed from every other hen by her ruffled feathers, her trailing wings: and the hoarſeneſs of her voice, and the different inflections, are all expreſſive of her ſituation, and mark ſolicitude and maternal affection.</p>
               <p>But if ſhe neglects herſelf in preſerving her young, ſhe expoſes herſelf to every danger in their defence. If a ſparrow-hawk appear in the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:1084500102:92"/>
air, this mother, ſo feeble, ſo timid, and which in every other circumſtance would conſult her ſafety by flight, becomes intrepid, from the warmth of attachment, darts before the dreaded talon, and by her repeated cries, the clapping her wings, and her undaunted reſolution, ſhe often intimidates the rapacious bird, which, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſed by the unexpected reſiſtance, retires to ſeek eaſier prey. She then ſeems to poſſeſs all the qualities of a generous mind; but what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flects no leſs honour on her inſtinct is, that if ſhe has been made to ſit on ducks eggs, or thoſe of any other water-foul, her affection is no leſs ardent for theſe ſtrangers than for her own progeny. She does not perceive that ſhe is only their nurſe, and not their mother; and when, directed by nature, they plunge into the neighbouring ſtream, it is amuſing to obſerve the aſtoniſhment, uneaſineſs, and vexation of the poor nurſe, who fancies ſhe is ſtill a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; impelled on the one hand by the deſire of following them into the midſt of the water, checked on the other by the invincible repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to that element, teaſing herſelf with fruitleſs buſtling along the margin, trembling, forlorn, beholding her family in imminent dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and not daring to afford them help.</p>
               <p>It would be impoſſible to ſupply all the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duities of the hen in raiſing her young, if the ſame degree of attention were required, and an equal affection with that of the mother. We
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:1084500102:93"/>
ſhall ſucceed by noticing the principal circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances in the conduct of the hen to her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geny, and by imitating them as much as we can. For example, it being obſerved, that the chief object of the mother's attention is to lead the chickens where they can find food, and to guard them againſt cold and the inclemency of the weather; a plan has been formed to effect this, and with even more advantage than from the aſſiſtance of the hen herſelf. If they be hatched in winter, they are kept a month or ſix weeks in a ſtove, heated to the ſame degree with the ovens for incubation, and only let out five or ſix times a-day to eat in open air, and eſpecially to enjoy the ſun. The warmth of the ſtove pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motes their growth, and the expoſure to the air ſtrengthens and braces them. Crumbs of bread, yolks of eggs, and millet ſeeds, are their firſt food. If the incubation be performed in ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, they are kept in the ſtove only three or four days; and in all ſeaſons they are brought out of the ſtove only to be put into the crib, which is a kind of ſquare cage, ſhut with a front of grating made of iron wire, or ſimple netting, and cloſed above with a hinged lid. In this cage the chickens are fed; but after they have eaten enough, and taken ſufficient exerciſe, they muſt be ſheltered ſo as to allow them to enjoy warmth and repoſe. Hence the chickens that are led by their mother are accuſtomed to aſſemble under the covert of her wings. For this purpoſe Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:1084500102:94"/>
contrived an <hi>artificial mother</hi>; this is a box formed of ſheeps ſkin, the bottom of which is ſquare, and the upper part ſloped like the top of a deſk. He places this box on one of the ends of the crib, in ſuch a ſituation that the chickens may enter eaſily, and walk round the three ſides at leaſt; he warms it below by means of a foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtove, which he refreſhes occaſionally. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination of the cover of this kind of deſk allows the chickens to place themſelves according to their different ſizes; but as they have a practice, eſpecially when they are cold, of preſſing toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and even climbing on each other, and in this crowd the weak and ſmall ones run the riſk of being ſmothered, this <hi>artificial mother</hi> is kept open at both ends, or rather both ends are co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with a net which the leaſt chicken can remove, ſo as eaſily to eſcape when it feels itſelf too much ſqueezed; and it can then, by going round to the other hole, chuſe a leſs dangerous place. Reamur endeavours to avoid even this inconvenience by another precaution, which is to keep the cover ſloped ſo low as to prevent the chickens from climbing on each other; and he raiſes it gradually as they grow. He improves ſtill on this idea, by dividing his largeſt cribs into two, by means of a tranſverſe partition, ſo as to be able to ſeparate the chickens of different ſizes. He even places the cribs on wheels, that they may be eaſily tranſported; for they muſt be brought into a chamber always in the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:1084500102:95"/>
and even during the day-time when the weather is bad; and in winter this chamber muſt be warmed. But when it is neither cold nor rainy, the cribs ought to be expoſed to the open air and the ſun, only taking the precau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſheltering them from the wind. The doors may even be left open, and the chickens will ſoon learn to come out to ſcrape the dung, or peck the tender graſs, and return to their food, or to recover their warmth under their artificial mother. If we would not hazard their ſauntering at will, we may place at the end of their crib an ordinary hen-crib, which, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating with the firſt, will allow them a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable ſpace to roam in, and at the ſame time prevent accidents.</p>
               <p>But the more we confine them, the more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular we ought to be in giving them food. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides millet-ſeeds, yolks of eggs, ſoup, and crumbs of bread, young poultry are fond of rape-ſeed, hemp-ſeed, and other ſmall grains of that kind; peaſe, beans, lentils, rice, ſhelled barley and oats, chopped turkey beans, and buck-wheat. It is proper, and even oeconomical, to burſt moſt of theſe in boiling water, before we offer them; the ſaving amounts to a fifth on the wheat, two fifths on the barley, one half on the turkey beans, but is nothing on the oats and buck-wheat. It would even be a loſs to ſoak the barley; but this grain is what the chickens ſhew the moſt indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference for. Laſtly, after they have grown, we
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:1084500102:96"/>
may give them every thing that we eat ourſelves, except bitter almonds<note n="*" place="bottom">

this ſort of food, that one would imagine that they are carni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorous, and
perhaps nothing is wanting to them, as well as to many others, but a hooked
bill and claws, to conſtitute them real birds of prey.</p>
               <p>It muſt however be admitted, that poultry differ from birds of prey, no leſs by their mode of digeſtion and the ſtructure of their ſtomach, than by their bill and their nails. In theſe the ſtomach is membranous, and digeſtion is effected by means of a ſolvent, which varies in different ſpecies, but the action of which is well aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained<note n="‡" place="bottom">
                     <bibl>Memories de l'Academie Royale des Sciences, an. 1752, p. 266.</bibl>
                  </note>; whereas the gallinaceous tribe may be conſidered as having three ſtomachs; <hi>viz.</hi> 1. The craw, which is a kind of membranous bag, where the grains are firſt macerated and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to be reduced to a pap: 2. The wideſt part of the canal, lying between the craw and the gizzard, but neareſt the laſt; it is lined with a
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:1084500102:97"/>
number of ſmall glands, which furniſh a liquor that the food imbibes in its paſſage: 3. Laſtly, The gizzard, which yields a liquor that is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly acid, ſince the internal coat, being ſoaked in water, becomes an excellent runnet for curd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling milk. This third ſtomach completes, by the powerful action of its muſcles, what had only been begun in the two firſt. The force of its fibres is greater than could be conceived; in leſs than four hours a ball of glaſs, which could ſuſtain a preſſure of four pounds, is reduced to an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palpable powder. In forty-eight hours, ſeveral tubes of glaſs, four lines in diameter and one line thick, were divided longitudinally into two kinds of rents; and, at the end of that time, all the ſharp edges were ground down, and the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh deſtroyed, particularly on the convex part. The gizzard was alſo able to flatten tubes of tinned iron, and, in the ſpace of twenty-four hours, to cruſh ſeventeen nuts; and this was effected by repeated compreſſions and alternate attrition, the mechaniſm of which it is difficult to perceive. Reaumur, who made ſeveral trials to diſcover it, never could diſtinguiſh but once any conſiderable motions in that part. He ſaw in a capon the gizzard, of which he had brought into view portions, contracting and ſink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and again ſwelling; he obſerved a kind of fleſhy chords which formed on the ſurface, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther appeared to be forming, becauſe he made in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſions between them which ſeparated them; and
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:1084500102:98"/>
all theſe motions appeared to be propagated in waves, and very ſlowly.</p>
               <p>What proves that, in gallinaceous birds, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion is performed chiefly by the action of the muſcles of the gizzard, and not by the power of any ſolvent, is, that if one of theſe be made to ſwallow a ſmall lead tube, open at both ends, but ſo thick as to reſiſt the compreſſion of the giz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, and into which a grain of barley be intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, the tube will be found in the ſpace of two days to have loſt conſiderably of its weight; but the grain incloſed, though it were boiled and ſhelled, will then be diſcovered to be ſomewhat ſwelled, but as little altered as if it had been left the ſame time in another place equally humid; whereas the ſame grain, and others that are much harder, if not protected by a tube, would be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted in much leſs time.</p>
               <p>One circumſtance which may aſſiſt the action of the gizzard is, that birds keep the cavity as full as poſſible, and thus the four muſcles of which it conſiſts are thrown into play. When grain is wanting, they cramb it with herbage, and even ſmall flints, the hardneſs and rough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of which contribute to bruiſe the grain againſt which they are inceſſantly rubbed. I ſay by their roughneſs; for, when they are poliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they quickly paſs through the body, and thoſe with rugged ſurfaces only remain. They are the more numerous in the gizzard the ſcarcer the food is, and they continue in it a longer
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:1084500102:99"/>
time than any other ſubſtance, whether digeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ible or indigeſtible.</p>
               <p>We ſhall not be ſurpriſed that the inner coat of this ſtomach is ſtrong enough to reſiſt the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action of ſo many hard bodies on which it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly grinds, if we conſider that it is really very thick, and of a ſubſtance analogous to horn. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, we know that bits of wood and leather, which are rubbed with an extremely hard pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to poliſh bodies, laſt for a very long time.</p>
               <p>We may alſo ſuppoſe that this membrane is renewed in the ſame manner as the callous ſkin of labourers hands.</p>
               <p>But though the ſmall ſtones may aſſiſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion, it is not aſſerted that the granivorous birds have a decided view in ſwallowing them. Redi having ſhut up two capons, with water and little pebbles for their food; they drank much water, and died; the one in twenty days, the other in twenty-four, and both of them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out having ſwallowed a ſingle ſtone. Redi found many in the gizzard, but theſe were what had been ſwallowed before.</p>
               <p>The organs that are deſtined for reſpiration, conſiſt of lungs, ſimilar to thoſe of the land ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, with ten air cells, eight of which are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the breaſt, and communicate directly with the lungs; and two larger ones in the lower belly, and which communicate with the eight preced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. When in inſpiration the thorax is dilated, the air enters by the larynx into the lungs, thence
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:1084500102:100"/>
into the eight upper air cells, which dilating in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hale that alſo of the two cells of the lower belly, and theſe ſuffer a proportional collapſe. When, on the contrary, the lungs and upper cells, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting during expiration, preſs the air included in their cavity, it eſcapes partly through the larynx, and partly returns from the eight cells in the breaſt into the two in the lower belly, which then dilate by a mechaniſm nearly ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logous to that of a double bellows. But this is not the proper place to explain the mechaniſm; it will be ſufficient to obſerve, that in thoſe birds which never fly, as the caſſowary, the oſtrich, &amp;c. and in thoſe that fly tardily, ſuch as the gallinaceous tribe, the fourth cell on each ſide is the ſmalleſt<note n="*" place="bottom">

               <p>All theſe differences in the ſtructure neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly imply many others, not to ſpeak of the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branous tubes that are obſerved in ſome birds.

This anatomiſt affirms, that he has aſcertained, by repeated trials, that if this coat be perforated, the voice is immediately impaired, and can be reſtored only by cloſing the hole accurately to vent the eſcape of the air<note n="*" place="bottom">

               <p>After obſerving ſuch wide differences in the conformation of the organs of the voice, will it not appear ſingular, that birds, with a tongue of cartilage, and lips of horn, ſhould imitate our ſongs, and even our ſpeech, more eaſily than thoſe among the quadrupeds that reſemble man the moſt? So difficult it is to judge of the uſe of the parts from their mere ſtructure, and ſo true, that the modification of the voice and of ſounds depends almoſt entirely on the ſenſibility of the ear.</p>
               <p>The inteſtinal canal is very long in the gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linaceous tribe, and exceeds about five times that of the animal, reckoning from the point of the bill to the <hi>anus.</hi> We find two <hi>caeca,</hi> about ſix inches in length, which take their riſe where the

The organs characteriſtic of the ſexes are alſo perceived; viz. in hens, the <hi>vulva</hi> or oriſice of the <hi>oviductus,</hi> and in Cocks the two yards, that is, the paps of the two ſpermatic veſſels.

               <p>It was known in the time of Ariſtotle, that the Cock had teſticles concealed within its body. The ancients even aſcribed to this ſituation the fiery paſſion of the male for the female, who is leſs ardent, they alleged, becauſe the ovarium be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing placed near the diaphragm, is more apt to be cooled by the acceſſion of the air reſpired<note n="*" place="bottom">

                  </note>. Sometimes the male has only one, but generally two; the bulk of theſe kinds of glands is far from being proportioned to that of the bird. In the eagle, they are only of the ſize of peas; in
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:1084500102:103"/>
a Cock of four months old, they are as large as olives. The bulk varies not only between one ſpecies and another, but between different indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals of the ſame ſpecies, and is moſt expanded in the ſeaſon of love. But how diminutive ſoever be their ſize, they produce mighty effects in the animal oeconomy, as is evinced by the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful changes effected by their extirpation. This operation is commonly performed when the bird is three or four months old. After emaſculation it grows plumper, and its fleſh becomes more juicy and delicate; and when ſubjected to a che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical analyſis, yields different products from what it would have given before caſtration<note n="*" place="bottom">The extract of the lean of a capon is ſomewhat leſs than the fortieth part of its total weight; whereas it amounts to one twelfth in a pullet, and rather more than one ſeventh in a Cock.

                  </note>. The capon is no longer liable to moult; in the ſame manner as
the buck, when degraded from his ſex, never caſts his antlers. The note is
al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, his voice is broken, and ſeldom heard: treated roughly by the
Cocks, with diſdain by the females, deprived of all the appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites related to
generation, it is not only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from the ſociety of its equals, but
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truded, as it were, from its ſpecies. It is an idle ſolitary out-caſt,
all whoſe powers are directed on itſelf, and whoſe ſole object is its
individual <pb n="96" facs="tcp:1084500102:104"/> preſervation: to eat, to ſleep, to fatten,
are its principal employments, and conſtitute the ſum of its wants. But, by
a little attention, we can draw advantage from its weakneſs, and even its
conſequent docility, by giving it uſeful habits. For inſtance, we can
teach it to rear and tend young chickens. For this purpoſe it muſt be kept
ſome days in a dark place, only bringing it out at regular hours to feed, and
accuſtoming it gradually to the ſight and company of a few chickens that
are pretty ſtout; it will ſoon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract a fondneſs for them, and will
lead them with as much affection and aſſiduity as their mother. It will
even conduct a greater number than a hen; for its wings ſpread and afford
more ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and the hen, freed from its toil and ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citude, will
ſoon begin again to lay; and thus the capon, though condemned to ſterility,
will ſtill contribute indirectly to the preſervation and multiplication of
its ſpecies.</p>
               <p>So great a change produced in the character of the capon, by a cauſe ſo weak and apparently ſo inadequate to the effect, is the more remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, as it is confirmed by an immenſe number of trials which men have made on other ſpecies, and have even dared to extend to their brethren of the human race.</p>
               <p>The Cock has been the ſubject of another ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment that is far leſs cruel, but perhaps no leſs important for the ſcience of phyſiology: it

is, after cutting the comb<note n="*" place="bottom">The reaſon why thè capon's comb is cut is, that, after emaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation, it does not ſtand erect but becomes pendulous, and would therefore prove inconvenient by hiding an eye.</note> as uſual, to ſubſtitute in its ſtead one of the young ſpurs which has juſt begun to ſhoot; thus engrafted, it gradually ſtrikes root into the fleſh, thence extracts its nouriſhment, and often grows more luxuriantly than it would in its natural place. Some have attained to two inches and a half in length, and more than three lines and a half in diameter at the baſe; ſometimes they are twiſted round like the horns of a ram, at other times bent back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards like thoſe of a he-goat<note n="†" place="bottom">

               <p>This is a kind of animal engrafting, the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of which would appear very doubtful when firſt tried, but from which, ſince the ſucceſs is known, it is aſtoniſhing that no practical in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation has been derived. In general, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive experiments have been more ſtudied, and purſued with more ardour, than thoſe which are directed to preſervation; becauſe man is fonder of pleaſure and expence, than the acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of knowledge and the exerciſe of bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence. Chickens are not hatched with that creſt and thoſe reddiſh membranes which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh them from other birds. It is a month after they have left the ſhell before theſe parts begin to unfold; at two months old, the young
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:1084500102:106"/>
Cocks crow, and fight with one another. They feel that they muſt hate each other, though the ſource of their diſlike has yet no exiſtence. It is commonly five or ſix months before they ſhew any paſſion for the hens, and that theſe begin to lay. In both ſexes, the complete term of their growth is a year, or fifteen months. The young hens, it is ſaid, lay more; but the old ones are better ſitters. This period of their growth would imply that the ordinary extent of their life does not exceed ſeven or eight years, if the ſame proportion ſubſiſted in birds as in quadrupeds. But we have ſeen that this is much longer; a Cock will live twenty years in the domeſtic condition, and perhaps thirty years in the ſtate of liberty. Unfortunately for them, we have no intereſt in ſuffering them to reach to a great age. The hens and capons that are deſtined for the table, never enjoy above one year's exiſtence; and moſt of them have only one ſeaſon. Thoſe which are ſelected for the multiplication of the ſpecies, become ſoon exhauſted, and none are permitted to finiſh the period aſſigned by nature; ſo that it is a ſingular accident, that cocks have ever been ſeen to die of age.</p>

                     </bibl> Obſerve, however, that the art of fattening capons was introduced by the Armenian merchants into Perſia from Europe, as appears from Tavernier.</note>, Perſia is the native region of Cocks; there they are numerous,
and held in great eſtimation, eſpecially by certain der<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſes, who
conſider them as living clocks; and it is well known that a clock is the
ſoul of every ſociety of derviſes.</p>
               <p>Dampier ſays, that he ſaw and killed, in the iſlands of Poulocondor, wild Cocks, that were not larger than our crows; and whoſe crow was much like that of our dunghill Cocks, only ſhriller. In another part he adds, that there are ſome in the iſland of Timor, and at St. Jago, one of the Cape de Verd iſlands. Gemelli Carreri relates that he obſerved ſome in the Philippines; and Merolla aſſerts that there are wild hens in the kingdom of Congo, which are more beautiful, and have a more delicate fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, than our domeſtic kind; but that the Negroes ſet little value on theſe birds.</p>
               <p>From their native climate, whereſoever it be, theſe birds have ſpread over the extent of the ancient Continent, from China to Cape Verd; and from the Southern Ocean to the Seas of the North. Theſe migrations were performed in remote ages, far beyond the reach of hiſtorical
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:1084500102:108"/>
tradition. But their ſettlement in the New World ſeems to be a much more recent event. The hiſtorian of the Incas informs us, that there were none at Peru before its conqueſt, and that after a reſidence of more than thirty years, the hens could not be habituated to hatch in the valley of Cuſco. Coreal poſitively aſſerts, that poultry were introduced by the Spaniards into Brazil, and that the inhabitants of that country would eat none of them, and looked upon their eggs as a kind of poiſon. Nor, according to the teſtimony of F. Charlevoix, had the natives of St. Domingo any; and Oviedo conſiders it as a certain fact, that they were carried from Europe to America. Acoſta indeed maintains the oppoſite opinion, that hens exiſted in Peru before the arrival of the Spaniards; and alleges as a proof, that the natives call the bird, in their language, <hi>gualpa,</hi> and its egg <hi>ponto.</hi> But the antiquity of the word is not ſufficient to eſtabliſh that of the thing denoted; for it is eaſy to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that ſavages, the firſt time they ſaw a ſtrange bird, would naturally give it a name, either from its reſemblance to ſome bird with which they were acquainted, or from ſome other analogy. What would determine me in favour of the firſt opinion is, the conformity to the law of the climate. This law, though it cannot be applied in general to birds, eſpecially thoſe which are vigorous on the wing, and to which all countries are open, yet regulates thoſe
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:1084500102:109"/>
which, like the poultry, being bulky and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an averſion to water, can neither waft their courſe through the air like the birds that ſoar, nor croſs the ſeas, nor even the large rivers, like the quadrupeds that ſwim, and would therefore be for ever excluded, but for the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of man, from thoſe countries which are ſeparated by an immenſe ocean. The Cock is then an animal which belongs peculiarly to the Ancient Continent, and ought to be added to the liſt that I have given, of all thoſe animals which exiſted not in the New World before it was diſcovered.</p>
               <p>In proportion as hens are removed from their native region, and accuſtomed to another cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate and different food, they muſt ſuffer ſome alteration in their ſhape, or rather in the parts moſt ſuſceptible of change. Hence undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly thoſe varieties that conſtitute the different breeds which I am to deſcribe; varieties which are conſtantly perpetuated in each climate, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the continued action of the ſame cauſes that produced them at firſt, or from the attention that is paid in matching the individuals ſelected for propagation.</p>
               <p>It is to be wiſhed that we could here form, as in the caſe of the dog, a kind of genealogical tree of all families of the Cock, which would point out the primitive ſtock, and its different branches, and repreſent the various orders of alterations and changes correſponding to its dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:1084500102:110"/>
ſtates. But this would require more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curate and more minute accounts than thoſe in our poſſeſſion. I ſhall therefore content myſelf with giving my opinion in regard to the hen of our own climate, and ſhall endeavour to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine into it's origin; but previous to this inquiry, I ſhall enumerate the foreign breeds that have been deſcribed by naturaliſts, or only mentioned by travellers.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The Common Cock.</hi> That of our own climate.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The Creſted Cock.</hi> It is diſtinguiſhed from the Common Cock by a tuft of feathers riſing on the head, and by its comb, which is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſmaller; probably becauſe the food, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of being ſpent on the comb alone, is partly diſtributed to nouriſh the feathers. Some tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers aſſert that the Mexican poultry are creſted; theſe, as well as all the reſt on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent of America, have been introduced from the ancient continent. The breed of the creſted hens is that which the curious have moſt culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated, and what generally happens when things are cloſely examined, they have obſerved a great number of differences, particularly in the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours of their plumage; which ſerve to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh a multitude of races, that are the more eſteemed in proportion to the beauty and rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their tints. Such are the gold and ſilver ones; the black-creſted white ones; the white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creſted black ones; the agate, the chamois, and
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:1084500102:111"/>
the ſlaty; thoſe with fiſh-ſcales, and the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined; the widow-hen, which has ſmall white tears ſprinkled on a ſallow ground; the flame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coloured; the ſtony ſort, whoſe plumage has a white ground ſpotted with black, chamois, ſlaty, or golden, &amp;c. But I ſuſpect that theſe differences are not ſo invariable, or ſo deeply impreſſed, as to conſtitute real diſtinct ſpecies, as ſome curious people pretend, who aſſert that many of the above breeds never intermix.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The Wild Cock of Aſia.</hi> This is undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly what approaches the neareſt to the original ſtock of our common kind; for never being fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered by man, or thwarted in the choice of its food or mode of life, what could ever alter its native purity? It is neither the largeſt nor the ſmalleſt of its ſpecies, but is intermediate between the extremes. It is found, as we have already obſerved, in many countries of Aſia, in Africa, and in the Cape de Verd iſlands. We have no deſcription of it ſo complete as to enable us to compare it with our Cock. I muſt here recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to travellers who have an opportunity of ſeeing this wild breed, to inquire if they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct neſts, and in what manner. Lottinger, phyſician of Straſburg, who has made many important obſervations on birds, informs me, that our hens, when left to themſelves, build neſts, and with as much care as the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridges.</p>

The Sieur Fournier informs me, that one of this ſpecies is ſtill living at Paris; it has, according to him, neither comb nor ruff; the head is ſimple like that of the pheaſant.

Beſides the Engliſh Cock excels the French in fighting; it has rather a tuft than a creſt; its neck and bill are more ſlender; and above the noſtrils there are two fleſhy protuberances, which are red like the comb.</p>

Its demeanour is grave and ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; its iris is yellow, and its eyes are encircled with a ring of brown feathers, from which riſes a black tuft that covers the ears. There are other feathers nearly like theſe behind the comb and beneath the barbils, and broad round black ſpots on the breaſt. His legs and feet are of a lead colour, excepting the ſole of the foot, which is yellowiſh.</p>

To propagate it in all its purity, requires that both the parents be covered with down.</p>
               <p n="15">15. <hi>The Negro Cock</hi> has its comb, barbils, epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermis, and perioſteum abſolutely black. Its plumage alſo is generally black, but ſometimes white. It is found in the Philippines, in Java, Delhi, and at St. Jago, one of the Cape de Verd iſlands. Becman affirms that moſt of the birds in the laſt mentioned place have bones as black as jet, and a ſkin black like that of a negroe<note n="*" place="bottom">Dampier.</note>. If this fact be true, we muſt impute it to the tinging quality of their food. We know the effects of madder, and other plants of that genus, and we are informed, that in England the veal is whiten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by feeding the calves with grain and other ſoft aliments, mixed with a certain earth or chalk found in the county of Bedford<note n="†" place="bottom">

there; but as its fleſh, after being dreſſed, is black and unpalatable, it is not likely that the race will be multiplied. When it croſſes the breed with others, varieties of different colours are produced, but which commonly retain the comb and the ruffs, or black barbils; and even the membrane that forms the little ear is tinged with a blackiſh hue on the outſide.</p>

This ſingular change, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by the exceſſive heat of thoſe torrid re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions, is not however ſo great as the loſs of the rump and tail in the gallinaceous tribe. But it appears to me much more curious, that as theſe two tribes of animals are the moſt domeſtic of all, and therefore the wideſt removed from their
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:1084500102:117"/>
natural condition, ſo there is breed of dogs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a tail, as there is of Cocks without a rump. Several years ago, I was ſhewn one of theſe dogs that had been whelped without a tail, but which I then conceived to be a degraded individual, a monſter; and for that reaſon I took no notice of it in the hiſtory of the canine genus. I have again conſidered the ſubject, and I am now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident that it is a conſtant and invariable race, like that of the Rumpleſs Cock. This breed of Cocks has a blue bill and feet; a ſingle or double comb, but no creſt; the plumage is variegated with all the colours; and the Sieur Fournier aſſures me, that when it couples with the ordinary kind, a half-rumped ſort are produced, with ſix feathers in the tail inſtead of twelve.—This may be true, but I can hardly believe it.</p>

               <p>Amidſt the immenſe number of different breeds of the gallinaceous tribe, how ſhall we deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the original ſtock? So many circumſtances have operated, ſo many accidents have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred; the attention, and even the whim of man have ſo much multiplied the varieties, that it appears extremely difficult to trace them to their ſource. The Wild Cocks found in the warm countries of Aſia may indeed be conſidered as the primeval ſtem in thoſe regions. But as in our temperate climates there is no wild bird that perfectly reſembles the Domeſtic Cock, we are at a loſs on which of the varieties to confer the priority. The pheaſant, the grous, the wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hen, are the only birds in the ſtate of nature which are analogous to our poultry; but it is uncertain if they would ever intermix, and have prolific progeny; and they have conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted diſtinct and ſeparate ſpecies from the moſt
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:1084500102:120"/>
remote times. Beſides, they want the combs, the ſpurs, and the pendulous membranes of the gallinaceous tribe. If we exclude all the fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign and wild kinds, we ſhall greatly diminiſh the number of varieties, and the differences will be found to be ſlight. The hens of Caux are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt double the bulk of the ordinary ſort; the Engliſh Cock, though exactly like the French, has much longer legs and feet; others differ on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the length of their feathers; others in the number of their toes; others are diſtinguiſhed by the beauty and ſingularity of their colours, as the Turkiſh and Hamburgh hen: and of theſe ſix varieties, to which the common breed may be reduced, three are to be aſcribed to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of the climate; that of Hamburgh, that of Turkey, and that of England; perhaps alſo the fourth and fifth, for the hen of Caux moſt probably came from Italy, ſince it is alſo called the <hi>hen of Padua,</hi> and the hen with five toes was known in Italy in the time of Columella. Thus there only remain the Common Cock and the Creſted Cock as the natural breed of our country, and even in theſe the two ſexes admit of all the variety of colour. The conſtant cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the tuft ſeems to mark an improved ſpecies; that is, one better kept and better fed; and conſequently the common breed, which has no tuft, muſt be the true parent of our poultry. It would appear that the primitive colour was white, and that all the intermediate ſhades be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:1084500102:121"/>
it and black were ſucceſſively aſſumed. What ſeems to corroborate this conjecture is, an analogy which no perſon has yet remarked, that the colour of the egg generally reſembles that of the plumage of the bird. Thus a raven's eggs are of a green brown, ſpotted with black; thoſe of the keſtril are red; thoſe of the caſſowary dark green; thoſe of the black crow are of a ſtill duller brown than thoſe of the raven; thoſe of the variegated magpie are alſo variegated and ſpotted; thoſe of the great cinereous ſhrike, ſpot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with grey; thoſe of the woodchat, ſpotted with red; thoſe of the goatſucker, mottled with bluiſh and brown ſpots on a cloudy whitiſh ground; thoſe of the ſparrow, cinereous entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, covered with cheſnut ſpots on a grey ground; thoſe of the blackbird, blackiſh blue; thoſe of the grous, whitiſh ſpotted with yellow; thoſe of the pintados, ſpeckled like their plumage, with white round ſpots, &amp;c. In ſhort, there ſeems to be an invariable relation ſubſiſting between the colour of the egg and that of the plumage. The tints are indeed much more dilute on the eggs, and in moſt of them the white predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates; but white is alſo in moſt caſes the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing colour of the plumage, eſpecially in fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males: and ſince hens of all colours, white, black, grey, tawney, and mottled, have white eggs, there is reaſon to conclude, that if they had remained in the ſtate of nature, white would at leaſt have predominated in their plumage. Domeſtication
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:1084500102:122"/>
has introduced various ſhades on the feathers; but as theſe are only accidental and ſuperficial, they have not been able to penetrate internally, or operate any change in the eggs. <note n="A" place="bottom">

               <p>IF the Cock be the moſt uſeful bird in our court-yards, the Turkey is the moſt diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed, by its bulk, by the ſhape of-its head, and certain natural habits poſſeſſed by few ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies. Its head is very ſmall in proportion to its body, and is deſtitute of the uſual decoration; for it is almoſt entirely featherleſs, and, together with a part of the neck, is only covered with a bluiſh ſkin, beſet with red fleſhy <hi>papillae</hi> on the fore part of the neck, and whitiſh <hi>papillae</hi> on the hind part of the head, with ſome ſmall ſtrag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling black hairs, and a few feathers ſtill more rare on the arch of the neck, and which are thicker in the lower part, a circumſtance which has not been noticed by naturaliſts. From the baſe of the bill, a kind of red fleſhy caruncle falls
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:1084500102:125"/>
looſely over a third part of the neck, which at firſt ſight appears ſingle; but when examined is found to be compoſed of a double membrane. A fleſhy protuberance, of a conical ſhape and furrowed with deep tranſverſe wrinkles, riſes from the bottom of the upper mandible. This protuberance is ſcarcely more than an inch long in its natural ſtate of contraction; that is, when the Turkey, ſeeing no objects but thoſe to which it is accuſtomed, and feeling no inward agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, walks calmly ſeeking its food. But, on any unuſual appearance, eſpecially in the ſeaſon of love, this bird, which in its ordinary ſtate is humble and tame, ſwells with inſtant rage; its head and neck become inflated, the conical pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuberance expands, and deſcends two or three inches lower than the bill, which it entirely co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers. All theſe fleſhy parts aſſume at the ſame time a deeper red; it briſtles up the feathers on its neck and back, ſpreads its tail like a fan, while its wings drop and even trail on the ground. In this attitude, he ſometimes ſtruts around his fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male, making a dull ſound, produced by the air eſcaping from the breaſt through the bill, and followed by a long gabbling noiſe. Sometimes he leaves his female to attack thoſe who diſturb him. In both theſe caſes, his motions are compoſed; but they become rapid the inſtant he utters the dull ſound which we have mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. He vents a ſhrill ſcream, which every body knows, which intermits from time to time, and
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:1084500102:126"/>
which he may be made to repeat as often as one chooſes, by whiſtling, or by forming any ſharp tones. He then begins again to wheel round, which action, according as it is directed to his fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male, or pointed at the object that has provoked his diſpleaſure, expreſſes attachment or marks rage: and it is obſerved, that his fits are the moſt vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent at the ſight of red clothes; he is then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed and becomes furious; ruſhes on the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ſtrikes with his bill, and exerts himſelf to the utmoſt to remove an object whoſe preſence he cannot endure.</p>
               <p>It is a curious and very ſingular fact, that the conical caruncle, which lengthens and is relaxed when the bird is agitated by the violence of paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, is relaxed in the ſame manner after death.</p>
               <p>Some Turkies are white, others variegated with black and white, others with white and ruſty yellow, others are of an uniform grey, which are the moſt uncommon of all. But in the greater number the plumage verges on black, with a little white near the ends of the feathers: thoſe which cover the back and the upper ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of the wings are ſquare at the extremities; and among thoſe of the rump, and even of the breaſt, there are ſome with rainbow colours, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by the different rays being reflected according to the various degrees of incidence. As they grow older the tints become more gloſſy, and the reflections more diverſified. Many people imagine that white Turkies are the hardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt;
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:1084500102:127"/>
and, for this reaſon, that breed is preferred in ſome provinces: there are numerous flocks in Pertois in Champaign.</p>
               <p>The naturaliſts have reckoned twenty-eight quills in each wing, and eighteen in the tail. But what is much more ſtriking, and what will readily diſtinguiſh this ſpecies from any other yet known, is a lock of hard black hair, five or ſix inches long, which, in our temperate cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates, riſes from the lower part of the neck in the grown male Turkey on the ſecond year, and ſometimes about the end of the firſt; and before it appears, the place where it emerges is marked by a fleſhy prominence. Linnaeus ſays, that this hair does not ſprout till the third year in the Turkeys bred in Sweden. If the fact be certain, it would follow that this production is the ſlower in proportion to the rigour of the climate; and indeed one of the principal effects of cold is, to check every ſort of growth. This lock of hair is the foundation of the epithet of bearded, <hi>(pectore barbato,)</hi> which has been ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the Turkey; an expreſſion in every reſpect improper, for it does not grow from the breaſt, but from the lower part of the neck; and, beſides, it is not ſufficient that there are hairs; they ought never to receive the name of beard, unleſs they riſe from the chin, as in Edwards's bearded vulture.</p>
               <p>We ſhould form an inaccurate idea of the tail of the Turkey-cock, if we imagined that all the
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:1084500102:128"/>
feathers of which it is compoſed can equally be ſpread like a fan. In fact, he has two tails, an upper and an under one; the firſt conſiſts of eighteen broad feathers inſerted round the rump, and which are erected when the bird ſtruts about; the ſecond, or lower one, is formed of others which are not ſo broad, and remains always in a horizontal poſition. The male is alſo diſtinguiſhed by a ſpur on each foot, which is of various lengths, but always ſhorter and ſofter than in common cocks.</p>
               <p>IN the female, not only the ſpurs, and the lock of hair hanging from the lower part of the neck, are wanting, but alſo the conical caruncle is ſhorter, and admits of no extenſion; both this caruncle barbil, and the glandulous fleſh that ſheaths the head, are of a paler red; ſhe is ſmaller alſo, and has leſs expreſſion, leſs reſolution, and leſs vigour of action; her cry is only a plaintive accent; ſhe never ſtirs but to ſeek food or to fly before danger: finally, ſhe cannot perform the ſtrutting evolutions, not becauſe ſhe has not the double tail of the male, but on account of the want of the <hi>elevator</hi> muſcles which erect the very large feathers that compoſe the upper fan.</p>
               <p>In the male, as in the female, the noſtrils are ſituated in the upper mandible; the ears are placed behind the eyes, thickly covered, and, as it were, darkened by a multitude of little divided feathers, pointed in different directions.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="120" facs="tcp:1084500102:129"/>
It will readily be ſuppoſed, that the beſt Cock is the ſtrongeſt, the livelieſt, and the moſt vigorous in all his movements. Five or ſix females may be entruſted to his care. If there are ſeveral males, they will fight with each other, but not with the furious obſtinacy of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary cocks; theſe even attack Turkies which are double their ſize, and kill them in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat. The ſubjects of the contention are equally compliant to the males of both ſpecies, if, as Sperling ſays, the Turkey-cock, when deprived of his females, pays his addreſſes to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon hens; and the Turkey-hens, in the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of their males, offer their favours to the ordinary cock, and eagerly ſolicit his potent embrace<note n="*" place="bottom">

               <p>The battles which the Turkey-cocks fight among themſelves are far leſs vigorous; the van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed does not always fly from the field of battle, and ſometimes he is even preferred by the females. It has been obſerved, that though a white Turkey was beat by a black one, all the chickens were white.</p>
               <p>The Turkies perform copulation nearly in the ſame way as ordinary cocks, only it laſts longer. Hence, perhaps, the reaſon that the male is not equal to ſo many females, and is ſooner worn out. I have already mentioned, on the authority of Sperling, that he ſometimes
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:1084500102:130"/>
mixes with common hens; the ſame author aſſerts, that when his females are taken from him, he not only couples with the pea-hen (which may happen), but alſo with the ducks (which ſeems to me to be leſs probable).</p>
               <p>The Turkey-hen is not ſo prolific as the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon hen. She muſt, from time to time, be fed with hemp-ſeed, oats, and buck-wheat, to make her lay: and after all, ſhe ſeldom has more than one hatch of fifteen eggs a-year. When ſhe has two, which is very uncommon, the firſt is about the end of winter, and the ſecond in the month of Auguſt. The eggs are white, with ſome ſmall ſpots of reddiſh-yellow; and their ſtructure is nearly the ſame as in thoſe of the common hen. The Turkey-hen will alſo hatch the eggs of all ſorts of birds. We may know when ſhe wants to ſit, for ſhe remains in the neſt; and in order to fix her attachment, the place muſt be dry, with a good aſpect, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſeaſon, and not too much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed; for inſtinct leads her to conceal herſelf with the greateſt care when ſhe covers.</p>
               <p>Thoſe of a year old are generally the beſt ſitters, and they are ſo intent, that they would die upon their eggs from mere inanition, if we were not at pains to remove them once a-day, and give them food and drink. This paſſion for hatching is ſo powerful and ſo du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, that they ſometimes have two neſts in ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, without the leaſt interruption; but, in
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:1084500102:131"/>
ſuch caſes, they muſt be ſupported by richer food. The cock has a very oppoſite inſtinct; for if he ſees the female covering, he breaks the eggs, which he regards, probably, as an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacle to his pleaſures<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <bibl>Sperling. <hi>Ibid.</hi>
                     </bibl>
                  </note>; and for this reaſon it is, perhaps, that the female is ſo induſtrious in concealing her neſt.</p>
               <p>After the full time, when the young Turkies are about to burſt into day, they pierce with their bill the ſhell of the egg in which they are incloſed; but it is ſometimes ſo hard, that they would periſh if not aſſiſted by cruſhing it; and this muſt be effected with great caution, following as cloſely as poſſible the natural proceſs. If roughly handled in their tender moments, if ſuffered to endure hunger, or if expoſed to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clement weather, though they may ſurvive for the time, they will pine away and ſoon periſh. Cold, rain, and even dew, occaſions lingering ſickneſs; the rays of a bright ſun ſtrike them with inſtant death; and ſometimes they are cruſhed even under the feet of their mother: ſuch are the dangers which threaten the life of this delicate bird. This cauſe, joined to the inferior fecundity of the Turkey-hens in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, is the reaſon why this ſpecies is much leſs numerous than that of the common poultry.</p>
               <p>After their extrication from the ſhell, the young Turkies ought to be kept in a warm and
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:1084500102:132"/>
dry place, where there is ſpread a broad layer of dung well trodden; and when we would bring them out into the open air, we ſhould do it by degrees, and chuſe the fineſt days.</p>
               <p>The young Turkies inſtinctively prefer pick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of the hand, to feeding in any other way. We judge by their chirping when they want to eat, which is frequent. They ought to be preſented with food four or five times a-day; their firſt nouriſhment ſhould be wine and water, which muſt be blown into their bill, and afterwards a few crumbs of bread may be mixed with it. On the fourth day, eggs ſpoiled in hatching may be given, beat up with bits of bread; and theſe addled eggs, whether they be hens or Turkies, are found to afford a ſalutary nouriſhment<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <bibl>Journal Economique, <hi>Aôut</hi> 1757, p. 69-73.</bibl>
                  </note>. Towards the tenth or twelfth day, the eggs are omitted, and in their ſtead are uſed chopped nettles mixed with millet, or with the flour of Turkey beans, of barley, of wheat, or of buck-wheat; or at leaſt, if we would ſave the grain without hurting the brood, with curdled milk, burdock, a little ſtinking camomile, nettle-ſeed, and bran. Afterwards, it will be ſufficient to give them all ſorts of decayed fruits cut into bits<note n="†" place="bottom">

                  </note>, eſpecially the berries of brambles and of white mulberries, &amp;c. When we perceive them having a languiſhing appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:1084500102:133"/>
we muſt dip their bills into wine, to make them drink a little, and at the ſame time oblige them to ſwallow a grain of pepper. Sometimes they appear benumbed and motionleſs, when they have been overtaken by a cold rain; and they would infallibly die, if we were not careful to wrap them in warm rags, and blow repeatedly into them warm air through their bill. They muſt be viſited from time to time to pierce the ſmall bladders that collect under the tongue and about the rump, and to give them ruſt-water; it is even recommended to bathe their head with this water, to prevent certain diſeaſes to which they are ſubject; but in that caſe, it muſt be wiped and dried very carefully; for it is well known that humidity of every kind is hurtful to Turkies in their tender age.</p>
               <p>The mother leads them with the ſame ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude that the hen leads her chickens; ſhe warms them under her wings with the ſame affection, and protects them with the ſame courage. It would ſeem that tenderneſs for her offspring gives quickneſs to her ſight; ſhe deſcries a bird of prey at a prodigious diſtance, when it is yet inviſible to every other eye. As ſoon as ſhe perceives her dreaded enemy, ſhe vents her fears by a ſcream that ſpreads terror through the whole brood; each little Turkey ſeeks refuge under a buſh, or ſquats in the herbage, and the mother keeps them in that ſituation by her cries
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:1084500102:134"/>
ſo long as danger is impending; but when her apprehenſions are removed, ſhe informs them by a different note, and calls them from their concealments to aſſemble round her.</p>
               <p>When the Turkies are newly hatched their head is ſhaded with a kind of down, but they have ſtill no glandulous fleſh or barbils. It requires ſix weeks or two months till theſe parts develope, or, as it is vulgarly ſaid, before the Turkies <hi>put forth the red</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Pouſſer le rouge.</hi>
                  </note>. This is as critical a period with them as that of dentition is with children; and then eſpecially wine ought to be mixed with their ordinary food to ſtrengthen them. A ſhort while before this they have begun to perch.</p>
               <p>It is ſeldom that Turkies are ſubjected to caſtration as ordinary cocks are; they fatten very well without ſuffering that operation, and their fleſh is no leſs delicate: another proof that their temperament is not ſo hot as that of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon poultry.</p>
               <p>When they have grown hardy, they leave their mother, or rather they are abandoned by her. The more tender and delicate they were in their infancy, they become in time the more robuſt and the more capable of ſupporting the inclemency of the weather. They are fond of perching in open air, and thus paſs whole nights in the rigours of winter; ſometimes reſting on
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:1084500102:135"/>
one foot and drawing up the other to keep it warm, as it were, under the ventral feathers; at other times, on the contrary, crouching on the branch, and keeping their bodies in equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>librium. They lay their head under the wing when they go to ſleep, and, during their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, the motion of reſpiration is very percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible.</p>
               <p>The beſt way of training Turkies after they are grown ſtout is, to allow them to ramble in the fields where nettles, and other plants which they are fond of, are plentiful, or to admit them into the orchards when the fruit begins to drop, &amp;c. But we muſt be attentive to reſtrain them from thoſe paſtures that bear plants hurtful to them, ſuch as the great fox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glove with red flowers; this plant is a real poiſon to Turkies; thoſe that eat it are thrown into a kind of intoxication, vertigoes, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions, and when the quantity is large they languiſh and die. We cannot therefore be too careful in extirpating this noxious plant from thoſe places where Turkies are raiſed<note n="*" place="bottom">

               <p>We ſhould alſo be careful, eſpecially in their early infancy, not to ſuffer them to go abroad in the morning till the ſun has dried the dew, and to ſhut them up before the fall of the evening damps; they muſt likewiſe be confined
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:1084500102:136"/>
in the ſhade during the violent heats of the ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer's day. Each evening, when they return to rooſt, they muſt be fed on paſte of grain, or on ſome other food, except in harveſt, when they have gathered enough in the fields. As they are extremely timid, they are eaſily led: the very ſhadow of a ſwitch is ſufficient to drive large flocks, and they will often run from an animal that is much ſmaller and much weaker than themſelves. There are occaſions, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, when they diſcover courage, eſpecially in their defence againſt the aſſaults of pole-cats, and other foes of the poultry. Sometimes even they ſurround a hare in his ſeat, and ſtrive to kill him by ſtriking with their bill<note n="*" place="bottom">Salerne.</note>.</p>
               <p>They have different tones, and different in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexions of voice, according to their age, their ſex, and the various paſſions by which they are influenced; their pace is ſlow, their flight tardy; they drink, eat, and ſwallow ſmall pebbles nearly as the cocks do, and have alſo a double ſtomach, that is, a craw and a gizzard; but, as they are much larger, the muſcles of the gizzard are alſo much ſtronger.</p>
               <p>The length of the inteſtines is nearly qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>druple that of the bird, reckoning from the tip of the bill to the end of the rump; they have two <hi>caeca,</hi> both turned forwards, and which, taken together, conſtitute more than a fourth of
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:1084500102:137"/>
the whole alimentary canal; theſe take their riſe near the extremity, and the excrements contained in their cavity differ but little from thoſe included within the <hi>colon</hi> and <hi>rectum</hi>; theſe excrements do not remain at all in the common <hi>cloaca,</hi> as the urine, and that white ſediment which is always found where the urine paſſes, and they have conſiſtence enough to receive ſhape in their extruſion from the <hi>anus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The parts of generation are nearly the ſame in Turkies as in common cocks; but they ſeem to be much leſs vigorous in their performance. The males are not ſo ardent for the females; their embraces are leſs frequent and leſs expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious; and the females, at leaſt in our climate, lay much later, and have much fewer eggs.</p>
               <p>As the eyes of birds have in ſome reſpects a different organization from thoſe of man and of quadrupeds, it may be proper to mention the chief diſtinctions. Beſides the upper and under eye-lids, the Turkies, as well as moſt other birds, have ſtill a third, called the internal eye-lid, <hi>membrana nictitans,</hi> which draws itſelf back into the ſhape of a creſcent in the large angle of the eye, and whoſe quick and frequent twink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings are effected by a curious muſcular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance. The upper eye-lid is almoſt entirely immoveable, but the lower can ſhut the eye by riſing to the upper, which ſcarcely ever hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, except when the animal is aſleep. Theſe two eye-lids have each a lachrymal point, but
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:1084500102:138"/>
no cartilaginous margins; the <hi>cornea</hi> is tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, encircled by an oſſeous ring, conſiſting of about fifteen ſcales over-lapping each other like the tiles of a roof. The cryſtalline lens is harder than in man, but ſofter than in the quadrupeds or fiſhes<note n="*" place="bottom">

Laſtly, the optic nerve ſends off, between the retina and the choröid coat, a black membrane of a rhomboidal figure, conſiſting of parallel fibres, which ſtretch through the vitreous humour, and are attached ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times directly to the interior angle of the cryſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talline capſule, and ſometimes are connected by the intervention of a filament branching from it. It is to this ſubtile and tranſparent membrane that the academicians have given the name of <hi>purſe,</hi> though it has ſcarcely any reſemblance to that in the Turkey, and ſtill leſs in the cock, the gooſe, the duck, the pigeon, &amp;c.; and its uſe, according to Petit, is to abſorb the rays of light that come from the lateral objects, and which, intermingling with the others, would render viſion obſcure<note n="‡" place="bottom">

                  </note>. However this may be, certain it is, that the organ of ſight is more complex in birds than in quadrupeds; and as we have before ſhewn that this ſenſe is poſſeſſed by the feathered race in a higher degree than what obtains in other animals, we muſt
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:1084500102:139"/>
aſcribe the ſuperiority to its difference of ſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and to its more perfect organization; but to ſtate the preciſe effect would require a more profound ſtudy of comparative anatomy and of the animal oeconomy.</p>
               <p>If we compare the relations of travellers, we cannot heſitate to conclude, that Turkies are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of America and of the adjacent iſlands; and that before the diſcovery of the New Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, there exiſted none in the Old.</p>

               <p>Finally, Boſman and ſome other travellers tell us, that if Turkies be ever ſeen in the country of Congo, on the Gold Coaſt, at Senegal, or in other parts of Africa, it is only at the factories and with ſtrangers, the natives mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing little uſe of them. According to the ſame travellers, their Turkies are evidently deſcended from thoſe carried thither by the Portugueſe and other Europeans, along with other poultry<note n="‖" place="bottom">Boſman.</note>.</p>
               <p>I will not diſſemble, that Aldrovandus, Geſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, Belon, and Ray, have affirmed that Turkies were natives of Africa or of the Eaſt Indies; and though their opinion on this ſubject is at preſent little regarded, I conceive that it is a duty which I owe to theſe great names not to reject it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome diſcuſſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="133" facs="tcp:1084500102:142"/>
Aldrovandus has attempted to prove at great length, that Turkies are the <hi>Meleagrides</hi> of the ancients, or the African or Numidian Hens, whoſe plumage was covered with round ſpots, like drops <hi>(Gallinae Numidicae guttatae)</hi>; but it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and every body is now agreed on the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, that theſe are really our <hi>pintados,</hi> which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed come from-Africa, but which are quite different from Turkies. It would therefore be needleſs to dwell more particularly on the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Aldrovandus, which in fact carries its refutation along with it; and yet Linnaeus ſeems inclined to perpetuate or renew the error, by applying to the Turkey the name of <hi>Meleagris.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ray, who maintains that Turkies have derived their origin from Africa or the Eaſt Indies, ſeems to have ſuffered himſelf to be deceived by names. That of the bird of <hi>Numidia,</hi> which he adopts, implies an African deſcent; that of <hi>Turkey</hi> and the <hi>Bird of Calecut,</hi> denotes an Aſiatic extraction. But no proof can be drawn from the name beſtowed by ill-informed people, or even the ſcientific term impoſed by philoſophers, who are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways exempted from prejudices. Beſides, Ray himſelf admits with Dr. Sloane, that theſe birds delight in the warm countries of America, and there multiply prodigiouſly<note n="*" place="bottom">

                  </note>.</p>
               <p>With regard to Geſner, he admits indeed that moſt of the ancients, and among others Ariſtotle
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:1084500102:143"/>
and Pliny, were totally unacquainted with Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kies; but he ſuppoſes that in the following quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation Aelian had them in view: <q rend="inline">India,</q> ſays this ancient, <q rend="inline">produces a ſort of very large cocks, whoſe comb is not red like that of ours, but ſo rich and variegated as to reſemble a crown of flowers; the feathers of the tail are not arched nor bent into circles, but flat, and when they are not erected, they trail like thoſe of the peacock; their plumage is of an emerald colour.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But it does not appear that this paſſage relates to Turkey Cocks; for, 1. The ſize does not prove the point, it being well known that in Aſia, and eſpecially in Perſia and at Pegu, the common cocks are exceedingly large.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This comb, compoſed of various colours, is alone ſufficient to overturn the opinion, ſince Turkies have never any comb; and what is here deſcribed is not a tuft of feathers, but a real comb, ſimilar to that of the ordinary cock, though of a different colour.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The manner it holds its tail, reſembling the peacock, is equally inconcluſive; for Aelian po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively ſays, that the bird which he is deſcribing carries its tail like the peacock, <hi>when it does not erect it</hi>; and if there had been an erection, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with a wheeling motion, Aelian would not have omitted a character ſo ſingular, and which forms ſo ſtriking a reſemblance to the pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cock,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:1084500102:144"/>
with which he was at the ſame inſtant drawing a compariſon.</p>

Beſides, is it likely that Columella, wiſhing to diſtinguiſh two ſpecies ſo remote from each other as the pintado and the Turkey,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:1084500102:145"/>
would be contented in ſelecting a ſlight differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of colour, inſtead of marking obvious and ſtriking characters?</p>
               <p>But if the attempts of Belon to beſtow on Turkies, from the authority of Columella, an African origin, are without foundation, his ſucceſs is not greater, when he ſeeks, from the following paſſage of Ptolemy, to give them an Aſiatic origin:—<q rend="inline">Trigliphon Regia, where the common cocks are ſaid to be bearded.</q> This Trigliphon is ſituated indeed beyond the Ganges; but there is no reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that theſe bearded cocks are Turkies; for, 1. The very exiſtence of theſe cocks is uncertain, reſting merely on hearſay. 2. This deſcription cannot refer to Turkies, ſince, as I have before obſerved, the word <hi>beard,</hi> applied to a bird, can mean only a tuft of feathers, or hairs, placed under the bill, not the lock of ſtiff hair which the Turkies have on the under part of the neck. 3. Ptolemy was an aſtronomer and geographer, and not a naturaliſt; and it is evident that he wiſhed to render his charts more intereſting, by introducing, and not always with judgment, accounts of the peculiarities of each country. In the very ſame page he ſpeaks of three iſlands of ſatyrs, whoſe inhabitants had tails; and he tells us, that the Manioles are ten iſlands ſituated nearly in the ſame climate, where loadſtone abounds ſo much, that iron cannot be employed in the conſtruction of ſhips,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:1084500102:146"/>
becauſe of the danger of their being attracted and held by the magnetic force. But theſe human tails, though aſſerted by ſeveral tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers, and by the Jeſuit miſſionaries, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Gemelli Careri, are at leaſt very doubtful; and the mountains of loadſtone, or rather their effects on the iron of veſſels, are no leſs ſo: ſo that little confidence can be put in facts mingled with ſuch uncertain rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. 4. Laſtly, Ptolemy, in the place above quoted, ſpeaks expreſsly of ordinary cocks, which cannot be confounded with Turkey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocks, neither in their external form, their plumage, their cry, their natural habits, the colour of their eggs, nor the time of incuba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp;c. It is true that Scaliger, while he admits that the meleagris of Athenaeus, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Clytus, who is quoted by Athenaeus, was an Aetolian bird that loved wet ſituations, which was averſe to hatching, and whoſe fleſh had a marſhy taſte, none of which characters belong to the Turkey; which is not an inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant of Aetolia, which avoids watery ſpots, which has the greateſt affection to its young, and whoſe fleſh has a delicate flavour; yet ſtill maintains that the meleagris is the Turkey. But the anatomiſts of the Academy of Sciences, who were at firſt of the ſame opinion, have, after examining the ſubject with more attention, aſcertained and proved that the pintado was the real <hi>meleagris</hi> of the ancients. In ſhort, we
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:1084500102:147"/>
muſt conſider it as an eſtabliſhed point, that Athenaeus, or Clytus, Aelian, Columella, and Ptolemy, have no more ſpoken of Turkies than Ariſtotle or Pliny; and that theſe birds were totally unknown to the ancients.</p>
               <p>Nor can we find the leaſt mention of the Turkey in any modern work, written prior to the diſcovery of America. A popular tradition refers the period of its firſt introduction into France to the ſixteenth century, in the reign of Francis I.; for this was the time when Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral Chabot lived. The authors of the Britiſh Zoology ſtate it as a well-known fact, that they were introduced into England in the time of Henry VIII. the contemporary of Francis I.; which agrees exactly with our opinion. For America having been diſcovered by Chriſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher Columbus towards the end of the fifteenth century, and theſe ſovereigns having aſcended the throne about the beginning of the ſixteenth century, it is natural to ſuppoſe, that the Turkies brought from the New World would under their reigns be regarded as novelties in France and England. This is confirmed too by the expreſs teſtimony of J. Sperling, who wrote before 1660; he affirms, that they had been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced from the New Indies into Europe more than a century prior to his time<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <bibl>Zoologia Phyſica, p. 366.</bibl>
                  </note>.</p>
               <p>Every thing, therefore, concurs to prove that the Turkies are natives of America. As they are
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:1084500102:148"/>
heavy birds, and cannot riſe on the wing, or ſwim, it would be impoſſible for them to croſs the ocean which ſeparates the two continents. They are in the ſame ſituation with the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drupeds, which, without the aſſiſtance of man, would not have been diſperſed through the Old and New Worlds. This reflection gives addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional weight to the teſtimony of travellers, who aſſure us, that they have never ſeen Wild Turkies either in Africa or Aſia, and that none are found there but ſuch as are domeſtic, and brought from other parts<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>The Honourable Daines Barrington has publiſhed an Eſſay, in which he attempts to prove, that the Turkey was known before the diſcovery of America. He examines the Comte de Buffon's arguments, and endeavours to invalidate or refute them; but his objections are entirely inconcluſive. If the Turkey had been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced into Spain by Columbus, it would have been called, ſays Mr. Barrington, <hi>the Mexican bird,</hi> and not <hi>pago,</hi> or <hi>pavo.</hi> Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal Perron, who died in 1620, relates, that the Indian Cocks had prodigiouſly multiplied, and were driven like flocks of ſheep from Languedoc into Spain: therefore, ſays Mr. B. the Turkey muſt have been introduced firſt into France. Theſe conjectures are ſo vague as to merit no particular diſcuſſion; and when Mr. B. aſſerts, that Sperling means one hundred and one years, by the expreſſion <q rend="inline">Ante centum, &amp; <hi>quod excurrit</hi> annos,</q> he ſeems not to have attended to grammar. That phraſe is claſſical, and means indefinitely ſome time more than a century: nor will the word <hi>excurrit</hi> admit of any other interpretation.</p> 
                     <p>Mr. Barrington proceeds: <q rend="inline">The Spaniſh term is not <hi>pavon de las Indias,</hi> as M. Buffon ſtates, but ſimply <hi>pavo,</hi> and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly <hi>pago.</hi> If, moreover, the name were <hi>pavon de las Indias,</hi> it would not ſignify the Weſt Indies, as in all the European lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages the addition of <hi>Weſtern</hi> is neceſſary.</q> But this aſſertion is too haſty: did not the King of Spain, after the diſcovery of America, aſſume the title of <hi>Indiae Rex,</hi> and not <hi>Indiae Occidenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis,</hi> or <hi>Indiarum?</hi>
                     </p> 
                     <p>I muſt add, that the opinion of the Comte de Buffon concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the native climate of the Turkey, is admitted by the inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious and reſpectable naturaliſt Mr. Pennant, who has adduced ſeveral new arguments in ſupport of it. Linnaeus, Gmelin, and Latham, entertain the ſame idea.</p>

                  <pb n="140" facs="tcp:1084500102:149"/>
This determination of the natal region of the Turkey leads to the deciſion of another queſtion, which, at firſt ſight, ſeems to have no connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with it. J. Sperling affirms, in his <hi>Zoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logica Phyſica,</hi> p. 369, that the Turkey is a monſter (he means an hybrid) produced by the union of the two ſpecies, that of the peacock and of the ordinary cock; but as it is aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained that the Turkey is of American ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction, it could not be bred by the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of two Aſiatic ſpecies; and what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely decides the point is, that no Wild Turkies are found through the whole extent of Aſia, though they abound in the foreſts of America. But it will be ſaid, what means the term <hi>gallo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pavus,</hi> which has ſo long been applied to the Turkey? Nothing is ſimpler: the Turkey was a foreign bird which had no name in any of the European languages; and as it bore ſeveral ſtriking reſemblances to the common cock and the peacock, a compound word was formed expreſſive of theſe analogies. Sperling and others would have us believe that it is really the croſs-breed of theſe two ſpecies; yet the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixture
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:1084500102:150"/>
conſiſts entirely in the names.—So dangerous it is to beſtow upon animals com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded epithets, which are always ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous.</p>
               <p>Edwards mentions another hybrid produced between the Turkey and the pheaſant<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <bibl>Gleanings.</bibl>
                  </note>. The individual which he deſcribes was ſhot in the woods near Hanford in Dorſetſhire, where it was ſeen in the month of October 1759, with two or three other birds of the ſame kind. It was of a middle-ſize between the pheaſant and the Turkey, its wings extending thirty-two inches; a ſmall tuft of pretty long black feathers roſe on the baſe of the upper mandible; the head was not bare like that of the Turkey, but covered with little ſhort fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; the eyes were ſurrounded with a circle of red ſkin, but not ſo broad as in the pheaſant. It is not ſaid whether this bird could ſpread the large feathers of the tail into the wheel-ſhape; it only appears from the figure, that it carried the tail in the ſame way as the Turkey generally does. It muſt alſo be obſerved, that this tail is compoſed of ſixteen quills, as in the grous; while that of the Turkey and of the pheaſant conſiſts of eighteen; alſo each feather on the body ſhot double from the ſame root, the one branch ſtiff and broad, the other ſmall and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with down, a character which belongs
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:1084500102:151"/>
neither to the pheaſant nor the Turkey. If this bird was really a hybrid, it ought to have had, like other hybrids, 1ſt, The characters common to the two primitive ſpecies; 2dly, The qualities intermediate between the extremes; a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance that in this caſe does not take place, ſince this individual had a character not to be found in either (the double feathers), and wanted others that occur in both (the eighteen quills of the tail). Indeed, if it be inſiſted that it was hybridous, we ſhould more reaſonably infer, that it was produced by the union of the Turkey with the grous; which, as I have remarked, has no more than ſixteen feathers in the tail, but has the double feathers.</p>
               <p>The Wild Turkies differ not from the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic ſort, except that they are much larger and blacker; they have the ſame diſpoſitions, the ſame natural habits, and the ſame ſtupidity. They perch in the woods on the dry branches, and when one falls by a ſhot, the reſt are not intimidated by the report, but all continue ſecure in the ſame poſition. According to Fernandes, their fleſh, though pleaſant to eat, is harder and not ſo delicate as that of the Tame Turkies; but they are twice as large. The Mexican name of the male is <hi>hucxolotl,</hi> and that of the female <hi>cihuatotolin.</hi> Albin tells us, that many Engliſh gentlemen amuſe themſelves in breeding Wild Turkies, and that theſe birds thrive very well in ſmall woods, parks, or other incloſures.</p>

The Creſted Turkey is only a variety of the common kind, ſimilar to what occurs among the ordinary cocks. It is ſometimes black, ſometimes white. That deſcribed by Albin was of the uſual ſize; its feet fleſh-coloured, the upper part of the body deep brown; the breaſt, belly, thighs, and tail, white; and alſo the feathers that form the tuft. In other reſpects it reſembled exactly the ordinary kind; it had the ſpongy and glandulous fleſh which covers the head and arch of the neck, and the lock of hard hair riſing (apparently) from the breaſt, and the ſhort ſpurs on each foot; it alſo bore the ſame ſingular antipathy to ſcarlet, &amp;c. <note n="A" place="bottom">Specific character of the Turkey, <hi>Meleagris Gallopavo:</hi>

They rooſt in the great ſwamps, but ſpend the whole day among the dry woods, ſearching for red acorns and various ſorts of berries. They grow very fat in the ſpring. When ſurpriſed, they run with prodigious ſpeed; but if hotly purſued, they take wing and perch on the ſummit of the next tall tree. The Indians make fans of the Turkies tails; and alſo weave the inner webs of their feathers with hemp, or the rind of the mulberry-tree, into an elegant ſort of clothing.</note>

However, it appears that the Pintado which was anciently reared with ſo much care at Rome, was afterwards entirely loſt in Europe.

which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the more attention, as they are anterior to every change of
climate.</p>
               <p>The Jeſuit Margat, who admits no ſpecial difference between the African Hen and the Meleagris of the ancients, ſays, that they have two kinds in regard to colour at St. Domingo; in ſome, black and white ſpots are diſpoſed in the form of rhomboids; in others, the plumage is of a deeper aſh-grey. He adds, that they all have white below the belly, and on the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, and at the tips of the wings.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Briſſon conſiders the whiteneſs of the plumage of the breaſt obſerved on the Pintados at Jamaica, as conſtituting a diſtinct variety; and he characteriſes it by this epithet, <hi>(pectore albo;)</hi> which, as we have juſt ſeen, belongs as much to the Pintados of St. Domingo as to thoſe of Jamaica.</p>
               <p>But beſides the differences which have been regarded by naturaliſts as a ſufficient foundation for admitting ſeveral races of Pintados, I can perceive many others, in comparing the deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and figures publiſhed by different authors, which ſhew little permanency, either in the

of the eyes, the ſides of the head and neck, in its upper part, are white,
ſpotted with aſh-grey. That of Friſch has beſides, under the throat, a
red ſpot in the ſhape of a creſcent, and lower down a very broad black
collar, the ſilky filaments on the <hi>occiput</hi> few, and not a ſingle
white quill in the wings; which form ſo many diverſities, in which the
Pintados of theſe authors differ from ours.</p>
               <p>In Marcgrave's ſpecimen, the bill was yellow; in that of Briſſon, it was red at the baſe, horn-coloured near the tip. The academicians found on ſome a ſmall tuft at the origin of the beak, conſiſting of twelve or fifteen ſtiff threads, about four inches long, which did not occur in thoſe of Sierra Leona, mentioned above.</p>
               <p>Dr. Caius ſays, that in the female the head is entirely black, and that this is the only diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between it and the male<note n="†" place="bottom">

Aldrovandus aſſerts, on the contrary, that the head of the female has the ſame colours with that of the male, but that its caſque is leſs elevated and more obtuſe.</p>
               <p>Roberts affirms, that it has not the caſque at all<note n="*" place="bottom">

                     <bibl>New Voyage.</bibl>—It is probable that the ſhort and very bright red creſt, mentioned by Father Charlevoix, is nothing but theſe caruncles.</note>.</p>
               <p>Barrere tells us, that theſe parts are of a paler colour than in the male, and that the ſilky hairs of the <hi>occiput</hi> are thinner, ſuch apparently as repreſented in Friſch's figure.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, the academicians found in ſome indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals theſe filaments on the <hi>occiput</hi> riſing an inch, ſo that they formed a kind of tuft behind the head.</p>
               <p>It would be difficult, from all theſe varieties, to ſelect thoſe that are ſo deeply and ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manently ſtamped, as to conſtitute diſtinct races; and as we cannot doubt but that they are very recent, it will perhaps be ſafeſt to regard them as the effects produced by domeſtication, change of climate, nature of the food, &amp;c.; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out introducing them into the deſcription, to mark the limits of the variations to which cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain qualities of the Pintado are ſubject, and to
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:1084500102:162"/>
endeavour, as much as poſſible, to aſcend to thoſe cauſes, of which the continued operation has at laſt imprinted conſtant characters, and formed diſtinct ſpecies.</p>
               <p>In one circumſtance, the Pintado bears a ſtriking reſemblance to the turkey; viz. it has no feathers on the head, nor on the arch of the neck. This has induced ſeveral ornithologiſts, as Belon, Geſner, Aldrovandus, and Klein, to take the turkey for the Meleagris of the ancients. But not to mention the numberleſs points of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between theſe two ſpecies<note n="*" place="bottom">The Meleagris was, according to the ancients, as large as a good hen, and it had a fleſhy tubercle on the head; its plumage was marked with white ſpots like lentils, but larger; there were two barbils attached to the upper mandible, the tail was pendulous, the back round, there were membranes between the toes, and no ſpurs at the feet: it delighted in marſhes, had no tenderneſs for its young. Theſe characters are entirely different from thoſe of the turkey, which, on the other hand, has many properties not to be found in the deſcription of the Meleagris; particularly the bunch of hairs that hangs under the neck, and his manner of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playing his tail, and of pacing around his female.</note>, we need only refer to the proofs by which it was decided that the turkey was peculiar to America, and could never migrate into the ancient con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent.</p>
               <p>Briſſon ſeems alſo to have miſtaken, when, from a quotation of Kolben<note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <q rend="inline">A bird which belongs properly to the Cape,</q> ſays this traveller, <q rend="inline">is the <hi>Knor-hahn,</hi> or <hi>Coq-knor.</hi> It is the centinel of the other birds; it informs them, when it ſees a man approach, by a ſcream reſembling the ſound of the word <hi>crac,</hi> and which it repeats very loud. It is as large as a common hen; its bill is ſhort and black, like the feathers on its crown; the plumage of the wings and body is mixed with red, white, and cine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reous; the legs are yellow, and the wings ſmall. It frequents ſolitary places, and builds its neſt in the buſhes; it lays two eggs; its fleſh is not much eſteemed, though it is very good.</q>
                  </note>, he inſerted <hi>Knor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haan</hi> 
                  <pb n="153" facs="tcp:1084500102:163"/> in the
liſt of the names of the Pintado. I agree with Briſſon, that the figure
given by this traveller is only copied from that of the African Hen of
Marcgrave; he muſt alſo allow that it would be hard to admit a bird
peculiar to the Cape of Good Hope to be the Pintado, which is ſpread through
the whole of Africa, and leſs common at that promontory than in other parts
of the country; ſtill more difficult will it be to reconcile the ſhort
black bill, the crown of feathers, the red which is intermixed with the colours
of the wings and of the body, and the quality which Kolben aſcribes to his
<hi>Knor-haan,</hi> that it lays only two eggs.</p>
               <p>The plumage of the Pintado, though not decorated with rich and dazzling colours, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably beautiful. It is of a bluiſh-grey ground, ſprinkled with conſiderable regularity, with white roundiſh ſpeckles, reſembling pearls. Hence ſome of the moderns have beſtowed on this bird the name of <hi>Pearled Hen</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Friſch.</note>; and the ancients applied the epithets <hi>varia</hi> and <hi>guttata</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <bibl>Martial's Epigrams.</bibl>
                  </note>. Such, at leaſt, was the plumage in its native climate; but ſince it has been carried into other
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:1084500102:164"/>
countries, it has aſſumed more of the white. Thus the Pintados at Jamaica and St. Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingo are white on the breaſt; and Edwards mentions ſome entirely white<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <bibl>Gleanings, <hi>Part Third.</hi>
                     </bibl>
                  </note>. The white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the breaſt, therefore, which Briſſon conſiders as the character of a variety, is only an alteration begun in the natural colour, or rather it is the ſhade between that colour and complete whiteneſs.</p>
               <p>The feathers on the middle part of the neck are very ſhort near its arch, where they are entirely wanting. From that part they gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually lengthen unto the breaſt, and there they are three inches long<note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <bibl>Memoires pour ſervir l'Hiſtoire des Animaux, <hi>Partie</hi> II. p. 81.</bibl>

               <p>Theſe feathers are of a downy texture from their root to near their middle, and this part is covered by the tips of the feathers in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding row, conſiſting of ſtiff webs interwoven with each other.</p>
               <p>It has ſhort wings and a pendulous tail, like that of the partridge, which, joined to the arrangement of its feathers, makes it look as if it were hunch-backed <hi>(Genus Gibberum,</hi> PLIN.); but this appearance is falſe, and no veſtige re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains when the bird is plucked<note n="‡" place="bottom">
                     <bibl>Lettres Edifiantes, <hi>Receuil</hi> xx.</bibl>

               <p>The ſize is nearly that of an ordinary hen, but the ſhape is like that of the partridge; hence
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:1084500102:165"/>
it has been called the Newfoundland Partridge<note n="*" place="bottom">Belon.</note>. But it is of a taller form, and its neck longer, and more ſlender near the arch.</p>
               <p>The barbils which riſe from the upper man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible have no invariable form, being oval in ſome, and ſquare or triangular in others; they are red in the female, and bluiſh in the male; and, according to the academicians and Briſſon, it is this circumſtance alone which diſtinguiſhes the two ſexes. But other authors, as we have already ſeen, have aſſigned different marks drawn from the colours of the plumage<note n="†" place="bottom">Caius <hi>apud Geſnerum.</hi>
                  </note>, of the barbils<note n="‡" place="bottom">Columella, Friſch, Dampier, &amp;c.</note>, the callous tubercle on the head<note n="§" place="bottom">Aldrovandus, Roberts, Barrere, Dalechamp, &amp;c.</note>, the caruncles of the noſtrils<note n="‖" place="bottom">Barrere, Labat, Dampier, &amp;c.</note>, the ſize of the body<note n="¶" place="bottom">Friſch.</note>, the ſilky threads of the <hi>occiput,</hi> &amp;c.<note n="**" place="bottom">Friſch, Barrere, &amp;c.</note>; whether theſe differences really reſult from the ſex, or by a logical error, which is but too com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, the accidental properties of the individual have been regarded as ſexual.</p>
               <p>Behind the barbils, we perceive on the ſides of the head the very ſmall orifice of the ears, which in moſt birds is concealed by feathers, but in this is expoſed. But what is peculiar to the Pintado is, a callous bump, or a kind of caſque, which riſes on its head, and which Belon improperly compares to the tubercle, or
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:1084500102:166"/>
rather to the horn of the <hi>giraffe</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">It was on account of this tubercle that Linnaeus termed the Pintado, in the ſixth edition, <hi>Hen with a</hi> HORNY <hi>top</hi>; and in his tenth edition, <hi>Pheaſant with a</hi> CALLOUS <hi>top.</hi>
                  </note>. It reſembles in ſhape the reverſe of the ducal cap of the Doge of Venice, or this cap placed with its back towards the front.

                  </note>. Its interior ſurface is like that of hard callous fleſh, and it is covered with a dry wrinkled ſkin, which extends over the <hi>occiput,</hi> and on the ſides of the head, but is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed where the eyes are placed. Thoſe natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raliſts who deal in final cauſes, have aſſerted, that this is a real helmet, beſtowed on the Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tados as a defenſive armour, to protect them againſt the attacks which they make on each other, becauſe they are quarrelſome birds, and have a ſtrong bill and a delicate ſkull.</p>
               <p>The eyes are large and covered; the upper eye-lid has long black hairs bent upwards, and the cryſtalline lens is more convex at the ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior than at the poſterior ſurface.</p>
               <p>Perrault affirms, that the bill is like that of the common hen; the Jefuit Margat makes it thrice as large, very hard, and pointed; the claws are alſo ſharper, according to Labat. But
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:1084500102:167"/>
all agree, both ancients and moderns, in ſaying that the feet have no ſpurs.</p>
               <p>There is a remarkable difference which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curs between the ordinary hen and the Pintado; that the inteſtines of the latter are much ſhorter in proportion, not exceeding three feet, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the academicians, excluſive of the <hi>caeca,</hi> which are each ſix inches, and widen as they extend from their origin, and receive, like the other inteſtines, veſſels from the meſentery. The largeſt of all is the <hi>duodenum,</hi> which is eight lines in diameter. The gizzard is like that of the common hen; and alſo contains numbers of ſmall pebbles, and ſometimes even nothing elſe; probably when the animal, dying of a lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing diſtemper, has paſſed the cloſe of its life without eating at all.</p>
               <p>The inner membrane of the gizzard is full of wrinkles; it adheres looſely to the nervous coat, and is of a ſubſtance analogous to horn.</p>
               <p>The craw, when inflated, is about the ſize of a tennis ball; the duct, which joins it to the gizzard, is of a harder and whiter ſubſtance than what precedes the craw, and does not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent near ſo many diſtinct veſſels.</p>
               <p>The <hi>aeſophagus</hi> deſcends along the neck, to the right of the <hi>trachea-arteria</hi>; becauſe, no doubt, the neck, which, as I have already ſaid, is very long, bending oftener forwards than ſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, the <hi>aeſophagus</hi> preſſed by the <hi>trachea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arteria,</hi> whoſe rings are entirely oſſeous, has
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:1084500102:168"/>
here, as in moſt of the birds, been puſhed to that ſide where there is leaſt reſiſtance.</p>
               <p>Theſe birds are ſubject to ſchirrous concre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the liver, and even in the kidney. Some have been found without any gall-bladder; but in this caſe the hepatic branch was very thick. Others have occurred with only one teſticle; in general, it ſeems that the internal parts are no leſs liable to changes than the exterior and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficial parts.</p>
               <p>The heart is more pointed than common in birds<note n="*" place="bottom">

               <p>I ſhall add another anatomical remark, which has perhaps ſome connection with the habit of crying and the clamorous notes of the Pintado; it is, that the <hi>trachea-arteria</hi> receives in the cavity of the thorax two ſmall muſcular chords of an inch long, and two-thirds of a line broad, which are inſerted on each ſide<note n="‡" place="bottom">

               <p>The Pintado is one of thoſe birds which ſeek, by weltering in the duſt, to rid themſelves of inſects. They alſo ſcrape the ground like com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon hens, and roam in numerous flocks. Bodies of two or three hundred together are ſometimes ſeen in the Iſle of May; and the inhabitants hunt them with a greyhound, and without other weapons than ſticks<note n="‡" place="bottom">Dampier and Brue.</note>. But, according to Belon, they run very faſt, keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their head elevated like the camelopard.
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:1084500102:171"/>
They perch at night to ſleep, and ſometimes during the day, on the walls of incloſures, on hedges, and even on the roofs of houſes, and on trees. They are at great pains, Belon adds, in providing their food; and, indeed, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the length of their inteſtines, they muſt conſume more than ordinary fowls, and be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to more frequent calls of hunger<note n="*" place="bottom">De Seve obſerved, in throwing ſome bread to Pintados, that when one of them happened to take a bit larger than it could im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ſwallow, it hurried away with it out of the reach of the other fowls, and hid it in the dunghill, or in the earth, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time afterwards returned and ate it.</note>.</p>
               <p>It appears from the concurrence of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients<note n="†" place="bottom">

               <p>If they be trained when young, they ſoon become tame. Brue relates, that when he was at the coaſt of Senegal, he received, as a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent from a princeſs of that country, two Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tados, a male and a female, both of which were ſo familiar that they would come to eat on his
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:1084500102:172"/>
plate; and that when they were at liberty to fly about the beach, they returned regularly to the ſhip, when the dinner or ſupper bell rung. Moore ſays, that they are as wild as the phea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants are in England<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <bibl>
                        <hi>Hiſt. Gen. des Voyages,</hi> tome iii. p. 310.</bibl>
                  </note>; but I ſuſpect he never ſaw pheaſants ſo tame as Brue's Pintados. And what proves that the Pintados are not very wild is, that they receive the food which is offered them the moment after they are caught.</p>
               <p>The Pintado lays and hatches nearly like the ordinary hen; but its fecundity appears to be not the ſame in different climates, or at leaſt that this is much greater in the domeſtic condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, where food is more abundant, than in the ſavage ſtate, which affords but a ſcanty ſubſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. I have been informed that it is wild in the Iſle of France, and there lays ten or twelve eggs on the ground in the woods; whereas thoſe that are domeſtic in St. Domingo, and ſeek the hedges and buſhes to depoſite their eggs, lay 100, or 150, provided that one be left conſtantly in the neſt.</p>
               <p>Theſe eggs are ſmaller in proportion than thoſe of an ordinary hen, and their ſhell is much harder. But there is a remarkable dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between thoſe of the domeſtic Pintados and thoſe of the wild ſort; the latter are marked with ſmall round ſpots like thoſe on their plum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age;
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:1084500102:173"/>
and this circumſtance has not been over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looked by Ariſtotle; but thoſe of the former are at firſt of a pretty bright red, which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards fades, and at laſt runs into the faint colour of a dried roſe. If this fact be true, as I have been aſſured by Fournier, who has raiſed many of theſe birds, we muſt conclude that the influence of domeſtication penetrates here ſo deeply, as to change not only the colours of the plumage, as we have already ſeen, but even thoſe of the matter which forms the ſhell of the eggs; and as this does not happen in other ſpecies, there is reaſon to conclude that the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Pintado is not ſo fixed and invariable as that of other birds.</p>
               <p>Is the Pintado watchful or not of its brood? This is a problem that has not yet been ſolved. Belon replies without qualification in the affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive<note n="*" place="bottom">

true of the ſmall ſpecies, which prefers marſhes. But moſt authors
impute to them a degree of indifference for their offspring; the Jeſuit
Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat informs us, that at St. Domingo they are not ſuffered to cover their
eggs, becauſe they diſcover ſo little attachment, and ſo often aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
their young<note n="†" place="bottom">

turkies or common hens.</p>
               <p>I can find nothing with reſpect to the time of incubation; but if we judge from the ſize of the bird, and from our knowledge of other ſpecies to which it is moſt analogous, we may allow three weeks, more or leſs, according to the heat of the ſeaſon or climate, and the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duity of the ſitter, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>In their firſt infancy, the young Pintados have neither the barbles nor the caſque; they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble the red partridges in their plumage, and the colour of their feet and bill, and it is difficult to diſtinguiſh the young males from the old fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males<note n="*" place="bottom">I have this fact from Fournier, who was mentioned above.</note>; for in all theſe ſpecies, the maturity of the females correſponds to the infancy of the males.</p>
               <p>The young Pintados are very tender, and being natives of the burning climates of Africa, are with difficulty reared in our northern coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries. According to Father Margat, they feed at St. Domingo, as well as the old ones, on millet. At the Iſle of May, they ſubſiſt on the graſshoppers and worms, which they find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by ſcraping the ground with their nails<note n="†" place="bottom">Dampier and Labat.</note>; and Friſch ſays, that they live on all ſorts of grain and inſects.</p>
               <p>The Pintado cock breeds alſo with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon hen. But it is a kind of artificial union,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:1084500102:175"/>
which requires attention to bring about. They muſt be bred together from their infancy; and the hybridous intercourſe gives birth to a baſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tard progeny of an imperfect ſtructure, and diſavowed, as it were, by nature. Their eggs are deſtitute of the prolific power, and the race is extinguiſhed in the death of the indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals<note n="*" place="bottom">Fournier.</note>.</p>
               <p>The Pintados that are raiſed in our poultry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards have an excellent flavour, in no reſpect inferior to that of partridges; but the wild or cheſnut ſort of St. Domingo have the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite reliſh, and exceed the delicacy of the pheaſant. The eggs of the Pintado too are a very agreeable food.</p>
               <p>We have ſeen that the Pintado is of African origin; and hence all the names that have been beſtowed on it: hen of Africa, of Numidia, the foreign hen, that of Barbary, of Tunis, of Mauritania, of Lybia, of Guinea, of Egypt, of Pharaoh, and even of Jeruſalem.

with its other dimenſions; and in the form of its feet, which are rough and without ſpurs, &amp;c.

               <p>Thoſe who, with Geſner, and ſome others, would conſider it as the original cock, can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed found their conjecture on ſome analogies; the general ſhape of its body; the particular configuration of its bill; the red projecting ſkin above the eyes, the ſingular nature of its fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, which are moſtly double, and riſe in pairs from the ſame root, a property which, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Belon, is peculiar to the ordinary cock; and laſtly, they have the ſame common habits, one male ſupplying ſeveral females, and theſe not building any neſts, but ſitting on their eggs with much aſſiduity, and ſhowing a ſtrong affection to their young after they are hatched. But if we conſider that the Grous has no mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes under its bill, and no ſpurs on its feet; that its feet are clothed with plumage, and its toes are edged with a kind of indenting; that there are two quills more in the tail; that this tail is not divided into two planes as in the ordinary cock, but can be diſplayed like a fan
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:1084500102:182"/>
as in the turkey; that its bulk is quadruple that of the ordinary cock; that it is fond of cold countries, while the domeſtic fowls thrive beſt in temperate climates; that no inſtance was ever adduced of the intermixture of the breeds; and that their eggs are of a different colour: If to all theſe we add the proofs already given, that the ordinary cock is a native of the genial regions of Aſia, where travellers have hardly ever ſeen the Grous; we certainly cannot admit that theſe are the primitive ſtock, and we muſt impute it to an error occaſioned, like many others, by the deceitful gloſs of names.</p>

               <p>But there is a circumſtance which ſeems to ſhed ſome doubts on the identity of theſe birds. Pliny, deſcribing his <hi>tetrao</hi> at ſome length, never takes notice of what Ariſtotle had ſaid of the <hi>tetrix,</hi> which it is likely he would have done, if he had conceived theſe to be the ſame; unleſs the ſlight mention made by Ariſtotle had eſcaped the Roman naturaliſt.</p>
               <p>With regard to the great <hi>tetrax</hi> of which Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus ſpeaks<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <bibl>Lib. ix.</bibl>
                  </note>, it is certainly not our Grous, ſince it has fleſhy barbles like thoſe of the cock, riſing near the ears and deſcending below the bill; a character quite foreign to the Grous, and which applies much better to the Meleagris or Numidian hen, which is our Pintado.</p>
               <p>The little <hi>tetrax</hi> mentioned by the ſame author, is, according to him, an exceeding ſmall bird; and this excludes all compariſon with our Wood Grous, which is one of the firſt magnitude.</p>
               <p>In reſpect to the <hi>tetrax</hi> of the poet Neme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſianus, who dwells on its ſtupidity, Geſner conſiders it as a ſpecies of buſtard. But I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover a diſcriminating mark of reſemblance to the meleagris in the colours of its plumage; the

                  </note>.</p>
               <p>But whatever be the force of theſe conjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, it appears inconteſtably proved, that the two ſpecies of the <hi>tetrao</hi> of Pliny are really thoſe of our Grous: the fine ſhining black of their plumage; the flame-colour of their eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brows; their reſidence in cold mountainous countries<note n="‡" place="bottom">

both to the Wood and Black Grous. We can even diſtinguiſh in Pliny's
deſcription, the traces of a peculiarity that has been remarked by few
moderns; <hi>Moriuntur contumaciâ,</hi> ſays this author, <hi>ſpiritu
revocato</hi>
                  <note n="§" place="bottom">
                     <hi>i. e.</hi> They die through
obſtinacy, recalling their breath.</note>. This refers to a curious
obſervation which Friſch has inſerted in his hiſtory of this bird. That
naturaliſt, not being able to find <pb n="174" facs="tcp:1084500102:185"/> the tongue in a
dead Grous, opened the gizzard, and diſcovered that it retreated there with
all its ligaments; and this muſt commonly hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, ſince it is the general
opinion of ſportſmen that the Grous has no tongue. The ſame, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
might be ſaid of the Black Eagle men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by Pliny, and the Brazil bird of
which Scaliger ſpeaks, which was reckoned to have not tongue. This opinion
might take its riſe with credulous travellers, or unobſervant hunters, who
never viewed this bird except when ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piring, or after death, and no perſon
inſpecting their gizzard.</p>
               <p>The other ſpecies of <hi>tetrao,</hi> which Pliny de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes at the ſame place, is much larger; ſince it exceeds the buſtard, and even the vulture, which it reſembles in plumage, and in point of ſize is inferior to the oſtrich alone: beſides, it is ſo unwieldy a bird, that it can be caught by the hand<note n="*" place="bottom">This is literally true of the Little Grous, as we ſhall find in the following article.</note>. Belon aſſerts, that this ſpecies of <hi>tetrao</hi> is unknown to the moderns, who, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to him, have never ſeen any Wood Grous larger, or even ſo large as the buſtard; and there is room to doubt, whether the bird mentioned in this paſſage of Pliny by the names <hi>Otis</hi> and <hi>Avis tarda,</hi> was really our buſtard, whoſe fleſh has an excellent flavour, while the <hi>avis tarda</hi> of Pliny was very unpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latable.
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:1084500102:186"/>
But we muſt not, on this account, infer with Belon, that the great <hi>tetrao</hi> was no other than the <hi>avis tarda</hi>; ſince the Roman na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turaliſt names both the <hi>tetrao</hi> and the <hi>avis tarda</hi> in the ſame paſſage, and compares them together as birds of different ſpecies.</p>
               <p>After a mature conſideration of the ſubject, I ſhould rather conclude: 1. That the firſt <hi>tetrao</hi> of which Pliny ſpeaks, is the ſmall ſpecies of Grous, to which what is here ſaid more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly refers; 2. That his great <hi>tetrao</hi> is our Wood Grous, which, without exaggeration, exceeds the bulk of the buſtard. I myſelf weighed a large buſtard, whoſe extreme length was three feet three inches, and the extent of whoſe wings was ſix feet and an half, and found it twelve pounds; but it is well known, and we ſhall afterwards have occaſion to take notice of it, that ſome of the Wood Grous weigh more.</p>
               <p>The Wood Grous has near four feet of alar extent. Its weight is generally twelve or fifteen pounds: Aldrovandus affirms, that he has ſeen ſome that were twenty-three pounds; but theſe were Bologna pounds, which contain each only ten ounces, and therefore twenty-three are not quite equal to fifteen pounds of ſixteen ounces. The Black Cock of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of Muſcovy, deſcribed by Albin, and which is really the Wood Grous, weighed ten pounds without the feathers or entrails; and the
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:1084500102:187"/>
ſame author informs us, that the <hi>lieures</hi> of Norway, which is really the ſame bird, is as large as a buſtard.</p>
               <p>This bird ſcrapes the ground, like all the frugivorous tribe. Its bill is ſtrong and ſharp<note n="*" place="bottom">I know not what Longolius means, when he ſays that this bird has traces of barbils. Is there a kind of large grous which have barbils, as there is among the ſmall grous; or does he allude to a certain diſpoſition of the feathers repreſenting, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfectly, barbils, as he has done at the article of the Hazel Grous?</note>; the tongue is pointed, and lodged in a propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional concavity in the palate. The feet are alſo firm, and clothed before with plumage; the craw is extremely wide, but, in other reſpects, both it and the gizzard are conſtructed as in the domeſtic cock: the coat of the gizzard has a velvet ſoftneſs where the muſcles are attached.</p>
               <p>The Wood Grous feeds on the leaves or tops of the pine, of the juniper, of the cedar, of the willow, of the white poplar, of the hazel, of the myrtle, of the bramble; on thiſtles, fir-cones, the leaves and flowers of buck-wheat; on chichling vetch, millfoil, dandelion, trefoil, the vetch, and the choke-weed; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when theſe plants are young and tender. When the ſeed begins to be formed, they leave the flowers, and only eat the leaves. They feed too, eſpecially in their firſt year, on black-berries, beech-maſt, and ants eggs. On the other hand, it has been obſerved, that many
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:1084500102:188"/>
plants prove poiſonous to this bird; among others, lovage, celandine, wall-wort, lily of the valley, wheat, nettles, &amp;c.<note n="*" place="bottom">

               </p>
               <p>On opening the gizzard of the Wood Grous, ſmall pebbles have been found, ſimilar to thoſe in common poultry; a certain proof that they do not confine themſelves to the leaves and flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers which they pluck from the trees, but alſo feed on grains which they ſeek by ſcraping the ground. When they eat too many juniper-berries, their fleſh, which otherwiſe is excellent, contracts an unpleaſant taſte; and according to the remark of Pliny, it loſes its delicate flavour, if kept in cages or coops, where it is ſometimes fed for curioſity<note n="†" place="bottom">

                  </note>.</p>
               <p>The female differs from the male only in its ſize and plumage, being ſmaller and not ſo black; beſides, it excels the male in the beauty and variety of its colours; a circumſtance which is uncommon in birds, and even in other animals. From not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to this fact, Geſner has made the female another ſpecies of Grous, by the name of <hi>grygallus major,</hi> formed from the German term <hi>grugel-hahn</hi>; for the ſame reaſon, he has made the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male of the Black Grous another ſpecies, which he calls <hi>grygallus minor.</hi> Yet he pretends that he did not fix theſe ſpecies till he had carefully examined all the individuals, except the <hi>gry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gallus minor,</hi> and was confident that he could
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:1084500102:189"/>
perceive characteriſtical differences. On the other hand, Schwenckfeld, whoſe reſidence was among mountains, and who obſerved the <hi>gry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gallus</hi> often and carefully, aſſures us, that it was the female Grous; but it muſt be admitted that in this ſpecies, and perhaps in many others, the plumage is ſubject to great diverſity, ariſing from the age, the ſex, the climate, and other cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances. The one which we have cauſed to be engraved is ſomewhat creſted. Briſſon takes no notice of a creſt in his deſcription; and of the two figures given by Aldrovandus, the one is creſted, the other not. Some pretend that the Grous, when young, has much white in its plumage<note n="*" place="bottom">When the bird diſplays its tail, the white forms a circle around it.</note>, which diminiſhes, as the bird grows old, and ſo regularly as to ſerve as a mark for diſtinguiſhing the age. It would even appear that the number of quills in the tail is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant; for Linnaeus makes it eighteen in his <hi>Fauna Suecica,</hi> and Briſſon only ſixteen in his <hi>Ornithology</hi>; and what is more extraordinary, Schwenckfeld, who ſaw and examined many of theſe birds, aſſerts that, both in the large and in the ſmall ſpecies, the females have eighteen tail-feathers, and the male only twelve. It therefore follows, that every ſyſtem which aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes, for its ſpecific characters, differences ſo variable as are the colours and even the number of the feathers, will be liable to the great incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:1084500102:190"/>
of multiplying the ſpecies, (I ſhould rather ſay, nominal ſpecies, or more properly new terms,) of oppreſſing the memory of begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and of giving them falſe ideas of things, and conſequently that ſuch a plan increaſes the difficulties in the ſtudy of nature.</p>
               <p>It is falſe, what Encelius relates, that the male Grous ſitting on a tree, calls the females to him with loud cries, emits <hi>ſemen</hi> from his bill, which they ſwallow, and again diſcharge, and thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come impregnated. Nor is it true, that the part of the <hi>ſemen</hi> which is not gathered up by the females, forms ſerpents, precious ſtones, and pearls. It is mortifying to our pride to ſee the human mind inflicted with grovelling errors, or hurried into ſuch extravagant follies. The Grous couple like other birds; nor was Encelius un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainted with the fact; but he inſiſts that the embrace is mere dalliance, and that the degluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>ſemen</hi> is eſſential to propagation!</p>
               <p>The male Grous begins to be in ſeaſon about the firſt of February; the fiery appetite is moſt intenſe towards the latter end of March, and continues till the leaves are expanded. During that period of love, each cock fixes his reſidence in a certain quarter, out of which he never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves. In the morning and evening he is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved walking backwards and forwards on the trunk of a large pine or other tree, his tail diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played, his wings trailing, his neck projecting, his head ruffled, and aſſuming all ſorts of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:1084500102:191"/>
poſtures; with ſuch force is he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled by the burning deſires! He has a certain note with which he calls his females, who run under the tree where he lodges, from which he ſoon deſcends to taſte the joys of love. This ſingular cry, which is very loud, and can be heard at a great diſtance, is perhaps the reaſon of the name which has been applied, of <hi>noiſy pheaſant.</hi> It begins with a kind of exploſion, and expires in a ſharp ſhrill note, reſembling the ſound produced by whetting a ſeythe. This noiſe vaniſhes and returns alternately, and after being repeated ſeveral times in the courſe of half an hour, it ends in exploſion like the firſt<note n="*" place="bottom">

               <p>The Wood Grous, which at other times is very ſhy, can eaſily be ſurpriſed in the ſeaſon of love, eſpecially when it is occupied with its call: it is then ſtunned with its own noiſe, or, if we chuſe, ſo intoxicated, that it is neither ſcared by the ſight of man, nor rouſed by the report of a fowling-piece. It ſees nothing, it hears no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, it is diſſolved into extacy<note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <q rend="inline">It is ſo overgrown that it may be caught motionleſs on the ground.</q> 
                     <bibl>PLINY.</bibl> What that naturaliſt imputes to its bulk, may be referred with greater probability to heat, and intoxication of its paſſion.</note>; hence it has been ſaid and even written, that the Grous is deaf
and blind. But almoſt all animals, not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting man, are, in ſimilar
ſituations, abſorbed in delight: all feel, in a certain degree, the
rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures <pb n="181" facs="tcp:1084500102:192"/> of maddening joys. But probably the Wood Grous
is more under the dominion of luſt; for in Germany, the term
<hi>auerhahn</hi> is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed on the lover, who neglects every other
concern, and devotes himſelf entirely to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of his paſſion<note n="*" place="bottom">Friſch.</note>, and even applied to every perſon who
diſcovers a ſtupid inſenſibility to his moſt important
intereſts.</p>
               <p>It will be readily conceived that the ſeaſon when the Grous is wholly occupied by the amorous paſſions, is the proper time for ſetting gins, or for hunting it. When I come to treat of the Small Black Grous, I ſhall deſcribe more particularly the precautions obſerved in this ſport; I ſhall here only obſerve, that people are attentive in extirpating the old cocks, becauſe theſe appropriate an extenſive tract, and ſuffer no rivals to enter the region of their pleaſures; and thus many females are deprived of the male influence, and produce addle eggs.</p>
               <p>Some bird-catchers pretend, that before the Wood Grous couple, they provide a clean even ſpot<note n="†" place="bottom">Geſner.</note>. That ſuch may occur I have no doubt, but I ſuſpect that the Grous ſhow no foreſight in choice. It is much more natural to ſuppoſe that theſe ſpots have been the habitual reſort of the hen and her young, and that after two or three months they become more trodden and flat than the reſt of the ground.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="182" facs="tcp:1084500102:193"/>
The leaſt number of eggs which the female Wood Grous commonly lays, is five or ſix; the greateſt number, eight or nine. Schwenckfeld aſſerts, that their firſt hatch is eight, and the ſubſequent ones amount to twelve, fifteen, or even ſixteen<note n="*" place="bottom">This gradation is conformable to the general obſervation of Ariſtotle; I ſuſpect only that the number is over-rated.</note>. Theſe eggs are white, ſpotted with yellow; and, according to the ſame author, they are larger than thoſe of common hens. The female drops them in a dry ſpot on the moſs, where it hatches them alone, without the aſſiſtance of the male<note n="†" place="bottom">I have ſomewhere read that the time of incubation is twenty-eight days, which is probable, conſidering the bulk of the bird.</note>. When it is obliged to leave the eggs, it carefully ſtrews them with leaves; and though it inherits a ſavage inſtinct, the love of progeny ſeems to blunt the ſenſe of immediate danger, and it continues to ſit after we have approached it, and can hardly be forced to forſake its eggs.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as the young are hatched, they run nimbly, and even before the ſhell is completely detached. The mother leads them in the moſt careful and attentive manner; ſhe goes with them into the woods, where ſhe feeds them with ants eggs, black-berries, &amp;c. They continue united through the reſt of the year, till the return of the ſeaſon of love, inſpiring them with new ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites and inclinations, diſperſes the family; the males are the wideſt ſeparated, never aſſociating
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:1084500102:194"/>
with their own ſex, and ſeldom mixing with the females but to ſatiate their luſt.</p>
               <p>The Wood Grous delights, as we have already obſerved, in lofty mountains. But this is the caſe only in the milder latitudes; for in coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries that are intenſely cold, as Hudſon's Bay, they prefer the plains and ſheltered places; and in ſuch ſituations, they enjoy, in thoſe inclement regions, perhaps the ſame temperature as on the moſt elevated ſummits in the genial climes<note n="*" place="bottom">

fleſh comb, with two barbils of the ſame colour and ſubſtance<note n="*" place="bottom">See Geſner.</note>. In this aſſertion Willughby
inſiſts that he was miſtaken. But it is difficult to conceive that Turner
could fall into an error with reſpect to this bird, which inhabits his own
country, and concerning a character that would be ſo eaſily noticed. On the
other hand, admitting what Turner ſays, I ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer his Mooriſh hen
to another ſpecies; or, if we chuſe, to another ſort of the Black Grous,
analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gous to the firſt in its general ſtructure and habits, but
diſtinguiſhed by its undivided tail and its fleſh barbils; and what
confirms me in this opinion is, that I find in Geſner, a bird by the name of
<hi>gallus ſylveſtris,</hi> which has theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties; ſo that we may
conſider it as an indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual of the ſame ſpecies with Turner's Mooriſh
hen; eſpecially, as in this ſpecies, the male is called the <hi>black
cock</hi> in Scotland, (whence Geſner received his figure,) and the female
<hi>grey hen</hi>; a circumſtance which marks diſtinctly the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of
the plumage of the two ſexes in this ſpecies of the Grous.</p>
               <p>The Black Grous weighs three or four pounds. It bears a great reſemblance to the Wood Grous; it has red eye-lids, rough feet without ſpurs, indented toes, white ſpot on the wing, &amp;c. But it is diſtinguiſhed by two obvious characters; it
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:1084500102:198"/>
is much ſmaller, and its tail is forked, the outer feathers being longer, the middle ones bent back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. Beſides, the male of the ſmall ſpecies is of a deeper and more diſtinct black; the red glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous ſkin above the eyes is broader, but ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to ſome variations in the ſame individuals at different times, as we ſhall find in the ſequel.</p>
               <p>The female is only two thirds of the ſize of the male<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <bibl>Britiſh Zoology.</bibl>
                  </note>. Its tail is leſs forked, and the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours of its plumage are ſo different, that Geſner was induced to refer it to a diſtinct ſpecies, by the name of <hi>grygallus minor.</hi> This change in the colours of the plumage does not take place till after a certain age; the young males at firſt reſemble their mother, and preſerve the ſame appearance till the end of the autumn. Towards the cloſe of that ſeaſon, and during the winter, the plumage gradually acquires a deeper colour, till it becomes a bluiſh-black, which is permanent thenceforth, except the ſlight changes which I ſhall mention. 1. The blue increaſes ſomewhat with age: 2. At the end of three years, and not ſooner, a white ſpot appears under the bill: 3. When they are very old, another ſpot of a variegated black ſpreads under the tail, where the feathers are all white<note n="†" place="bottom">

The naturaliſts who unanimouſly reckon twenty-ſix quills in the wing of the Black Grous, do not agree ſo well with reſpect to the number of quills in the tail: Schwenckfeld allows eighteen to the female, and only twelve to the male. Willoughby, Albin, and Briſſon, beſtow ſixteen on either ſex. The two males preſerved in the Royal Cabinet have each eighteen; viz. ſeven large ones on each ſide, and four in the middle much ſhorter. Muſt we aſcribe theſe differences to a real variation in the number of quill-fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; or are we to impute them to the inac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curacy or inattention of the obſervers?—The wings of the Black Grous are ſhort, and hence its flight is laborious, nor is it ever ſeen to riſe high, or to purſue a diſtant courſe.</p>
               <p>In both ſexes the orifice of the ears is wide, the toes are connected by a membrane as high as the firſt articulation, and edged with indent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; their fleſh is white, and of eaſy digeſtion; the tongue ſoft, beſet with ſmall points, and not parted; under the tongue is a glandulous ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; in the palate, a cavity correſponding ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly to the dimenſions of the tongue; the craw is very large, the inteſtinal tube fifty-one inches long, and the appendices or <hi>caeca</hi> twenty-four; theſe fluted with ſix <hi>ſtriae</hi>

               <p>The difference between the male and female is not confined to the ſurface; it penetrates even
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:1084500102:200"/>
to the interior organization. Dr. Waygand ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, that the bone of the <hi>ſternum</hi> in the males, being held to the light, appears interwoven with a prodigious number of ſmall ramifications of a red colour, which meander in every ſhape and in all directions, and form a curious and ſingular web; but that in the females the ſame bone has nothing analogous to theſe ramifications; it is beſides very ſmall, and of a whitiſh colour<note n="*" place="bottom">

If we ſtrip this tale of the marvellous, it alludes to the ſame ſort of torpor with that of the Grous and Marmots, while the functions of the external ſenſes are ſuſpended for want of heat.</note>.</p>
               <p>Theſe birds are found in the mountainous tracts of the North of England and Scotland; in Norway, and the boreal provinces of Sweden; in the neighbourhood of Cologne; in the Swiſs Alps; in Bugey, where, according to Hubert, they are called <hi>grianots</hi>; in Podolia; in Lithu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ania; in Samogitia; and particularly in Vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinia, and in the Ukraine, which includes the Palatinates of Kiovia and Breſlaw, where a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh noble, as Rzacynzſki ſays, caught in one day, near the village of Kuſmince, one hundred

               <p>The Black Grous comes in ſeaſon about the time when the willows begin to ſhoot, that is towards the end of the winter; the ſportſmen readily diſcover it by the humidity of their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements<note n="†" place="bottom">

It is then that the males are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to aſſemble by day-break, to the number of a hundred or more, in ſome place which is elevated, ſolitary, ſurrounded with marſhes, or covered with heath, and this is the field of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual contention; they fight bitterly with each other, till the vanquiſhed are driven to flight.

               <p>When the females are impregnated, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire to lay their eggs in copſes, which are thick and tall.

               <p>As ſoon as the chickens are twelve or fifteen days old, they flap their wings, and eſſay to fly; but it is five or ſix weeks before they are able to riſe from the ground, and then they perch on the
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:1084500102:204"/>
trees with their mothers. This is the time to decoy them with a call<note n="*" place="bottom">This call is made of a bone of the Goſhawk, which is filled with wax, and proper holes bored in it. <bibl>BRESLAW's <hi>Acts.</hi>
                     </bibl>
                  </note>, to catch them in the net, or to ſhoot them. The mother miſtaking this call for the chirping of her ſtrayed young, runs to the place, and invites them by a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar cry, which ſhe often repeats, like the domeſtic fowls in the ſame circumſtances; ſhe thus col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects the whole covey, and all become devoted to the mercy of the ſportſmen.</p>
               <p>As they grow bigger, their plumage gradually aſſumes a black caſt, and then they are not ſo eaſily decoyed; but when they have attained half their growth, the falcon is flown at them; and the proper time is about the cloſe of autumn, when the trees have ſhed their leaves. In that ſeaſon, the males ſelect ſome ſpot, whither they repair every morning at ſun-riſe, and by a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain cry (eſpecially when it is likely to be froſt, or fine weather), they invite all other birds of the ſame ſpecies, of every age and of either ſex. When aſſembled, they fly in flocks to the buſhes; or if there is no ſnow on the ground, they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſe over the ſtubble fields, where barley, oats, or other ſuch grain has been reaped. Then it is that birds of prey trained on purpoſe afford ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent ſport.</p>
               <p>Another method of catching this game is prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed in Courland, Livonia, and Lithuania. They uſe a ſtuffed grous, or an artificial bird made of
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:1084500102:205"/>
cloth of the proper colour, and ſtuffed with hay or tow, and this is termed in thoſe countries, <hi>balvane.</hi> They faſten this <hi>balvane</hi> to the end of a ſtick, and place it on ſome birch-tree near the ſcene of their amours: the time for this ſport is in the month of April. The birds gather round the <hi>balvane,</hi> and fight with each other in play; at laſt they engage in earneſt, and are ſo much occupied in the violence of their contentions, that the ſportſman, who is concealed near the ſpot in his hut, ſurpriſes them, and catches them, without being obliged to aim a ſingle blow. Thoſe caught in this way, he tames in the ſpace of five or ſix days; ſo that they will come to eat out of his hand<note n="*" place="bottom">In this reſpect the Little Grous differs widely from the Great Grous, which, far from ſubmitting to domeſtication, conſtantly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects what is offered it to eat.</note>. On the following year in the ſpring, they make uſe of thoſe tame birds, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of <hi>balvanes,</hi> to decoy the wild Black Grous, which fall upon them, and fight with ſuch fury as not to be ſcared by the report of a fowling-piece. Each morning they repair by day-break to the common rendezvous, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main there till ſun-riſe, when they fly away and diſperſe through the foreſts and heaths in ſearch of food. About three o'clock in the afternoon, they return to the ſame ſpot. and continue there till late in the evening. This is their regular courſe of life, eſpecially in fair weather, during the ſeaſon of love, which laſts three or four
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:1084500102:206"/>
weeks; but when it is rainy or cold, they are rather more retired.</p>
               <p>The young Black Grous have alſo their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite ſpot of reſort, where they aſſemble in flocks of forty or fifty at a time, and devote themſelves to nearly the ſame amuſements or occupations; their voice however is hoarſer, and broken; and they do not leap with equal agility. Their meeting laſts only eight days, after which they join the old ones.</p>
               <p>When the ſeaſon of love is over, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently their aſſemblies leſs regular, new ſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagems muſt be employed to decoy them near the hut where is the <hi>balvane.</hi> Several ſportſmen on horſeback encloſe a circuit of variable extent, having the hut for its centre, and cracking their whips, they drive the Grous from buſh to buſh, and ſo gradually contract the bounds, and, by means of a whiſtle, they inform the perſon who manages the <hi>balvane</hi> of their approach. The Grous, when they ſhift from one buſh to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, diſtinguiſh accurately thoſe branches which are able to ſupport them, not even ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting the vertical ſhoots, which bend with their weight into an horizontal ſituation; after alight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they liſten attentively, ſtretching out their neck to learn if they are in a place of ſafety, and as ſoon as they have allayed their fears, they begin to pluck the tender buds. The dexterous ſportſman then ſeizes the opportunity of placing his <hi>balvane</hi> on the neighbouring twigs, and
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:1084500102:207"/>
fixing a cord, he pulls it from time to time, ſo as to imitate the waving motions of the Grous, ſitting on a flexible branch. Experience alſo inſtructs him to turn the head of the <hi>balvanes</hi> againſt the wind when it blows violently; but in ſtill wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he finds it beſt to place them oppoſite to each other. If the Grous are driven ſtraight towards his hut, he can diſcover by an eaſy ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, whether they will perch within his reach. If their flight is irregular, if they ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times approach and ſometimes retire, flapping their wings, he concludes, that perhaps the whole flock, or at leaſt part of them, will alight near him. On the other hand, if they ſpring not far from his hut, and ſhoot in a rapid ſteady courſe, he is certain that they will puſh on to a diſtance. When the Grous ſettle near the hut, the fowler is informed at leaſt thrice by their repeated cries; he is then cautious not to fire upon them too ſuddenly; he remains ſtill in his hut, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out making the leaſt noiſe, allowing the birds time to examine their ſituation, and to quiet their apprehenſions. When they are ſettled and begin to feed, he takes his aim ſteadily, and fires. But however numerous the flock be, though it even amount to fifty or a hundred, he can hardly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to kill more than one or two at each ſhot; for theſe birds do not group together, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly perch on a ſeparate tree, and hence ſtraggling buſhes are better for the ſport than a thick foreſt. However, when there is no ſnow
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:1084500102:208"/>
lying on the ground, this amuſement is ſometimes taken in open ſtubble fields, the crops of oats, barley, buck-wheat, being led, the hut is covered with ſtraw; there the ſport is tolerably ſucceſsful, except in ſevere weather, when theſe birds are diſperſed and concealed. But the firſt fine day that ſucceeds makes them more eaſily caught; and a ſhooter, who has taken his ſtation properly, can, without any aſſiſtance of horſemen, and with bird-calls alone, entice them to his hut with eaſe.</p>
               <p>It is aſſerted that, when theſe birds fly in flocks, they are led by an old cock, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts them like an experienced chief, and teaches them to ſhun the decoys of the ſportſmen; ſo that in this caſe it is exceedingly difficult to drive them to the <hi>balvane,</hi> and all that can be then expected is to intercept a few of the ſtragglers.</p>
               <p>The proper time for the ſport is from ſun-riſe to ten o'clock in the forenoon; and from one o'clock in the afternoon to four. But in autumn, when the air is ſtill and cloſe, it may be continued without interruption through the whole day; for the Grous then ſeldom ſhift their place. And in this way, they may be chaſed from tree to tree, till near the winter ſolſtice; about that time they grow more wild, ſhy, and cunning; they even change their accuſtomed haunt, unleſs they are confined by the rigours of the ſeaſon.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="197" facs="tcp:1084500102:209"/>
It is ſaid to be a ſign of fair weather, when the Grous ſit on the tops of the trees, and upon the young ſhoots; but if they deſcend to the lower branches, and ſquat, it forebodes an approaching ſtorm. I ſhould not take notice of theſe remarks of the ſportſmen, if they did not correſpond with the inſtincts of theſe birds, which, from what we have already ſeen, muſt be very ſuſceptible of the impreſſions made by the varying ſtate of the atmoſphere, and whoſe ſenſibility in this reſpect may be ſuppoſed ſo great, conſiſtently with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability, as to be affected by the change which decides the nature of the following day.</p>
               <p>When the weather is exceſſively rainy, they retire for ſhelter into the cloſeſt and moſt buſhy foreſts, and as they are tardy and laborious in their flight, they can ſometimes be hunted down with dogs, which exhauſt them, and catch them by ſpeed of foot<note n="*" place="bottom">

               <p>In other countries, the Black Grous is, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Aldrovandus, caught with a nooſe; a net is alſo uſed, as has been already obſerved; but it would be curious to know the ſhape, dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and conſtruction of the one with which the Poliſh nobleman, of whom Rzaczynſki ſpeaks, caught two hundred and ſixty at one time. <note n="A" place="bottom">Specific character of the Black Grous, <hi>Tetrao-Tetrix:</hi>

At a ſhort diſtance they plant tall baſkets ſhaped like an invented cone, and place in the mouth of theſe a little wheel that turns freely on its axis. The Black Grous are attracted by the corn, alight on the poles, and after a haſty repaſt, fly to the baſkets, perch upon the rim of the wheel, which, giving way, precipitates them into the trap.</note>

               <p>I HAVE, in the preceding article, ſtated the reaſons which have induced me to refer this bird to a diſtinct family. Geſner ſpeaks of it by the name of <hi>Wood-cock, (gallus ſylveſtris),</hi> as a bird having red barbils, and a broad undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided tail. He adds, that the male is called <hi>Wood-cock</hi> in Scotland, and the female <hi>Grey-hen.</hi> It is true indeed, that this author, conceiving that the two ſexes cannot differ much in the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of their plumage, tranſlates Grey-hen by <hi>gallina fuſca</hi> or <hi>Duſky-hen,</hi> in order to bring them to a nearer conformity; and reſting on this erroneous verſion, he concludes that this ſpecies is quite diſtinct from the Mooriſh hen of Turner, becauſe he imagines this bird is too widely removed, by the colour of its plumage, from the male to belong to the ſame family. But the fact is, that the male is almoſt always en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely black, and the female is nearly the ſame colour with the gray partridge; and this circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance completely decides its identity with the Black Cock of Scotland; for even Geſner admits, that in other reſpects they are perfectly alike. The only difference that I can perceive is, that

the Scotch Black Cock has ſmall red ſpots under the breaſt, the wings, and the thighs; but we have ſeen in the preceding article, that the young males which in the end become black, are at firſt of the colour of the mother, and perhaps the ſmall red ſpots mentioned by Geſner, are only the traces of their infant plumage before they have acquired the deep jet.</p>
               <p>I ſee no reaſon why Briſſon ſhould confound this tribe or variety, as he calls it, with the <hi>tetrao,</hi> dotted with white, of Linnaeus<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <bibl>
                        <hi>Fauna Suecica,</hi> No. 167.</bibl>
                  </note>; ſince one of the characters of this bird, which is termed by the Swedes <hi>rackle-hane,</hi> is its having a forked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail. Beſides, Linnaeus gives it no barbils, which, according to the figure and deſcription of Geſner, belong to the other birds.</p>
               <p>Nor can I ſee why Briſſon, though he claſſes theſe two tribes together, makes only one variety of the forked-tail Black Grous; ſince, beſides the differences that have been juſt noticed, Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus expreſsly mentions, that his Grous ſprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kled with white, is more ſhy and wild, and has a quite different cry; which implies, I ſhould imagine, characters deeply impreſſed, and more permanent than what conſtitute a mere variety.</p>
               <p>It would appear therefore more conſiſtent to diſtinguiſh theſe into two ſpecies of Black Grous; the one including the Scotch Black Cock, and Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner's Mooriſh Hen; and the other, characterized by the ſmall white ſpots under the breaſt, and
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:1084500102:213"/>
its different cry, would comprehend the Swediſh <hi>rackle-hane.</hi> Thus we might reckon four ſpecies of the genus of Grous. 1. The Wood Grous: 2. The Forked-tail Black Grous: 3. The <hi>Rack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan,</hi> or <hi>Racklehane,</hi> of Sweden, deſcribed by Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus: 4. The Mooriſh Hen of Turner, or the Black Cock of Scotland; with fleſh barbils on both ſides of the bill, and with an uniform tail.—Theſe four ſpecies are all natives of the northern climates, and reſide either in foreſts of pine or of birch. The third only, or the Swediſh <hi>rackle-hane,</hi> is the only one that might be conſidered as a variety of the Black Grous, if Linnaeus had not aſcertained its having a different note.</p>

               <p>THE Wood Grous are common in Lapland, eſpecially when the ſcarcity of proviſions, or the exceſſive multiplication of their numbers, compels them to leave the foreſts of Sweden and Scandinavia, and advance into the polar tracts<note n="*" place="bottom">Klein.</note>. Yet they have never been found white in thoſe frozen regions; the colour of their plumage ſeems to be fixed and permanent, and to reſiſt the operation of cold. The ſame may be ſaid of the Little or Black Grous, which are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent in Courland, and the north of Poland; but Dr. Weigandt, the Jeſuit Rzaczynſki, and Klein, affirm that there is in Courland another kind of the ſame, termed <hi>White Grous,</hi> which, however, become white only in winter, and by the return of ſummer, acquire a reddiſh-brown colour, according to Dr. Weigandt; but a bluiſh-grey, according to Rzaczynſki. Theſe variations take place generally in both ſexes; ſo that at all times the individuals have preciſely
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:1084500102:215"/>
the ſame colours. They do not perch on trees like the other Grous, but delight in thick bruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood and heath; and generally ſelect each year a certain ſpot, to which they commonly reſort when diſperſed by ſportſmen, by birds of prey, or by the violence of a ſtorm. If we hunt them, we ought, when they are firſt ſprung, to obſerve carefully their place of ſhelter, ſince this will certainly be their rendezvous through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the year; and it will be more difficult to ſpring them a ſecond time, for they will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſquat on the ground, and endeavour to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal themſelves, in which caſe it will be eaſy to ſhoot them.</p>
               <p>It appears, therefore, that they differ from the Black Grous, not only by their colour, and by the uniformity which obtains between the male and female, but in their habits, ſince they never perch. They are alſo diſtinguiſhed from the ptarmigans, becauſe they inhabit not the lofty mountains, but reſide in the woods and among the heaths; nor are their legs clothed to the toes with feathers. I muſt indeed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, that I would rather have ranked it with the Red Grous, did I not ſubmit to the opinion of theſe three intelligent writers, who ſpeak of a bird that is a native of their own country.</p>

               <p>WHAT Varro has ſaid concerning the Ruſtic or Wild Hen, applies ſo accurately to the Hazel Grous, that Belon does not heſitate to conclude that they were the ſame. It was, according to Varro, a bird uncommonly rare at Rome; and ſo difficult to tame, that it could only be raiſed in cages, and ſeldom or never laid eggs in this ſtate of captivity. Belon and Schwenckfeld ſay the ſame of the Hazel Grous; the former conveys, in a few words, a preciſe notion of the bird, more diſtinct than could be given by a long deſcription. <q rend="inline">Suppoſe,</q> ſays he <q rend="inline">that you ſaw a partridge bred by the croſſing of the red with the grey, and having a few pheaſants feathers, and you will have an idea of the Hazel Grous.</q>

               <p>The male is diſtinguiſhed from the female by a very remarkable black ſpot under its throat, and by its orbits, which are of a much deeper red. Their ſize is that of the <hi>bartavelle</hi>; the

                  <pb n="205" facs="tcp:1084500102:218"/> extent of their wings is only twenty-one
inches, and hence they fly ſlowly and laboriouſly, and a great effort is
required to raiſe them from the ground: however, they run exceedingly
faſt<note n="*" place="bottom">Geſner.</note>. They have twenty-four quills,
that are almoſt all equal, in each wing, and ſixteen in the tail.
Schwenckfeld ſays, that there are only fifteen; but he is miſtaken, and the
leſs excuſable, as there is perhaps not a ſingle bird that has an odd
number of tail quills. The tail is marked near its extremity by a broad
blackiſh bar, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted only by the two middle quills. I ſhould not take
notice of that circumſtance, were it not to confirm the remark of Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lughby,
that in moſt birds the two middle quills do not follow the diſtance of the
lateral ones, but ſometimes project beyond them, and ſometimes extend not
ſo far; ſo that in this caſe, the interruption of colour appears to
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on the difference of their poſition.—Like the other Grous,
their orbits are red; the toes indented on the ſides, though more ſlightly;
the nail of the middle toe, ſharp and flat; the legs clothed with feathers
before, but only as far as the middle of the tarſus; the gizzard muſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar;
the alimentary canal thirty inches and odd; the appendices or <hi>caeca</hi>
thirteen or four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen inches, ſtriped with furrows<note n="†" place="bottom">Willughby.</note>; the fleſh white when dreſſed, but more
ſo within than <pb n="206" facs="tcp:1084500102:219"/> without, and thoſe who have examined
it atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively pretend that they can diſtinguiſh four dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent colours;
in the ſame manner as three different flavours are found in the buſtards
and common grous. However, the fleſh of the Hazel Grous is excellent; and
hence is derived, it is ſaid, its Latin name <hi>Bonaſa</hi>; and alſo
the Hungarian appellation <hi>Tſchaſarmadar,</hi> or <hi>Caeſar's
Bird,</hi> ſignifying that it was fit to be kept for the Emperor. It is
indeed highly eſteemed, and Geſner remarks that it is the only diſh
ſuffered to appear twice at princes' tables.</p>
               <p>In the kingdom of Bohemia, it is as much eaten at Eaſter, as lamb in France; and it is cuſtomary to ſend it in preſents from one perſon to another<note n="*" place="bottom">Schwenckfeld.</note>.</p>
               <p>The Hazel Grous lives, both in ſummer and winter, on nearly the ſame food as that of the Common Grous. We find in their ſtomach, in the ſummer, the berries of the ſervice-tree, of the bilberry, the bramble, and the heath; the ſeeds of the Alpine elder, the pods of the <hi>ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarella,</hi> the catkins of the birch and of the hazel, &amp;c.; and in winter, we meet with juniper berries, the buds of the birch, the tops of heath, fir, juniper, and of ſome other ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greens<note n="†" place="bottom">Ray, Schwenckfeld, and Rzaczynſki.</note>. When the Hazel Grous is kept in confinement, it may be fed with wheat, barley,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:1084500102:220"/>
and other grain; but, like the Common Grous, it does not long ſurvive the loſs of its liberty<note n="*" place="bottom">Geſner and Schwenckfeld.</note>; whether becauſe it is ſhut up ſo cloſely as to affect its health, or that its ſavage, or rather generous nature, will not brook the ſlighteſt encroachment on its freedom.</p>
               <p>The time of ſport returns twice a-year, in ſpring and in autumn; but the latter ſeaſon is the moſt favourable. They are attracted by the ſound of bird-calls which imitate their note, and horſes are led into the field, becauſe it is a vulgar opinion, that the Hazel Grous are fond of theſe animals<note n="†" place="bottom">Geſner.</note>. It has alſo been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked by the ſportſmen, that if the cock be firſt caught, the hen ſeeks her mate with anxious ſolicitude, and returns ſeveral times to viſit the ſpot, with other males in her train; but if the hen be firſt enſnared, the cock joins another family, and totally forgets his former attachments<note n="‡" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>. Certain it is, that when one of theſe birds is ſurpriſed and rouſed, it ſprings, making a loud noiſe, and, perching on a tree, it ſits motionleſs and unconcerned, while the ſportſman meditates its deſtruction. Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they ſettle on the centre of the tree, where the boughs part from the trunk.</p>
               <p>As much has been ſaid of the Hazel Grous, many fables have been told: the moſt abſurd
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:1084500102:221"/>
are thoſe concerning its manner of propagating. Encelius, and others, aſſert that they copulate with their bills, that the cocks themſelves lay when they grow old, and that their eggs being hatched by the toads, produce wild baſiliſks, in the ſame manner as the eggs of the common cocks, if hatched by toads, give birth to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic baſiliſks. And leſt we ſhould entertain ſuſpicions with regard to theſe baſiliſks, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celius deſcribes one that he ſaw<note n="*" place="bottom">In Geſner.</note>; but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunately he neither tells us whether he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held it emerge from the egg, or beheld this egg excluded by the male. Moſt of theſe ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities take their riſe from the miſrepreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of facts; and it is probable that the Hazel Grous bill like the turtle doves, and toy with each other to raiſe the ſwell of love.</p>
               <p>According to the opinion of ſportſmen, the Hazel Grous comes in ſeaſon in the months of October and November; and at that time the males only are killed, being decoyed by a kind of whiſtling analogous to the ſhrill note of the females; they haſten to the ſpot, making a loud ruſtling noiſe with their wings, and are ſhot as ſoon as they alight.</p>
               <p>The females, like other large birds, form their neſt on the ground, and commonly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal it under hazels, or below the ſhade of a
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:1084500102:222"/>
broad mountain fern. They commonly lay twelve or fifteen eggs, and ſometimes even twenty, and theſe are ſomewhat larger than pigeons eggs<note n="*" place="bottom">Schwenckfeld.</note>. They ſit three weeks, and have ſeldom more than ſeven or eight young<note n="†" place="bottom">Friſch.</note>, which run as ſoon as they are hatched, as uſual in moſt of the ſhort-winged birds. As ſoon as the young are able to fly, the parents remove from the tract where they bred; and being thus forſaken, they pair and diſperſe, to form new ſettlements, and in their turn to ſend off other colonies<note n="‡" place="bottom">Geſner.</note>.</p>
               <p>The Hazel Grous delight in foreſts, where they can find their proper ſuſtenance, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal themſelves from the rapacious birds, which they dread exceedingly, and perch, for ſhelter, on the low branches<note n="‖" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>. Some affirm that they prefer the mountain foreſts; but they alſo inhabit the woods that grow in the plains, for they are plentiful in the neighbourhood of Nuremberg. They are frequent alſo in the woods that clothe the bottom of the Alps and the Apennines. They are found like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in the mountain of Giants in Sileſia, in Poland, &amp;c. Anciently they were ſo numerous, according to Varro, in a little iſland in the Liguſtic Sea, now the Gulph

               <p>IF this bird be the ſame with the <hi>Gallus paluſtris</hi> of Geſner, as Briſſon thinks, the figure which the German naturaliſt gives, muſt undoubtedly be very inaccurate, ſince no feathers are repreſented on the legs; and, on the other hand, red barbils appear under the bill. Is it not natural then to ſuſpect that this figure be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to a different bird? However, the <hi>Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cock,</hi> or <hi>Cock of the Marſh,</hi> is excellent meat; and all that we know of its hiſtory is, that it delights in wet ſituations, as its name denotes. The Authors of the <hi>Britiſh Zoology</hi> ſuppoſe, that what Briſſon takes for the <hi>Scotch Hazel Grous,</hi> is really the <hi>Ptarmigan</hi> in its ſummer garb, and that its plumage becomes almoſt always white in winter. But if this were the caſe, it muſt alſo loſe the feathers which cover the toes; for Briſſon expreſsly notices, that it is only clothed to the origin of the toes, and the ptarmigan in the Britiſh Zoology is feathered even to the nails; beſides, theſe two birds, as they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented in the Zoology, and in Briſſon's work, reſemble each other neither in appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance nor ſtructure. Briſſon's Scotch Hazel Grous is ſomewhat larger than ours, and its
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:1084500102:225"/>
tail ſhorter; it reſembles that of the Pyrenees in the length of its wings; its legs clothed before with feathers as far as the origin of the toes; in the length of the middle toe compared with thoſe on the ſides; and in the ſhortneſs of the hind toe: it differs, becauſe its toes are not indented, and its tail has not the two long nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row feathers, which is the moſt obvious cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the Pyrenean Hazel Grous. I need take no notice of the colours of the plumage, the figure will convey a clearer idea than any deſcription; and beſides, nothing is more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain, ſince they vary conſiderably in the ſame individual at different ſeaſons.</p>

               <p>Briſſon, conſidering the Damaſcus or Syrian Partridge of Belon, as the ſame ſpecies with his Pyrenean Hazel Grous, ranges it among the appellations beſtowed in different languages on that tribe, and quotes Belon as his authority for the Greek name <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. But he is miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken in two points: Firſt, Belon tells us himſelf, that the bird which he calls <hi>the Damaſcus Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridge,</hi> is a different ſpecies from what authors term <hi>Syroperdrix,</hi> which has a black plumage and a
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:1084500102:228"/>
red bill. Secondly, Briſſon, writing the word in Greek characters, ſeems to inſinuate that it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from that language, while Belon poſitively mentions that it is originally Latin. Laſtly, it is difficult to conceive what led Briſſon to conſider the <hi>aenas</hi> of Ariſtotle as the ſame ſpecies with his Pyrenean Hazel Grous; for Ariſtotle claſſes his <hi>aenas,</hi> which is the <hi>vinago</hi> of Gaza, with the pigeons, the turtles, and the ring-doves, (in which he is followed by all the Arabians,) and he expreſsly mentions that, like theſe birds, it only lays two eggs at a time. But we have already ſeen that the Hazel Grous lays a much greater number; and conſequently the <hi>aenas</hi> of Ariſtotle cannot be conſidered as the Pyrenean Hazel Grous, and ought therefore to be referred to a different ſpecies.</p>
               <p>Rondelet conceived, that the Greek word was not <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>, but ought to be read <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

               </p>
               <p>It follows from what has been ſaid, that the <hi>ſyroperdrix</hi> of Belon, and the <hi>oenas</hi> of Ariſtotle, are not the Pyrenean Hazel or Pin-tailed Grous, any more than the <hi>alchata, alfuachat,</hi> and the <hi>filacotona,</hi> which appear to be Arabian names, and certainly denote a bird of the pigeon kind.</p>
               <p>On the other hand, the Syrian bird, which Edwards terms <hi>the little heath-cock, with two thread-like feathers in the tail,</hi> and which the Turks call <hi>kata,</hi> is really the ſame with the Pyrenean Hazel-Grous. This author tells us, that Dr. Shaw names it <hi>kittawiah,</hi> and that he only gives three toes to each foot; but he alleges that the traveller has committed this overſight in not attending to the hind toe, which is hid under the plumage of the legs. Yet he had a little before mentioned, (and we readily
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:1084500102:230"/>
perceive it from the figure,) that the fore-part only of the leg is covered with white feathers like hairs; and it is difficult to conceive how the hind toe could be concealed under the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior plumage. It would be more natural to ſay, that it eſcaped Dr. Shaw's obſervation, by its diminutive ſize, for it is only two lines long. The two lateral toes are alſo very ſhort com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with the middle one, and in them all, the edges are marked with ſmall indentings, as in the common Grous. The Pin-tailed or Pyre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nean Hazel Grous, ſeems therefore to be quite a diſtinct ſpecies from the true Hazel Grous. For, 1. its wings are much broader in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the reſt of its body, and conſequently it muſt fly ſmoothly and rapidly, and have habits different from thoſe of tardy birds. 2. We learn from the obſervations of Dr. Ruſſel, quoted by Edwards, that it flies in numerous flocks, and ſpends the greateſt part of the year in the deſerts of Syria, and does not venture near the city of Aleppo, except in the months of May and June, when it is obliged to reſort to places where it can get water. We know too that the Hazel Grous is a timorous bird, and never deems itſelf ſecure from the vultures talons, unleſs concealed in the moſt ſhady trees. The Pin-tailed Grous, which the inhabitants of Catalonia call the <hi>partridge of Garrira</hi>

                  </note>, is nearly the bulk of the gray partridge;
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:1084500102:231"/>
the orbits are black, nor are the eye-brows red or flame coloured; the bill is almoſt ſtraight; the noſtrils are placed at the baſe of the upper mandible, and joining the feathers which cover the face; the fore-part of the leg is feathered to the origin of the toes; the wings are of conſiderable length, and the ſhafts of the quills are black; the two quills in the middle of the tail are twice as long as the reſt, and very narrow where they project; the lateral quills grow ſhorter and ſhorter until the laſt one. We may remark that of all theſe properties which characteriſe the pretended Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zel Grous of the Pyrenees, there is not one which exactly agrees with the Hazel Grous<note n="*" place="bottom">Edwards and Briſſon.</note>.</p>
               <p>The female is of the ſame ſize with the male, but differs by its plumage, the colours of which are fainter, and by the filaments in the tail, which are not ſo long. It appears that the male has a black ſpot under its throat, and that the female, inſtead of this, has three rings of the ſame colour, which encircle its neck like a collar.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not attempt to deſcribe the colours of the plumage; I ſhall only obſerve that they have a great affinity to thoſe of the bird known at Montpelier by the name of <hi>angel,</hi> of which John Culmann communicated a deſcription to Geſner<note n="†" place="bottom">

ſeem to be omitted in this deſcription, and alſo in the figure ſent by
Rondelet to Geſner, of this ſame bird, which he had taken for the
<hi>oenas</hi> of Ariſtotle. In ſhort, there ſeems to be reaſon to
doubt the identity of theſe two ſpecies, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding their
correſpondence in the plumage and in the place of reſidence; unleſs we
ſuppoſe that the ſubjects deſcribed by Culmann and deſigned by
Rondelet were females, in which the threads of the tail were much ſhorter,
and conſequently leſs remarkable.</p>
               <p>This ſpecies is found in moſt of the warm countries in the ancient continent; in Spain, in the ſouth of France, in Italy, in Syria, in Turkey and Arabia, in Barbary, and even at Senegal; for the bird figured in the <hi>Planches Enluminées</hi> by the name of the Senegal Hazel Grous, is only a variety, and ſomewhat ſmaller, but has the ſame long feathers or threads in the tail, the lateral quills become gradually ſhorter the farther they are placed from the middle, the wings are very long, the legs covered before with a white down, the mid-toe much longer than thoſe near the ſides, and the hind one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly ſhort; laſtly, it has no red ſkin over the eyes, and differs from the Pin-tailed Grous only in being rather ſmaller, and its plumage deeper tinged with reddiſh. It is therefore only
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:1084500102:233"/>
a variety of the ſame ſpecies, produced by the influence of climate; and what ought to ſhew that this bird is different from the Hazel Grous, and ſhould therefore be diſtinguiſhed by a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frent name, is, that beſides the diſparity of figure, it always inhabits the warm countries, and never occurs in the cold or even the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate climates; whereas the Hazel Grous are rare except in chilly tracts.</p>
               <p>It may be proper in this place to tranſcribe what Dr. Shaw informs us with reſpect to the <hi>Kittawiah,</hi> or Barbary Hazel Grous, and which is all we know on the ſubject, that the reader may compare it with the Pin-tailed Grous, or the Pyrenean Hazel Grous, and judge if they are really two individuals of the ſame ſpecies.</p>

               <p>THIS is Belon's <hi>francolin,</hi> which we muſt not confound, as ſome ornithologiſts have done, with the <hi>francolin</hi> deſcribed by Olina. Theſe are two birds widely different both in their form and in their habits: the laſt delights in plains and low ſituations; it has not the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful flame-coloured orbits, that give the other ſo diſtinguiſhed an appearance; its neck is ſhorter and its body thicker; the feet reddiſh, furniſhed with ſpurs, and not feathered, as its toes are not indented; in ſhort, it bears no reſemblance at all to the bird which we at preſent conſider.</p>
               <p>The ancients have ſaid a great deal about the <hi>attagas,</hi> or <hi>attagen</hi> (for they uſe both names in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently). Alexander the Myndian tells us in his commentary on Athenaeus, that it was rather larger than a partridge, and its plumage, which was of a reddiſh ground, was mottled with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:1084500102:236"/>
colours. Ariſtophanes had ſaid nearly the ſame thing; but Ariſtotle, according to his commendable cuſtom of marking the analogy between unknown objects and ſuch as are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, compares its plumage to that of the wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cock (<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>). Alexander the Myndian ſubjoins, that its wings are ſhort, and its flight tardy; and Theophraſtus remarks that, like the other heavy birds, as the partridge, the cock, the pheaſant, &amp;c. it is hatched without feathers, and can run as ſoon as it quits the ſhell. Like theſe alſo, it welters in the duſt<note n="*" place="bottom">The ancients called theſe birds <hi>Pulveratrices,</hi> which roll in duſt to rid themſelves of the inſects that torment them; in the ſame manner as the aquatic fowls ſeek to remove them by ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling water on their wings.</note>, and feeds on fruits, devour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the berries and grain which it finds, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times eating the plants themſelves, ſometimes ſcraping the earth with its nails; and as it runs more than it flies, it was cuſtomary to hunt it with dogs, and this chaſe was ſucceſsful<note n="†" place="bottom">

                     </bibl> This author adds, that they are fond of ſtags, and, on the contrary, have an averſion to cocks.</note>.</p>
               <p>Pliny, Aelian, and others ſay, that theſe birds loſe their cry with their liberty; and that, owing to the depreſſion of their native faculties, they are very difficult to tame. Varro, however, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructs us how to breed them, and the mode is nearly the ſame with that of raiſing peacocks, pheaſants, Guinea fowls, partridges, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Pliny informs us, that this bird, which had been very rare, was become more common in
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:1084500102:237"/>
his time; that it was found in Spain, in Gaul, and on the Alps; but that thoſe from Ionia were the moſt eſteemed. In another place, he tells us, that there were none in the iſland of Crete. Ariſtophanes ſpeaks of thoſe found in the vicinity of Megara in Achaia. Clement of Alexandria ſays, that thoſe from Egypt were reckoned the moſt delicious by the epicures. Some there were alſo in Phrygia, according to Aulus Gellius, who deſcribes it as an Aſiatic bird. Apicius di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects us how to cook the Red Grous, which he joins with the partridge; and St. Jerome men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions it in his letters as a moſt exquiſite diſh<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <q rend="inline">You ſmell of Grous <hi>(Attagen),</hi> and yet boaſt of eating Gooſe,</q> ſaid St. Jerome to an hypocrite, who pretended to live on ſimple diet, but in private regaled himſelf with delicacies.</note>.</p>
               <p>However, to judge whether the <hi>attagen</hi> of the ancients is our Red Grous, we muſt collect its hiſtory from the writings of the moderns, and form the compariſon.</p>
               <p>It appears that the word <hi>attagen,</hi> though with various corruptions, has generally been uſed by the modern authors who have written in Latin, as the name of this bird<note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Attago, Actago, Atago, Atchemigi, Atacuigi, Tagenarios, Tagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nari,</hi> are all words corrupted from <hi>Attagen.</hi> Geſner.</note>. It is true indeed, that ſome ornithologiſts, as Sibbald, Ray, Willughby, and Klein, have referred it to the <hi>lagopus altera</hi> of Pliny<note n="‡" place="bottom">
                     <bibl>Hiſt. Nat. lib. x. 48.</bibl>
                  </note>; but, beſides that Pliny only mentions it by the way, and ſo curſorily as to give no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:1084500102:238"/>
idea, is it likely that this great naturaliſt, who had treated at great length on the <hi>attagen</hi> in the ſame chapter, would ſay a few words of it afterwards under another name, and without giving notice? This reflection is alone ſufficient, in my opinion, to prove that the <hi>attagen</hi> of Pliny and his <hi>lagopus altera</hi> were different birds; and we ſhall afterwards know what they really were.</p>
               <p>Geſner was told, that this bird is commonly called <hi>franguello</hi> at Bologna; but Aldrovan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus, who was a native of that place, tells us, that the name <hi>franguello </hi>(<hi>hinguello,</hi> according to Olina), was given commonly to the chaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finch, and which is evidently derived from the Latin <hi>fringilla.</hi> Olina ſubjoins, that in Italy, his <hi>francolin,</hi> which we have ſaid is a bird different from ours, was generally named <hi>franguellina</hi>; a word corrupted from <hi>frangolino,</hi> and to which a feminine termination was added, to diſtinguiſh it from <hi>fringuello.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I know not why Albin, who has copied the deſcription that Willughby gives of the <hi>lagopus altera</hi> of Pliny, has changed the name into <hi>Cock of the Marſh</hi>; unleſs becauſe Tournefort ſays, that the Samian <hi>francolin</hi> haunts marſhes. But if we compare the deſcriptions with the figures, we ſhall readily perceive that the Samian <hi>fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colin</hi> is entirely different from the bird which Albin, or his tranſlator, has been pleaſed to term
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:1084500102:239"/>
                  <hi>Cock of the Marſh,</hi> ſince he had before applied the name of <hi>francolin</hi> to this Forked-tail Black Grous. The Red Grous is called <hi>duraz</hi> or <hi>alduragi</hi> by the Arabians, and the Engliſh name is derived from the red colour of its orbits and plumage; ſome Britiſh naturaliſts have alſo termed it <hi>perdrix aſclepica</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Johnſton, Charleton, &amp;c.</note>.</p>
               <p>This bird is larger than the <hi>bartavelle,</hi> and weighs about nineteen ounces; its eyes are arched with two very broad red orbits, formed by a fleſhy membrane, rounded and pared above, and riſing higher than the crown of the head; the noſtrils are ſhaded with ſmall feathers, which produce a fine effect; the plumage is mixed with red, black, and white. But the female has leſs of the red, and more of the white, than the male; the membrane of the orbits not ſo prominent, much leſs pared, and of a fainter red; in general, the colours of its plumage are more dilute<note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <bibl>Britiſh Zoology.</bibl>
                  </note>; beſides, it has not thoſe black feathers dotted with white, which in the male form the tuft on the head, and a kind of beard under the bill<note n="‡" place="bottom">Aldrovandus.</note>.</p>
               <p>In both ſexes, the tail is nearly like that of the partridge, but rather longer; it conſiſts of ſixteen quills, the two middle ones variegated
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:1084500102:240"/>
with the ſame colours with thoſe on the back, while the lateral are all black; the wings are very ſhort, each containing twenty-four quills, of which the third reckoning from the tip of the wing is the longeſt; the legs are clothed with plumage to the toes, according to Briſſon, and as far as the nails, according to Willughby; theſe nails are blackiſh, and alſo the bill; the toes of a deep-gray, edged with a narrow in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dented membranous belt. Belon tells us, that in his time <hi>francolins</hi> (that is Red Grous) were brought from Venice, ſome of which had the plumage we have deſcribed, and others were entirely white, and were called in Italy by the ſame name. Except in the colour, the latter were exactly like the former; and on the other hand, they reſembled ſo much the white par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridge of Savoy, that Belon conceives them to belong to another ſpecies, which Pliny has term<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>lagopus altera.</hi> According to this idea, which appears to me to be well founded, the <hi>at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagen</hi> of the Roman naturaliſt would be our <hi>variegated Red Grous</hi>; and the ſecond ſpecies of the <hi>lagopus</hi> would correſpond to the <hi>White At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagas,</hi> which is diſtinguiſhed from the former by its white plumage, and from the firſt kind of <hi>lagopus,</hi> commonly termed the <hi>White Partridge,</hi> by its ſize, and its legs, which are not feathered below.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="227" facs="tcp:1084500102:241"/>
All theſe birds, according to Belon, live on ſeeds and inſects: the authors of the Britiſh Zoology add, heath tops and mountain berries.</p>
               <p>The Red Grous is indeed an inhabitant of the elevated tracts. Willughby informs us, that it ſeldom ventures into the low country, nor even deſcends to the ſloping ſides of the mountain, but prefers to reſide on the loftieſt ſummits. It is found in the Pyrenees, the Alps, the mountains of Auvergne, of Dauphiné, of Switzerland, in Foix, Spain, England, Sicily, the canton of Vicenza, and in Lapland<note n="*" place="bottom">Klein.</note>. Laſtly, it inhabits Olympus in Phrygia, where the modern Greeks call it <hi>taginari</hi>

                  </gap>, which occurs in Suidas, and is formed from <hi>attagen</hi> or <hi>attagas,</hi> which muſt be conſidered as the primitive.</p>
               <p>Although this bird is naturally very ſhy, the ſecret of breeding them in cages has been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered in the iſland of Cyprus, as formerly at Rome; at leaſt, if the bird ſpoken of by Alexander Benedictus is the Red Grous. What induces me to ſuſpect this is, that the francolin figured in the CCXLVIth plate of Edwards, which was certainly brought from Cyprus, is much more like the common ſort, than that of Olina, and we know that the laſt can be kept in cages<note n="‡" place="bottom">Olinà.</note>.</p>

The domeſtic Red Grous is larger than the wild, but this has a ſuperior delicacy of flavour, and is preferred to the Partridge. At Rome, the <hi>francolino</hi> is called the Cardinal's diſh<note n="*" place="bottom">Geſner.</note>; however, it ſoon grows tainted, and cannot be ſent to a great diſtance. The ſportſmen take out its entrails the inſtant it is killed, and ſtuff it with freſh heath<note n="†" place="bottom">Willughby.</note>.

                  </note>, and it muſt indeed be admitted, that theſe birds bear a great analogy to each other.</p>
               <p>The Red Grous breed in the ſpring; the female lays on the ground like all the large birds; the eggs are eight or ten, ſharp at the one end, eighteen or twenty lines in length, and dotted with red-brown, except in one or two places about the ſmall end. The incuba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion laſts twenty days; the young remain with the mother, and continue to follow her through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the ſummer.

If we compare the accounts of the moderns in regard to the Red Grous, with what the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients have ſaid on the ſame ſubject, we find the former more accurate and full; yet we have ſtill facts enow from which we may conclude the identity of that bird with the <hi>attagen</hi> of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity.</p>
               <p>To conclude, though I have been at pains to remove the confuſion in which this ſubject is involved, and to aſſign to each ſpecies the characters that have been indiſcriminately be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed, I cannot expect that I have been equally ſucceſsful in clearing every point. The uncertainty which clouds our views, is owing entirely to that latitude in the uſe of names in which naturaliſts have indulged themſelves, and which throws obſtacles almoſt inſurmountable on every attempt to connect our preſent informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the diſcoveries of paſt ages. <note n="A" place="bottom">Specific character of the Red Grous, <hi>Tetrao Scoticus,</hi> LATH.—<q rend="inline">It is ſtriated tranſverſely with rufous and blackiſh; its ſix exterior tail-quills on either ſide, blackiſh.</q> Mr. Pennant thinks that this bird is peculiar to Britain.

               <p>IT is found in the mountains of Switzerland, and in thoſe around Vicenza. I have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to add to what has been ſaid in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding article, except that Geſner's ſecond ſpecies of <hi>lagopus</hi> appears to be really one of theſe birds, though the white of its plumage is pure only on the belly and the wings, and is clouded with brown or black on the reſt of the body: for we have already ſeen that the colour of the male is not ſo deep as that of the female; and we know that in moſt young birds, and particularly of this kind, it never acquires its due intenſity till the ſecond year. Alſo Geſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner's deſcription ſuits this ſpecies exactly; the eyebrows red, naked, curved, and prominent; the feet feathered as far as the nails, but not below; the bill ſhort and black; the tail alſo ſhort; its reſiding in the Swiſs mountains, &amp;c. I ſhould imagine that this bird was really a White Attagas, a male, and young, weighing only fourteen ounces inſtead of nineteen, the uſual bulk.</p>
               <p>I would draw a ſimilar concluſion with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to Geſner's third ſpecies of <hi>lagopus,</hi> which ſeems to be the ſame with what the Jeſuit

Rzaczynſki takes notice of two kinds; the one ſmall, which I am at preſent conſidering; the other larger, and which is probably a ſpecies of the Hazel Grous. This author ſubjoins, that both birds are found entirely white in the Palatinate of Novogorod. I do not claſs them with the Ptarmigan, as Briſſon has done Geſner's ſecond and third ſpecies of <hi>lagopus</hi>; becauſe their feet are not feathered beneath, which is the moſt ancient and decided character.</p>

Attagas, according to Belon, are liable to the ſame va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riations of colour. It
is aſtoniſhing that Friſch was not informed, that his <hi>White Mountain
Francolin,</hi> which is the Ptarmigan, is ſubject to this influence of cold;
for if he was acquainted with this fact, it is equally ſtrange that he has
omitted to mention it. He only ſays, that he was told that no White
Francolins could be met with in ſummer; and therefore he tells us, that they
were ſometimes found (in ſummer no doubt) with their wings and back brown,
but which he had never ſeen. This was the place, therefore, where he ought to
have added, that they are white only in winter, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Ariſtotle, as I have already ſaid, was unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Ptarmigan; what demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates the aſſertion, is a paſſage in his Natural Hiſtory, where he ſays, that the hare is the only animal whoſe feet are covered with fur on the ſole; but, if he had known the fact, he would certainly not have omitted, in a place where he draws general compariſons, to mention a bird that is diſtinguiſhed by the ſame property.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="234" facs="tcp:1084500102:249"/>
The name <hi>Lagopus</hi> is that which Pliny and other writers of antiquity have beſtowed on this ſpecies of birds. The moderns have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore committed an impropriety, when they have applied a word which marks the diſtinguiſhing character of the Ptarmigan to the nocturnal birds, whoſe feet are feathered above and not below<note n="*" place="bottom">Belon, Willughby, and Klein.</note>. Pliny adds, that it is as large as a pigeon, that it is white, that it is excellent, and that it reſides on the ſummits of the Alps; laſtly, that it is ſo wild that it can hardly be reduced to the domeſtic ſtate; and he concludes with telling us, that its fleſh ſoon runs into putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</p>
               <p>The laborious accuracy of the moderns has completed this ſketch of antiquity. They have noticed that glandulous ſkin which forms a ſort of red eye-brows, but of a brighter colour in the male than in the female; it is alſo ſmaller in the latter, and the two black ſtreaks are want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the head, which in the male ſtretch from the bottom of the bill to the eyes, and even extend near the ears. Except in this cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, the male and female are perfectly alike in their external form; and all that I ſhall afterwards mention on this ſubject will apply to both equally.</p>
               <p>The ſnowy colour of the Ptarmigan is not ſpread over its whole body, but is ſtained even
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:1084500102:250"/>
in winter. This exception obtains eſpecially in the quills of the tail, which are black, with a little white at the point; nor does it appear from the deſcription, that this colour tinges con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually the ſame quills. Linnaeus, in his <hi>Fauna Suecica,</hi> deſcribes the middle ones as black; and in his <hi>Syſtema Naturae,</hi> he ſays, with Briſſon and Willughby, that theſe are white, and the lateral quills black. Theſe naturaliſts ſeem not to have examined their ſpecimens with ſufficient accuracy. In the individual which I have cauſed to be figured, and in others which I have viewed, I found the tail compoſed of two rows of feathers, one over the other, the upper one entirely white, and the under one black, and each conſiſting of fourteen feathers<note n="*" place="bottom">Theſe cannot be counted exactly without plucking, as we have done, above and below the rump; it was in this way that we aſcertained that there were fourteen white above, and as many black below.</note>. Klein takes notice of a bird, which he received from Pruſſia on the 20th of January 1747, and which was perfectly white, except the bill, the lower part of the tail, and the ſhafts of ſix quills of the wings. The Lapland prieſt, Samuel Rheen, whom he quotes, ſays, that the Snow Fowl, or Ptarmigan, has not a ſingle black feather, except the female, which has one of that colour in each wing. And the white partridge, of which Geſner ſpeaks, was indeed entirely white, except round the ears, where
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:1084500102:251"/>
there were ſome black marks; the coverts of the tail, which are white, and extending its whole length, conceal the black feathers, are what have occaſioned moſt of theſe miſtakes. Briſſon reckons eighteen quills in the tail, while Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lughby, and ſome other ornithologiſts, reckon only ſixteen; and there are really only four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen. It would ſeem, that the plumage of this bird, how variable ſoever, is more uniform than the naturaliſts repreſent it<note n="*" place="bottom">It is not ſurpriſing, that authors differ about the white or black colour of the lateral tail-feathers of this bird; for in ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out the tail with the hand, it is eaſy to terminate the ſides either by the black or the white feathers. Daubenton the younger has well remarked, that there is another method of ſettling the contradiction of authors, and of ſhewing clearly that the tail conſiſts only of fourteen quills all black, except the outer one, which is edged with white near its origin, and the tip, which is white in them all; becauſe the ſhafts of theſe fourteen black quills are twice as thick as the ſhafts of the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen white quills, and do not project ſo far, not over-lapping entirely the ſhafts of the black quills; ſo that we may regard theſe white feathers as only coverts, though the four middle ones are as large as the black ones, which are all very nearly equal in length.</note>. There are twenty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>four quills in the wings, the third one, reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the outer ſide, is the longeſt, and the firſt ſix have black ſhafts, though the webs are white: the down which ſhade the feet and toes as far as the nails, is very thick and ſoft; and it has been ſaid, that this is a kind of fur-gloves which nature has given to theſe birds, to defend them from the intenſe cold of their native cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates. The nails are very long, even that of
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:1084500102:252"/>
the little hind toe; that of the mid-toe is ſcooped lengthwiſe, and its edges are ſharp, which enables it to form holes in the ſnow with eaſe.</p>
               <p>The Ptarmigan is at leaſt as large as a tame pigeon, according to Willughby; its length is fourteen or fifteen inches, the extent of its wings twenty-two inches, and its weight four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen ounces: ours is rather ſmaller. But Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus remarks, that they are of different ſizes, and that the ſmalleſt inhabits the Alps<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <bibl>Fauna Suecica.</bibl>
                  </note>. He ſubjoins, indeed, that the ſame bird is found in the foreſts of the northern countries, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in Lapland; which gives room to ſuſpect, that this ſpecies is different from our Alpine Ptarmigan, which has different habits, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers the lofty mountains: unleſs perhaps we ſay, that the cold which prevails on the ſummits of the Alps is nearly the ſame with what is experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced in the vallies and foreſts of Lapland. But the diſagreement of writers with reſpect to the cry of the Ptarmigan ſeems to prove decidedly, that there is a confuſion of ſpecies. Belon ſays, that it has the note of the partridge: Geſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that the voice ſomewhat reſembles that of a ſtag; Linnaeus compares it to a prattling and jeering. Laſtly, Willughby ſpeaks of the feathers on its feet as a ſoft down <hi>(plumulis mollibus)</hi>; and Friſch compares them to hogs
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:1084500102:253"/>
briſtles. But how can we reconcile ſuch op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite qualities, how refer ſuch different cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters to the ſame ſpecies? There is reaſon then for the diviſion which I have drawn be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Ptarmigans of the Alps, the Pyren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nees, and ſuch other mountains, and the birds of the ſame genus that occur in the foreſts, and even in the plains of the northern regions.</p>
               <p>We have already ſeen, that in winter the Ptarmigan is robed in white; in ſummer, it is covered with brown ſpots, which are ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered irregularly on a white ground. It may be ſaid, however, never to enjoy the ſolſtitial warmth, and to be determined by its ſingular ſtructure to prefer the chilling froſt; for as the ſnow melts on the ſides of the mountains, the bird conſtantly aſcends, till it gains the ſummits, where reigns eternal winter. It would ſeem to be oppreſſed by the dazzle of the ſolar rays; it withdraws from the luſtre of day, and forms holes and burrows under the ſnow. It were curious to inveſtigate the internal and intimate ſtructure of the Ptarmigan, and diſcover the reaſon why cold ſeems ſo neceſſary to its exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and why it ſo carefully ſhuns the preſence of the ſun; while almoſt every animated being longs for his return, and hails his approach, as the father of Nature, the ſource of delight, whoſe benign influence inſpires and enlivens all. Muſt we aſcribe it to the ſame cauſes
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:1084500102:254"/>
which make the nocturnal birds retire from his eſlugence? or is the Ptarmigan the <hi>kakkerlac</hi> of the winged tribe?</p>
               <p>Such a diſpoſition, however, will evidently render this bird difficult to tame, and Pliny ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly mentions the fact<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <bibl>Coll. Acad. Part Etrang. i. 520.</bibl>
                  </note>. Yet Redi ſpeaks of two Ptarmigans, which he calls <hi>White Partridges of the Pyrenees,</hi> that were bred in the volery of the garden at Boboli, belonging to the Grand Duke.</p>
               <p>The Ptarmigans fly in flocks, but never ſoar aloft; for they are heavy birds. When they perceive any perſon, they remain ſtill on the ſnow to avoid being ſeen; but they are often betrayed by their whiteneſs, which ſurpaſſes the ſnow itſelf. However, whether through ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity or inexperience, they are ſoon recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to the ſight of man; they may often be caught by preſenting bread, or a hat may be thrown before them, and a nooſe ſlipped round the neck, while they are engaged in admiring this new object; or they may be diſpatched by the blow of a ſtick behind<note n="†" place="bottom">Geſner.</note>. It is even ſaid, that they will not venture to paſs a row of ſtones rudely piled like the foundation of a wall, but will conſtantly travel cloſe by the ſide of this humble barrier, quite to the ſpot where the ſnares are placed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="240" facs="tcp:1084500102:255"/>
They live upon the buds and tender ſhoots of the pine, the birch, the heath, whortle berry, and other Alpine plants<note n="*" place="bottom">Willughby &amp; Klein.</note>. It is to the nature of their food undoubtedly, that we muſt aſcribe the ſlight bitterneſs of their fleſh<note n="†" place="bottom">Geſner.</note>, which otherwiſe is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent for the table; it is dark-coloured, and is a very common ſort of game in Mount Cenis, and in all the towns and villages near the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of Savoy<note n="‡" place="bottom">Belon.</note>. I have eaten of it, and found it had much the flavour of hare.</p>
               <p>The females lay and hatch their eggs on the ground, or rather on the rocks<note n="§" place="bottom">Geſner &amp; Rzaczynſki.</note>;—this is all that we know with regard to their propagation.

               <p>The Ptarmigan has a very thick craw, and a muſcular gizzard, in which ſmall ſtones are found mixed with its aliments. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtines are thirty-ſix or thirty-ſeven inches long; the <hi>coeca</hi> are thick, fluted, and very long, but not uniform, and are, according to Redi, full of minute worms<note n="‖" place="bottom">

The ſame perhaps may be ſaid of the words <hi>rhoncas</hi> and <hi>herbey,</hi> which, according to the ſame author, the Griſons, who ſpeak Italian, beſtow on the Ptarmigan.

The ſame authors admit, that in winter both birds are alike, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt entirely white. Edwards ſays, that the lateral quills of the tail are black even in winter, and only tipt with white; and yet he afterwards ſubjoins, that one of theſe which had been killed in that ſeaſon, and brought from Hudſon's-bay by Light, was of a ſnowy white, which ſtill more ſhews that in this ſpecies the colours of the plumage are variable.</p>
               <p>The White Grous is of a middle ſize, between the partridge and the pheaſant, and its ſhape would reſemble that of the former, if its tail
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:1084500102:258"/>
were ſomewhat ſhorter. The one repreſented in Edwards, Pl. LXXII. is a cock, ſuch as it is in ſpring, when it begins to drop its winter's robe, and feel the influence of the ſeaſon of love; its eyebrows are red and more prominent, and in ſhort, like thoſe of the Red Grous; it has alſo ſmall white feathers round the eyes, and others at the bottom of the bill, which cover the noſtrils; the two middle feathers are variegated like thoſe of the neck, the two ſucceeding are white, and all the reſt blackiſh, tipt with white, both in ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer and winter.</p>
               <p>The livery of ſummer extends only over the upper part of the body; the belly continues al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways white, the feet and toes are entirely cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with feathers, or rather with white hairs; the nails are leſs curved than uſual in birds<note n="*" place="bottom">We have ſeen two birds brought from Siberia under the name of <hi>Ptarmigans,</hi> which were probably the ſame ſpecies with that of Hudſon's Bay, and whoſe nails were ſo flat, that they reſemble more the nails of Apes than the claws of birds.</note>.</p>
               <p>The White Grous reſides the whole year in Hudſon's-bay; it paſſes the night in holes that it makes in the ſnow, which, in theſe arctic countries, reſembles fine ſand. In the morning it emerges from its retreat, and flies directly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, ſhaking the ſnow from off its wings. It feeds in the morning and evening, and does not ſeem to dread the ſun, like the Ptarmigan of the Alps; ſince it ſpends whole days expoſed to his rays, even in the middle of the day, when they
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:1084500102:259"/>
are moſt forcible. Edwards received this ſame bird from Norway, which appears to me to form the ſhade between the Ptarmigan and the Red Grous; having the feet of the one, and the large eyebrows of the other. <note n="A" place="bottom">Specific character of the White Grous, <hi>Tetrao-Albus:</hi>—<q rend="inline">It is orange, variegated with black ſtripes and white daſhes; its toes ſhaggy; its tail-quills black, and white at the tip; the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termediate ones entirely white.</q> The White Grous are amazingly numerous about Hudſon's Bay; where they breed all along the coaſt, and lay about ten eggs, ſprinkled with black. In the beginning of October, they aſſemble in ſome hundreds, and live among the willows, whoſe tops they crop: Hence they are ſtyled <hi>Willow Partridges.</hi> In December they retire to the mountains to feed on cranberries: for, in that frightful climate, the cold is ſo intenſe, that the ſnow appears like fine powder, which in the depth of winter, is in a great meaſure ſwept by the winds from the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands, and carried into the plains. Theſe birds are generally tame as chickens; if they chance to be unuſually ſhy, they may be ſoon hunted and worn out, till they ſink into their natural ſecurity. They are eſteemed excellent meat, and much ſought for by the ſervants of the Hudſon's Bay Company. They are commonly taken with nets of twine twenty feet ſquare ſet inclined, into which they are driven. Ten thouſand are often caught in the courſe of the winter.</note>

                  <p>IT would ſeem that the Hazel Grous of Canada, and the Hazel Grous of Hudſon's Bay, as deſcribed by Briſſon and deſigned by Edwards, are the ſame ſpecies.</p>
                  <p>It is frequent through the whole year in the country bordering on Hudſon's Bay, and prefers the plains and low grounds; whereas, in another climate, the ſame bird, ſays Ellis, is found in the higheſt tracts, and even on the ſummit of moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains. In Canada, it is called the Partridge.</p>
                  <p>The male is ſmaller than the common Hazel Grous; its eyebrows red; its noſtrils covered with ſmall black feathers; the wings ſhort; the feet clothed below the tarſus; the toes and nails gray; the bill black. In general its colour is very duſky, and is brightened only by a few white
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:1084500102:261"/>
ſpots round the eyes, on the flanks, and on ſome other parts.</p>
                  <p>The female is ſmaller than the male, and the colours of its plumage lighter and more varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated; in other reſpects it is preciſely alike.</p>
                  <p>Theſe birds feed on pine cones, juniper-berries, &amp;c. They are numerous in the northern coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries of America, and are ſtored up for winter's proviſions; the froſt preſerves them from prutre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, and they are thawed in cold water, when they are to be uſed. <note n="A" place="bottom">Specific character of the <hi>Tetrao Canadenſis:</hi>—<q rend="inline">Its tail-quills are black, fulvous at the tip; two white daſhes at the eyes.</q> By the Engliſh ſettlers at Hudſon's Bay it is called the <hi>Wood Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridge,</hi> becauſe it uſually lives among the pines.

In ſummer, it lives on ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; in winter, it crops the ſhoots of the ſpruce fir, which gives its fleſh a diſagreeable taſte. It is ſaid to lay only five eggs.</note>

                  <p>Though Briſſon conceives this bird alſo as a diſtinct ſpecies from the ruffed Hazel Grous of Pennſylvania, it is highly probable that they are
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:1084500102:262"/>
really the ſame: and to this ſpecies muſt we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer too the ruffed Heath-cock of Edwards. If we conſider that Edwards's figure was taken from a living bird in love-ſeaſon, and that Briſſon's was copied from a dead ſubject; if we make allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance for the liberties which are ſuggeſted by the fancy of the deſigner, we may diſregard the minute diſparities.</p>
                  <p>It is rather larger than the ordinary Hazel Grous, and like it, the wings are ſhort, and the feathers that cover the feet reach not to the toes; but it has neither the red eyebrows, nor the ring of that colour which encircles the eyes. What diſtinguiſh it, are the two tufts of feathers which riſe from the upper part of the breaſt, one on each ſide, and project beyond the reſt, and bend downwards; the feathers which form theſe are of a fine black, the edges beaming with different reflections of gold green. The bird can expand at pleaſure theſe falſe wings, which when cloſed fall on both ſides on the upper part of the true; the bill, toes, and nails, are of a reddiſh brown.</p>
                  <p>This bird is, according to Edwards, very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in Maryland and Pennſylvania, where it is called the <hi>pheaſant.</hi> But its inſtincts and habits are much nearer thoſe of the Grous. It is of a middle ſize between that of the pheaſant and the partridge; its feet are feathered, and its toes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dented on the edges like thoſe of the Grous; its bill is ſimilar to that of a common cock; its
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:1084500102:263"/>
noſtrils are ſhaded with ſmall feathers, which riſe from the bottom of the bill, and point for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; the whole upper part of the body, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding the head, the tail, and the wings, are mailed with different brown colours, more or leſs brightened with the mixture of orange and black; the throat is of a brilliant orange, though rather deep; the ſtomach, the belly and the thighs, are marked with black ſpots, in the ſhape of a creſcent, and ſtrewed with regularity on a white ground; it is furniſhed with long feathers round the head and neck, which it can erect at will, and form a creſt or ruff, and this it gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally does in the ſeaſon of its amours; it alſo ſpreads the tail-quills like a fan, inflates its craw, trails its wings, and ruſtles with a whirring noiſe like a turkey-cock; it ſummons its females alſo by a very odd ſort of clapping the wings, which is ſo loud as to be heard at half-a-mile's diſtance in calm weather<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. Bartram ſays, that the people of Pennſylvania call this the <hi>thumping</hi> of the ruffed Grous.</note>. It takes this kind of exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe in ſpring and autumn, which are the ſeaſons of breeding, and repeats it every day at ſtated hours, viz. at nine o'clock in the morning, and four o'clock in the afternoon, and this always ſitting on a dead trunk. At firſt, it ſtrikes ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, allowing an interval of two ſeconds between each beat; but it gradually quickens the ſtrokes, which at laſt become ſo rapid as to appear a
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:1084500102:264"/>
continued ſound, reſembling the noiſe of a drum, or, according to ſome, the muttering of diſtant thunder. This noiſe laſts about a minute, and, after a repoſe of ſeven or eight minutes, it again renews and paſſes through the ſame gradations. Such is the call which invites the female to the feaſt of love; but what an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces a future generation, is often the ſignal for the deſtruction of the preſent. The ſportſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, led by the noiſe, approaches the bird unper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and when the male is diſſolved in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions of pleaſure, he takes the fatal aim. If the bird however obſerve the perſon, it ſtops its motions, and flies off three or four hundred paces.—Theſe are really the inſtincts and habits of the European Grous, though the ſingularities are rather heightened.</p>
                  <p>The common food of thoſe in Pennſylvania is grain, fruits, wild grapes, and above all ivy berries, which is the more extraordinary, as theſe prove fatal to other animals.</p>
                  <p>They hatch only twice a year, probably in ſpring and autumn, which are the two ſeaſons when the male beats his wings. They make their neſts on the ground with leaves, or by the ſide of a fallen trunk, or at the foot of a tree; all which habits indicate a heavy bird. They lay from twelve to ſixteen eggs, and ſit about three weeks. The mother has the ſafety of her young much at heart; ſhe riſks every thing in their defence, and expoſes herſelf to all the
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:1084500102:265"/>
dangers that menace their deſtruction. The tender brood are themſelves dexterous in ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for a concealment beneath the leaves. But all theſe precautions are inſufficient to elude the dreaded aſſaults of the birds of prey. The little family continues united, till the glow of the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing ſpring inſpires new appetites, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſes its members.</p>
                  <p>Theſe birds are exceedingly wild, and can never be tamed. If they are hatched under common hens, they fly almoſt as ſoon as they burſt from the ſhell, and hide themſelves in the foreſts. The fleſh is white, and an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent meat; and may not this be the reaſon why the rapacious birds chaſe them with ſuch perſeverance? We have already mentioned the conjecture in treating of the European Grous; if it were confirmed by a ſufficient num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of obſervations, we might infer that vora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city does not always exclude predilection, but that the birds of prey have nearly the ſame taſte as man: and this would afford another analogy between thoſe two ſpecies. <note n="A" place="bottom">Specific character of the Ruffed Grous, <hi>Tetrao-Umbellus:</hi>

                  <p>The American bird, which may be called the Long-tailed Hazel Grous, deſigned and deſcribed by Edwards under the name of the <hi>Hudſon's-Bay Heath-Cock,</hi> or <hi>Grous,</hi> but which appears to me to be more related to the Hazel Grous. The individual repreſented in Edwards, Plate CXVII, is a female, with the ſize, colour, and long tail of the pheaſant; the plumage of the male is of a deeper ſhining brown, with various reflections near the neck: and he ſtands very erect, with a bold aſpect; differences which are invariable between the male and female in all birds of this kind. Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards did not venture to give red eye-brows to this female, becauſe he only ſaw a ſtuffed ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimen, in which that character was not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently diſtinct; the legs were rough, the toes indented on the edges, and the hind toe very ſhort.</p>
                  <p>At Hudſon's Bay, this bird is called a <hi>phea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant.</hi> The long tail, indeed, forms a ſort of ſhade between the hazel grous and the phea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants. The two middle quills of the tail project
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:1084500102:267"/>
two inches farther than the two following on either ſide, and thus gradually ſhorten. Theſe birds are alſo found in Virginia, in the woods and the unfrequented parts. <note n="A" place="bottom">Specific character of the Long-tailed Grous, <hi>Tetrao Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſianellus:</hi>—<q rend="inline">Its tail is wedge-ſhaped; its head, its neck, and the upper ſide of its body, are brick-coloured, ſtriped with black.</q> In Hudſon's Bay, it lives among the larch buſhes: feeds on berries in ſummer, and on the buds of larch and birch in winter. It lays from nine to thirteen eggs. The cock has a very ſhrill ſort of a crow, not very loud. When diſturbed, or on wing, he repeats the ſound <hi>cuck, cuck,</hi> and cracks the feathers of his tail. The fleſh of theſe birds is gray, fat, and juicy.</note>

               <p>IF empire belonged to beauty and not to ſtrength, the Peacock would undoubtedly be king of the birds; for upon none of them has Nature poured her treaſures with ſuch profuſion. Dignity of appearance, nobleneſs of demeanour, elegance of form, ſweetneſs and delicacy of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions, whatever marks diſtinction and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands reſpect, have been beſtowed. A light waving tuft, painted with the richeſt colours, adorns its head, and raiſes without oppreſſing it. Its matchleſs plumage ſeems to combine all that delights the eye in the ſoft delicate tints of the fineſt flowers; all that dazzles it in the ſparkling luſtre of the gems; and all that aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes it in the grand diſplay of the rainbow. But not only has Nature united, in the plumage
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:1084500102:270"/>
of the Peacock, to form a maſter-piece of mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence, all the colours of heaven and earth; ſhe has ſelected, mingled, ſhaded, melted them with her inimitable pencil, and formed an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rivalled picture, where they derive from their mixture and their contraſt new brilliancy, and effects of light ſo ſublime, that our art can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther imitate nor deſcribe them.</p>
               <p>Such appears the plumage of the Peacock, when at eaſe he ſaunters alone in a fine vernal day. But if a female is preſented ſuddenly to his view; if the fires of love, joined to the ſecret influence of the ſeaſon, rouſe him from his tranquillity, and inſpire him with new ardour and new deſires; his beauties open and expand, his eyes become animated and expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, his tuft flutters on his head, and expreſſes the warmth that ſtirs within; the long feathers of the tail, riſing, diſplay their dazzling rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; the head and neck bending nobly back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, trace their ſhadow gracefully on that ſhining ground, where the ſun-beams play in a thouſand ways, continually extinguiſhed and renewed, and ſeem to lend new luſtre, more delicious and more enchanting; new colours, more variegated and more harmonious; each movement of the bird produces new ſhades, numberleſs cluſters of waving, fugitive reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which ever vary and ever pleaſe.</p>
               <p>It is then that the Peacock ſeems to ſpread out all his beauties, only to delight his female, who,
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:1084500102:271"/>
though denied the rich attire, is captivated with its diſplay; the livelineſs which the ardor of love mingles with his geſtures, adds new grace to his movements, which are naturally noble and dignified, and which, at this time, are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with a ſtrong hollow murmur ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive of deſire<note n="*" place="bottom">

their native abode. That beautiful bird muſt owe its birth to the luxurious
climate where Nature laviſhly pours her riches; where gold, and pearls, and

countenanced by Holy Writ; Peacocks are enumerated among the valuable and rare
commodities that were every three years im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by Solomon's fleet; which
being fitted out in the Red Sea, and not being able to venture at a diſtance
from the ſhore, muſt obviouſly have drawn its riches either from India,
or the eaſtern coaſt of Africa. Nor is it probable that the latter was the
place that furniſhed theſe luxuries; for no traveller has ever ſeen wild
Peacocks in Africa, or the adjacent iſlands; except at St. Helena, where
Admiral Verhowen ſhot ſome that could not be caught. But it is not probable
that Solomon's fleet could ſail every three years to Madeira, without a

               <p>We may therefore preſume, that Solomon's fleet did not import theſe rarities from the Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can coaſt, but from the ſhores of Aſia, where they abound, living in a ſtate of nature, and multiplying without the aſſiſtance of man; and where they are larger and more prolific than in other countries, as is the caſe with all animals in their congenial climate.</p>
               <p>From India they migrated into the weſtern part of Aſia. Accordingly we learn from Diodorus Siculus, that they abounded in Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon.

               <p>From Aſia they were tranſported into Greece, where at firſt they were ſo rare as to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited in Athens for thirty years, at the monthly feſtivals, as an object of curioſity, which drew crouds of ſpectators from the neighbouring towns<note n="§" place="bottom">

was after the return of Alexander from India, and we know that he firſt
ſtopped at the iſland of Samos. The conqueror was ſo delighted with the
rich plumage of the Peacocks, that he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted ſevere penalties againſt
killing them. But it is very probable that ſoon after his time, and even
before the cloſe of his reign, they were become common; for we learn from the

His paſſions muſt even be more fiery, if it be true, that when he has only one or two hens, he teazes and fatigues them, and even induces ſterility and diſturbs the work of genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by his immoderate uſe of venery.

But perhaps this coolneſs of paſſion is owing to the nature of the climate.</note>; whereas, when the ordinary cock,
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:1084500102:280"/>
who can ſatisfy the wants of fifteen or twenty hens, is reduced to one, he makes her the mother of a numerous brood.</p>
               <p>The pea-hens are alſo of an amorous mould, and when deprived of the males, they toy with each other, and welter in the duſt; but the eggs which they lay are then void of the principle of life. This happens commonly in the ſpring, when the return of ſoft and genial warmth awakens nature from her torpor, and gives a new ſtimulus to the appetite, which prompts every animated being to reproduce its ſpecies. Hence perhaps the reaſon why ſuch eggs were termed zephyrian <hi>(ova zephyria),</hi> not becauſe the gentle zephyrs were imagined capable of impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating them, but becauſe the vernal ſeaſon is fanned by light airs, and even depicted by the zephyrs<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Wind-eggs</hi> is their common name in Engliſh; becauſe they want the outer ſhell, and are flaccid, as if inflated with air. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps this was alſo the reaſon of the ancient epithet Zephyrian.</note>.</p>
               <p>I could eaſily believe that the ſight of the male ſtrutting round them, diſplaying his tail, and ſhewing every expreſſion of deſire, would ſtill more excite them, and make them lay more of theſe addle eggs; but I will never be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded that the careſſes, diſtant geſtures, and light flutterings, would effect a real fecundation, without the more intimate union, and the more vigorous compreſſions of the male.

But this muſt be underſtood of thoſe pea-hens that both lay their eggs and rear their young; for if the eggs be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved as faſt as they are laid, and are placed under a common hen<note n="†" place="bottom">Ariſtotle ſays, that an ordinary hen cannot hatch more than two pea-hens' eggs; but Columella allows five of theſe eggs in addition to four common eggs. He adviſes to remove the eggs the tenth day, and ſubſtitute an equal number of the ſame kind recently laid, in order that they may be hatched along with the pea-hen's eggs, which require ten days longer incubation. Laſtly, he directs that theſe be turned every day, if the ſitter be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to do it on account of their bulk, which it is eaſy to diſcover by marking the eggs on one ſide.</note>, they will, according to Columella, have three hatches in the courſe of the year; the firſt of five eggs, the ſecond of four, and the third of two or three. It would ſeem that in this country they are not ſo prolific, ſince they lay ſcarcely four or five eggs in the year. On the other hand, they appear to be far more prolific in India, where, according to Peter Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr, they lay twenty or thirty, as I have already noticed. The temperature of a climate has a mighty influence on whatever relates to genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:1084500102:283"/>
and this is the key to thoſe apparent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions which are found between the writings of the ancients and our own obſervations. In a warm country, the males are more ardent, fight with each other, require more females, and theſe lay a greater number of eggs; but in a cold country the latter are not ſo prolific, and the former are calm and indifferent.</p>
               <p>If the pea-hen be ſuffered to follow the bent of inſtinct, ſhe will lay her eggs in a ſecret re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired ſpot; the eggs are white, and ſpeckled like thoſe of the turkey-hen, and nearly of the ſame ſize. It is aſſerted that ſhe is very apt to lay in the night, or rather careleſsly drop the eggs from the rooſt on which ſhe is perched; and for this reaſon, it is adviſed to ſpread ſtraw under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath, to prevent their being broken by the fall<note n="*" place="bottom">

               <p>During the whole time of incubation, the pea-hen anxiouſly ſhuns the male, and is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly careful to conceal her track, when ſhe returns from the neſt: for in this ſpecies, as in the gallinaceous tribe and many others<note n="†" place="bottom">

Some have imagined that it was from the deſire of covering them himſelf<note n="*" place="bottom">Aldrovandus.</note>, which would be a very different motive. Natural hiſtory will continually be clouded with uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainties; to remove them, we ought to obſerve every thing ourſelves; but who is able for the taſk?</p>
               <p>The pea-hen ſits from twenty-ſeven to thirty days, more or leſs, according to the temperature of the climate, and the warmth of the ſeaſon<note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <bibl>Ariſtotle, lib. vi. 9.</bibl> and <bibl>Pliny, lib. x. 59.</bibl>
                  </note>. During that time, a ſufficient ſupply of food ought to be ſet within their reach, that they may not be obliged to ſtray in ſearch of ſubſiſtence, and allow their eggs to cool; and care muſt be taken not to teaze or diſturb them in their neſt; for if they perceive that they are diſcovered, they will be filled with diſquietude, abandon their eggs, and begin to make a ſecond hatch, which is not likely to ſucceed, becauſe of the lateneſs of the ſeaſon.</p>
               <p>It is ſaid that the pea-hen never hatches all her eggs at once, but as ſoon as a few chickens emerge, ſhe leaves the neſt to lead them about. In this caſe, the eggs that are left ſhould be ſet under another hen, or placed in a ſtove for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubation<note n="‡" place="bottom">

               <p>Aelian tells us, that the pea-hen does not ſit conſtantly on her eggs, but ſometimes leaves
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:1084500102:285"/>
them two days together, which ſuſpends the progreſs of incubation. But I ſhould imagine that there is ſome miſtake in the text of Aelian, which refers to the hatching, what Ariſtotle and Pliny mention with regard to the laying, which is really liable to interruptions of two or three days; whereas ſuch interruptions in the ſitting ſeem to be inconſiſtent with the law of nature obſerved by all the known ſpecies of birds, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs when the heat of the climate approaching that of incubation diſpenſes with it as unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary<note n="*" place="bottom">As in the caſe of the Oſtrich.</note>.</p>
               <p>After the young are hatched, they ought to be left under the mother for twenty-four hours, and then removed to the coop<note n="†" place="bottom">

               <p>Their firſt food muſt be barley-meal, ſoaked in wine; wheat ſteeped in water; or even pap boiled, and allowed to cool. Afterwards they may have freſh curd, from which the whey is well preſſed, mixed with chopped leeks, and even graſshoppers, of which they are very fond, but the legs muſt be previouſly removed from theſe inſects<note n="‡" place="bottom">

It is obſerved that on the firſt days after hatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the mother never leads her young to the ordinary neſt, or even ſits with them twice in the ſame place; and as they are delicate, and cannot mount on the trees, they are expoſed to many accidents. At this time therefore we ought to watch them cloſely, and diſcover where the mother reſorts, and put the brood in a coop, or in the field in a patch incloſed with hurdles, &amp;c.<note n="*" place="bottom">

Such a ſpot indeed allowed them to follow freely the bent of nature, without danger of eſcaping, ſince they are unable to fly to a diſtance, and cannot ſwim; and at the ſame time they had nothing to apprehend from ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacious animals, which were entirely extirpated from the little iſland. They lived there at eaſe, without conſtaint, and without diſquietude; they thrived better, and (what was not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looked by the Romans) their fleſh acquired a finer reliſh; and to have them under their eye, and to examine whether their numbers increaſed or diminiſhed, they accuſtomed them every day at a ſtated hour, on the diſplay of a certain ſignal,
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:1084500102:288"/>
to come round the houſe, and they threw a few handfuls of grain to draw them together<note n="*" place="bottom">

               <p>When the brood are a month old, or a little more, the creſt begins to ſhoot, and then they are ſubject to ſickneſs, as the young turkies in ſimilar circumſtances.

               <p>The creſt conſiſts of ſmall feathers, of which the ſhaft is not furniſhed with webs, but beſet with little ſlender detached threads; the top is formed by a bunch of ordinary feathers united together, and painted with the richeſt colours.</p>
               <p>The number of theſe ſmall feathers is variable; I have counted twenty-five in a male, and thirty in a female; but I have not examined enough to decide accurately.</p>
               <p>The creſt is not an inverted cone, as might be ſuppoſed; its baſe, which is uppermoſt, forms a very extenſive ellipſe, whoſe greater axis is in the direction of the head; all the feathers that compoſe it, have a particular and perceptible
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:1084500102:289"/>
motion, by which they approach each other, or recede, at will, and alſo a general motion, by which the whole creſt is ſometimes erected, ſometimes reclined.</p>
               <p>The waving ſummits of this creſt, as well as all the reſt of the plumage, are decorated with much more ſplendid colours in the male than in the female. Beſides this circumſtance, the cock is diſcriminated from the hen when three months old, by a little yellow which appears on the tip of the wing; he is afterwards diſtinguiſhed by his ſize, by the ſpur on each leg, by the length of his tail, and the power of expanding it like a fan. Willughby fancies that the Peacock ſhares that remarkable property with the turkey alone; but in the courſe of this hiſtory we have ſeen that it belongs alſo to ſome grous, to ſome pigeons, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The tail-feathers, or rather thoſe long coverts that are inſerted in the back near the rump, are on a great ſcale what thoſe of the creſt are on a ſmall one. The ſhaft is equally furniſhed from its origin to its extremity, with parted filaments of a varying colour, and it ends in a flat vane, decorated with what is called the <hi>eye,</hi> or the <hi>mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror.</hi> This is a brilliant ſpot, enamelled with the moſt enchanting colours; yellow, gilded with many ſhades, green running into blue and bright violet, according to the different poſitions, and the whole receives additional luſtre from the colour of the centre, which is a fine velvet black.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="274" facs="tcp:1084500102:290"/>
The two feathers in the middle are each four feet and a half long, and extend beyond the reſt, the others gradually diminiſhing as they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach the ſides. The creſt is permanent, but the tail is caſt every year, either entirely or in part, about the end of July, and ſhoots again in the ſpring; during which interval the bird is diſpirited and ſeeks retirement.</p>
               <p>The predominant colour of the head, throat, neck, and breaſt is blue, with different reflections of violet, yellow, and lucid green; and by means of theſe waving ſhades, nature can ſpread a greater variety of colouring on the ſame ſpace.</p>
               <p>On each ſide of the head, there is a protube<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance formed by ſmall feathers, which cover the perforation of the external ear.</p>
               <p>Peacocks ſeem to toy with each other by the bill; but on examining them cloſely, I find that they ſcratch the head, which is ſubject to a very nimble ſort of lice. Theſe may be ſeen running over the white ſkin that encircles the eyes, which muſt occaſion an uneaſy feeling. Accordingly, the birds remain very tame and ſeem pleaſed when another ſcratches them.</p>
               <p>Theſe birds aſſume the rule in the yard, and will not ſuffer the other poultry to feed till they have ſatisfied their hunger. They eat nearly the ſame way with the gallinaceous tribe, laying hold of the grain by the point of the bill, and ſwallowing it whole.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="275" facs="tcp:1084500102:291"/>
When they drink, they plunge their bill into the water, and make five or ſix quick motions with the lower jaw; then raiſing their head and holding it horizontal, they ſwallow the water, with which their mouth is filled, and without moving the bill.</p>
               <p>Their food is received into the <hi>oeſophagus,</hi> where a little above the anterior orifice of the ſtomach, is placed a glandulous ſwelling filled with ſmall tubes, which pour out much limpid liquor.</p>
               <p>The ſtomach is clothed on the outſide with a great number of muſcular fibres.</p>
               <p>In one of theſe birds, which was diſſected by Gaſpar Bartholin, there were two biliary ducts; but he found only one pancreatic duct, though there are generally two in the feathered tribes.</p>
               <p>The <hi>coecum</hi> was double, and pointing from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind forwards; its length was equal to that of all the other inteſtines together, and was more capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious<note n="*" place="bottom">

               <p>The rump is very thick, becauſe in it are inſerted all the muſcles deſtined to elevate and expand the tail.</p>
               <p>The excrements are commonly figured, and mixed with a little of that white matter which is common to the gallinaceous tribes, and many other birds.</p>
               <p>I am informed that they ſleep, ſometimes hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their head under their wing, ſometimes co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering their neck, and leaving the bill expoſed.</p>

Peacocks love cleanlineſs, and for this reaſon they are at pains to hide their excrements; not becauſe they are loth that men ſhould derive any benefit from the dung<note n="*" place="bottom">

               <p>Though they cannot fly much, they are fond of climbing. They generally paſs the night on the roofs of houſes, where they do a great deal of miſchief, and on the loftieſt trees. From theſe elevated ſtations, they often ſcream; and their cry is univerſally allowed to be diſagreeable, perhaps becauſe it diſturbs our ſleep, and from which it is pretended that their name is formed in all languages<note n="†" place="bottom">

                     <bibl>Athenaeus, lib. xiii 30.</bibl>
                  </note>. But a more natural and better founded friendſhip is obſerved between the turkey and Peacock. Theſe two birds are of the number that raiſe and diſplay their tail; a circumſtance which implies many common pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties.
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:1084500102:294"/>
Accordingly, they agree better than with the other fowls. It is even ſaid that a Peacock has been ſeen to copulate with a turkey-hen<note n="*" place="bottom">Belon.</note>; which would ſhew a great analogy between the two ſpecies.</p>
               <p>The term of the life of the Peacock is twenty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>five years, according to the ancients<note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <bibl>Ariſtotle, Hiſt. Anim. vi. 9.</bibl>—<bibl>Pliny, x. 20.</bibl>
                  </note>; and this determination ſeems to be well-founded, ſince the bird is full grown before the end of three years, and the feathered race attain to a greater age than quadrupeds, becauſe their bones are more pliant. But I am ſurpriſed that Willugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by imagines, on the authority of Aelian, that the Peacock lived a complete century, eſpecially as the account of that relator is mingled with many circumſtances evidently fabulous<note n="‡" place="bottom">

                  </note>.</p>
               <p>I have already ſaid, that the Peacock feeds on all ſorts of grain, like the gallinaceous tribe. The ancients generally gave it a monthly allowance of a buſhel of wheat, weighing about twenty pounds. It is proper to notice that the flower of the elder is hurtful to them<note n="§" place="bottom">Linnaeus.</note>, and that the leaf of the nettle is, according to Franzius, a mortal poiſon to the young Peacocks.</p>
               <p>As in India the Peacocks live in the ſtate of nature, it is uſual in that country to hunt them. They can hardly be approached in the day-time, though they are ſcattered over the
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:1084500102:295"/>
fields in numerous flocks; becauſe, as ſoon as they deſcry a ſportſman, they fly away more ſpeedily than partridges, and conceal themſelves in the thickets, where they cannot be purſued. The night therefore is the only proper time for the chaſe, which, in the vicinity of Cambaya is conducted in the following manner:</p>
               <p>The ſportſmen get cloſe to the tree where the Peacocks are perched, and preſent a kind of banner, which ſupports two burning candles, and is painted with the figures of Peacocks. The Peacock dazzled by the glare, or engaged in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring the painting, ſtretches out its neck re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peatedly, and again draws it back, and when its head is obſerved to be entangled in a running knot, placed for the purpoſe, the hunters immediately draw the cord and ſecure the bird<note n="*" place="bottom">Tavernier.</note>.</p>
               <p>We have ſeen that the Greeks much admired the Peacock, but this was only for the beauty of the plumage. The Romans, who carried every luxury to exceſs, actually feaſted on Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocks fleſh.

The Emperors refined on the luxury of their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; and Vitellius and Heliogabalus gloried in filling enormous chargers<note n="‡" place="bottom">Among others that called by Vitellius the Aegis of Minerva.</note> with the brains of

                  <p>Climate has no leſs influence on the plumage of birds than on the fur of animals. We have elſewhere ſeen, that the hare, the ermine, and moſt other animals are ſubject to grow white in cold countries, particularly in the winter ſeaſon. Here is a ſpecies or a variety of Peacocks, which ſeems to have received ſimilar impreſſions from the ſame cauſe: and the effects are even greater, ſince the race is permanent; for the whiteneſs of hares and ermines is merely tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary, and happens only in the winter, like that of the ptarmigan. The colour of the White
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:1084500102:299"/>
Peacock, on the other hand, is no longer affected by the ſeaſon or climate, and the eggs hatched even in Italy produced a white brood. The one which Aldrovandus has cauſed to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graved, was reared at Bologna; and this cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance has made him ſuſpect that this va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety did not belong peculiarly to cold countries. Yet moſt naturaliſts agree in aſſigning Norway and other northern countries for its native region<note n="*" place="bottom">Friſch, and Willughby.</note>. It would ſeem that it is there wild, for in the winter it travels into Germany, where it is commonly caught in that ſeaſon<note n="†" place="bottom">Friſch.</note>. They are indeed found in countries much far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſouth, as in France and Italy, but there they are in the domeſtic ſtate<note n="‡" place="bottom">Aldrovandus.

                  <p>Linnaeus affirms in general, as I have before ſaid, that Peacocks are averſe to reſide in Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and he excepts not even the white ſort.</p>
                  <p>It required a long period of time, and a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular concurrence of circumſtances, to reconcile a bird, bred in the delicious climates of Aſia and India, to the rigours of the northern tracts. If it had not been carried thither, it could not have migrated to theſe inhoſpitable countries, either by the north of Aſia, or by the north of Europe.</p>
                  <p>Though the date of this event be not exactly known, I preſume that it is not very diſtant;
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:1084500102:300"/>
for, on the one hand, I learn from Aldrovan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus, Longolius, Scaliger, and Schwenckfeld, that it is not long ſince White Peacocks were eſteemed as rarities; and on the other hand, I have grounds to believe that the Greeks were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainted with them, becauſe Ariſtotle, having ſpoken in his <hi>Treatiſe on the Generation of Animals</hi> of the variegated colours of the Peacock, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of white partridges, white ravens, and white ſparrows, takes no notice of White Peacocks.</p>
                  <p>The moderns add nothing to the hiſtory of this ſort of Peacocks, except that the young are very delicate and difficult to rear<note n="*" place="bottom">Schwenckfeld.</note>. It is how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever likely, that the influence of climate is not confined to the change of plumage alone, but muſt have operated in ſome degree on their temperament, inſtincts, and habits. I am ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed that no naturaliſt has obſerved the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of the alterations, or at leaſt noticed the intimate and latent effects produced. A ſingle diſcovery of this kind would undoubtedly be more intereſting, and tend more to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement and extenſion of natural know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, than the minute enumeration of all the feathers of theſe birds, and the laborious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of all their ſhades and tints, in the four quarters of the world.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, though their plumage be entirely white, and particularly the long feathers of the

In the time of Schwenckfeld, they were very rare in Sileſia; and it is only
twenty years ſince they were introduced into Pruſſia<note n="‖" place="bottom">Klein.</note>, though they are very frequent in Bohemia<note n="¶" place="bottom">Id.</note>. If they have multiplied in Saxony, it is
owing to the attention of the Duke Frederic<note n="**" place="bottom">Aldrovandus.</note>, who let looſe two hundred in that country,
and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited their being caught or killed. Geſner, who travelled through
the mountains of Switzer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, affirms that he never ſaw any. It is true,
indeed, that Stumpfius aſſerts the contrary; but it is probable that they
may be found in ſome diſtricts which Geſner had not examined, as in that
part which borders on the Milaneſe terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories, where Olina ſays they are
very common. <pb n="289" facs="tcp:1084500102:306"/> Pheaſants are far from being plentiful in
France. In the northern provinces they are ſeldom ſeen, and would perhaps
ſoon die away but for the attention beſtowed on the preſervation of the
royal game. Even in Brie, where ſome are continually making their eſcape
from their keepers, and where their neſts, with eggs, have been found in the
extenſive foreſts of that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, ſo unfavourable is the climate that
the number of the wild Pheaſants is never obſerved to increaſe. We knew
an opulent perſon in Burgundy, who was at the utmoſt pains and ſpared no
expence in ſtocking his eſtate, which lay in Auxois, but without
ſucceſs. I ſhould therefore ſuſpect that Regnard muſt have been
miſtaken when he tells us, that he killed two Pheaſants in Bothnia<note n="*" place="bottom">

Magnus, who ſays that they are found in Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinavia, where they lie under
the ſnow through the winter without any ſuſtenance<note n="†" place="bottom">Quoted by Aldrovandus.</note>. This habit ſeems to belong rather
to the grous than to the Pheaſants; and the name <hi>Gallae
ſylveſtres,</hi> which Olaus applies, ſuits better that genus of birds.
My conjecture has the more foundation, ſince neither Linnaeus, nor any other
accurate obſerver, mentions ſeeing real Pheaſants in the northern
countries. In ſhort, we may ſuppoſe, that the name Pheaſant has firſt
been given by <pb n="290" facs="tcp:1084500102:307"/> the natives to the grous, which are very
nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous in the boreal tracts, and afterwards adopted blindly by travellers,
and even by compilers, who are equally inattentive in diſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minating
ſpecies.</p>
               <p>Since the wings of the Pheaſant are ſhort, conſequently its flight low and laborious, we may readily conclude, that it could not traverſe the immenſe ocean that divides America from the temperate countries in the Ancient Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent. Accordingly, none have been found in the New World, but only ſome birds a-kin to them. I ſpeak not of the true Pheaſants which are at preſent common in the plantations of St. Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingo; for theſe, as well as the peacocks and pintados, were introduced by the Europeans<note n="*" place="bottom">

               <p>The Pheaſant is of the ſize of the common cock<note n="†" place="bottom">Aldrovandus, who has carefully obſerved and deſcribed this bird, ſays, that he examined one which weighed three pounds of twelve ounces, <hi>libras tres duodecim unciarum,</hi> which ſome have ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norantly tranſlated, three pounds twelve ounces.</note>, and in ſome reſpects rivals the peacock in beauty. His figure is as dignified, his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment as bold, and his plumage almoſt as reſplendent. The colours of the Chineſe Phea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant are even brighter; but he has not, like the peacock, the power of diſplaying his rich plumage, and of elevating the long feathers of his tail. Beſides, the Pheaſant has neither the creſt of the peacock, nor the double tail; of

The coverts under the tail continue diminiſhing, and terminate in a kind of filaments. The tail conſiſts of eighteen quills, though Schwenckfeld reckons only ſixteen; the two middle ones are the longeſt of all, and they ſhorten regularly towards the ſides. Each leg is furniſhed with a ſhort pointed ſpur, which has eſcaped ſome deſigners, and even the engraver of our <hi>Planches Enluminées,</hi> No. 121; the toes are connected by a membrane broader than uſual in pulverulent birds<note n="‡" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>, and ſeems to form the firſt ſhade be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween theſe and the aquatic tribes; and in fact Aldrovandus obſerves, that the Pheaſants de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in wet places; and he adds, that they are ſometimes caught in the marſhes in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood of Bologna.

Theſe birds are fond of living in woods that grow on the plains, differing in this reſpect from the grous, which inhabit foreſts that clothe the mountains. They perch on the tops of trees during the night<note n="*" place="bottom">Friſch.</note>, ſleeping with their head under the wing; their cry, that is the cry of the male, (for the female has none at all,) is intermediate between that of the peacock and the pintado, but more like that of the latter, and therefore far from being agreeable.</p>
               <p>Their diſpoſition is ſo unſocial, that they not only fly from the preſence of man, but avoid the company of each other, except in the months of March and April, when the male courts the female. It is then eaſy to diſcover them in the woods, becauſe they are betrayed by the loud noiſe made by the clapping of their wings, which may be heard at a great diſtance<note n="†" place="bottom">Olina.</note>. The Cock Pheaſants are not ſo ardent as the common cocks. Friſch aſſerts that, in the wild ſtate, each attaches itſelf to a ſingle female: but man, who glories in perverting the order of nature to his intereſt or his whims, has changed the inſtinct of theſe birds, by habituating each cock to ſerve ſeven hens, and conſtraining theſe to reſt ſatisfied with the performance of a ſingle male.</p>

               <p>If we would undertake to raiſe Pheaſants on a great ſcale, we muſt for that purpoſe allot a park of proportional extent, which ſhould be partly laid out in graſs, and partly planted with buſhes, where theſe birds may be ſhaded from the ſun, ſheltered from rain, and even protected from the aſſaults of the ravenous tribes. One part of this park ought to be divided into ſeveral ſmall patches of ten or twelve yards ſquare, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed ſo that each may lodge a cock with his females, and they muſt be confined either by diſabling their wings, or by ſpreading a net over the little incloſure.

or hear each other, for though naturally cold and phlegmatic, their diſquietude or jealouſy will interrupt or relax their amours. Thus, in ſome animals, as well as in man, jealouſy is not always proportioned to the appetite of love.</p>
               <p>Palladius alleges, that the cocks need only be a year old<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <bibl>Journal Economique, Sept. 1753.</bibl>
                  </note>, and all naturaliſts agree, that hens are proper for breeding the third year. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times when Pheaſants are numerous, it is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to lodge the females in the incloſures, and leave them to the embraces of the wild cocks.</p>
               <p>Theſe birds feed on all ſorts of grain and herbs. It is even recommended to throw part of the park into a kitchen garden, in which to raiſe beans, carrots, potatoes, onions, lettuces, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnips, and eſpecially the two laſt, of which they are remarkably fond.

The Engliſh author, whom I have juſt quoted, aſſures us, that he loſt many Phea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants

                  </note>. But whatever ſort of food we give them, it muſt be offered ſparingly, not to make them too fat; for corpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence blunts the ardor of the cock, weakens the prolific powers of the hen, and makes her lay eggs with ſoft ſhells and eaſily broken.</p>
               <p>The time of incubation is from twenty to twenty-five days, according to moſt authors and my own obſervation<note n="†" place="bottom">Geſner, Schwenckfeld.—<bibl>Journal Economique</bibl>, &amp; le Roi.</note>. Palladius fixes it at thirty; but this is a miſtake which ought not to have been adopted in the <hi>Maiſon Ruſtique</hi>; for in the warm climate of Italy, the Pheaſants could not require ſo long time to hatch, and therefore inſtead of <hi>trigeſimus,</hi> we ought to read <hi>vigeſimus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We ought to keep the ſitting-hen in a place remote from noiſe and ſomewhat under ground, ſo as not to be affected by the variations of the weather, or expoſed to the ſtroke of thunder.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as the young Pheaſants leave the ſhell, they begin to run like all the gallinaceous tribe. For the firſt twenty-four hours, food is generally withheld from them; after that, they are put with the mother into a crib, and carried out every day to the fields, into the paſture grounds where ant-hills abounds. This ought
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:1084500102:316"/>
to be covered with deals, which may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved or replaced as occaſion requires. It ought alſo to have a diviſion near one of the ends, where the mother ſhould be confined with bars ſo wide aſunder however as to allow the chickens to go out and return as often as they chuſe. The clucking of the impriſoned mother, and the neceſſity of being frequently warmed, will conſtantly bring them back and prevent them from ſauntering too far. It is uſual to join to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether three or four hatches of nearly the ſame age, ſo as to form a ſingle family, which may be reared by the ſame mother.</p>
               <p>They are fed at firſt, like all young chicks, with a mixture of hard eggs, crumbs of bread, and lettuce leaves mixed together, and with an addition of the eggs of meadow ants. But at this tender age two precautions muſt be carefully obſerved. They muſt not be allowed to drink at all, nor be carried abroad till the dew is entirely gone, for humidity of every kind is hurtful to them. We may notice by the way, that this is one of the reaſons why hatches of wild Pheaſants ſeldom ſucceed in France; for, as I have already remarked, theſe birds prefer the freſh verdant places, and in ſuch ſituations the young can hardly ſurvive the damps. The ſecond point to be attended to is, that their food ſhould be given frequently and in ſmall quantities, beginning as ſoon as day break, and always mixing with it ants eggs.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="300" facs="tcp:1084500102:317"/>
In the ſecond month, more ſubſtantial nouriſhment may be given; eggs of the wood ants, turkey beans, wheat, barley, millet, ground beans; and the intervals between the meals may be gradually enlarged.</p>
               <p>At this time they begin to be ſubject to ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min. To prevent that diſorder, moſt modern writers adviſe us to clean the crib, or even to lay it aſide altogether, except the ſmall roof which ſerves to ſhelter them. Olina recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends a plan propoſed by Ariſtotle, which ſeems to me better contrived and more ſuitable to the nature of theſe birds. They are in the number of thoſe that welter in the duſt, and when that gratification is withheld, they languiſh and die<note n="*" place="bottom">

                  </note>. Olina directs ſmall heaps of dry earth or very fine ſand to be laid near them, in which they may tumble and rid themſelves of the painful itching occaſioned by the inſects.</p>
               <p>We muſt alſo be very attentive in giving them clean water, and in often renewing it, elſe they will be in danger of contracting the pip, of which there is ſcarcely any remedy, according to the moderns; though Palladius adviſes to remove it as in common chickens, and to rub the bill with garlick bruiſed with tar.</p>
               <p>The third month is attended with new diſeaſes. The tail feathers then drop and others appear, which is a ſort of criſis to them, as well as to
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:1084500102:318"/>
the Peacocks. But ants eggs are ſtill a reſource; they haſten the trying moment, and leſſen the danger, provided we do not give them too much, for the exceſs is pernicious. In proportion as the young Pheaſants grow up, their regimen becomes the more like that of the adults; and at the end of the third month, they may be let looſe in the place intended to be ſtocked. But ſuch is the effect of domeſtication on animals that have lived ſome time in that ſtate, that even thoſe which, like the Pheaſants, have an invincible attachment to liberty, cannot be reſtored to it but by imperceptible degrees; in the ſame manner as a good ſtomach that has been weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened with watery elements, cannot at once re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover its tone, ſo as to digeſt rich food. We muſt firſt carry the crib which contains the brood to the field where the colony is to be diſperſed; we muſt give them what food they like beſt, but never in the ſame ſpot; and we muſt diminiſh the quantity every day, and thus by degrees conſtrain them to provide for themſelves, and to become acquainted with the country. When they are able to procure ſubſiſtence, they ſhould be reſigned to liberty and nature. They will ſoon grow as wild as thoſe bred in the woods; except only that they will ſtill retain a ſort of affection for thoſe ſpots where they were foſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their infancy.</p>

it to the ſociety of a number of females, has tried alſo to effect another violence, to make it breed with a foreign ſpecies; and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments have in ſome degree ſucceeded, though they required great care and attention<note n="*" place="bottom">The Wild Pheaſants never tread the hens which they meet; not but they ſometimes make advances, only the hens will never permit them to proceed. I owe this, among many other obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to M. Le Roi, Lieutenant des Chaſſes at Verſailles.</note>. A young Cock Pheaſant which had never copulated, was ſhut in a cloſe place where but a faint light glimmered through the roof: ſome young pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets were ſelected, whoſe plumage reſembled the moſt that of the Pheaſant, and were put in a crib adjoining that of the Cock Pheaſant, and ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from it only by a grate, of which the ribs were ſo cloſe as to admit no more than the head and neck of theſe birds. The Cock Pheaſant was thus accuſtomed to ſee theſe females, and even to live with them, becauſe the food was thrown into the crib only. When they had grown familiar and the ſeaſon of love ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached, both the cock and hens were fed on heating aliments, to provoke their deſires; and after they diſcovered an inclination to couple, the grate which parts them was removed. It ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times happened, that the Cock Pheaſant, faithful to nature and indignant at the inſult offered him, abuſed the hens, and even killed the firſt he met with: but if his rage did not ſubſide, he was on the one hand mollified by touching his bill
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:1084500102:320"/>
with a red-hot iron, and on the other, ſtimulated by the application of proper fomentations. At laſt his appetites however growing every day more fiery, and nature conſtantly counteract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing herſelf, he at laſt copulated with the hens, which in conſequence laid eggs dotted with black, like thoſe of the Pheaſant, but much larger; and they produced hybrids partaking the properties of both ſpecies, and, according to ſome, more delicate, and even better flavoured than the true ſort, but incapable, it is ſaid, of propagating their kind: yet Longolius aſſerts, that the females of this kind which couple with their ſire, produce real Pheaſants. Care has alſo been taken to give the Cock Pheaſant only virgin hens; whether the more to incite the males, (for man judges of all creatures from himſelf,) or becauſe the repetition of the experiment on the ſame ſubjects is ſaid to occaſion the breed to degenerate.</p>
               <p>It is pretended that the Pheaſant is a ſtupid bird, and imagines itſelf ſafe when its head is concealed; which has been alleged of many other birds that heedleſsly fall into all ſorts of ſnares. When hunted by a pointer, and met, it ſtands ſtill, and looks ſteadily at the dog, ſo that the ſportſman can take his aim at leiſure. To decoy it, we need only preſent its own figure, or a red rag on a white ſheet. It is caught alſo by ſetting gins in the tracks which it treads in the morning to drink. It is alſo chaſed by the
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:1084500102:321"/>
falcon, and ſuch as are taken this way, are ſaid to be more delicate and delicious than ordinary<note n="*" place="bottom">Aldrovandus.</note>. Autumn is the ſeaſon when they are fatteſt. The young ones may be fattened like other poultry, only in introducing the little ball into the throat, care ſhould be taken to prevent the tongue from being puſhed backwards, which would infallibly kill the bird.</p>
               <p>A fat young Pheaſant is a moſt exquiſite mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, and at the ſame time very wholeſome food. Accordingly this luxury has been always re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved for the tables of the rich, and the whim of Heliogabalus of feeding his lions on Pheaſants, has been regarded as the moſt wanton profuſion.</p>
               <p>According to Olina and Le Roi, this bird, like the common hens, lives about ſix or ſeven years; but the opinion that the age may be diſcovered from the number of the croſs bars on its tail, is void of foundation. <note n="A" place="bottom">Specific character of the Pheaſant, <hi>Phaſianus Colchicus:</hi>—<q rend="inline">It is rufous, its head blue, its tail wedge-ſhaped, its cheeks marked with <hi>papillae.</hi>

It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembles indeed the Pheaſant, by the red circle round its eyes, and its long tail; and it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches the common cock, by the dull and homely feathers of its plumage. It is alſo ſmaller than the ordinary Pheaſant, and like the other Hybrids it is incapable of producing its ſpecies.</p>
                  <p>Friſch tells us, that many of theſe are raiſed in Germany, being profitable; and that they are excellent food.</p>

               <p>I SHALL not range under this denomination, ſeveral birds on which moſt travellers or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turaliſts have beſtowed the name of Pheaſant, but which, after a cloſe inveſtigation, we have determined to belong to very different tribes.—Such as, 1. The Pheaſant of the Antilles of Briſſon, which is that of the iſland Kayriouacou of Father Tertre, and which has longer legs and a ſhorter tail than the Pheaſant. 2. Briſſon's crowned Pheaſant of the Indies, which differs from the Pheaſant by its general form, and by the ſhape of its bill, its inſtincts and habits, its long wings and ſhort tail, and which, if we except its ſize, ſeems to reſemble much the pigeons. 3. The American bird, which we have directed to be figured under the name of <hi>The Creſted Pheaſant of Cayenne,</hi> becauſe it was ſent to us under that name; but which appears to be diſtinguiſhed from the Pheaſant by its bulk, its carriage, its long ſlender neck, its ſmall head, its long wings, &amp;c. 4. The <hi>Hocco Phea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant</hi> of Guiana, which is by no means a Phea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, as the compariſon of the figures alone ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices to ſhew. 5. All the other <hi>Hoccos</hi> of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica,
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:1084500102:326"/>
which Briſſon and Barrere, and others who have been miſled by their ſyſtems, have referred to the genus of the Pheaſant; though they differ in many reſpects, and even in ſome properties that have been received as generic characters.</p>

                  <p>Some authors, who have applied to this bird the name of <hi>Red Pheaſant,</hi> would have had equal reaſon to have called it the <hi>Blue Pheaſant,</hi> and the term <hi>Golden Pheaſant</hi> is equally inadequate to denote the plumage, which is enriched by the luſtre of all theſe three colours.</p>
                  <p>It may be conſidered as a variety of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary ſpecies, whoſe garb ſparkles with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corations of a happier clime. They are two branches of the ſame family, which, though long ſeparated, recal their common deſcent, and can ſtill intermingle, and breed with each other. But it muſt be confeſſed that their progeny par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes ſomewhat of the ſterility of Hybrids; which
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:1084500102:327"/>
proves the antiquity of the partition of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal houſe.</p>
                  <p>The Painted Pheaſant is ſmaller than the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Pheaſant. The remarkable beauty of this bird has occaſioned its being ſo much bred in our pheaſant walks. The predominant co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours of its plumage are red, gold, yellow, and blue; it has long beautiful feathers on the head, which can be erected at pleaſure; its iris, bill, legs, and nails, are yellow; the tail is propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally longer than that of the common Phea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, more mottled, and in general of a brighter plumage; above the feathers of the tail others are ſpread long and narrow, and of a ſcarlet co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, with a yellow ſhaft; the eyes are not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circled with red ſkin, like the European Pheaſant: in a word it appears to have been deeply marked by the impreſſion of the climate.</p>
                  <p>The female of the Painted Pheaſant is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ſmaller than the male, and its tail is not ſo long; the colours of its plumage are very or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, and even inferior to thoſe of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon kind; but ſometimes they acquire in time the beauty of the male. In England, one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to Lady Eſſex changed, in the ſpace of ſix years, its mean duſky colour into the rich luſtre of the male; ſo as not to be diſtinguiſhed, except by the appearance of the eyes and the length of the tail. Intelligent perſons who have had opportunities of obſerving theſe birds, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:1084500102:328"/>
me, that this change of colour takes place in moſt females, and begins at four years old, when males take a diſlike to them and treat them harſhly. That then thoſe long narrow fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, which in the male lie over the tail, begin to appear. And in a word, as they grow older, they become the more like the males, which in a certain degree happens in all animals.</p>
                  <p>Edwards tells us, that he ſaw at the Duke of Leeds's, a common Hen Pheaſant, whoſe plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage had in the ſame manner become like that of the male. He adds, that ſuch changes of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours ſeldom take place except among birds that live in the domeſtic ſtate.</p>
                  <p>The eggs of the Painted Pheaſant are very like thoſe of the Pintado; they are proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſmaller than thoſe of the domeſtic Hen, and more reddiſh than thoſe of the common Phea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant.</p>
                  <p>Sir Hans Sloane kept a male about fifteen years: it would therefore ſeem that this bird is hardy, ſince it lived ſo long out of its native abode. It is ſoon reconciled to our climate, and multiplies faſt; it breeds even with the European Pheaſant. Le Roi, Lieutenant of the Rangers at Verſailles, put one of them to a Cock Phea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant of this country, and obtained two Cock Pheaſants very like the common kind, but the plumage had a dirty caſt, and only a few yellow feathers on the head like thoſe of the Painted
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:1084500102:329"/>
Pheaſant: and theſe two young males being pair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with European hen-pheaſants, one ſucceeded the ſecond year, and a hen-pheaſant was hatched, which could never be made to breed. The two Cocks produced no more, and the fourth year made their elopement.</p>
                  <p>It is probable that the Painted Pheaſant is that elegant pheaſant whoſe plumes ſell higher in China than the pheaſant itſelf; and alſo the ſame with what <hi>Marco Polo</hi> admired in one of his travels to China, whoſe tail was two or three feet long. <note n="A" place="bottom">Specific character of the Painted Pheaſant, <hi>Phaſianus Pictus:</hi>—<q rend="inline">Its creſt is yellow, its breaſt ſaffron, its ſecondary wing-quills blue, its tail wedge-ſhaped.</q>

parts being added from the dead ſubject, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents this Pheaſant more exactly, and gives a better idea of its air and port, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>It is eaſy to ſee, from the bare inſpection of the figure, that it is a variety of the Pheaſant, having the general proportions of the Painted Chineſe Pheaſant, but larger, and exceeding even the European kind. It reſembles the laſt in a remarkable property, having a red border round the eyes, which is even broader and of greater extent; for it falls on each ſide below the under mandible, and at the ſame time riſes like a double comb above the upper man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible.</p>
                  <p>The female is rather ſmaller than the male, and differs much in colour. It has neither the upper-ſide of the body white, nor under-ſide of a fine black, with purple reflexions. In no part of its plumage is there any white, except a ſingle ſpeck below its eyes; the reſt is of a brown red, more or leſs deep, except under the belly and on the lateral feathers of the tail, where there are black tranſverſe bars on a gray ground. In every other reſpect there is leſs difference between the ſexes in this than in any other Pheaſant: the female has, like the male, a tuft on its head, its eyes are encircled with a red border, and its legs are of the ſame colour.</p>
                  <p>Since no naturaliſt, or traveller, has given the leaſt hint concerning the original abode of
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:1084500102:331"/>
the Black-and-white Pheaſant, we are obliged to form conjectures. I am inclined to ſuppoſe that, as the Pheaſant of Georgia, having mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grated towards the eaſt, and having fixed its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence in the ſouthern or temperate provinces of China, has become the Painted Pheaſant; ſo the White Pheaſant, which is an inhabitant of our cold climates, or that of Tartary, having travelled into the northern provinces of China, has become the pencilled kind: that it has there grown to a greater ſize than the original Phea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, or that of Georgia; becauſe it has found in theſe provinces food more plentiful and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſuited to its nature: but that it betrays the marks of a new climate in its air, port, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal form; in all which it reſembles the Painted Pheaſant; but retains of the original Pheaſant the red orbits, which have been even expanded from the ſame cauſes undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly that promoted the growth of its body, and gave it a ſuperiority over the ordinary Pheaſant. <note n="A" place="bottom">Specific character of the Pencilled Pheaſant, <hi>Phaſianus Nycthemerus:</hi>—<q rend="inline">It is white, its creſt and belly black, its tail wedge-ſhaped.</q>

                  <p>Edwards, to whom we are indebted for our acquaintance with this uncommon bird, ranges it among the turkies, on account of the fleſhy excreſcences on the head, and yet he has given it the name of Horned Pheaſant. I ſhould ſuppoſe that it is more like the pheaſant than the turkey: for theſe protuberances are by no means peculiar to the turkey; they belong alſo to the cock, the pintado, the royal bird, the caſſowary, and many others in both continents; nor are they even withheld from the pheaſant, ſince we may regard the broad circle of red ſkin that ſurrounds the eyes, as nearly of the ſame nature; and in the Pencilled Pheaſant of China, this really forms the double comb on the bill, and the barbils under it. If we add, that the Napaul is an inhabitant of the congenial climate of pheaſants, ſince it was ſent to Dr. Mead from Bengal; that in its bill, its feet, its ſpurs, its wings, and its general form, it was like the pheaſant; we ſhall be convinced
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:1084500102:334"/>
that it is more natural to claſs it with the phea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants, than with an American bird ſuch as the turkey.</p>
                  <p>The Napaul, or Horned Pheaſant, is ſo called becauſe of two protuberances which grow from its head like horns, are of a blue colour, a cylin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drical ſhape, blunt at their ends, reclined back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and conſiſt of a ſubſtance reſembling callous fleſh. It has not that round circle about its eyes which occurs in the pheaſants, and is ſometimes dotted with black; the ſpace which ſurrounds the eyes, is ſhaded with black hairs, like feathers. Under this-ſpace, and from the bottom of the lower mandible, grows a kind of gorget conſiſting of looſe ſkin, which falls down and floats freely on the throat and the upper part of the neck: this gorget is black in the middle, and is ſprinkled with a few ſtraggling hairs of the ſame colour. It is marked with wrinkles; ſo that it appears to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of extenſion in the living animal, and there is reaſon to ſuppoſe that it can be inflated or contracted at pleaſure. The lateral parts are blue, with ſome ſpots of orange, and without any hair on the outer ſurface; but the inſide, which applies to the neck, is ſhaded with little black feathers, as well as that part of the neck which it covers. The crown of the head is red, the fore-part of the body reddiſh, and the hind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part of a duſky colour. Over the whole bird, including even the tail and the wings, we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:1084500102:335"/>
white ſpots, ſurrounded with black, and diſperſed with conſiderable regularity: theſe ſpots are round on the fore-part, and oblong, or ſhaped like tears, on the hind-part, with the point turned towards the head. The wings ſcarcely reach beyond the origin of the tail; from which we may conclude that it is a heavy bird. The length of the tail could not be determined by Edwards, for in the original drawing it is repreſented as being partly worn off. <note n="A" place="bottom">Specific character of the Horned Pheaſant, <hi>Penelope Satyra</hi>— <q rend="inline">It has a pair of horns on its head; its body is red, with ſpang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling points.</q>

                  <p>The Japan Peacock is the name given by Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drovandus to what is referred to in the eighth ſpecies of Pheaſant by Briſſon; and both of
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:1084500102:339"/>
theſe authors admit, that this bird reſembles our peacock only by the feet and tail.</p>
                  <p>It has a ſpike-ſhaped tuft on its head; for which reaſon I term it <hi>ſpicifere.</hi> This tuft is about four inches high, and appears enamelled with green and blue; the bill is of an aſh-colour, longer and more ſlender than that of the Peacock; the iris is yellow, and the orbits red, as in the Pheaſant; the tail-feathers are fewer, their colour deeper, and their ſpangles broader, but glowing with the ſame tints as in the Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pean Peacock. The diſtribution of the colours forms on the breaſt, the back, and that part of the wings next the back, a kind of ſcales which give different reflexions in different places; blue on the part of the wings next the back; blue and green on the back; blue, green, and gold-colour on the breaſt: the other quills of the wing are green in the middle through their whole length, then yellowiſh, and run into black at their extremity: the crown of the head, and the arch of the neck, are covered with blue ſpots mixed with white on a greeniſh ground.</p>
                  <p>Such is nearly the deſcription which Aldro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vandus has given of the male, from a painted figure ſent by the Emperor of Japan to the Pope. He does not inform us whether it diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plays its tail like our Peacock: but it is certainly
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:1084500102:340"/>
not ſpread in Aldrovandus' figure; nor has it any ſpurs on the legs, though that author has not omitted them in the engraving of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Peacock, which is placed oppoſite to ſerve for compariſon.</p>
                  <p>According to Aldrovandus, the female is ſmaller than the male; has the ſame colours on the head, neck, breaſt, and wings; but the under-ſide of its body is black, and the coverts of the rump, which are much ſhorter than the quills of the tail, are decorated with four or five ſpangles of conſiderable breadth in proportion to the ſize of the quills: green is the predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant colour in the tail, the feathers are edged with blue, and their ſhafts are white.—This bird ſeems to be much akin to the bird which Koempfer, in his Hiſtory of Japan, mentions under the name of Pheaſant<note n="*" place="bottom">

                  <p>This bird is hardly known, except from the figure and deſcription which Edwards publiſhed of the male and female, made from the living ſubject.</p>
                  <p>At firſt ſight the male ſeems to bear ſome analogy to the Pheaſant and Peacock: like them it has a long tail, decorated with ſpangles, as in the Peacock. And ſome naturaliſts, abiding by the firſt impreſſion, have ranged it with the Pheaſants<note n="*" place="bottom">Klein and Briſſon.</note>. But though from the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe exterior appearances, Edwards has been induced to retain the name of Peacock-Pheaſant, he was convinced, on a cloſer inſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that it did not belong to the Pheaſant kind: becauſe, 1. The long feathers of the tail are round, and not pointed at the end; 2. They are ſtraight throughout, and not arched back; 3. They do not make an inverted gutter by the bending back of their webs as in the Phea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant;
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:1084500102:342"/>
4. It does not walk with its tail raiſed and recurved as in that bird.</p>
                  <p>Still leſs does it belong to the Peacock kind, from which it differs in the carriage of its tail, in the diſpoſition and number of the quills that compoſe it. It is diſtinguiſhed too by other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties; its head and neck are thick, its tail does not riſe and ſpread like the Peacock's<note n="*" place="bottom">Edwards never ſays that this bird diſplays its tail: I may therefore infer the negative, ſince if the expanſion had taken place, that intelligent naturaliſt would have obſerved it and have mentioned it.</note>, and inſtead of a tuft, it has only a ſort of flat creſt formed by the feathers on the top of the head, which briſtle and ſtretch towards a point ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what projecting; and laſtly, it has a double ſpur on each leg, a ſingular character, from which I have denominated the bird<note n="†" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Eperonnier,</hi> from <hi>Eperon,</hi> a ſpur.</note>.</p>
                  <p>Theſe external differences, which undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly involve many others which are more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed, would ſeem a ſufficient reaſon to every ſenſible man, who is not prejudiced by ſyſtems, for excluding it from the Peacocks and Phea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants; though like theſe, its toes are parted, its feet naked, its legs covered with feathers as far as the heel, the bill faſhioned into a curved cone, the tail long, and the head without comb or membrane. A perſon who ſticks rigidly to a ſyſtem, could not fail to range it with the Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cock or the Pheaſant, ſince it poſſeſſes all the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:1084500102:343"/>
of that genus; but muſt the hiſtorian, exempt from prejudice and unfettered by forms, recogniſe it as the Peacock of Nature?</p>
                  <p>In vain it will be urged, that ſince the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal characters of this bird are the ſame with thoſe of the Pheaſant, the little variations ought not to ſeclude it from that arrangement; for I may ſtill aſk, who has a right to fix theſe prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal characters? to decide, for inſtance, that the negative attribute of having neither creſt nor membrane is more eſſential than the ſhape or the ſize? and to pronounce that all birds which reſemble each other in characters arbitrarily ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, muſt alſo agree in their true proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties?</p>
                  <p>In laying aſide the name of Chineſe Peacock, I have acted conformably to the teſtimony of travellers, who aſſure us, that through the whole extent of that vaſt country there are no Peacocks but ſuch as have been introduced from abroad<note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <bibl>Navarette, <hi>Deſcription de la China.</hi>

                     </note>.</p>
                  <p>In this bird the iris is yellow, and alſo the ſpace between the bottom of the bill and the eye; the upper mandible red; the lower mandible of a deep brown, and the feet of a dirty brown; its plumage is exceedingly beautiful; the tail, as I have already ſaid, is ſprinkled with oval ſpangles, and is of a fine purple colour with reflections of blue, green, and gold. The effect of theſe ſpangles, or mirrors, is the more ſtriking, as they
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:1084500102:344"/>
are defined and diſtinguiſhed from the ground by a double circle, the one black and the other dull orange. Each quill of the tail has two of theſe mirrors cluſtered together, the ſhaft paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing between them. However, as the tail con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains much fewer quills than that of the Peacock, it is much leſs loaded with ſpangles; but to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſate this, it has a very great number on its back and wings, where the Peacock has none: thoſe on the wings are round; and as the ground colour of the plumage is brown, it reſembles a ſable richly ſtrewed with ſapphires, opals, eme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralds, and topazes. The greater quills of the wing are not decorated with ſpangles, all the reſt have each only one; and their colours, whether in the wings or in the tail, do not penetrate to the other ſurface, which is of an uniform dull caſt.</p>
                  <p>The male exceeds the ſize of an ordinary Pheaſant; and the female is a third ſmaller, and appears more lively and active. As in the male, its iris is yellow; but there is no red on its bill, and its tail is much ſmaller. And though in the female of this bird the colours are more like thoſe of the male, than in the Peacocks or Pheaſants, they are more faint and dull, and have not that luſtre and thoſe luminous undulations which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce ſo charming an effect in the ſpangles of the male.</p>

degree, of the changes to which domeſtic animals are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject<note n="†" place="bottom">Sir Hans Sloane ſays, that their plumage is

The Academicians had heard that their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian cock was brought from Africa, where it was called <hi>Ano</hi>; but as Marcgrave and ſeveral other obſervers inform us that it is a native of Brazil, and ſince we learn from a compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the moſt accurate deſcriptions and figures, that its wings are ſhort and its flight laborious, we can hardly be perſuaded that it could traverſe the immenſe ſtretch of ocean that divides the ſhores of Africa and Brazil. It is much more natural to ſuppoſe that the ſubjects diſſected by the Academicians, if they were really brought from Africa, had been previouſly carried thither either from Brazil or from ſome other ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the New World. The ſame reaſon will enable us to judge of the propriety of the appellation of the Perſian Cock, beſtowed by Johnſton on this bird.</p>
                  <p>The Hocco is nearly as large as a turkey. One of its moſt diſtinguiſhing properties is a creſt, which is black, or ſometimes black mixed with white, about two or three inches high, and which extends from the origin of the bill to the back of the head. The bird can raiſe or depreſs it at pleaſure, and according as it is differently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected. This creſt conſiſts of narrow tapering fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſomewhat reclined, but the point is reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and bent forwards. Of theſe feathers, the Academicians obſerved many whoſe webs were incloſed half the length of their ſhaft, in a kind of membranous caſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="330" facs="tcp:1084500102:349"/>
The prevailing colour of the plumage is black, which is for the moſt part uniform and like vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet on the head and neck, and ſometimes ſprinkled with white ſpeckles; the reſt of the body has greeniſh reflections, and in ſome ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects it changes into a deep cheſnut, as in that of No. 125. of the <hi>Planches Enluminées.</hi> The bird figured in that plate has no white under the belly or on the tail; in which reſpect it differs from that of No. 86. Laſtly, Others are white below the belly and not at the tail, and <hi>vice verſâ</hi>; and we muſt obſerve, that theſe co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours are liable to vary both in their tints and in diſpoſition, according to the ſex.</p>
                  <p>The bill is ſhaped like that of the gallinaceous tribe, but is rather ſtronger: in ſome, it is of a fleſh colour and whitiſh near the point, as in the Brazilian Hocco of Briſſon: in others, the end of the upper mandible is grooved on both ſides, which makes it look as if it were armed with three points, the principal one in the middle, and the two lateral, formed by furrows, ſomewhat farther back, as in the Indian Cocks of the Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demicians: in others, the baſe is covered with a yellow ſkin, in which are placed the noſtrils; as in the Guiana of Briſſon: in others, this yellow ſkin, extending on both ſides of the head, forms a circle of the ſame colour round the eyes; as in the <hi>Mitou-poranga</hi> of Marcgrave: in others, this ſkin ſwells on the baſe of the upper man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible into a kind of tubercle or round bump,

                     <pb n="331" facs="tcp:1084500102:351"/> which is pretty hard and about the ſize of a
ſmall nut. It is commonly believed that the females have not this
protuberance; and Edwards adds, that it does not grow on the males till after
the firſt year; which appears to be the more probable, ſince Fernandez
obſerved in his <hi>Tepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tototl</hi> a kind of tumor begun to form on the
bill. Some individuals, as the <hi>Mitou</hi> of Marcgrave, have a white ſkin
behind the ear like the common hens. The legs would reſemble in ſhape
thoſe of the gallinaceous tribe, if they had ſpurs and were not
proportionally thicker: they vary too in their colour, from a darkiſh brown
to a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
                  <p>Some naturaliſts would refer the Hocco to the genus of the turkey; but it is eaſy, from the foregoing deſcription, and from the figure, to collect numerous and deciſive differences which diſcriminate theſe kinds. In the turkey the head is ſmall and not feathered, which is alſo the caſe with the top of the neck; the bill bears a conical muſcular protuberance, capable of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dilated and contracted; the legs are armed with ſpurs; the tail feathers can be ſpread like a fan, &amp;c. whereas in the Hocco, the head is large, the neck ſunk, and both are clothed with feathers; on the bill is a round, hard, and almoſt bony ſwelling; and on the crown of the head a moveable creſt, which ſeems to be peculiar to this bird, and which is raiſed and depreſſed at

pleaſure; but no perſon has ever aſſerted that it can expand its tail feathers like a fan.</p>
                  <p>To theſe exterior differences, add the more intimate eſſential diſparities, which appear from diſſection to be as numerous.</p>
                  <p>The inteſtinal canal is much longer, and the two <hi>coeca</hi> much ſhorter, than in the turkey; its craw is alſo much leſs capacious, being only four inches round; but I have ſeen a crop taken out of a turkey, that ſeemed to have nothing unuſual in its ſtructure, that could contain half a Paris pint dry meaſure. Beſides, in the Hocco, the fleſhy ſubſtance of the gizzard is for the moſt part very thin, and its inner coat, on the contrary, very thick, and ſo hard as even to be apt to crack. Laſtly, The <hi>trachea arteria</hi> dilates and makes an inflexure near where it forks; as happens in ſome aquatic birds, quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to what is obſerved in the turkey.</p>
                  <p>But if the Hocco be not a turkey, the modern nomenclators had ſtill leſs reaſon to ſuppoſe it a Pheaſant; for beſides thoſe differences, which will readily be perceived externally and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, there is a deciſive one in the inſtincts of theſe birds. The Pheaſant is always wild; though bred from its infancy, though treated kindly and fed with great attention, it never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes reconciled to the domeſtic ſtate; it is ever a reſtleſs priſoner, ever ſeeking the means of eſcape: it even abuſes the companions of its ſlavery, and never aſſociates with them. When
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:1084500102:353"/>
it recovers its liberty, and is reſtored to the ſavage ſtate, for which it ſeems to be formed, nothing can be more timorous or miſtruſtful; every new object is viewed with a ſuſpicious aſpect; the leaſt noiſe ſcares it, and the ſlighteſt motion diſturbs its quiet; even the ſhadow of a branch ſhaken by the wind is ſufficient to make it take wing. On the contrary, the Hocco is a calm bird, ſecure and even ſtupid; which perceives no danger, or at leaſt makes no exertion to ſhun it: it ſeems to forget itſelf, and to be careleſs of its own exiſtence. Aublet ſhot nine of them in the ſame flock with the ſame piece, which he loaded as often as required. Such was their patient tranquillity. We may ſuppoſe that ſuch a bird muſt be ſociable; that it will readily accommodate itſelf to the other domeſtic fowls; and that it can be eaſily tamed. And though trained, it roams to a great diſtance during the day, but always returns again in the evening; as Aublet tells me himſelf. It becomes ſo tame as to rub with its bill on the door to gain ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion; to pull the ſervants by the clothes when they neglect it; to follow its maſter every where; or, if not allowed, it waits anxiouſly for his return, and, on ſeeing him again, ſhews every ſign of joy and affection.</p>
                  <p>It is difficult to conceive habits more oppoſite; and I ſhould imagine that no naturaliſt, or even nomenclator, if he had been acquainted with
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:1084500102:354"/>
them, would have ventured to refer theſe two birds to the ſame genus.</p>
                  <p>The Hocco loves to inhabit the mountains, if we may infer this from the import of the name <hi>Tepetototl,</hi> which, in the Mexican language, ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies <hi>mountain-bird.</hi> When kept in cages it is fed on bread, paſte, and other ſuch things<note n="*" place="bottom">Fernandez.</note>. It is fond of perching on trees, eſpecially to paſs the night. It flies tardily, as I have obſerved above; but its carriage is bold<note n="†" place="bottom">Barrere.</note>. Its fleſh is white, though rather dry; but when kept a ſufficient time, it is pleaſant eating<note n="‡" place="bottom">Fernandez, Marcgrave, &amp;c.</note>.</p>
                  <p>Sir Hans Sloane ſays, that its tail is only two inches long, which Edwards conceives to be printed by miſtake for ten. But I ſhould imagine that this correction is too general and unlimited; for I obſerve that Aldrovandus aſſerts, from a drawing of a bird of this ſort, that it has no tail. And on the other hand, Barrere relates, from his own obſervations which he made on the ſpot, that the female of his Amazon Hocco, which is the Curaſſow-Hocco of Briſſon, has a ſhort tail. Whence it appears that what Sir Hans Sloane has affirmed with regard to the Hocco in general, muſt be reſtricted to the female only, at leaſt in certain tribes. <note n="A" place="bottom">Specific character of the <hi>Crax-Alector:</hi>

                  <p>We have figured this bird in the <hi>Planches En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminées</hi> under the name of <hi>Stone of Cayenne,</hi> which is really what it bears in the <hi>Royal Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagerie,</hi> where the drawing was made after the life. But as in its native country, which is Mexico, it is known by the name of <hi>Pauxi,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Fernandez, I have thought proper to employ both theſe names.—It is the fourth ſpecies of the Pheaſant of Briſſon, which he terms the <hi>Mexican Hocco.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This bird reſembles the preceding in many reſpects; but it differs in ſome particulars. Its head is not tufted like the other; the ſwelling on the bill is larger, of the ſhape of a pear, and of a blue colour. Fernandez ſays, that this tubercle is as hard as a ſtone; and this is the reaſon, I ſuppoſe, why it was called firſt the <hi>Stone-bird,</hi> and then the <hi>Stone</hi>; for the ſame cauſe that it was firſt named <hi>Cuſco</hi> or <hi>Cuſhew-bird,</hi> and <hi>Numidian-hen,</hi> from this bump, which ſome have conceived to reſemble the American nut, called <hi>cuſco</hi> or <hi>cuſhew</hi>; and others have imagined that it is like the caſque of the Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tado.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="336" facs="tcp:1084500102:356"/>
But theſe are not the only differences which diſtinguiſh the Pauxi from the preceding Hoccos: it is ſmaller, its bill is ſtronger, more hooked, and almoſt as much ſo as that of the parrot. Beſides, it is much more ſeldom brought to Europe than the Hocco. Edwards, who ſaw the Hocco in almoſt every collection, could not meet with a ſingle Caſhew or Pauxi in the courſe of his inquiries.</p>
                  <p>The elegant black of its plumage has blue and purple reflections, which cannot be repreſented in the deſign.</p>
                  <p>This bird perches on trees; but it lays on the ground like the pheaſants, leads its young, and even calls them together. The brood live firſt on infects, and afterwards, when they are grown up, they feed on fruits, ſeeds, and whatever is proper for poultry<note n="*" place="bottom">Aublet and Fernandez.</note>.</p>
                  <p>The Pauxi is as gentle, or, if we chuſe, as ſtupid, as the other Hoccos; for it will ſit ſtill though fired at ſix times in ſucceſſion; yet, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Fernandez, it will not ſuffer itſelf to be caught or handled; and M. Aublet informs me, that it is found in uninhabited places, which is probably one of the cauſes why it is ſo rarely brought to Europe.</p>
                  <p>Briſſon ſays, that the male differs from the female only by the colours, having brown where the other is black; but that they are in other reſpects alike. Aldrovandus, however, admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:1084500102:357"/>
that the plumage is in general brown, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves that its wings and tail are cinereous; that the bill is leſs hooked, and that it has no tail; which would be a feature of coincidence with the Amazon Hocco of Barrere, in which, as we have already noticed, the tail of the female is much ſhorter than that of the male: and theſe are not the only American birds which want the tail; in a certain part of that continent, the poultry tranſported from Europe loſe their tail and rump, as we have already obſerved in the hiſtory of the cock. <note n="A" place="bottom">Specific character of the <hi>Crax Pauxi:</hi>

                  <p>This bird is figured in the <hi>Planches Enluminees</hi> under the name of <hi>Creſted Cayenne Pheaſant</hi>; at leaſt it does not differ ſenſibly from that, as will appear by comparing No. 337. with the deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Fernandez.</p>

                     <pb n="338" facs="tcp:1084500102:358"/>
According to that author, the Hoazin is not quite ſo large as a turkey-hen; its bill is hooked; its breaſt of a yellowiſh white; the wings and tail marked with ſpots or white rays an inch aſunder; the back, the upper ſide of the neck, the ſides of the head, are of a tawny brown; the legs are of a dirty colour. It has a creſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of feathers that are whitiſh on one ſide and black on the other; this creſt is taller and differently ſhaped from that of the Hoccos; and it does not appear that they can raiſe and depreſs it at pleaſure: its head alſo is ſmaller and its neck more ſlender.</p>
                  <p>Its voice is very ſtrong, and more like a bray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing than a cry. It is ſaid that it calls its own name, probably in a ſad frightful tone. Nothing more was wanted among ſavage tribes to place it in the claſs of inauſpicious birds; and as the human mind is naturally prone to imagine the object of dread endowed with vaſt power, theſe rude people draw from it remedies for the moſt inveterate and alarming diſorders. They do not appear, however, to feed on it: they abſtain per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps through fear, which it inſpires; or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps from an averſion, becauſe it lives common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on ſerpents. It inhabits generally exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive foreſts, where it perches on trees beſide water, to watch and ſurpriſe theſe reptiles. It is found in the warmeſt parts of Mexico. Hernandez adds, that it appears in autumn,
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:1084500102:359"/>
which gives room to ſuſpect that it is a bird of paſſage<note n="*" place="bottom">

                        <p>I ſhould rather diſcover the Hoazin in another bird mentioned by the ſame author, after the Pauxi.

                  <p>This bird has named itſelf; for its cry is, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Marcgrave, <hi>Yacou</hi>; whence is derived the name <hi>Iacupema.</hi> I have preferred that of Yacou as the eaſieſt, and the beſt adapted.</p>
                  <p>Marcgrave is the firſt who has ſpoken of this bird. Some naturaliſts, copying him, have ranged it with the pheaſants; others, ſuch as Briſſon and Edwards, have claſſed it with the turkies. But it is neither the one nor the other:—it is not a turkey, though it has a red ſkin under the neck; for it differs in many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects; in its ſize, which is ſcarcely equal to that of a common hen; its head is partly co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with feathers, and its creſt is much more like that of the Hoccos than that of the creſted turkey; and its legs have no ſpurs:—beſides, it has not the bunch of hard hair under the neck, nor the muſcular caruncle on the bill, as in the turkey-cock, nor does it expand the feathers of its tail. On the other hand, it is not a pheaſant; for it has the long and ſlender bill and the creſt of
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:1084500102:361"/>
the Hoccos; its neck is ſlender; it has a fleſhy membrane under the throat; its tail-feathers are all of an equal length; and its diſpoſitions are mild and gentle: all which characters diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh it from the pheaſants, and its cry differs from both that of the pheaſant and of the tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>key. But what ſhall we then make it? It ſhall be a Yacou, having ſome analogies with the turkey (the fleſhy membrane under the throat and the tail compoſed of equal quills); with the pheaſants (the eye encircled with black ſkin, the wings ſhort, and the tail long); with the Hocco (the long tail, the creſt, and mild diſpoſition); but which is diſtinguiſhed from all theſe by numerous and marked differences, and therefore conſtitutes a ſeparate ſpecies.</p>
                  <p>We can hardly doubt that the <hi>Guan</hi> or <hi>Quan</hi> of Edwards, ſo called, according to him, in the Weſt Indies, probably by ſome other tribe of Savages, is at leaſt a variety of the Yacou, from which it differs only in being not ſo tall, and its eyes of another colour; but ſuch differences may take place in the ſame ſpecies, eſpecially ſince it is domeſticated.</p>
                  <p>Black mixed with brown is the prevailing co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of its plumage, but with different reflections, and ſome white ſtreaks on the neck, breaſt, belly, &amp;c.; the legs are of a bright red.</p>
                  <p>The fleſh of the Yacou is excellent meat. All that is known with reſpect to its other properties has been related in the beginning of this article.</p>

Ray conſiders it as of the ſame ſpecies with the coxolitli of Fernandez; but that bird is much larger, and has not under its throat that fleſhy membrane which characterizes the Yacou; and for this reaſon I have claſſed it with the Hoccos properly ſo called. <note n="A" place="bottom">Specific character of the <hi>Penelope Criſtata:</hi>

                  <p>No author has taken notice of the female of the Yacou except Edwards, who conjectures that it has no creſt. From this ſingle authority, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of the moſt accurate figures and ſtuffed ſpecimens, I am inclined to ſuppoſe, that the bird figured in No. 328. of the <hi>Planches En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminées</hi> under the name of <hi>The Greeniſh Pheaſant of Cayenne,</hi> and which is generally called in that iſland <hi>The Marail,</hi> is perhaps the female of the ſpecies of Yacou; for I can diſcover many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſive points of reſemblance to the <hi>Guan</hi> of Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards (Plate XIII.); in its ſize, the colour of its
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:1084500102:363"/>
plumage, and its general ſhape, if we except only the creſt, which is wanting in the female; in its port, in the length of its tail, in the red circle that ſurrounds the eyes<note n="*" place="bottom">This naked ſkin is blue in the Yacou, and red in the Marail; but we have before obſerved the ſame difference of colour between one ſex and the other in the fleſhy membranes of the Pintado.</note>, the red naked ſpace below the throat, the form of its feet and bill, &amp;c. I muſt own that I have alſo perceived ſome differences; the quills of the tail are like organ pipes, as in the pheaſant, and not equal, as in the Guan of Edwards; and the noſtrils are not ſo near the origin of the bill: but it would not be difficult to inſtance a number of ſpecies in which the female differs ſtill more from the male, and in which there are varieties that are more remote from each other.</p>
                  <p>M. Aublet, who ſaw this bird in its native coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, tells me, that it is eaſily tamed, and that its fleſh is delicate, and richer and ſuperior in ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culency to that of the pheaſant. He adds, that it is a real turkey, only ſmaller than what is naturalized in Europe: and this is ſtill another point of reſemblance to the Yacou, its having been taken for a turkey.</p>
                  <p>This bird is not only found in Cayenne; but, if we may judge from the identity of the name, it inhabits the country which is watered by the majeſtic ſtream of the Amazons; for Barrere ſpeaks of the Marail of the Amazons, as a bird whoſe plumage is black, its bill green, and no

                  <p>I give this name, which is expreſſive of its cry, to that beautiful bird of the Antilles de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by Father du Tertre.</p>
                  <p>If all the American birds that have been taken for pheaſants muſt be referred to the Hocco tribe, the Caracara ought to be ranged with theſe; for the French inhabitants of the Antilles, and Father du Tertre after them, have applied to it the name of <hi>Pheaſant.</hi> 
                     <q rend="inline">This Pheaſant is,</q> ſays he, <q rend="inline">a very beautiful bird, about the ſize of a capon, taller, and with legs like thoſe of the peacock. Its neck is much longer than that of a cock, and the bill and head reſemble thoſe of a raven; all the feathers of the neck
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:1084500102:365"/>
and breaſt are of a fine ſhining blue, as plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing as peacock's plumes; all the back is of a brown gray, and the wings and tail, which are rather ſhort, are black.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q rend="inline">When this bird is tamed, it becomes maſter of the houſe, and drives off the common hens and turkey-hens, and ſometimes even kills them. Nor does it allow the dogs to paſs without offering violence. . . . . I ſaw one which was a mortal enemy to Negroes, and would not permit one to enter the hut, but picked their legs and feet ſo cruelly as to draw blood.</q> Thoſe who have eaten them affirm, that their fleſh is as good as that of the phea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants in France.</p>
                  <p>How could Ray ſuppoſe that ſuch a bird was the ravenous bird mentioned by Marcgrave un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſame name? It is true indeed that it fights with the poultry, and flies at dogs and Negroes; but this it does only when tamed. We ſhall more eaſily diſcover in it the natural jealouſy of a domeſtic animal, which cannot bear the rivals in his maſter's favour, than the ferocious diſpoſitions of a bird of prey, which darts on others to tear them in pieces and devour them. Beſides, it is not common that the fleſh of a rapacious bird is delicate eating, as is that of the Caracara. Laſtly, It appears, that in the Caracara of Marcgrave, the tail and wings are much longer in proportion than in that of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther du Tertre.</p>

                  <p>Fernandez ſpeaks of a bird which is of the ſame country and nearly the ſame ſize with the preceding, and which, in the Mexican language, is called <hi>Chachalacamelt</hi>; from which I have formed <hi>Chacamel,</hi> for the eaſier pronunciation. Its chief character is that of having a cry like the common hen, or rather like the clamorous noiſe of a number of fowls; for it is ſo conſtant and ſo loud, that a ſingle bird of this kind is ſaid to make as much din as a whole court-yard. Hence is derived the Mexican name, which ſignifies the <hi>crying bird.</hi> It is brown on the back, of a duſky-white on the belly, and the bill and feet are bluiſh.</p>
                  <p>The Chacamel, like moſt of the Hoccos, commonly inhabits the mountains, where it rears its young. <note n="A" place="bottom">Specific character of the <hi>Penelope Vociſerans:</hi>—<q rend="inline">Its bill is bluiſh, its back brown, its breaſt blue, its belly whitiſh-brown.</q>

                  <p>As far as we can judge from the imperfect hints of Fernandez and Barrere, we may range here, 1. The Parraka<note n="*" place="bottom">Specific character:—<q rend="inline">It is brown, below fulvous, its top fulvous, its tail equal.</q>
                     </note> of the latter, which he calls <hi>Pheaſant,</hi> and of which he
ſays only that the feathers of the head are of a tawny colour, and form a
kind of creſt. 2. The <hi>Hoitlallotl,</hi> or Long Bird of the former, which
inhabits the warm regions of Mexico<note n="†" place="bottom"> 
Specific character:—<q rend="inline">It is tawny-white, its tail long and green.</q>
                     </note>. This bird has a long tail, ſhort wings, and a laborious flight,
like moſt of the foregoing; but it outſtrips the fleeteſt horſes. It is
not ſo large as the Hoccos, being only eighteen inches from the tip of the
bill to the end of the tail. Its general colour is white, verging on the
fulvous. Near the tail it is ſtained with black, mixed with ſome white
ſpots; but the tail itſelf is of a varying green, which has reflections
nearly like the peacock's plumes.</p>

Theſe birds are ſo little known, that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not venture to refer them to their ſpecies.

               <head>The PARTRIDGE.</head>
               <p>IT is often the moſt difficult to give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curate and conſiſtent account of thoſe ſpecies which are the moſt generally known. When a perſon meets, for the firſt time, with a bird which he has never before ſeen, he overlooks the minute characters, and, ſeizing the more obvious reſemblances, he refers it to that tribe with which he is previouſly beſt acquainted. Hence that ſtrange incoherent jumble of names which have been formed on the relations of haſty and inaccurate obſervers. We have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready been more than once embarraſſed in this chaos of terms; and I am afraid that the article of the Partridge will not be the laſt which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires a critical examination.</p>
               <p>I take the Common Partridge for the baſis and firſt ſpecies of the genus, as being the beſt known, and therefore the fitteſt ſubject for compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon.—I ſhall admit one variety and three per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent breeds.</p>
               <p>Theſe permanent breeds are, 1. The <hi>Common Gray Partridge</hi>; and, as a variety of it, the <hi>White Gray Partridge</hi> of Briſſon. 2. The <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſcus Partridge,</hi> not that of Belon, which is the Hazel Grous, but that of Aldrovandus, which is ſmaller than our Gray Partridge, and which
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:1084500102:370"/>
appears to be the ſame with the Little Partridge, a bird of paſſage well known to our ſportſmen. 3. The <hi>Mountain Partridge,</hi> which is figured in No. 136. of the <hi>Planches Enluminées,</hi> and which ſeems to form the ſhade between the Gray and the Red Partridges.</p>
               <p>In the ſecond ſpecies I range the Red Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridge, into which I admit two permanent breeds in France, and one variety, and two foreign breeds.</p>
               <p>The two permanent Red Partridges which are found in France are, 1. No. 150. <hi>Planches Enlu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minées.</hi> 2. The <hi>Greek Partridge,</hi> Pl. 231.</p>
               <p>The two foreign ſpecies are, 1. The <hi>Red Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bary Partridge</hi> of Edwards, Pl. 70. 2. The <hi>Rufous-breaſted Partridge,</hi> which is found on the banks of the Gambra.</p>
               <p>As the plumage of the Red Partridge is liable to aſſume ſhades of white like that of the Gray Partridge, thence reſults a variety exactly ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar to that in the latter.</p>
               <p>From this genus I exclude ſeveral ſpecies which have been improperly referred to it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Francolin, which we have removed from the Partridges, becauſe it differs from them not only by its general ſhape, but by ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular characters, as in the ſpurs, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The bird called by Briſſon the <hi>Senegal Partridge,</hi> and which he makes his eighth ſpecies. This bird appears to me to be more a-kin to the Francolins than to the Partridges;
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:1084500102:371"/>
and as it has two ſpurs on each leg, I ſhall give it the epithet of <hi>Double Spur.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The African Red Partridge.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The third foreign ſpecies, called by Briſſon the <hi>Great Partridge of Brazil,</hi> which he ſuppoſes to be the <hi>Macucagua</hi> of Marcgrave, from whom he copies the deſcription, and confounds it with the <hi>Agamia</hi> from Cayenne, which is a bird wholly different from both.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The <hi>Yambou</hi> of Marcgrave, which is the Brazilian Partridge of Briſſon, and which has neither the ſhape, the habits, nor the charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Partridge; ſince, according to Briſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon himſelf, it has a long bill, perches upon trees, and lays blue eggs.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The American Partridge of Cateſby and Briſſon, which alſo perches, and prefers the woods to the cleared grounds; a character which does not belong to the Partridge.</p>
               <p n="7">7. A multitude of American birds, which the herd of travellers have called Partridges from ſome ſlight reſemblance inaccurately obſerved. Such are the birds known at Guadeloupe under the names of <hi>Red Partridges, Gray Partridges,</hi> and <hi>Black Partridges</hi>; though, according to the accounts of perſons better informed, they are pigeons or turtles; ſince they have neither the bill nor the fleſh of the Partridge, perch on trees, where they build their neſts, lay only two eggs, and ſince the young do not run as ſoon as they quit the ſhell, but are fed by the parents in the
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:1084500102:372"/>
neſt like turtles. Such too are moſt probably thoſe Partridges which Carreri ſaw on the mountains of the Havannah; ſuch the <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouris,</hi> the <hi>Pegaſſous,</hi> and the <hi>Pegacans</hi> of Lery; and ſuch perhaps are ſome American birds which I have ranked in the claſs of Partridges on the authority of writers, when their relations ſeemed not contradicted by facts; though I muſt own, that it is not likely birds ſo heavy could croſs the intervening ocean.</p>

                  <p>Though Aldrovandus, judging of other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries from his own, aſſerts that Gray Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridges abound in every part of the globe; it is certain that there are none in the iſland of Crete; and it is probable that they never inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited Greece; for Athenaeus remarks with ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize, that all the Italian Partridges had not a red bill like thoſe of Greece. Nor are they
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:1084500102:373"/>
equally ſpread through Europe: they ſeem to avoid the extremes both of heat and cold, and are found neither in Africa nor in Lapland. They thrive moſt in the temperate parts of France and Germany. It is true, indeed, that Boterius ſays that they do not inhabit Ireland; but this muſt be underſtood of the Red Partridges, which are not found even in England, (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the beſt authors of that country,) and which have not penetrated in that direction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the iſlands of Guernſey and Jerſey. The Common Partridge is frequent in Sweden, where Linnaeus tells us it winters under the ſnow in a kind of burrow, which has a double entrance. This manner of lodging during the ſevere ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, is very like that of the Ptarmigan, which we have already deſcribed; and if this fact were not averred by a man of ſo high reputation as Linnaeus, I ſhould ſuſpect ſome miſtake; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially as in France the long winters, with great falls of ſnow, prove fatal to numbers of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridges. Laſtly, as it is a bird of laborious flight, I am much inclined to ſuſpect that it has never migrated into America; and I ſhould imagine, that thoſe birds of the New World which are referred to this genus, would be ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from it if they were better known.</p>
                  <p>The Gray Partridge differs in many reſpects from the Red; but what makes me conſider them as diſtinct kinds, is that, according to the
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:1084500102:374"/>
remark of the few ſportſmen who can make ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations, though they ſometimes inhabit the ſame ſpot, they never aſſociate together. A vacant male of the one ſpecies will ſometimes, indeed, conſort with a pair of the other, follow them, and even diſcover ſymptoms of jealouſy; yet it never copulates with the female, though it is reduced to abſtinence, and beholds conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually the ſweets of conjugal felicity, and feels the enlivening influence of ſpring.</p>
                  <p>The Gray Partridge is alſo of a gentler na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture than the Red, and not difficult to tame; and when not teazed, it ſoon becomes fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar<note n="*" place="bottom">Ray aſſerts the contrary; but as he confeſſes that the Red Partridges are never ſeen in England, his authority will not in this inſtance weigh againſt actual obſervers.</note>. However, they never could be form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into flocks that would be driven, as has been done with the Red Partridges: for the Red Partridges are thoſe which travellers, as Olina remarks, deſcribe as being bred in nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous flocks on ſome iſlands of the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terranean. The Gray Partridges have alſo a more ſocial turn, ſince each family continues in a ſingle body, or covey, till the pairing of love. If a hatch, from ſome accident, does not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely ſucceed, the families recruit their ſtrength by uniting with others, and adopting the feeble remnants of ſuch as have ſuffered moſt ſeverely from the ſportſmen: ſo that about the end of
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:1084500102:375"/>
ſummer they often compoſe new coveys more numerous than at firſt, and which continue aſſociated till next year.</p>
                  <p>Theſe birds are fond of corn countries, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially where the fields are in high cultivation, and manured with marl; no doubt becauſe they find there abundance of food, both grain and inſects; and perhaps the ſaline quality of the marl, which contributes ſo much to the fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tility of the ſoil, is alſo ſuited to their conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution or taſte. Gray Partridges prefer the open country, and never reſort to copſes or vineyards, but when they are purſued by the fowler, or by the bird of prey: yet they do not lodge in the depths of the foreſts; and I have been frequently told that they never paſs the night among buſhes or thickets: however, a Partridge's neſt was found in a buſh at the root of a vine. They begin about the end of winter, after the intenſe froſts, to pair: that is, each male ſelects his female companion, and retires. But this new arrangement is not effected without violent diſputes among the males, and ſometimes even among the females. War and love are in moſt animals inſeparable, eſpecially among thoſe which, like the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridges, are ſtimulated by an ardent appetite. The females of this ſpecies, like the common hens, lay without having had intercourſe with the male. When the Partridges are once paired, they never part, but live in the cloſeſt and the
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:1084500102:376"/>
moſt faithful union. Sometimes, after they are paired, the weather grows ſevere, and then they all gather together, and again form the covey.</p>
                  <p>Gray Partridges ſeldom breed, at leaſt in France, before the end of March, above a month after they have begun to pair; and they do not lay before May, or even June, if the winter has laſted long. They make their neſt, in general, with little care or preparation: ſome graſs or ſtraw, ſtrewed roughly in the print of an ox or a horſe's foot, is all they require. It is obſerved, however, that the older and more experienced females take greater pains with their neſts than young ones, and are more careful both in guarding againſt inundation, and in chuſing a ſpot ſomewhat elevated and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected naturally by bruſh-wood. They gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally lay from fifteen to twenty eggs, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times twenty-five; but the number is much ſmaller when the bird is either very young or very old: ſuch too is the ſecond hatch made by Partridges of the proper age, when the firſt has been deſtroyed. The eggs are nearly of the ſame colour with thoſe of pigeons: Pliny ſays that they are white<note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <bibl>Lib. x. 3.</bibl>
                     </note>. The incubation laſts about three weeks, more or leſs according to the degree of heat of the ſeaſon.</p>
                  <p>The female takes upon herſelf the whole taſk of covering, and, during that time, ſhe under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goes
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:1084500102:377"/>
a conſiderable moult; for all the feathers of the belly drop. She ſits with great aſſiduity; and, it is ſaid, that ſhe never leaves her eggs without ſtrewing them with leaves. The male, attentive to his mate, generally ſettles near the neſt, ready to accompany her when ſhe riſes in queſt of food; and his attachment is ſo faithful and ſteady, that he prefers this laborious office to the free pleaſures which the calls of other Partridges ſolicit him to enjoy: to theſe he ſometimes replies, but never quits his ſtation to indulge his appetite. At the expiration of the regular time, if the ſeaſon be favourable and the incubation ſucceed, the chicks pierce the ſhell with great eaſe, and as ſoon as they have extri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated themſelves, they begin to run, carrying ſometimes a part of the ſhell with them. It happens ſometimes, however, that they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to burſt from their priſon, and that they die in the ſtruggle. In this caſe, the feathers of the young bird are found glued to the inner ſurface of the ſhell, which muſt happen when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the egg is expoſed to too great heat. To remedy this malady, dip the eggs five or ſix minutes in water, ſo that the moiſture may ſoak through the ſhell and looſen the feathers. This kind of bathing may alſo perhaps refreſh the young bird, and give it additional ſtrength to force a paſſage. The ſame happens with regard to pigeons, and many other uſeful birds, which
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:1084500102:378"/>
might be ſaved by the method I have deſcribed, or ſome analogous experiment.</p>
                  <p>The male, though it has no ſhare in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubation, aſſiſts the mother in raiſing the young. They lead them in common, continually call them together, point out to them their proper food, and teach them to find it by ſcratching the ground with their nails. It is not uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to diſcover them ſquatted beſide each other, covering the chickens with their wings, whoſe heads project on all ſides, preſenting very lively eyes. In ſuch caſe, the parents are not eaſily fluſhed; and the ſportſman, who is attentive to the preſervation of his game, avoids diſturbing ſo intereſting an office. But if the pointer comes too near, or runs in upon them, the male is always the firſt that ſprings, venting his anguiſh in a peculiar cry, and appropriated to this emergence. He ſtops thirty or forty paces diſtant, and ſometimes even he returns upon the dog and beats it with his wings,—to ſuch a degree does parental affection in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire courage in the moſt timid animals! Sometimes that tender ſentiment inſpires in theſe birds a ſort of prudence, and ſuggeſts ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedients for ſaving the brood. When the male ſprings in ſuch caſes, he has been obſerved to fly ſlowly, and hanging his wing, as if to decoy the enemy into a purſuit, in the expectation of an eaſy prey; while the bird keeps always be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, but at ſuch a ſhort diſtance as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:1084500102:379"/>
to afford hopes, till the ſportſman is carried away from the covey. On the other hand, the female ſprings ſhortly after the male, and ſhoots to a much greater diſtance, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>variably in a different direction. Immediately after ſhe has alighted, ſhe returns back running along the furrow, and finds her chickens ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered and ſquatted among the graſs and the leaves; haſtily collects them, and before the dog has returned from the eager purſuit of the male, ſhe has led them to a diſtant ſpot, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out giving the ſlighteſt notice to the ſportſman by the noiſe in retreating. It is an obſervation with reſpect to animals which holds very gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, that the ardor for copulation is the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the ſolicitude for their progeny. The Partridge is an inſtance: few birds are ſo amorous, and few diſcover ſuch an aſſiduous or ſuch bold vigilance for their young. This ſtrength of affection ſometimes degenerates into rancour, which the mother diſcovers to other coveys, purſuing them and tearing them with her bill.</p>
                  <p>The legs of the young Partridges are at firſt yellow, which colour grows lighter, running into white, and afterwards turns brown, and at laſt, when the bird is three or four years old, it deepens into black. This is a method of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering their age: another is drawn from the appearance of the laſt feather of the wing,
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:1084500102:380"/>
which is pointed after the firſt moult, but in the following year is quite round.</p>
                  <p>The firſt food of young Partridges is ants eggs, and the ſmall inſects which they find on the ground and among the herbage. Thoſe which are fed within doors refuſe grain for a long time, and probably this is not their proper aliment till they are grown up. They always prefer lettuce, ſuccory, chickweed, ſow-thiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, groundſel, and even the ſhoots of ſpring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing corn. In the month of November their ſtomach is found filled with that ſubſtance, and during the winter they learn to ſearch for the tender herbage beneath the ſnow. But when the ground is ſtiff with froſt, they reſort to the mild ſprings, and crop the herbs on their mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins, though not ſuited to their conſtitution.—In ſummer, they are never obſerved to drink.</p>
                  <p>Partridges are three months old when the red tint diſcovers itſelf; for the Gray Partridges alſo have red on the ſide of the temples between the eye and the ear, and its appearance is a critical period with theſe birds, as with all others in like caſes, ſince it advances the adult ſtate. Previous to this they are delicate, their wing feeble, and they dread the damps; but after they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered from the ſhock, they become hardy, and begin to ply their wings, to ſpring together and conſtantly keep company; and though the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey be diſperſed, they learn to aſſemble again, in ſpite of the precautions of the ſportſman.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="361" facs="tcp:1084500102:381"/>
They aſſemble by a call; every body knows the cry of the Partridge, which is not very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant; it is rather a ſharp grating noiſe like that of a ſcythe, than a warble. The mythologiſts, ſtruck with this reſemblance, metamorphoſed the inventor of that inſtrument into a Partridge<note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <bibl>Ovid's Metamorphoſes, Book viii.</bibl>
                     </note>. The note of the male differs not from the female, except in being louder and more drawling. The male is beſides diſtinguiſhed from the female by a blunt ſpur on each leg, and a black mark like a horſe-hoe under the belly, which is not found in the other ſex.</p>
                  <p>In this ſpecies, as in many others, there are more males hatched than females<note n="†" place="bottom">About a third more, according to Ray.</note>; and it is a matter of ſome conſequence to deſtroy the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernumerary males, which diſturb the pairs al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready formed and check multiplication. The common method of catching them is to call them in the pairing ſeaſon by means of a female, and the beſt for this purpoſe is one that has been taken old. The males flock to the female's voice, and fall into the fowler's ſnares. So head-long they ruſh into danger, as ſometimes to alight on houſes, or even on the ſhoulder of the bird-catcher. The moſt proper ſort of ſnares, and what are the leaſt liable to accidents, are a kind of large weel nets of a tunnel ſhape, into which the Partridges are driven by a perſon diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:1084500102:382"/>
like a cow, who, to aid the deception, holds in his hand one of the bells uſually faſtened to the necks of cattle<note n="*" place="bottom">Olina.</note>. After they are entangled in the lines, the ſupernumerary males are ſelected, and ſometimes even all the males are taken, and the females are ſet at liberty.</p>
                  <p>The Gray Partridges are ſedentary birds, which not only continue in the ſame country, but which ſtray as little as poſſible from the neighbourhood where they are bred, and they always return again. They fear much the bird of prey; when they perceive him, they crowd cloſe one upon another, but their formidable enemy diſcovers them from a diſtance, approaches them glancing along the ground, in order to ſpring one of which he may catch on the wing. Surrounded by ſo many enemies, and expoſed to ſo many dangers, we may naturally ſuppoſe that few will reach a great age. Some fix the period of their life at ſeven years, and aſſert that, in their ſecond year, they have attained their full vigour, and give over laying in the ſixth. Olina ſays, that they live twelve or fifteen years.</p>
                  <p>It has been tried to breed Partridges in parks, for the purpoſe of ſtocking grounds not inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited by them. The experiment has ſucceeded, and it has been found that they may be raiſed nearly the ſame way as Pheaſants, only no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence muſt be had on the eggs of domeſtic
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:1084500102:383"/>
Partridges. Seldom do they lay, when reduced to that ſtate, and ſtill ſeldomer do they pair and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulate; and they never have been obſerved to hatch in thoſe incloſures where the Pheaſants ſo readily breed. We muſt therefore ſearch in the fields for the eggs of free Partridges, and ſet them under common hens. A ſingle hen can hatch about two dozen and rear that number of young, which will follow this ſtranger as well as they would do their natural mother, but they are not ſo well acquainted with her voice. They become however familiarized to it in a certain degree, and the Partridge thus bred, retains through the reſt of its life the habit of calling when ſhe hears the clucking of hens.</p>
                  <p>The Gray Partridges are much leſs delicate to raiſe than the Red ſort, and not ſo ſubject to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, at leaſt in France, which it would ſeem is their congenial climate. It is unneceſſary even to give them ants eggs, and they may be fed like the common poultry on bread crumbs, hard eggs, &amp;c. When they have grown ſtout and begin to ſeek their food, they may be let looſe where they are bred, and from which place they never, as I have already noticed, remove to any great diſtance.</p>
                  <p>The fleſh of the Common Partridge has long been eſteemed delicious and wholeſome food. It has two properties which are ſeldom com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined; it is juicy, and yet not fat. Theſe birds have twenty-two quills in each wing, and

eighteen in the tail, of which the four mid-ones are of the ſame colour with the back<note n="*" place="bottom">Willughby.</note>.</p>
                  <p>The noſtrils, which are at the origin of the bill, are more than half covered with a ſcreen of the ſame colour with the bill, but of a ſofter ſubſtance, as in the common hens. The naked ſpace between the eye and the ear is of a brighter red in the male than the female.</p>

And indeed what proves decidedly this poſition, he does not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark the characteriſtic property of this bird, that its feet are feathered to the toes. With re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to Scaliger, he could not poſſibly confound theſe two ſpecies; becauſe in the ſame chapter where he ſpeaks of the White Partridge of which he had eaten, he a little afterwards diſcourſes at great length on the <hi>Lagopus</hi> of Pliny, whoſe feet are clothed with plumage, and which is the true Ptarmigan.</p>
                  <p>The Grayiſh White Partridge is by no means ſo white as the Ptarmigan; the ground only is of that colour, and is ſullied with the ſame ſpecks as in the Common Partridge, diſtributed in the ſame manner.

                  <p>This Partridge, deſcribed by Aldrovandus, is probably the ſmall migratory ſpecies, which has been obſerved at different times in ſeveral pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces of France.</p>
                  <p>It differs from the Gray Partridge not only in its ſize, which is always inferior, but by its bill, which is longer, by the yellow colour of its legs, and above all, the habit of changing its reſidence. It has been ſeen in Brie, and in other places, paſſing in numerous flocks, and purſuing its journey without halting. A game-keeper in the neighbourhood of Montbard ſaw laſt March (1770), a flight of one hundred and fifty or two hundred, which ſeemed to turn aſide and ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend their progreſs at the noiſe of the call, but were entirely gone the next day. This ſimple fact, which is undoubted, points out the analogy
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:1084500102:387"/>
and the difference between this ſpecies and the common ſort. Their being drawn by the call ſhewed their affinity; their rapid flight through a country equally ſuited to the Gray and Red Partridges, which both reſide in it the whole year, denotes another inſtinct, and conſequently another organization, and at leaſt another fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily.</p>
                  <p>We muſt not confound this Damaſcus or Syrian Partridge with the <hi>Syroperdix</hi> of Aelian, found in the vicinity of Antioch; whoſe plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage was black, the bill fulvous, the fleſh firmer and better flavoured, and the diſpoſition more ſavage than that of other Partridges: for the colours we ſee do not correſpond, and Aelian does not tell us that this <hi>Syroperdix</hi> is a bird of paſſage. He adds, as a ſingular circumſtance, that it ſwallows ſtones; which however is very common in the granivorous tribes. Scaliger mentions a remarkable fact, to which he was witneſs, and which bears ſome relation to the preſent; it is that in Gaſcony, where the land is very ſandy, their fleſh was mixed with minute particles, which was very diſagreeable. <note n="A" place="bottom">Specific character of the Damaſcus Partridge, <hi>Tetrao Damaſcenus:</hi>—<q rend="inline">It has a naked ſaffron ſpot under its eyes, its tail is ferruginous, its breaſt brown, its feet yellow.</q>

                  <p>I make this Partridge a diſtinct ſpecies, ſince it reſembles neither the Gray nor the Red ſort. It would be difficult to decide to which of theſe kinds we ought to refer it; for if, on the one hand, it be certain they ſometimes breed with Gray Partridges; on the other, their ordinary reſidence is on mountains; and the red colour of their bill and legs, alſo ſhews a cloſe relation to the Gray Partridge, and I am ſtrongly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to ſuſpect that they ſometimes even conſort with theſe. I am therefore perſuaded that it conſtitutes the intermediate ſpecies between theſe extremes; it is nearly the ſize of the Gray Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridge, and has twenty quills in the tail. <note n="A" place="bottom">Specific character of the Mountain Partridge, <hi>Tetrao Montanus:</hi>—<q rend="inline">Its feet and bill are red, its throat tawny-yellowiſh.</q>

                     </note>. This is reckoned ridiculous by Willughby; but I am inclined to think that he has been too haſty in paſſing judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for if we diſtinguiſh between the fact ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved and the intention implied, the aſſertion of Ariſtotle is literally true, and is nothing more than that the Partridge, like all the other females of the feathered race, is induſtrious to conceal her neſt; leſt the males, eſpecially the ſupernu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merary ones, ſeeking to copulate in the time of incubation, diſturb the function by the gratifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their appetites. For this reaſon it has always been recommended to deſtroy the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous males, as one of the moſt efficacious means of advancing the multiplication of the breed, not only of Partridges, but of other birds in the ſavage ſtate.</p>
                  <p>Ariſtotle adds, 2dly, That the female Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridge divides her eggs into two hatches, one of which ſhe entruſts to the male, until the young are educated<note n="†" place="bottom">
                        <bibl>

                     </note>. This is abſolutely incompatible with the propenſity to break the eggs, which he ſuppoſes to be implanted in the male. But if we would reconcile Ariſtotle with himſelf and with truth, we may ſay, that as the female does not lay all her eggs in the ſame ſpot; ſince ſhe cannot retain them, but allows them ſometimes to drop wherever ſhe happens to ſit; and as the male ſeems in this ſpecies, or at leaſt in ſome

families of this ſpecies, as in the gray ſort, to ſhare in the education of the young, it is not impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable but he alſo participates in the drudgery of incubation, and may cover a part of the eggs which were not under the hen.</p>
                  <p>Ariſtotle ſays, 3dly, That the males tread one another, and even their young as ſoon as they are able to walk<note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <bibl>Lib. ix. 8.</bibl>
                     </note>; and this aſſertion has been conſidered as fabulous and abſurd. I have how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever more than once had occaſion to mention undoubted inſtances of this perverſion of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct; and, among the Partridges, nature is ſo purient, that the male cannot hear the cry of the female without ſhedding <hi>ſemen</hi>; and ſo intoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated is he with pleaſure in the ſeaſon of love, that though commonly extremely ſhy, he ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures then to alight on the bird-catcher. How much more therefore would their ardour be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted in the warm climate of Greece, and when they had long been denied the company of their mates, as during the time of incubation?</p>
                  <p>Ariſtotle aſſerts, 4thly, That female Partridges conceive and produce eggs, when they happen to be fanned by wind from the males, or when theſe fly over them, or even when they hear their notes<note n="†" place="bottom">
                        <bibl>Lib. v. 5.</bibl>
                     </note>. Theſe words of the Grecian phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher have given occaſion to much ridicule; as if a current of air impregnated with the foecun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dating particles of the male, or the mere vibra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:1084500102:394"/>
impreſſed by his voice, were really ſufficient to impregnate the female. All that is inſinuated is, that in ſuch circumſtances the natural fire of their conſtitution blazes with new force; and for the ſame reaſon, weltering in the duſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the laying<note n="*" place="bottom">Ariſtotle adds a fact which evinces their ſalacious temperament; <q rend="inline">they alſo lay <hi>zephyrian</hi> or addle eggs, if the genital parts be ſtroked by the finger.</q>
                     </note>.</p>
                  <p>From theſe facts it is eaſy to conceive, that the Hen Partridge, though ſtrongly ſet on co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering, will ſometimes prefer the indulgence of appetite to the tedious duty of incubation. It may even happen that, when ſhe perceives her mate wavering in his fidelity, and about to yield to the allurements of other females, ſhe will offer the embrace, to ſecure the domeſtic har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, and provide for the proſperity of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected progeny<note n="†" place="bottom">Often the female riſes from her neſt when ſhe perceives her mate attending to a ſauntering female, and throwing herſelf into his embrace, ſatiates his appetite. <bibl>Ariſt. lib. ix. 18.</bibl>—So that luſt overcomes even the attachment to their brood. <bibl>Lib. x. 33.</bibl>

                  <p>Aelian has ſaid, that the males fight always with greater obſtinacy in preſence of the females; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, he adds, when thus circumſtanced, they will rather die, than ſhew cowardice, or appear after being vanquiſhed<note n="‡" place="bottom">

                     </note>. We muſt here too diſtinguiſh between the fact and the intention. It is certain that the ſight of the females adds fuel to their quarrels; not however becauſe it
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:1084500102:395"/>
piques their honour, but becauſe it inflames their appetite for enjoyment.</p>
                  <p>It is thus by diſtinguiſhing between actions and intentions, and rejecting crude ſuppoſitions which disfigure important facts, that we can often extract the truth from relations of animals, which have ſo much been deformed by the fictions of man, and the folly of aſcribing to all other beings his own character, his own feelings, and his own apprehenſions.</p>
                  <p>As the <hi>Bartavelles</hi> poſſeſs many properties in common with the Gray Partridges, we need only remark the chief differences. Belon, who had viſited their native climate, tells us, that they are double the ſize of our Partridges: that they are very plentiful, and even more common than any other bird in Greece, in the Archipelago iſlands, and particularly on the coaſts of the iſland of Crete (now Candia): that they call in the love ſeaſon, uttering a ſound like that of the word <hi>chacabis</hi>; whence the Latins have undoubtedly formed the term <hi>cacabare</hi> to denote that cry; and the ſame analogy might perhaps have had ſome ſhare in the conſtruction of the <hi>cubeth, cubata, cubeji,</hi> &amp;c. the names of the Red Partridge in the eaſtern languages.</p>
                  <p>Belon relates alſo, that the <hi>Bartavelles</hi> generally lodge in rocks, but that they come down into the plains to build their neſt, in order that their young may procure food with eaſe: that they lay from eight to ſixteen eggs, of the ſize of ſmall
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:1084500102:396"/>
hen eggs, white and ſprinkled with reddiſh points, and the yolk of which cannot be made hard. Laſtly, what he imagines ſhews the Greek Partridge to be of a different kind from our Red Partridge, is this, that in Italy, where both are known, they have each a diſtinct name, the Grecian ſort being called <hi>Cothurno,</hi> and the other <hi>Perdice</hi>; as if the vulgar who beſtow names could not be miſtaken, or even apply two different denominations to the ſame ſpecies. He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures alſo, and not without probability, that it is this large Partridge, which, according to Ariſtotle, croſſes with the ordinary hen and breeds prolific hybrids; a circumſtance which, as the Greek philoſopher remarks, rarely happens, and never but between the moſt ſalacious kinds<note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <bibl>

                  <p>Ariſtotle obſerves, that the male Partridges ſing or cry chiefly in the love ſeaſon, when they fight with each other, or even before they begin to quarrel<note n="‡" place="bottom">

                  <p>This is of an intermediate ſize between the <hi>Bartavelle</hi> and the Gray Partridge. It is not ſo common as the latter, nor does every climate ſuit it. It is found in moſt of the temperate and mountainous countries of Europe, Aſia, and Africa: it is rare in the Netherlands<note n="*" place="bottom">Aldrovandus.</note>, and in many parts of Bohemia and Germany, where the attempts to breed it have proved unſucceſsful, though the pheaſant thrives there<note n="†" place="bottom">Idem.</note>.

                  <p>The Red Partridges ſettle in mountains which abound with heath and buſhes, and ſometimes in the ſame mountains which are inhabited by the game improperly termed <hi>White Partridges</hi>; yet they prefer the lower and more hoſpitable tracts<note n="†" place="bottom">Stumpſius <hi>apud Geſn.</hi>
                     </note>. In winter, they confine the range of their excurſions, and lodge under the ſhelter of rocks with a ſouthern aſpect. During the reſt of the year they continue in the buſhes, and the ſportſmen can hardly drive them from their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treats. I am well informed that they can, better than the common Partridge, ſupport the rigours of winter, and are much more eaſily caught by gins or ſnares. They reſort every ſpring in nearly the ſame numbers to their favourite haunts. They feed on grain, herbs, ſlugs, caterpillars, ants' eggs, and other inſects; but their fleſh is often tainted with the ſmell of their aliments. Aelian relates that the Partridge of Cyrrha, a maritime town in Phocis, had a diſagreeable taſte, becauſe of their living on garlick.</p>
                  <p>They fly heavily and laboriouſly, like the gray ſort; and without ſeeing them, we may eaſily diſtinguiſh them by the noiſe merely which they make with their wings when they are fluſhed. When they are ſurpriſed on the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, they ſeek ſhelter among the precipices, and
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:1084500102:401"/>
when they are diſlodged, they regain the ſummit. In the plains, they ſhoot ſwiftly forward. When they are hotly purſued, they fly into the woods, and perch upon the trees, and ſometimes even burrow in the ground, which the Gray Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridge never does.</p>
                  <p>The Red Partridges are diſtinguiſhed from the Gray alſo by their natural habits and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions; they are not ſo ſocial: they form them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves indeed into coveys, but the union is not ſo complete or harmonious. Though hatched and bred together, the Red Partridges keep apart from each other: they do not ſpring at the ſame inſtant, they do not fly in the ſame di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and they do not call each other with the ſame eagerneſs, except in the love ſeaſon, and then even each pair forms a ſeparate union. Laſtly, When their paſſion is gratified, and the female begins coolly to cover her eggs, the male abandons to her the charge of raiſing the family. In this reſpect, our Red Partridges ſeem to differ from thoſe of Egypt; ſince the prieſts choſe as the emblem of domeſtic harmony, a pair of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridges, a male and a female, occupied each apart with its hatch<note n="*" place="bottom">Aldrovandus.</note>.</p>
                  <p>A conſequence of the ſavage diſpoſition of the Red Partridge, is that they are more difficult to breed in parks like the pheaſant, though the method is nearly the ſame. It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires more pains and attention to habituate
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:1084500102:402"/>
them to their captivity: nor are they ever com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely reconciled, ſince the young Partridges languiſh in their priſon, and though every expedient be tried to ſweeten their condition, would pine away or fall into ſome diſorder, if not ſet at liberty as ſoon as their feathers begin to ſhade their heads.</p>

numerous flocks have been ſeen that obeyed the voice of their conductor with
wonderful docility. Porphyry mentions a tame Partridge brought from Carthage,
which ran to call his maſter, fawned on him, and expreſſed its 
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:1084500102:403"/> fondneſs by certain articulations which ſeemed to
flow from ſentiment, and were entirely dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from its ordinary notes.
Mundella and Geſner raiſed ſome themſelves that grew very familiar. It
appears from ſeveral paſſages in ancient authors, that they had even
acquired the art of teaching them to ſing, or at leaſt to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove their
natural notes ſo much as to give a pleaſing ſort of warble<note n="*" place="bottom">Athenaeus.—Plutarch.—Aelian.</note>.</p>
                  <p>But all this may be reconciled, by ſaying that this bird has not ſo great averſion to man as abhorrence of ſlavery: that he has diſcovered the way to tame and ſubdue the moſt ſavage animal, that is, one the moſt enamoured of liberty; and that the method is to treat it according to its inſtinct, and to indulge it with as much freedom as poſſible. In this light, the ſociety of the tame Partridge with the perſon who directs its will, is the moſt engaging, and the moſt noble; founded not on its wants, its intereſts, or on a ſtupid ſerenity of temper, but bound by ſympathy, choice, and a mutual affection. The Partridge contracts a liking for man, and ſubmits to his inclinations, only when he allows it to leave him at pleaſure, and impoſes no reſtraint beyond what ſociety requires. In a word, when he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to reduce it to domeſtic ſlavery, its ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous nature revolts at the appearance of force; the loſs of liberty preys upon its vitals, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhes
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:1084500102:404"/>
the moſt powerful inſtincts, thoſe of love and of ſelf-preſervation. Sometimes, in the paroxyſms of its rage, it daſhes its head againſt the cage and expires. It diſcovers an invincible repugnance to propagation: and if ſometimes, ſtimulated by the ardour of temper, and the warmth of the ſeaſon, it copulates in confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, its embraces are too feeble to perpetuate a race of ſlaves. <note n="A" place="bottom">The Red Partridge is not found in England; but in France it is the moſt common of the genus.</note>

                     </note>. The Francolin which Olina figures and deſcribes, is the one of which I am to treat. That of Edwards differs from it in ſome reſpects,
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:1084500102:406"/>
and appears to be exactly the ſame bird with the Francolin of Tournefort, which alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembles that of Ferrara, ſince it is found on the ſea-coaſt, and in marſhy ſituations.</p>
                  <p>Ours ſeems to differ from theſe three laſt, and even from that of Briſſon, not only in the colour of its plumage, and even of its bill, but by the ſize and form of its tail, which is longer in Briſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon's figure, more ſpread in ours, and hanging in thoſe of Edwards and Olina. But notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this, I believe that the Francolin of Olina, that of Tournefort, that of Edwards, that of Briſſon, and my own, are all of the ſame ſpecies; ſince they have many common pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, and their ſmall differences are not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to conſtitute different races, but may be referred to the age, the ſex, the climate, and other local or accidental circumſtances.</p>
                  <p>The Francolin is undoubtedly, in many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, like the Partridges, and for this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, Olina, Linnaeus, and Briſſon, have ranged it with them. For my own part, I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, from a cloſe examination and compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of theſe two birds, that they ought to be ſeparated: for the Francolin differs from the Partridge not only in the colours of its plumage, its general ſhape, the figure of its tail, and its cry; but is diſtinguiſhed alſo by a ſpur on each leg<note n="*" place="bottom">That of Olina had none; but it was probably a female.</note>; whereas the male Partridge has only a callous tubercule.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="386" facs="tcp:1084500102:407"/>
The Francolin is alſo much leſs diffuſed than the Partridge; it can hardly ſubſiſt but in the warm climates. Spain, Italy, and Sicily, are almoſt the only countries of Europe where it is found; it inhabits alſo Rhodes<note n="*" place="bottom">Olina.</note>, the Iſle of Cyprus<note n="†" place="bottom">Tournefort.</note>, Samos<note n="‡" place="bottom">Edwards.</note>, Barbary, eſpecially in the vicinity of Tunis<note n="§" place="bottom">Olina.</note>, Egypt, the coaſts of Aſia<note n="‖" place="bottom">Tournefort.</note>, and Bengal<note n="¶" place="bottom">Edwards.</note>. In all theſe places, both Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colins and Partridges occur; but they have each their appropriated name, and form diſtinct ſpecies.</p>
                  <p>As theſe birds are very rare in Europe, and their fleſh is excellent food, the killing them has been forbidden in many countries under ſevere penalties; and hence, it is ſaid, they derive the name <hi>Francolin</hi>; becauſe they enjoy a ſort of freedom under the protection of theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibitions.</p>
                  <p>Little more can be ſaid of this bird than what the figure ſuggeſts: its plumage is very beautiful; it has a conſpicuous collar of an orange colour. It is rather larger than the Common Partridge; the female is ſmaller than the male; the colours of its plumage fainter and leſs variegated.</p>
                  <p>Theſe birds feed on grain; and they may be bred in aviaries, though care muſt be taken to give each a ſmall ſeparate crib, where it may
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:1084500102:408"/>
ſquat and conceal itſelf, and to ſtrew ſand and a little gravel on the floor.</p>
                  <p>Their cry is a kind of loud whiſtle, audible at a great diſtance<note n="*" place="bottom">Olina.</note>.</p>
                  <p>Francolins live much in the ſame manner as Partridges<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>; their fleſh is exquiſite, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times preferred to that of Partridges or Phea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants.</p>
                  <p>Linnaeus takes the Damaſcus Partridge of Willughby for the Francolin<note n="‡" place="bottom">Tenth edition of the <bibl>

                     </note>. But we may obſerve, 1ſt, That this Damaſcus Partridge is rather Belon's, who firſt took notice of it, and whom Willughby only copied. 2dly, This bird differs from the Francolin, both in the ſize, which is inferior to that of the Common Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridge, according to Belon; and in its plumage, as will eaſily be perceived by comparing the figures; and beſides, its legs are feathered, which prevented Belon from claſſing it with the plovers. Linnaeus ſhould alſo have admitted the Francolin of Tournefort as the ſame with that of Olina, which Willughby mentions. Laſtly, the Swediſh naturaliſt is miſtaken in fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing excluſively on the Eaſt as the climate of the Francolin; for, as I have already obſerved, it is found in Sicily, Italy, Spain, and Barbary, and in many other countries to which the epithet of oriental cannot be applied.</p>

Ariſtotle ranges the <hi>Attagen,</hi> which Belon conceives to be the Francolin, among the pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verulent and granivorous birds. Belon makes him alſo ſay, that it lays a great number of eggs, though no mention of this ſort is made in the place quoted; but it is the neceſſary conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of Ariſtotle's theory with regard to pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verulent granivorous birds. Belon relates, on the authority of the ancients, that the Franco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin was common in the plain of Marathon, being fond of marſhy ſituations; which agrees very well with Tournefort's obſervations re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting the Francolins at Samos. <note n="A" place="bottom">Specific character of the <hi>Tetrao Francolinus:</hi>—<q rend="inline">Its belly and throat are black, its tail wedge-ſnaped.</q>

Theſe birds, indeed, reſemble each other conſiderably: they are both pulverulent; they have ſhort wings and tail, and run very ſwiftly; their bill is like that of the gallinaceous tribe; their plumage is gray, ſpeckled with brown, and ſometimes entirely white<note n="†" place="bottom">

re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance, they are balanced by an almoſt equal number of diſparities,
which make the Quails a ſpecies entirely diſtinct from the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridges.
For, 1. The Quails are univerſally ſmaller than the Partridges, comparing
corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponding breeds. 2. They have not the bare ſpace between the eyes, as
in the Partridges, nor the figure of the horſe-ſhoe impreſſed on the
breaſt of the males, nor have true Quails the bill and legs ever red. 3. The
eggs are ſmaller, and of an entirely different colour. 4. Their notes alſo
are quite different, though they love in nearly the ſame ſeaſon; but the
Partridges intimate their rage before they fight, while the Quails ſcream
only in the midſt of their quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels<note n="*" place="bottom">

of a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent taſte, and much more loaded with fat. 6. The period of their
life is much ſhorter. 7. They are leſs cunning than the Partridge, and much
more eaſily enſnared, eſpecially when young and unexperienced. Their
diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions are not ſo gentle; it is extremely rare to ſee them
tamed, and though confined from their infancy, they can hardly be trained to
obey the voice. They are not of ſuch a ſocial temper; for they ſeldom
form themſelves into coveys, except when their wants unite the feeble family
to their mother, or ſome common and powerful cauſe urges at once the whole
ſpecies <pb n="398" facs="tcp:1084500102:420"/> to aſſemble together, and traverſe the
extent of the ocean, holding their courſe to the ſame diſtant land. But
this forced aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation ſubſiſts no longer than neceſſity
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires; and after they have alighted, and find in their adopted country that
they can live at will, their union diſſolves. The appetite of love is the
only tie that binds them together, and even this connection is unſtable and
mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary; for though the male ſeeks the female with the greateſt ardour,
he diſcovers no choice or predilection; the matches are formed haſtily, and
as quickly broken. As ſoon as paſſion has ſpent its force, the male
treats his mate with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference and cruelty, and abandons her to the labour
and care of raiſing the family. The young are hardly grown up when they
ſeparate, or if they are kept together, they fight obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately with each
other; their quarrels are ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated only by their mutual deſtruction<note n="*" place="bottom">The ancients were well acquainted with this fact, for they ſaid

               <p>The propenſity of the Quails to migrate at certain ſeaſons, is one of their moſt powerful inſtincts.</p>
               <p>The cauſe of this deſire muſt be very gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, for it acts not only on the whole ſpecies, but alſo on individuals kept in confinement and debarred from communication with their kind. Some young Quails, bred in cages from their
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:1084500102:421"/>
earlieſt infancy, which had never enjoyed liberty, and therefore could not feel its loſs, were yet obſerved, for the ſpace of four years, to ſhew a degree of reſtleſſneſs, and to flutter with unuſual agitations, regularly at the ſeaſon of migration, which returns twice annually, in April and in September. This uneaſineſs laſted thirty days each time, and began conſtantly an hour before ſun-riſe. The priſoners moved backward and forward from one end of the cage to the other, and darted againſt the net which covered it, and often with ſuch violence, that they dropped down ſtunned by the blow. They paſſed the night in theſe fruitleſs ſtruggles, and the following day they appeared dejected, exhauſted, and torpid. We know alſo that, in the ſtate of liberty, Quails ſleep the greater part of the day: and if to this we add, that they are ſeldom obſerved to arrive in the day-time, we may infer, that they perform their journies by night<note n="*" place="bottom">Belon and Pliny expreſs the ſame opinion.</note>, and that the diſpoſition to migrate is innate: whether that avoiding the extremes of heat and cold, they remove to the north in ſummer, and advance to the ſouth in winter; or what is more probable, that they direct their courſe to thoſe countries where the harveſt is making, and thus change their abode to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the proper ſubſiſtence for themſelves and for their young.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="400" facs="tcp:1084500102:422"/>
This laſt reaſon, I ſay, is the moſt probable; for, on the one hand, it is proved by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that Quails can well ſupport cold; ſince Horrebow informs us that they have been found in Iceland; and they have been kept for years together in a room without fire, and having even a northern aſpect, and yet ſeemed not in the leaſt affected by the ſevereſt winters. On the other hand, it appears, that one circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance which determines them to abide in a country, is the plenty of herbage; for it is well known by ſportſmen, that when the ſpring is dry, and conſequently graſs ſcarce, there are few Quails the reſt of the year. Beſides, the ſpur of actual want is a more powerful cauſe, is more conſiſtent with the limited inſtinct of theſe ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, and implies leſs foreſight, which philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers have rather been too liberal in beſtowing on brutes. When they cannot procure ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence in one country, it is very natural to ſuppoſe that they will ſeek it in another. This ſcarcity of food intimates to them their ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and rouſes all their faculties into action. They leave the exhauſted tract, riſe into the regions of air, and puſh forward to diſcover countries which may preſent them with abund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. Habit joining itſelf to the inſtinct com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all animals, but moſt remarkable in the winged tribes, of ſcenting their food from a
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:1084500102:423"/>
diſtance, gives birth to a diſpoſition which is as it were innate; it is not therefore ſurpriſing that the ſame Quails ſhould return annually to the ſame haunts. But we can hardly ſuppoſe with Ariſtotle, that it is from an attentive ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the ſeaſons, and that they change their climate twice a-year, like the ancient kings of Perſia. It will be ſtill more difficult to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, with Cateſby and Belon, and ſome others, that when they ſhift their reſidence, they wing their courſe without interruption to the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>podes, there to find exactly the ſame latitude, and to enjoy the ſame temperature; which would imply ſcientific knowledge, or rather error, to which brute inſtinct is much leſs ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject than cultivated reaſon.</p>
               <p>But whatever ſpeculations we may form with reſpect to the migration of the Quails, certain it is, that when they enjoy their natural liberty they depart and return at ſtated times. They left Greece according to Ariſtotle, in the month <hi>Boedromion</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">

                  </note>, which comprehended the end of Auguſt and the beginning of September. In Sileſia, they arrive in the month of May, and depart about the end of Auguſt<note n="†" place="bottom">Schwenckfeld.</note>. Our ſportſmen reckon on their return to France about the tenth or twelfth of May. Aloyſius Mundella ſays, that they begin to appear in the neighbourhood of Venice about the middle of
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:1084500102:424"/>
April. Olina fixes the time of their arrival in the <hi>Campagna di Roma</hi> in the beginning of April. But almoſt all agree that they depart after the firſt autumnal froſt, which ſpoils the graſs and deſtroys the inſects; and ſince the colds of May do not drive them back to the ſouth, we are furniſhed with another proof that warmth is not what they ſeek, but that their real object is food, and of which the ſpring froſts cannot deprive them. We muſt not however conſider theſe terms as invariably fixed. They will vary within certain limits in different coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries according to the nature of the climate; and even in the ſame region, they will be affected by the lateneſs or earlineſs of the ſeaſon, which will advance or retard the harveſt, and will promote or check the multiplication of the inſects which ſupport the Quails.</p>
               <p>Both the ancients and the moderns have been buſy in forming theories with regard to the migration of the Quail and other birds of paſſage; ſome have heightened it by the addition of the marvellous; while others, ſtruck with the difficulty of conceiving that ſo ſmall a bird, and which flies tardily and laboriouſly, could perform diſtant journies, have heſitated to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the fact, and have had recourſe to hypotheſes ſtill more extraordinary to account for their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular diſappearance at certain ſtated ſeaſons. None of the ancients ever entertained indeed the ſlighteſt doubt on the ſubject: and yet they
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:1084500102:425"/>
well knew that the Quail is inactive, flies little and with reluctance<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <bibl>Ariſtotle, <hi>Hiſt. Anim.</hi> lib. viii. 8.</bibl>

This abſurdity was reſerved for ſome moderns, who certainly did not know that the internal heat of animals ſubject to become torpid, being generally inferior to that of other qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drupeds, and ſtill more to that of birds, requires a conſtant acceſſion of warmth from the air, as I have ſhewn in another work: when this ſource fails, the vital action is ſuſpended; and, if they were expoſed to a greater cold, they would in a ſhort time periſh. But this certainly is not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable to the Quails, which are generally eſteemed of a hotter conſtitution than the other birds; ſo that in France it has given riſe to a proverb<note n="†" place="bottom">It is a common ſaying, <hi>Chaud comme un Caille,</hi> warm as a Quail.</note>; and in China, it is cuſtomary to carry this bird alive in one's hands to keep them

                  </note>. Beſides, I have diſcovered from obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations continued for ſeveral years, that they never grow torpid, though ſhut during the whole winter in rooms without a fire, and expoſed to the north, as I have formerly mentioned: and many perſons of the moſt undoubted veracity, who had ſimilar opportunities, have aſſured me of the ſame fact. But, if the Quails neither conceal themſelves nor remain torpid through the winter, and always diſappear in that ſeaſon, we may certainly conclude that they migrate into other countries.—And this fact is demonſtrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a great number of other authorities.</p>
               <p>Belon, happening in autumn to be on board a veſſel, in his paſſage from Rhodes to Alexandria, ſaw Quails flying from the north towards the ſouth. Many of them were caught by the mariners, and grains of wheat were found very entire in their craw. The preceding ſpring, the ſame obſerver ſaw in ſailing from the iſland of Zante to the Morea, a great number of them in motion from ſouth to north; and he affirms that, in Europe as well as Aſia, Quails are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally migrating birds.</p>
               <p>The Commander Godeheu conſtantly ſaw them paſſing Malta in the month of May, aided by certain winds, and again in September in their return<note n="†" place="bottom">

                  </note>. Many ſportſmen have aſſured me,
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:1084500102:427"/>
that they have often, in the fine nights during ſpring, heard them arrive, and could eaſily diſtinguiſh their cry, though at a great height in the air. Add to this, that they are no where ſo plenty as on the French coaſts, oppoſite to Africa or Aſia, and in the interjacent iſlands. Almoſt all thoſe of the Archipelago and even the ſhelves, are, according to Tournefort, covered with them, in certain times of the year; and more than one of thoſe iſlands has been named <hi>Ortygia</hi>

In the age of Varro, it was remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that at the ſeaſons of the arrival and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture of the Quails, immenſe flocks were ſeen in the iſlets of Pontia, Pandataria, and others ſcattered along the ſouthern coaſt of Italy<note n="†" place="bottom">

                  </note>, and which they probably choſe for a ſtation to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruit. About the beginning of autumn, ſuch great numbers were caught in the iſland of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prea, in the entrance of the Gulph of Naples, that the biſhop of the iſland drew his princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal revenue from the profits of the game, and was for that reaſon called <hi>The Biſhop of Quails.</hi> Many too are caught in the neighbourhood of Peſaro, which is ſituated on the Adriatic Gulf, about the end of autumn, the ſeaſon of their arrival<note n="‡" place="bottom">Aloyſius Mundella, <hi>apud Geſnerum.</hi>
                  </note>. Laſtly, ſuch amazing numbers drop
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:1084500102:428"/>
on the weſtern coaſts of the kingdom of Naples, in the vicinity of <hi>Nettuno,</hi> that in the extent of four or five miles, ſometimes a hundred thouſand are taken in a day, and are ſold for fifteen <hi>jules</hi> the hundred (leſs than ſeven ſhillings), to a ſort of brokers who carry them to Rome, where they are much leſs common<note n="*" place="bottom">Geſner and Aldrovandus. This capture is ſo lucrative, that land near the place is extravagantly high priced.</note>. Clouds of them alſo alight in the ſpring on the coaſts of Provence, eſpecially on the lands belonging to the biſhop of Frejus, which border on the ſea; they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted, it is ſaid, with the fatigue of their jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, that for the firſt days they may be caught with the hand.</p>
               <p>But it will ſtill be replied, how can a bird ſo ſmall, ſo weak, whoſe flight is ſo ſlow and labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, how can it, though urged by hunger, tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe the great extent of ſea? I may admit that many iſlands are ſcattered at intervals in their paſſage, on which they may halt to recruit their vigour: ſuch as Minorca, Corſica, Sardinia, Sicily, Malta, Rhodes, and other iſles in the Archipelago. But ſtill I conceive that it would be impoſſible for them to perform the journey without aſſiſtance. Ariſtotle was well convinced that this was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, and was even acquainted with the kind of aid which the Quails moſt commonly received; and if he was miſtaken, it is only in deſcribing the manner. <q rend="inline">When the north wind blows,

the Quails, (ſays he,) perform their journey with eaſe; but when the ſouth wind prevails, as it oppreſſes them with the load of its vapours, they make a painful progreſs, and declare their labour and exertion, by the cries which they utter in their flight<note n="*" place="bottom">

               <p>M. Godeheu has well remarked, that in the ſpring, the Quails never alight on Malta, except when they are carried by a north-weſt wind, which hinders them from gaining Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vence; and that in their return, they are wafted to that iſland by the ſouth wind, which oppoſes their deſcent on the Barbary ſhore<note n="‡" place="bottom">

them one after another, when they have croſſed the ſea. This is nothing
more than bits of gravel which the Quails, like other granivorous birds,
ſwallow with their food. In general, ſuch a degree of deſign, ſagacity,
and diſcernment, is aſcribed to them, as would <pb n="409" facs="tcp:1084500102:431"/> give
room to doubt if thoſe who are ſo liberal in beſtowing theſe qualities,
really poſſeſs a large ſhare themſelves. They have remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that
other migratory birds, as the Land Rail, accompany the Quails, and that the
Falcon was ſure to catch ſome one on its arrival; hence they have concluded
that the Quails chooſe out from another ſpecies a guide or chief, which
they call <hi>The King of the Quails (ortygrometra)</hi>; for as the foremoſt
of the body falls a victim to the hawk, the Quails ſhrewdly contrive to
caſt the danger upon the fated individual of a foreign race.</p>
               <p>But the Quails do not all migrate; there are a few which, being unable to follow the reſt, remain behind; either having received a wound in their wings, or, being the product of the ſecond hatch, they are too young and feeble to perform the journey.

                  </note>. In France the number of theſe is very inconſiderable; but the Author of the Britiſh Zoology aſſures us, that in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land a part only of the Quails are obſerved to quit the iſland entirely, while thoſe which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main ſhift their quarters, removing from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior counties to the ſea coaſt, and particularly to the hundreds of Eſſex, where they continue through the winter: if the froſt or ſnow drive
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:1084500102:432"/>
them from the ſtubble fields or marſhes, they retreat to the beach, and ſubſiſt upon the marine plants, which they can pick up between high and low water mark. The ſame Author ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joins, that the time of their appearance in Eſſex correſponds exactly to that of their leaving the inland country. It is likewiſe ſaid, that a great number of them remain in Spain and in the ſouth of Italy, when the winter is not ſo ſevere as entirely to deſtroy the ſeeds and inſects that ſerve for their food.</p>
               <p>With reſpect to ſuch as venture to croſs the ſeas, thoſe only perform a fortunate voyage that are aſſiſted by a fair wind; and if in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding ſeaſon it has ſeldom blown from a favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able quarter, much fewer arrive in the countries where they ſpend their ſummer. And, in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, we may judge with tolerable accuracy of the place whence they have come, by the direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the breeze which wafts them along.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as the Quails arrive, they ſet about lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. They do not pair, as I have already re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked; and if the number of males, as I am informed, exceeds much that of the females, monogamy would have been inconvenient. Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, confidence, perſonal attachment, qualities ſo deſirable in the individual, would have been hurtful in the ſpecies. The multitude of males reduced to a ſtate of celibacy, would diſturb the marriages that are formed, and render them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prolific.
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:1084500102:433"/>
But in the preſent caſe, the unbounded liberty of union blunts and extinguiſhes the jealouſy and the rivalſhip of their loves. The male has been obſerved to repeat a dozen times a-day his embraces with ſeveral females in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcriminately<note n="*" place="bottom">Aldrovandus and Schwenckfeld,</note>; and while nature tolerates this kind of libertiniſm, ſhe provides for the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplication of the ſpecies. Each female drops fifteen or twenty eggs into a neſt, which ſhe hollows in the ground with her claws, lines with graſs and leaves, and conceals as much as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible from the piercing eye of the hawks. Theſe eggs are greyiſh, ſpeckled with brown. She ſits about three weeks. The ardor of the males effectually fecundates them, and they are ſeldom found addle.</p>
               <p>The Authors of the Britiſh Zoology ſay, that in England the Quails ſeldom lay more than ſix or ſeven eggs. If this fact be uniform, we may conclude that they are leſs prolific in that iſland than in France, Italy, &amp;c.; and it remains to be inquired whether this diminution of the genial powers ought to be attributed to the cold, or ſome other quality of the climate.</p>
               <p>The young Quails are able to run almoſt as ſoon as they leave the ſhell, like the young Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridges; but they are in many reſpects more hardy, ſince in the ſtate of liberty they quit their mother much earlier, and even venture to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend

on themſelves for ſubſiſtence eight days after they are hatched. This circumſtance has made ſome perſons ſuppoſe that the Quail lays twice a year<note n="*" place="bottom">Aldrovandus aſſerts, that the Quails begin to lay the ſame year they are hatched, in the month of Auguſt, and have ten eggs.</note>; but I much doubt it, except they have been diſturbed in their firſt hatch. It is not even affirmed that they begin an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other after they have arrived in Africa in the month of September, though this would be much more probable, ſince on account of their regular migrations they are unacquainted with autumn and winter, and the year to them conſiſts of two ſprings and two ſummers: and they change their climate, it might ſeem, to enjoy and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuate the ever verdant ſeaſon of love and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation.</p>
               <p>Certain it is, that they drop their feathers twice a year, in the end of winter and on the approach of autumn. Each moulting laſts a month; and as ſoon as their plumage is reſtored, they wing their paſſage, if at liberty, into other climes; and if they are kept in confinement, they diſcover a reſtleſſneſs and ſtruggle to burſt from their priſon at the ſtated periods of migration.</p>
               <p>When the young are four months old, they are able to accompany their parents in their diſtant flight.</p>
               <p>The female differs from the male in being ſomewhat larger, according to Aldrovandus

The Quail, like the Partridge and many other animals, never multiplies its kind, except when it enjoys the liberty of nature. In vain have the forlorn priſoners been furniſhed with the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials for conſtructing their neſts; the tendereſt concerns are ſtifled in their breaſt, and their eggs are allowed to drop unheeded.</p>
               <p>Many fooliſh ſtories have been told with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the generation of Quails. It has been ſaid that, like the Partridges, they are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnated by the wind; this means no more than that they ſometimes lay without the male in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <bibl>Ibidem.</bibl>
                  </note>. It has been alleged that they are bred from the tunnies, which the troubled ocean ſometimes caſts on the ſhores of Lybia; that they appear at firſt like worms, then aſſume the form of flies, and gradually growing larger, they become graſshoppers, and at laſt Quails<note n="†" place="bottom">Geſner.</note>: that is, the vulgar ſeeing the Quails ſearching among the carcaſes of the tunnies rejected by the waves for ſome inſects that are hatched in them, and having ſome vague idea of the metamorphoſes which inſects undergo, fancied that a graſshopper could be transformed into a Quail, as a worm is changed into a fly. Laſtly, it has been ſaid, that the male copulates with the female toad<note n="‡" place="bottom">Phanodemus <hi>apud Geſnerum.</hi>
                  </note>; a ſtory which has not even the ſlighteſt appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of probability.</p>

                  <pb n="415" facs="tcp:1084500102:439"/>
The Quails feed on wheat, millet, hemp-ſeed, green herbage, inſects, and all ſorts of ſeed, even that of the hellebore; which gave the antients an antipathy to its fleſh, augmented ſtill further by the reflection that theſe were the only animals beſides man that are ſubject to the epilepſy<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <bibl>Pliny, lib. x. 23.</bibl>
                  </note>. But experience has deſtroyed this prejudice.</p>
               <p>In Holland, where theſe birds are frequent, eſpecially along the coaſts, it is uſual to call the berries of Bryony Quail-berries; which ſhews that they prefer that ſort of food<note n="†" place="bottom">Hadrian. Jun. <hi>Nomenclat.</hi>
                  </note>.</p>
               <p>It would appear that they can ſubſiſt without drink; for ſportſmen have aſſured me, that they are never obſerved to ſeek water; and others, that they have fed them a whole year on dry grain without any drink, though they frequently drank when it was in their power. To with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw every kind of drink, is even the only way to cure them when they <hi>caſt out their water</hi>; that is, when they are attacked by a certain diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper, in which they have always a drop at the point of their bill.</p>
               <p>Some have imagined, that they always trouble the water before they drink, and they have not failed to aſcribe it to envy; for naturaliſts are never ſatisfied till they aſſign to brutes the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of action. They inhabit the fields, the paſture grounds, and the vineyards; but ſeldom
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:1084500102:440"/>
reſort to the woods, and never perch upon trees. They grow much fatter than Partridges. What is ſuppoſed to contribute to this, is their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining ſtill during the greateſt part of the heat of the day; then they conceal themſelves in the talleſt graſs, and ſometimes continue in the ſame ſpot for the ſpace of four hours, lying on their ſide, with their legs extended; and ſo much are they overcome with the drowſy indolence, that a dog muſt abſolutely run upon them before they are fluſhed.</p>
               <p>It is ſaid that they live only four or five years, and Olina attributes the ſhortneſs of the term to their diſpoſition to corpulency. Artemidorus imputes it to their unhappy quarrelſome temper; and ſuch is really their character, for they have been made to fight in public to entertain the rabble. Solon even directed that ſuch combats ſhould be exhibited to the youth, with the view to inflame their courage. And this ſpecies of gymnaſtic exerciſe, which would appear to us ſo puerile, muſt have been held in high eſtimation by the Romans, and conſidered as an affair of the ſtate, ſince we are told that Auguſtus puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a prefect of Egypt with death, for buying and bringing to table one of theſe birds that had acquired celebrity by its victories. Even at preſent this ſort of amuſement is common in ſome cities of Italy. They give two Quails high feeding; and then place them oppoſite to each
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:1084500102:441"/>
other, at the ends of a long table, and throw be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them a few grains of millet ſeed (for they need a ground of quarrel). At firſt they ſhew a threatening aſpect, and then ruſh on like light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, ſtrike with their bills, erecting the head and riſing upon their ſpurs, and fight till one yields the field of battle<note n="*" place="bottom">Aldrovandus.</note>. Formerly, theſe combats were performed between a Quail and a man: the Quail was put into a large box, and ſet in the middle of a circle traced on the floor; the man ſtruck it on the head with one finger, or plucked ſome feathers from it: if the Quail, in defending itſelf, did not paſs the limits of the circle, its maſter gained the wager; but if in its fury it tranſgreſſed the bounds, its worthy antagoniſt was declared victor; and ſuch Quails as often won the prize ſold very dear<note n="†" place="bottom">

               <p>Since the Quail is accuſtomed to migrate, and travels to immenſe diſtances by the aid of the wind, it is eaſy to conceive that it muſt be ſpread through a wide extent.

                  <p>This bird is not much larger than our Quail, reſembles it exactly in the colours of its plumage, and pipes at intervals; but it is diſtinguiſhed by many notable differences.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="424" facs="tcp:1084500102:448"/>
1. Its note is very deep, and very ſtrong, and pretty much like the ſort of lowing of the bittern, ingulphing its bill in the marſhes<note n="*" place="bottom">The Hollanders call this lowing <hi>Pittoor,</hi> according to Bontius.</note>.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Its diſpoſition is ſo gentle that it can be tamed to the ſame degree as our domeſtic fowls.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is remarkably affected by cold; it ceaſes to pipe, and its active powers are ſuſpended, in the abſence of the ſun. As ſoon as he has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended into the weſt, it retires into ſome hole, and ſpends the night enveloped in its wings; but when the ſtar of day again beams upon the earth, it riſes from its lethargy, and celebrates his return with joyous notes, that awaken the whole houſe<note n="†" place="bottom">Bontius ſays, that he kept one in a cage for the expreſs pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of rouzing him in the morning: in fact their firſt calls an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce always the riſing of the ſun.</note>. Alſo, when kept in a cage, if it has not the ſun conſtantly, or if the cage is not covered with a coat of ſand upon linen cloth to retain the heat, it will pine away and ſoon die.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Its inſtinct is different; for, according to Bontius's account, it is very ſocial, and goes in companies. Bontius adds, that he found it in the foreſts on the iſland of Java; but our Quails live ſolitary, and are never found in the woods.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Its bill is ſomewhat longer.</p>

This ſpecies has however one point of ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy to our Quail, and to many others; to wit, the males fight each other with exceſſive rancour, and deſiſt not till one is killed.—But this cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance is not a ſufficient foundation for ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranging it with theſe, and I have therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed on it a diſtinct name. <note n="A" place="bottom">Specific character of the <hi>Tetrao Suſcitator:</hi>—<q rend="inline">It is varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated with yellowiſh, rufous, black, and gray; its bill longer.</q>

                  <head>I. The COLINS.</head>
                  <p>THE Colins are Mexican birds, which have rather been mentioned than deſcribed by Fernandez<note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <bibl>

                     </note>; and thoſe who have copied that author on this ſubject have committed ſome miſtakes, which it will be proper to correct.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Nieremberg<note n="†" place="bottom">
                        <bibl>
                           <hi>Joan Euſeb. Nirembergi Hiſtoria Naturae maxime Peregrinae,</hi> lib. x. cap. lxxii. p. 232.</bibl>
                     </note>, who profeſſes to take his accounts entirely from others, and who in this place borrows from Fernandez, takes no notice of the <hi>Cacacolin</hi> of chap. cxxxiv. though that bird is of the ſame ſpecies with the Colins.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Fernandez ſpeaks of two <hi>Acolins,</hi> or Water-Quails, in chap. x. and cxxxi.; Nie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remberg mentions the former, and very improper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, after the Colins; ſince it is a water-bird, as well as the one of chap. cxxxi. which he totally omits.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="427" facs="tcp:1084500102:451"/>
Thirdly, He takes notice of the <hi>Occolin</hi> of chap. lxxxv. of Fernandez, which is a Mexican Partridge, and conſequently nearly related to the Colins, which are alſo Partridges, as we ſhall ſee.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Ray ſtill copying Nieremberg, on the ſubject of the <hi>Coyolcozque</hi> varies the expreſſion, and in my opinion alters the meaning of the paſſage; for Nieremberg ſays, that this Coyol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cozque is like the Quails ſo called by us <hi>Spaniards,</hi> (which are certainly the Colins,) and concludes with telling that this is a ſpecies of the Spaniſh Partridge. But Ray makes him ſay that it is like the European Quails, and ſuppreſſes the words <hi>eſt enim ſpecies perdicis Hiſpanicae</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">i. e. <hi>For it is a ſpecies of Spaniſh Partridge.</hi>
                     </note>; yet theſe laſt words are eſſential, and contain the real notion of Fernandez with regard to the ſpecies to which theſe birds muſt be referred; ſince, in chap. xxxix. which is occupied entirely on the Colins, he ſays that the Spaniards call them <hi>Quails,</hi> becauſe they reſemble the European Quails, though they certainly belong to the genus of Partridges. It is true, that he repeats in the ſame chapter, that all the Colins are referred to the Quails; but, in ſpite of this confuſion, it is eaſy to ſee that when the author beſtows on the Colins the name of <hi>Quails,</hi> he ſpeaks after the vulgar, who are guided in applying epithets by the general appearances, and that his more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curate
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:1084500102:452"/>
opinion was, that they are ſpecies of the Partridge. I ſhould therefore have had reaſon, from the authority of Fernandez, the only ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver who has had an opportunity of viewing theſe birds, to place the Colins next the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridges; but I have rather choſen to yield as much as poſſible to the common opinion, which is not altogether groundleſs, of ranging them after the Quails, as being related to both theſe kinds of birds.</p>
                  <p>According to Fernandez, the Colins are very common in New Spain; their muſic reſembles much that of our Quails; their fleſh is excellent, and proper even for ſick people when kept ſome days. They feed on grain, and are commonly kept in a cage; which would make one believe that they are different from our Quails, and even our Partridges.—We ſhall in the following articles take notice of their ſeveral kinds.</p>

                  <p>I have ſoftened the Mexican word <hi>Coyolcozque</hi> into this name. This bird, in its cry, its ſize, its habits, its manner of living and of flying, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembles the other Colins, but differs from them in its plumage. Fulvous mixed with white, is
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:1084500102:455"/>
the prevailing colour of the upper ſide of the body, and fulvous alone that of the under ſide and of the legs: the top of the head is black and white, and two bars of the ſame colour deſcend from the eyes upon the neck: it inhabits the cultivated fields.—Such is what Fernandez re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, and Briſſon muſt have read the account with little attention, or rather copied Ray, when he tells us that the Coyolcos is like our Quail in its cry, flight, &amp;c.; while Fernandez expreſsly ſays, that it is analogous to the Quails, ſo called by the vulgar, that is to the Colins, and is really a ſpecies of the Partridges<note n="*" place="bottom">

                  <p>Friſch gives (Pl. CXIII.) the figure of a bird, which he calls <hi>The Small Hen of the foreſts of America,</hi> and which, according to him, reſembles
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:1084500102:456"/>
the Wood Grous in its bill, legs, and general form; its legs however are not feathered, nor are its toes edged with indentings, nor its eyes decorated with red orbits, as we may ſee from the figure. Briſſon, who conceives this bird to be the ſame with the <hi>Colenicuiltic</hi> of Fernandez, has ranged it among the Quails, by the name of <hi>Louiſiana Quail,</hi> and gives a figure of it. But comparing the figures or the deſcriptions of Briſſon, Friſch, and Fernandez, I find greater differences than could occur in the ſame bird; for not to mention the colours of the plumage, ſo difficult to paint in deſcription, and ſtill leſs the attitude, which is but too arbitrary, I obſerve that the bill and the legs are large and yellowiſh, according to Friſch; red and moderate ſized, according to Briſſon; and that the legs are blue, according to Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nandez.</p>
                  <p>But if I attend to the different lights in which naturaliſts have viewed it, the embarraſſment will be increaſed; for Friſch fancied that it was a Hen of the Wood, Briſſon a Quail, and Fernan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dez a Partridge. That this was the opinion of the laſt manifeſtly appears, for though he ſays, in the beginning of chap. xxv. that it is a Quail, he evidently conforms to the common language; ſince he concludes the chapter with ſaying, that the <hi>Colenicuiltic,</hi> in its bulk, in its cry, in its habits, and in every other particular, is analogous to the bird of chap. xxiv; but that bird is the Coyolcozque, a kind of Colin; and Fernandez,
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:1084500102:457"/>
as we have already ſeen, ranks the Colins among the Partridges.</p>
                  <p>I would not inſiſt on this matter, were it not to avoid as much as poſſible the great inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience attending on nomenclature. Each author, fond of building a ſyſtem, is not ſatisfiled till he aſſign to every object, however anomalous, its place; and thus, according to the different views that ariſe, the ſame animal may be claſſed with <hi>genera</hi> widely diſtinct.—Such is the preſent caſe.</p>
                  <p>To return—The Colenicui is of the bulk of our Quail, according to Briſſon; but its wings ſeem to be longer; its body is brown above, and dirty-gray and black beneath; it has a white throat, and a ſort of white eye-brows. <note n="A" place="bottom">Specific character of the <hi>Tetrao Mexicanus:</hi>—<q rend="inline">Its legs and bill are blood-coloured, the line on its eye-brows white.</q>

               <p>IT was eaſy to domeſticate the heavy and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>active birds, ſuch as the common hen, the turkey, and the peacock; but to tame thoſe which are nimble and ſhoot on rapid wings, required attention and art. A low hut, rudely conſtructed on a confined ſpot, is ſufficient for lodging and raiſing our poultry; to induce the Pigeons to ſettle, we muſt erect a lofty building, well co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered without and fitted up with numerous cells. They really are not domeſtics, like dogs or horſes; or priſoners like the fowls; they are rather voluntary captives, tranſient gueſts, who continue to reſide in the dwelling aſſigned them, only becauſe they like it, and are pleaſed with a ſituation which affords them abundance of food, and all the conveniencies and comforts of life. On the ſlighteſt diſappointment or diſguſt, they abandon their manſion, and diſperſe; and ſome of them even will always prefer the mouldering holes of ancient walls to the neateſt apartments in Pigeon-houſes; others take their abode in the clefts and hollows of trees; others ſeem to fly the habitations of men, and cannot be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed to enter their precincts; others again never
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:1084500102:460"/>
roam from human dwellings, but muſt be fed near their volery, to which they are inflexibly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached. Theſe various and even oppoſite habits ſhew, that under the Pigeon are included many different ſpecies. This opinion is confirmed by the modern nomenclators, who, beſides a great number of varieties, reckon five ſpecies of Pigeons, without including the Ring-dove and Turtle. We ſhall remove theſe two laſt ſpecies from thoſe of the Pigeon, and conſider each ſeparately.</p>
               <p>The five ſpecies of Pigeons noticed by our no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menclators are, 1. The Domeſtic Pigeon; 2. The Roman Pigeon, which includes ſixteen varieties; 3. The Brown Pigeon; 4. The Rock Pigeon, with one variety; 5. The Wild Pigeon; but theſe five ſpecies are in my opinion the ſame. My reaſon is this. The Domeſtic Pigeon and the Roman Pigeon, with all their varieties, though differing in ſize and colours, are certainly the ſame ſpecies; ſince they breed together, and their progeny are capable of procreating. We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conſider the great and little Domeſtic Pigeons as two different ſpecies; we can only ſay that they are different branches of the ſame kind, the one of which has been reduced to a more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect domeſtication than the other. In the ſame manner, the Brown Pigeon, the Rock Pigeon, and the Wild Pigeon, are three nominal ſpecies which may be compriſed in one, which is the Brown Pigeon, and of which the Rock Pigeon and the Wild Pigeon are only minute varieties;
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:1084500102:461"/>
ſince the nomenclators themſelves admit that theſe three are nearly of the ſame ſize, that they migrate, perch, and have all the ſame inſtincts, differing only in their ſhades of colour.</p>
               <p>Thus the five nominal ſpecies are compriſed under two; viz. the Brown Pigeon and the Common Pigeon; and in theſe no real difference exiſts, except that the firſt is wild, and the ſecond domeſtic. I conſider the Brown Pigeon as the parent of all the reſt, and from which they differ more or leſs according as they have been handled by men. Though I cannot prove it, I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident that the Stock Pigeon and the Common Pigeon would breed together if they were paired: for the difference is not ſo great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween our little Domeſtic Pigeon and the Stock Pigeon, as between it and the large rough-footed or Roman Pigeon, with which however it breeds. Beſides, in this ſpecies we can trace all the gradations between the wild and the domeſtic ſtate, as they occur in ſucceſſion; in the order of genealogy, or rather of degeneracy. The Stock Pigeon is imitated, in a way that cannot be miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>underſtood, by thoſe deſerters which leave our pigeon-houſes; they perch on trees, which is the firſt and ſtrongeſt ſhade in their return to the ſtate of nature: theſe Pigeons, though bred do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtics, and apparently reconciled, like the reſt, to a fixed abode and to common habits, abandon their dwelling, renounce ſociety, and ſeek a ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement in the woods; and thus, impelled by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:1084500102:462"/>
alone, they reſume their native manners. Others, ſeemingly leſs courageous and leſs intre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid, but equally fond of liberty, fly from our pigeon-houſes, and ſeek a ſolitary lodgment in the holes of old walls, or, forming a ſmall body, they haunt ſome unfrequented towers; and in ſpite of the hardſhips to which their ſituation expoſes them, and the multiplied dangers that aſſail them from all ſides, they ſtill prefer theſe uncomfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able dwellings to the convenience and plenty of their former manſion: this is the ſecond grada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the ſtate of nature. The Wall Pigeons do not completely adopt their native habits, and do not perch like the former, yet they enjoy a much larger ſhare of freedom than thoſe which remain in the domeſtic condition. The third gradation is the inhabitants of our pigeon-houſes, which never leave their dwelling but to ſettle in one more comfortable, and which roam abroad only to ſeek amuſement, or to procure ſubſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. And as even among theſe there are ſome deſerters, it would ſeem that the traces of their primaeval inſtincts are not entirely effaced. The fourth and fifth gradations have totally changed their nature. Their tribes, varieties, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixtures are innumerable, being completely do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic from the earlieſt ages; and man, while he has improved their external forms, has changed their internal qualities, and extinguiſhed in them every ſentiment of freedom. Theſe birds are for the moſt part larger and more beautiful than
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:1084500102:463"/>
the Common Pigeons; are more prolific, fatter and finer flavoured, and on all theſe accounts more pains have been beſtowed upon them. They are inactive helpleſs creatures, that require the conſtant attention of man; and the moſt cruel hunger cannot in them call forth thoſe little arts in which animals are uſually ſo prompt. They are therefore completely domeſticated, and entirely dependent on man, who has degraded them from their original condition.</p>
               <p>If we ſuppoſe, that after our dove-cots were ſtocked, we ſelected thoſe of the young which were moſt remarkable for their beauty, and raiſed them apart with greater care and attention, and ſtill continued to chooſe the moſt gaudy of their deſcendants; we ſhould at laſt obtain thoſe painted varieties which at preſent exiſt. To give a complete hiſtory of theſe would therefore be to detail the effects of art, rather than to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe the productions of nature. For this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, we ſhall content ourſelves with the bare enumeration of them.</p>

<pb n="440" facs="tcp:1084500102:464"/>
Domeſtic Pigeon, but of a browner colour. It varies however both in its bulk and plumage; for the one which is figured by Friſch under the name of <hi>Columba Agreſtis,</hi> is the ſame bird with a white ſhade, and its head and tail reddiſh; and what the ſame author has termed <hi>Vinago, five Columba Montana,</hi> is ſtill the Wild Pigeon, only its plumage borders on a dark blue. What Albin deſcribes by the term <hi>ring-dove,</hi> which is not applicable to it, muſt be conſidered as ſtill the ſame bird; and likewiſe what Belon calls the <hi>Deſerter Pigeon,</hi> which is more proper. We may ſuppoſe that this variety has ariſen from thoſe individuals which deſert our pigeon-houſes, and relapſe into the ſtate of nature; for the dark blue Wild Pigeons neſtle not only in the clefts of trees, but in the holes of ruins and precipices which they find in the foreſts. Hence ſome na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turaliſts have called them <hi>Rock Pigeons,</hi> and others, becauſe they are fond of elevated tracts, have named them <hi>Mountain Pigeons.</hi> We may alſo obſerve, that this is the only ſpecies of the Wild Pigeon with which the ancients ſeem to have been acquainted, and which they called <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

My opinion on this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject derives additional force from this fact, that in all countries where there are Domeſtic

Above 3000 pigeon-houſes are computed in the neighbourhood of Iſpahan; it is a pleaſure to ſee people take Pigeons in the field, by means of Pigeons tamed and trained for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, which they make to fly in flocks the whole day beſide the Wild Pigeons; theſe are thus mingled in the flock, and led to the pigeon-houſe.</q>

continues only during the ſummer in our temperate cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates. They arrive in
flocks in Burgundy, Champagne, and other northern provinces in France, about
the end of February and the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of March; they ſettle in the woods and
neſtle in the hollow trees, laying two or three eggs in the ſpring, and
probably making a ſecond hatch in ſummer; they raiſe only two young at a

                  </note>, which, as we have obſerved, is only half domeſtic, and ſtill retains the original in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct of flying in flocks. If it has loſt that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive courage which is founded on the feeling of independence, it has acquired more of the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and uſeful qualities. It often hatches thrice a-year, and, if ſtill more domeſticated, even ten or twelve times; whereas the Brown Pigeons breeds only once, or at moſt twice, annually. They lay, at intervals of two days, almoſt always two eggs and ſeldom three, and never raiſe more than two young, which are commonly a male and female. Many, and theſe are of the younger ſort, lay only once a-year, and the ſpring hatch is always the moſt numerous. The beſt pigeon-houſes are thoſe built facing the eaſt, on ſome riſing ground ſeveral hundred paces diſtant from the farm-yard; where the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants can enjoy quiet, have the advantage of an extenſive proſpect, and receive the cheering influence of the morning ſun. I have frequently ſeen Pigeons, flying from the vallies before ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe,
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:1084500102:467"/>
alight to baſk on a pigeon-houſe that was ſeated on a hill, and drive away or even diſpoſſeſs the lodgers; and this happens ofteneſt in ſpring and autumn. I ſhall add another remark, that lofty and ſolitary pigeon-houſes are the moſt productive. From one of mine, I had uſually 400 pairs of young Pigeons; while I got only 100 or 130 from others that were ſituated 200 feet lower. The only danger is, leſt the rapacious birds that hover about the elevated tracts diſturb the Pigeons and check their breeding, for they cannot much diminiſh their numbers, as they prey on thoſe only which ſtray from the flock.</p>
               <p>After the Common Pigeon, which is half do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic, we ſhall place thoſe varieties to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of which man has ſo much contributed; but the number is ſo immenſe, that it would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the limits of our work to deſcribe each particularly, and we ſhall therefore be contented with a general ſurvey.</p>
               <p>The curious in this line apply the name of Biſet to all Pigeons that live in the fields, or are bred in large pigeon-houſes, and call thoſe <hi>do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic</hi> which are lodged in ſmall pigeon-houſes, or voleries, and do not venture to roam abroad. They are of different ſizes: for inſtance, the tumbler and wheeler Pigeons, which are the leaſt of all the volery Pigeons, and ſmaller than the Common Pigeon. They are more agile and nimble, and when they breed with the common ſort, they loſe their diſtinctive qualities. It

12. The Dark Pouter Pigeon of a fine vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet black, with ten wing-quills white, as in the Cheſnut Pouter Pigeon. Both have the bib or kerchief under the neck white; and the females are like the males. Of all the Pouter Pigeons of a pure breed, that is, which have an uniform plumage, the ten quills are all white as far as the middle of the wing, and this may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded as a general character.</p>
               <p n="13">13. The Slaty Pouter Pigeon, which has the under-ſurface of the wings white, and a white cravat; the female is like the male.—Theſe are the principal breeds of the Pouter Pigeons, but there are others of inferior beauty, ſuch as the red, the olive, the ſable, &amp;c</p>
               <p>All Pigeons have more or leſs the power of inflating their craw by inſpiring air; and the ſame effect may be produced by blowing into the gullet. But this breed of Pouter Pigeons poſſeſſes the property in ſo ſuperior a degree as can reſult only from ſome peculiar conformation of its organs. The craw, almoſt as large as the reſt of the body, and kept conſtantly inflated, obliges them to draw back their head, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents them from looking forward: and thus while they ſwell with conceit, the falcon ſeizes them unawares. Hence they are raiſed more for curioſity than utility.</p>
               <p>Another breed is the Proud Pigeons; they are the moſt common, and at the ſame time the moſt eſteemed, on account of their prolific quality.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="447" facs="tcp:1084500102:473"/>
The Proud Pigeon is nearly one half larger than the Biſet, and the female pretty much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembles the male. They breed almoſt every month in the year, provided that only a ſmall number are put into the ſame volery, and to each there be allowed three or four baſkets or rather holes, formed into pretty deep caſements with ſhelves, to prevent them from ſeeing one another while ſitting; for each Pigeon not only defends its own hole, and fights the others that come near it, but contends for the poſſeſſion of the next row. For example, eight pairs are ſufficient to ſtock a ſpace eight feet ſquare, and people who have bred them affirm that ſix pair would be equally productive. The more their number be increaſed in a given ſpace, the more there will be of brawling and fighting and of broken eggs. In this breed there are often impotent males, and barren females, which never lay.</p>
               <p>They are fit to breed in the eighth or ninth month, but do not attain maturity till three years old. Their prolific powers are vigorous for ſix or ſeven years; after which the number of eggs they lay diminiſhes gradually; though there are inſtances of their breeding at the age of twelve. They lay their two eggs ſometimes in the ſpace of twenty-four hours, and during winter in that of two days; ſo that the interval varies according to the ſeaſon. The female keeps her firſt egg warm, without covering it aſſidu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, nor does ſhe begin to ſit cloſely till after
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:1084500102:474"/>
the ſecond is laid. The period of incubation is commonly eighteen days; ſometimes only ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen, eſpecially in ſummer, and nineteen or twenty in winter. The attachment of the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male to her eggs is ſo ardent and ſteady, that ſhe will forego every comfort, and ſubmit to the moſt cruel hardſhips, rather than forſake them. A Hen Pigeon, whoſe toes froze and dropt off, perſiſted to ſit till her young were hatched: her toes were froſt-bitten, becauſe her hole chanced to be cloſe to the window of the dove-cot.</p>
               <p>While the female is employed in hatching, the male places himſelf in the next hole; and the moment ſhe is compelled by hunger to leave her eggs and go to the trough, he obſerves her feeble murmur of intimation, takes her place, covers the eggs and ſits two or three hours.

               <p>The varieties of the Proud Pigeon may be reduced to three with reſpect to ſize, which have all the common character of a red filet round the eyes.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Thoſe heavy birds that are nearly as large as ſmall pullets; their bulk alone recommends them, for they are not good breeders.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>Bagadais</hi> are large Proud Pigeons, with a tubercle over the bill in the form of a ſmall morel<note n="*" place="bottom">

eyes, that is, a ſecond eyelid, fleſhy and reddiſh, which even falls upon the eyes when they are old, and prevents them from ſeeing.—Theſe Pigeons are not productive.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Bagadais</hi> have a curved and hooked bill, and exhibit many varieties; white, black, red, tawny, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Spaniſh Pigeon; which is as large as a hen, and exceedingly beautiful. It differs from the <hi>Bagadais</hi> in not having the <hi>morel</hi> above its bill, and its ſecond fleſhy eyelid being leſs protuberant, and its bill ſtraight inſtead of curv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. It croſſes with the <hi>Bagadais,</hi> and produces a very thick and large breed.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Turkiſh Pigeon; which, like the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gadais,</hi> has a thick excreſcence above the bill, with a red bar extending from the bill round the eyes. This bird is very thick, creſted, low legged, with a broad body and wings: ſome are of a tawny colour, or a brown bordering on black, ſuch as repreſented in Pl. CXLIX. of Friſch; others are of an iron-gray, lint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gray, chamois, and wine-ſop. Theſe Pigeons are very inactive, and never roam from their volery.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Roman Pigeons; which are not quite ſo large as the Turkiſh, but have the ſame extent of wings, but no creſt; they are black, tawny, or ſpotted.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the largeſt of the Domeſtic Pigeons; there are ſome of a middle ſize, and others

in Latin <hi>Columba-galerita,</hi> that is, Hooded Pigeon. But in general all
of the Jacobines are hooded, or rather have a half-cowl on the head, which
deſcends along the neck, and extends along the breaſt like a cravat of
ruffled feathers: this variety is nearly allied to the Pouter Pigeon, for its
ſize is the ſame, it alſo ſomewhat inflates its craw, nor is it ſo
prolific as the other Jaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines, of which the moſt perfect are entirely
white. In all of them, the bill is very ſhort; the latter breed often, but
their young is very ſmall.</p>
               <p>The Shaker or Peacock Pigeon is ſomewhat larger than the Jacobine. The fineſt of this breed have thirty-two feathers in the tail, while the common ſort have only twelve. After they have raiſed their tail, they bend it forwards, and at the ſame time draw back the head ſo as to make it meet the tail. They ſhake alſo during the whole of this movement; either from the violent contraction of the muſcles, or from ſome other cauſe, for there is more than one breed of Shaker Pigeons<note n="‡" place="bottom">There is a Shaker Pigeon different from the Peacock Pigeon, its tail not being near ſo broad. The Peacock Pigeon has been denominated by Willughby and Ray, <hi>Columba tremula laticauda</hi> (broad-tailed Shaker Pigeon); and the Shaker Pigeon <hi>Columba tremula anguſticauda ſeu acuticauda</hi> (narrow-tailed or ſharp-tailed Shaker Pigeon): the latter, though it does not raiſe or diſplay its tail, trembles, they ſay, almoſt continually.</note>. They make this diſplay of the tail
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:1084500102:480"/>
commonly in the love ſeaſon; though ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times alſo upon other occaſions. The female raiſes and diſplays her tail alſo like the male, and is quite as beautiful; ſome kinds are entirely white, others white with the head and tail black. To this ſecond variety we muſt refer the Pigeon figured in Pl. CLI. of Friſch, which he calls in German, <hi>Pfau-taube,</hi> or <hi>Hunerſchwantz</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">i. e. <hi>Peacock</hi> or <hi>Hen-tailed Pigeon.</hi>
                  </note>, and in Latin, <hi>Columba caudata.</hi> That Author re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks at the ſame time, that the Shaker Pigeon diſplays its tail, and works eagerly and conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with its head and tail, nearly in the ſame way as the <hi>wryneck.</hi> Theſe Pigeons do not fly ſo well as the others; their broad tail catches the wind, and they often fall to the ground; for this reaſon they are bred chiefly from curioſity. However, theſe Pigeons, though by themſelves they could perform no diſtant journies, have been carried into remote countries: in the Philippine iſlands, ſays Gemelli Carreri, are Pigeons that elevate and ſpread their tail like the peacock.</p>
               <p>The Poliſh Pigeons are larger than the Shaker Pigeons. Their diſtinguiſhing character is a very thick and ſhort bill, their eyes bordered

are of different colours, many black, others rufous, chamois, dotted with gray,
or entirely white.</p>
               <p>The Turbet Pigeon is one of the ſmalleſt, being ſcarcely larger than a turtle, with which it breeds. The Turbet Pigeon is diſtinguiſhed from the Jacobine, the former not having the half cowl on the head and neck, but only a tuft of feathers that appear to ruffle on the breaſt and under the throat. Theſe Pigeons are very hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, well-made, and have a neat air; ſome are of the colour of wine-ſop, others chamois, painted, rufous, gray, entirely white or black, and others white with black mantles. The laſt variety is what Friſch repreſents in his CXLVII. Plate, under the German name <hi>Mowchen,</hi> and the Latin deſignation <hi>Columba collo hirſuto</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Pigeon with ſhaggy neck.</note>. This Pigeon has an averſion to pairing with other Pigeons, and is not very prolific: it is beſides very ſmall, and eaſily falls a prey to the rapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious tribes. Upon all theſe accounts it is ſcarcely ever raiſed.</p>
               <p>The Pigeons called Dutch-ſhell Pigeons, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe on the back of the head are reverſed feathers forming a ſort of ſhell, are alſo ſmall. Their head is black, the end of the tail and the tip of the wings are alſo black; but all the reſt of the body is white. Some are red-headed, blue-headed, or the head and tail yellow;
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:1084500102:483"/>
the tail is uſually of the ſame colour with the head, but the wings are always white. The firſt variety which has a black head, reſembles ſo much the Sea-ſwallow, that ſome perſons have applied to it that name; and with the more appearance of analogy, as this Pigeon has not its body round like moſt of the reſt, but long and very ſlender.</p>
               <p>Beſides the Shell Pigeon which we have juſt mentioned, there are other Pigeons which have the head and tail blue; others where theſe parts are black; others where they are red; others where they are yellow: but in all the four the extremity of the tail is of the ſame colour with the head. They are nearly as large as the Peacock Pigeons, and their plumage is very neat and ſingular.</p>
               <p>There are ſome named Swallow Pigeons, that are not larger than turtles, and like them are ſlender ſhaped and of very nimble flight: the whole of the under-ſide of their body is white, and the upper-ſide, as well as the neck, the head and the tail, black, or red, or blue, or yellow, with a ſmall caſque of the ſame colours on the head, but the under-ſide of the head is always white, and ſo is that of the neck. To this va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety we muſt refer the <hi>Galeated Pigeon</hi> of John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton and Willughby, of which the principal character is, that the feathers of the head and thoſe of the tail and the quills of the wings are always of the ſame colour, and the body of a different colour; for example, the body white,

or of ſome other colour, whatever it be.</p>
               <p>The Carmelite Pigeon, which forms a differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent breed, is perhaps the loweſt and the ſmalleſt of all our Pigeons; it appears ſquatted like the goat-ſucker; it is alſo very rough-legged, the feathers on its thighs being exceeding long, and its legs remarkably ſhort. The males and females reſemble each other, as in moſt of the other breeds. It includes four varieties, which like thoſe of the preceding ſorts, are alſo of an iron-gray, chamois, wine-ſop, and ſoft gray: but in them all, the under-ſide of the body and of the wings is white, all the upper-ſide of the body being of the colours we have mentioned. Their bill is ſmaller than that of a turtle, and they have a little tuft behind the head, which draws to a point as in the creſted lark.</p>
               <p>The Drum Pigeon or <hi>glou-glou,</hi> of which we have ſpoken, is alſo very low and rough-legged, but larger than the Carmelite Pigeon, and nearly of the ſize of the Poliſh Pigeon.</p>
               <p>The Daſhed Pigeon, which is marked by a daub, as it were, of a black, a yellow, or a red pencil, above the bill only, and as far as the middle of the head, with the tail of the ſame colour, and all the reſt of the body white, is highly valued by the curious. It is not rough-legged; it is of the ſize of the ordinary Proud Pigeons.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="456" facs="tcp:1084500102:486"/>
The Swiſs Pigeons are ſmaller than the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Pigeons, and not larger than the Biſets; they even fly as nimbly. There are ſeveral kinds of them; viz. thoſe garniſhed with red, with blue, and with yellow, on a ſilky white ground with a collar, which forms a horſe-ſhoe on the breaſt, and is of an embroidered red. They have often two bars on the wings, of the ſame colour with that of the horſe-ſhoe.</p>
               <p>There are other Swiſs Pigeons not garniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with intermingled tints, ſhaded over the whole body with an uniform ſlate colour, and without any collar or horſe-ſhoe. Others are called <hi>jaſpered yellow collars, mailed yellow collars,</hi> and others <hi>very mailed yellow collars,</hi> &amp;c. becauſe they have collars of that colour.</p>
               <p>There is ſtill another variety of the Swiſs Pigeons, called the <hi>Azure Pigeon,</hi> becauſe its plumage inclines more to blue than the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding.</p>
               <p>The Tumbler Pigeon is one of the ſmalleſt kind; that which Friſch has figured, Pl. CXLVIII. under the names <hi>Tummel-taube, tumler, Columba geſtuoſa ſeu geſticularia,</hi> is of a rufous brown; but ſome are gray, and variegated with rufous and gray. It whirls round in its flight, like a body thrown in the air; for this reaſon it has received its appellation. All theſe motions ſeem to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply vertigoes, which, as I have obſerved, may be aſcribed to the effect of domeſtication. It flies very
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:1084500102:487"/>
ſwiftly, and ſoars higher than any; but its movements are precipitate and very irregular. Friſch ſays, that its fluttering reſembles in ſome meaſure the capers of a rope-dancer; it has been called the Harlequin Pigeon <hi>(Columba geſtuoſa).</hi> Its ſhape is pretty much like that of the Biſet; it is commonly employed to attract Pigeons from other dove-cots, becauſe it flies higher and far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and continues longer on the wing than the reſt, and more eaſily eſcapes the hawk.</p>
               <p>The ſame may be ſaid of the Wheeler Pigeon, which Briſſon has called after Willughby, the <hi>Smiter Pigeon</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Columba Percuſſor, <hi>Will.</hi> and <hi>Briſſ.</hi>
                  </note>; it turns round in its flight, and flaps ſo vigorouſly with its wings, as to make as much noiſe as a mill-clapper; and often in the violence of its exertions, which ſeem to be almoſt convulſive, it breaks ſome of its wing-quills. Theſe Wheeler or Smiter Pigeons are common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gray, with black ſpots on the wings.</p>
               <p>I ſhall barely mention ſome other varieties that are uncertain or ſecondary, noticed by the nomenclators, and which belong undoubtedly to the breeds that we have deſcribed, but to which, from the imperfect accounts given, we cannot refer them with accuracy or certainty.</p>

               <p>AS this bird is much larger than the Biſet, and as both are nearly related to the Domeſtic Pigeon, we may ſuppoſe that the ſmall breeds of our houſe-pigeons have proceeded from the Biſets, and the large breeds from the Ring Pigeons: and this conjecture is the more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, as the ancients were in the practice of rearing and fattening the Ring Pigeons<note n="†" place="bottom">Perrottus, <hi>apud Geſnerum.</hi>
                  </note>. The only circumſtance that ſeems to oppoſe this idea is, that the ſmall domeſtic Pigeons croſs with the large ſorts, while the Ring Pigeon ſeems not to intermix with the Biſet, and, though they inhabit the ſame tracts, do not mix together. The turtle, as it is ſtill more eaſily raiſed and kept
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:1084500102:502"/>
in houſes, might equally be regarded as the ſource of ſome of our domeſtic breeds, were it not, like the Ring Pigeon, of a peculiar ſpecies, that intermingles not with the Wild Pigeons. But though in their native foreſts, where each can poſſeſs its proper female, theſe birds are never obſerved to aſſociate together, yet when they are deprived of their liberty, and have no longer the opportunity of ſelection, the force of paſſion may obliterate the principle of choice, and may impel them to unite with the females of their kindred ſpecies, and give birth to a progeny of hybrids. Nor will the offspring, like the males, be blaſted with ſterility, but may, like the breed between the he-goat and the ſheep, be capable of reproduction. To judge from analogy, the Pigeon tribe conſiſts in the ſtate of nature of three prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal ſpecies, as we have obſerved, and of two that may be regarded as intermediate. On theſe the Greeks beſtowed five different names: the firſt and largeſt is the <hi>Phaſſa</hi> or <hi>Phatta,</hi> which is our Ring Pigeon: the ſecond is <hi>Peleias,</hi> which is our Wild Pigeon: the third is the <hi>Trugon</hi> or the Turtle: the fourth, which is the firſt of the intermediate kinds, is the <hi>Oinas,</hi> which being rather larger than the Wild Pigeon, muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as relapſed from the ſtate of domeſtica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: the fifth is the <hi>Phaps,</hi> which is a Ring Pigeon ſmaller than the <hi>Phaſſa,</hi> and for that reaſon called the <hi>Leſſer Pigeon,</hi> but which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to us to be only a variety of the ſpecies of
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:1084500102:503"/>
the Ring Pigeon; for it has been obſerved that the Ring Pigeons are of different ſizes, according to the nature of the climate.—Thus all the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal ſpecies, ancient or modern, may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to three, viz. the Wild Pigeon, the Ring Pigeon, and the Turtle, which have all perhaps contributed to the endleſs varieties of our do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic Pigeons.</p>
               <p>The Ring Pigeons arrive in our provinces in the ſpring, rather earlier than the Biſets, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire in autumn ſomewhat later. The month of Auguſt is the time in France when the young are the moſt numerous; and it appears that they iſſue from the ſecond hatch, which is made to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the end of the ſummer; for the firſt hatch being very early in the ſpring, the neſt is not covered with leaves, and is therefore too much expoſed and often deſtroyed. Some Ring Pigeons remain in moſt of our provinces during winter; they perch like the Biſets, but do not like them conſtruct their neſts in holes of trees; they place them on the tops, and build them neatly with ſticks: the neſt is flat and ſo wide as to admit at once both the male and female. I have aſcertained that very early in the ſpring, they lay two and often three eggs; for ſeveral neſts have been brought to me containing two and ſometimes three young ones already ſtrong in the beginning of April<note n="*" place="bottom">Salerne ſays, that the poulterers of Orleans buy, in the ſeaſon of the neſts, a conſiderable number of Turtles, which they blow with the mouth and fatten with millet, ſo that in leſs than a fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night they are fit to be carried to Paris. That in the ſame manner they fatten the Ring Pigeons, and alſo carry thither Biſets and other Pigeons, which they call <hi>Poſtes,</hi> and which are, according to them, Pigeons that have forſaken dove-cots, and roam at will, neſtling ſometimes in one place, and ſometimes in another, in churches, in towers, in the walls of old caſtles, or in rocks.—This fact proves that the Ring Pigeon, like all the Pigeons and Turtles, can be reared like other domeſtic birds, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently that they may have given birth to the moſt beautiful and the largeſt dove-cot Pigeons. M. Le Roy, Lieutenant of the chaces, and inſpector of the park at Verſailles, aſſures me, that the young Ring Pigeons taken from the neſt, tamed and fattened very well, and that even the old Ring Pigeons caught by a net, were eaſily reconciled to live in the voleries, where in a very ſhort time by blowing they grow fat.</note>. Some perſons have
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:1084500102:504"/>
aſſerted that in our climate they breed only once a-year, unleſs they are robbed of their eggs or young, which, it is well known, obliges all birds to a ſecond hatch. But Friſch affirms that they lay twice a-year, which ſeems to us very certain; ſince the union of the male and female being conſtant and faithful, would ſeem to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply that their love, and the attachment for their young, continues the whole year. But the female lays a fortnight after the embrace of the male<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <bibl>Ariſtotle, <hi>Hiſt. Anim.</hi> lib. vi. 4.</bibl>
                  </note>, and ſits only another fortnight; and the ſame length of time would be ſufficient for the young gaining ſtrength to enable them to fly, and provide for themſelves:—thus it is proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that ſhe may breed twice in the courſe of the year, firſt in the beginning of ſpring, and again at the ſummer ſolſtice, as the ancients re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked. In warm and temperate climates this
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:1084500102:505"/>
undoubtedly takes place, and very probably the caſe is nearly the ſame in cold countries. The Ring Pigeon has a louder ſort of cooing than the Common Pigeon, but is never heard except in the love ſeaſon, and in fine weather; for when it rains, theſe birds are ſilent, and ſeldom does their ſong cheer the gloom of winter. They live upon wild fruits, acorns, beech-maſt, ſtraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berries, of which they are very fond, and alſo beans and grain of all kinds. They make great havoc among the corn when it is ſhed or lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and if theſe ſorts of food fail them, they have recourſe to herbage. They drink like other Pigeons, that is at one draught, without raiſing their head, till they have ſwallowed as much water as they have occaſion for. As their fleſh, eſpecially when they are young, is excellent meat, their neſts are much ſought for, and great numbers are robbed. This devaſtation, joined to their ſlow multiplication, much reduces every where the ſpecies. Many are caught indeed with nets in their route through the provinces bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering on the Pyrenees; but this laſts only a few days and at one ſeaſon.</p>

According to Edwards, who has, ſince Albin, given an excellent deſcription

Pigeon . . . . The feathers covering the tail are long and pointed like thoſe
of a dung-hill cock; they have very beautiful reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of colour variegated

               <p>THE Turtle, more perhaps than any other birds, loves coolneſs in ſummer, and gentle warmth in winter. It arrives in our climates very late in the ſpring, and departs in the end of Auguſt; whereas the Biſets and the Ring Pigeons appear a month earlier and remain a month later, and ſome even the whole winter.

<q rend="inline">I have ſeen, a perſon writes me of the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted
credit<note n="*" place="bottom">M. Hebert, whom I have already cited more than
once.</note>, I have ſeen in Bugey, at a houſe of Chartreux, a bird got by
croſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Pigeon with a Turtle; it was of the colour of a French Turtle,
and reſembled the Turtle more than the Pigeon; it was reſtleſs, and
moleſted the other birds of the volery. The father Pigeon was of a very
ſmall kind, perfectly white, with black wings.</q> It has not been obſerved
whether theſe hybrids are prolific; but the general fact proves at leaſt
the great analogy that ſubſiſts between theſe two birds. It is
therefore not unlikely, as we have before remarked, that all the varieties of
the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic Pigeon may reſult from the gradations of intercourſe, and
the multiplied combinations of the Biſet, the Ring Pigeon, and the
Turtle.</p>
               <p>What ſeems to confirm our opinion with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to theſe unions, which may be conceived to be illegitimate, as being out of the uſual courſe of nature, is, that exceſſive ardor which theſe birds feel in the ſeaſon of love. The Turtle melts with a ſtill more tender paſſion than the Pigeon, and more ſingular preludes announce the ſwell of pleaſure. The male Pigeon only ſtruts round his mate, puffing and diſplaying his figure. The Turtle, whether kept in confinement or fluttering at will in the grove, begins his addreſſes by
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:1084500102:519"/>
ſaluting his female eighteen or twenty times in ſucceſſion in the moſt humble poſture, bending ſo low each time as to touch the ground, or the branch, with his bill, and he ſighs the tendereſt murmurs. The female appears at firſt inſenſible to his paſſion, but the ſecret flame ſoon kindles, and at laſt yielding to the ſoft deſires, ſhe gives vent to ſome plaintive accents. And when once ſhe has diſſolved in his embrace, ſhe burns with a conſtant fire; ſhe never leaves the male, ſhe returns his kiſſes and his careſſes, and ſtimulates him to renew the rapturous joys, till the buſineſs of hatching divides her attention, and invites to more ſerious occupations.</p>
               <p>I ſhall cite only one fact which manifeſts the ardour of theſe birds<note n="*" place="bottom">The Turtle, M. Roy writes me, differs from the Ring Pigeon and the Common Pigeon, by its diſſoluteneſs and inconſtancy, notwithſtanding its reputation for the contrary qualities. Not only females that are ſhut up in voleries receive promiſcuouſly all the males; but I have ſeen wild ones, which were neither con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained nor corrupted by domeſtication, give favours to two ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively on the ſame branch.</note>: if the males be put in one cage and the females in another, they will copulate together as if they were of different ſexes: the males indeed burn ſooner and with more intenſity than the females. Confinement therefore only deranges nature, but cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh it!</p>

female Collared Turtle, and reſembled more the father than the mother. I have
no doubt but theſe are prolific. The Collared Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle is only ſomewhat
larger than the common kind; its inſtincts and habits are the ſame. In

analogous in their diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions than in their figure. They eat and drink
in the ſame manner, without lifting their head till they have ſwallowed as

                  <p>In the New Continent we meet firſt with the Canada Turtle, which, as I have ſaid, is the ſame ſpecies with the European Turtle.</p>
                  <p>Another bird, which we have called after the travellers, <hi>Tourte,</hi> is what Cateſby has termed the <hi>Carolina Turtle</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">This Pigeon reſides the whole year in Carolina, and ſeeds on the berries of poke (<hi>Phytolacca Decandria,</hi> Linn.) and the ſeeds of the mug-apple.

It appears to be the ſame, the only difference being a gold-coloured ſpot, mixed with green and crimſon, which in Cateſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by's bird is placed below the eyes and on the ſide of the neck, but which is not to be ſeen in ours. This would incline me to ſuppoſe that the firſt is the male, and the ſecond the female. It is likely that the <hi>Picacuroba</hi> of Brazil, mentioned by Marcgrave, belongs to this ſpecies.</p>

differing but little from it, muſt be regarded as a variety of it.</p>
                  <p>We ſhall alſo remark, that this bird bears a great reſemblance to the one given by Edwards, which is probably only the female of ours. What alone ſeems oppoſed to this opinion, is the difference between the climates. Edwards was informed that his bird came from the Eaſt Indies, and ours was brought from America. Might not there be ſome miſtake with regard to the climate of Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards's? Theſe birds are ſo much like each other, and to the <hi>Tourte,</hi> that we cannot be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded that they are the inhabitants of climates ſo widely different; and we are certain that ours was ſent from Jamaica to the Royal Cabinet.</p>
