            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE medicinal education of children, which is commonly managed with ſuch negligence, is however, of very great importance, and the faults that may be committed in it are attended with the moſt dangerous conſequences. Children like dough, are ſuſceptible of all impreſſions, and an infant well formed at its birth, may become weak, and ſickly, thro' the improper management of the nurſe, to whoſe care it is committed: and on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, the moſt tender and ſickly infant may become ſtrong and robuſt, by a care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful attention to the rules laid down in this Pamphlet. Several years practice in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular branch of medicine, has enabled me to make theſe obſervations, ſo that I have aſſerted nothing but what is agreeable to reaſon, and confirmed to me by repeated experience: I have alſo, with great pains and attention, ſtudied all the authors, who
<pb facs="tcp:0165600400:3"/>have profeſſedly written on this ſubject, and have collected together in this treatiſe, all the uſeful precepts, both with reſpect to the nurſing, and the treatment of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes of children, which are ſcattered in their different works; and have endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to expoſe thoſe cuſtoms which are evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently founded on abſurd and dangerous prejudices. This ſmall tract will, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, appear contemptible, to thoſe who judge of the worth of books by their bulk; but I doubt not, experience will teach its value, to mothers and nurſes, and that the peruſal will not in the leaſt injure, if it does not improve, the more learned and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. I.</hi> Of the Ligature of the Navel String, and the Evacuation of the firſt Excrements called the Meconium.</head>
               <p>THE tying of the navel-ſtring is the firſt operation performed on the new born infant, it is done with common thread ſeveral times doubled, turned two or three times round the navel-ſtring, and tied at the diſtance of about two or three inches
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0165600400:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>from the navel, in order to prevent a fatal hemorrhage from this part; at the end which is left, there is applied a ſmall compreſs of fine linnen, which is kept in its place by a ſlight bandage.</p>
               <p>The ſkin of children, at their birth, is covered over with a whitiſh, viſcid liquor, this is eaſily removed by waſhing the child with a little wine, mixed with warm water; this lotion is alſo a remedy for inflammations of the ſkin, which are common at this time, as it augments the motion of the humours, and diſſipates the bad effects of the air. The ſame intention is anſwered by ſhaking, extending, and bending, the different mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the infant, by ſlightly rubbing the belly, and by gently irritating the organs of ſenſation, by which means the obſtructions formed in the veſſels of the ſkin are removed, and the mucous juices that are found in all the joints, are attenuated.</p>
               <p>The ſtomach and inteſtines of the infant are full of a viſcid matter, which is called the meconium, the firſt intention is to cleanſe the child of this, before food, in any quantity, is to be given: for nature, which is always the beſt director, does not provide any till ſome days after its birth are expired. Reſt, which at this time is the chief nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment of the child, and the proper diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of this excrement, are the principal
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0165600400:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>matters to be regarded for a few days. To promote this end, the general practice of nurſes is to cram a dab of butter and ſugar down the infant's throat, or ſome ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholeſome meſs: it is the cuſtom of ſome to give a little bit of fat roaſt pig, with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to cure it of its mother's longings, ſo that from this prepoſterous management, the child runs the riſk of being made ſick from the very firſt hour. In the room of theſe abſurd methods, to encourage the cleanſing of the child, a tea ſpoonful of ſolutive ſyrup of roſes, or ſyrup of violets, with an equal quantity of oil of ſweet al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds, mixed together, may be now and then given: the pap ſhould be made very thin, and given in ſmall quantities, for if much be given before this excrement is evacuated, they will ferment together and occaſion pain, and the tender body of the infant not being able to bear it, is flung into convulſions, and for want of attending ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently to this circumſtance, abundance of children have loſt their lives.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> Of the Examination of the Bridle of the Tongue, and of the time when the Child ought to take the firſt Aliments.</head>
               <p>THE child makes known by the motion of its lips, when it wants ſome nouriſhment, it ſucks its own glands, and draws ſpittle from them, which it either ſwallows or rejects, by putting it in foam out of its mouth; if any one preſents a finger, it ſeizes it, rolls it in its mouth, and by theſe ſigns demands the nipple; but before it be given, it is not ſufficient to teach it by little and little to ſeize it as it ought, we muſt alſo examine if the child is not hindered by ſome fault in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of its tongue. The tongue is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſo cloſely tied to the lower part of the mouth, by the means of the bridle, that it is obliged to be cut; this is uſually done by nurſes and midwives with the nail, but as this method is frequently attended with bad conſequences, I would recommend rather the cutting it with a ſharp pair of ſciſſars. But the bridle of the tongue very ſeldom requires this operation, for it ought never to be cut, except when it is extended almoſt
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0165600400:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>to the very tip of the tongue, which is very uncommon.</p>
               <p>As to the time when the child ought to take nouriſhment, it is very difficult to give certain and invariable rules on this ſubject: however, it is natural to believe that follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an exact method in relation to ſuckling of children, or giving them any other kind of nouriſhment, will not meet with unſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mountable obſtacles, and it would be very uſeful if mothers would give themſelves the trouble to put it in practice, and determine not to be diſcouraged at the beginning: thoſe nurſes, or mothers, cannot be ſufficiently blamed who perpetually incite their children to ſwallow down milk, or any other kind of food, under pretence that they have warm ſtomachs, and an eaſy digeſtion; that they want them to grow and look fat, and that good milk can do them no hurt, without conſidering whether theſe exceſſes are fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by vomiting, a looſeneſs, the gripes or convulſions: the weaker and more delicate the ſtomach of the infant is, the greater precaution ſhould be taken not to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>load it, and it ought to be allowed the more time to digeſt the nouriſhment it contains. Thoſe who would not have children voracious, ſubject, to a vomiting and looſeneſs, to breakings out and ether diſorders, ought, as much as poſſible, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0165600400:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>a fixed rule for the time when infants are to be fed, and for the quantity of ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments neceſſary for them. Their digeſtion would be more perfect, and their health more ſolidly eſtabliſhed, were parents con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with giving them their nouriſhment, five or ſix times in the twenty four hours, a ſmall quantity at each time, and always at the ſame hour, or as near as poſſible; this method ſhould be obſerved about a twelve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>month, when, and not before, the child ought to be weaned, not all at once, but by degrees that it may neither feel, nor fret at, the want of the breaſt. Were this plan of nurſing ſtrictly followed, the children kept clean and ſweet, tumbled and toſt about a good deal, I am certain that in ſix or eight months time, moſt children would become health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and ſtrong, would readily find the uſe of their legs, and very ſoon ſhift for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> Of the Dreſs moſt proper for new born Children, and ſome remarks on the errors, in the common method of nurſing.</head>
               <p>THE ingenious Dr. Cadogan obſerves, that there needs no other proof of the impropriety of the preſent method of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up children, as practiſed by nurſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> than the frequent miſcarriages attending it. Children in general are over cloathed and over fed: to theſe cauſes the doctor imputes almoſt all their diſeaſes, the firſt great miſtake is that they think a new born infant cannot be kept too warm; from this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, they load and bind it with flannels, wrappers, ſtays, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are all together almoſt equal to its own weight, by which means a healthy child is made ſo tender and chilly, that if by any accident a door or window be left open, the child often catches an irrecoverable cold, and what is ſtill more abſurd, at the end of the month, is ſent into the country to be nurſed, in a leaky houſe, that lets in wind and rain from every quarter. Can it be any wonder the child never thrives afterwards? But beſides the miſchief ariſing from the heat and weight of theſe ſwadling cloaths, they are too often put on ſo tight,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0165600400:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>and the child is ſo crampt by them, that its bowels have not room to act and exert them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the free eaſy manner they ought, this is a very hurtful circumſtance, for limbs that are not uſed, will never be ſtrong, and ſuch tender bodies cannot bear much preſſure, the circulation hindered by the compreſſion of any one part, muſt produce unnatural ſwellings in ſome other, to which without doubt the many diſtortions and deformities we every where meet with are owing. A new born child cannot be well too cool and looſe in its dreſs, it even wants leſs cloathing in proportion than a grown perſon, for children are capable of bearing great hardſhips before they are made ſickly, by the miſtaken management of their nurſes, witneſs the many foundlings picked up daily in the ſtreets of London, and the many inſtances, both antient and modern, of infants expoſed, and deſerted, which have nevertheleſs lived ſeveral days, tho' ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the utmoſt ſeverity of the winter ſeaſon.</p>
               <p>I would recommend the following dreſs. A flannel waiſtcoat without ſleeves, made to fit the body, and tie looſely behind, to which there ſhould be a petticoat ſewed, and over this a kind of gown of the ſame materials, or any other that is light, thin and flimſy. The petticoat ſhould not be
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0165600400:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>quite ſo long as the child, the gown a few inches longer, with one cap only on the head, which may be made double if it be not thought warm enough; what I mean is, that the whole head-dreſs ſhould be ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived, that it may be put on at once, and neither bind or preſs the head at all; the linnen may be the ſame as uſual. This I think, would be abundantly ſufficient for the day, laying aſide all thoſe ſwathes, bandages, ſtays, and contrivances, that are moſt ridiculouſly uſed to cloſe, and keep the head in its place, and ſupport the body; as if nature had produced her chief work, a human creature, ſo careleſsly unfiniſhed, as to want thoſe idle aids to make it perfect. Shoes and ſtockings are not in the leaſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary till the child is able to run about, for they keep the legs wet, and naſty, if they are not changed almoſt every hour, and often cramp and hurt the feet, beſides, a child would ſtand firmer, and learn to walk much ſooner without them. The child ſhould wear a thin flannel ſhirt during the night, which ought to be every way quite looſe: Children in this ſimple, looſe, dreſs, which may be eaſily put on and off, without much trouble, would be infinitely eaſier, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy a much freer uſe of their limbs, than when they are loaded, as is too frequently practiſed, with wrappers, ſtays, ſwathes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:0165600400:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p>Nurſes entertain a ſtrange opinion about changing the linnen, and keeping the children clean. They fooliſhly imagine, that clean linnen, and freſh cloaths, draw away and rob them of their nouriſhment; on the contrary, they do nothing more than imbibe a little of that moiſture, which their bodies exhale, which is of ſervice to them, and therefore their linnen cannot be changed too often, it ſhould be conſtantly clean eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day, as it would free them from ſtinks, and acidities, which are not only offenſive, but prejudicial to the tender ſtate of infancy. Every mother who is able, ought to ſuckle her own child, ſince it is not only more beneficial to the child, but alſo conducive to her own health, ſince forcing back the milk, which moſt young women have in great plenty, ſometimes endangers life, and often lays the foundation of many incurable diſeaſes.</p>
               <p>But if from a bad habit of body, want of a ſufficient quantity of milk, or any other cauſe, the mother is incapable of ſuckling her child, it will be infinitely bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to procure a wet-nurſe, than to attempt to rear the infant by dry-nurſing, ſince not above one in three of the children attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be brought up, by this unnatural and dangerous method, ever ſurvive it.</p>

                  <head>Rules proper to be obſerved in the choice of a Wet-Nurſe.</head>
                  <p>CARE ſhould be taken to chuſe a healthy woman, not more than thirty years of age, who has already ſuckled one child, and who has not lain-in above two or three months, and has plenty of good milk, which is judged to be ſo, when it is white, full of cream, ſweet, and of a moderate conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; if it be too wheyey or thick, yellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh, ſalt, hot, or but in a ſmall quantity, it is a ſufficient reaſon to think it bad, and on that account to reject: the nurſe. The trials commonly made to determine the quality of the milk, are taſting it, and let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a drop fall into the eyes, when, if it makes the eyes ſmart, or does not leave a ſweetneſs on the tongue, it is good for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. We judge of its conſiſtence by the ſight, or letting a little of it run into the palm of the hand, and then ſtroking the other hand upon it, by which it is eaſily known whether the milk is of a proper conſiſtence. Great regard ſhould be paid to the diet of the nurſe: ſhe ought to be very ſober and temperate; ſhe ſhould eat one hearty meal of fleſh-meat, with a good deal of garden-ſtuff and bread, every day, broth, milk, tea, or chocolate, are beſt for
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0165600400:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>her breakfaſt. Her drink ſhould be ſmall-beer, or milk and water; wine and ſtrong-beer ſhould be carefully avoided, ſince giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpirituous liquors to a nurſe, is, in reali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, giving them to the child, the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of which may be eaſily foreſeen. Tho' moderate exerciſe is, in general, uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in preſerving the health of nurſes, yet it is impoſſible to lay down general rules on this ſubject, as we muſt of neceſſity, in this caſe, comply with their uſual cuſtom and diſpoſition. It is commonly thought, that long ſleep is advantageous, and can never be prejudicial; but this opinion is wrongly founded, ſince too long ſleep is ſucceeded by heavineſs, ſtupidity, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy, whereas vivacity, and gaiety of diſpoſition, are qualities conſtantly required in nurſes, which it is impoſſible to find in a woman who ſleeps twelve or fourteen hours every night.</p>
                  <p>Another error is, that nurſes ſhould be abſolutely deprived of the conjugal embraces of their huſbands, leſt they ſhould become pregnant, and the infant, ſuck bad milk; but ſince medicinal obſervations prove, that the fruſtrating this appetite is attended often with dangerous conſequences, and I do not believe, that its being moderately gratified, has been ever attended with the leaſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience, with reſpect to health; I ſee
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0165600400:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>no reaſon for forbidding nurſes the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of their huſbands, provided that the nurſe is changed, if ſhe ſhould prove with child.</p>

               <p>THE food of infants on their being weaned, ought certainly to be propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned to the weakneſs of their digeſtive organs, contrary to the opinion of Mr. Locke, who adviſes children to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to the coarſeſt aliments, but the inconveniences, and danger attending this method are very evident, ſince indigeſtions, and all the diſorders ariſing from them, threaten the infant who is fed with nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which its weak ſtomach cannot thoroughly digeſt, ſince the digeſtive power is very weak in young children. Their principal nouriſhment at firſt ſhould conſiſt of broths, but little ſeaſoned, of the beſt white bread well baked, of rice gruel, barley broth, water-gruel, panada, or pap made with bread inſtead of flower: baked
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0165600400:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>apples, pears, cherries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> this permiſſion muſt not extend to plums, apricots, peaches, figs, melons, almonds and nuts, which are by repeated obſervations, found to be very pernicious; they may be allowed bread and butter, now and then, provided the butter be quite ſweet and freſh, and all the produce of the kitchen garden, for all theſe things are wholeſome and good for them, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the common notion of their being windy, which they are only to ſtomachs whoſe tone is ſpoilt by the uſe of high ſeaſoned ſauces, ragouts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The child ſhould be weaned when about a twelvemonth old, which the nurſe ſhould do by rubbing her nipple with a little aloes, or any other bitter, or drug, which has a ſtrong diſagreeable ſmell, this diſguſts the infant, who cries, is uneaſy, and frets at the loſs of a food he has ſo long been uſed to. The nurſe muſt be careful not to let the uneaſineſs of the child prevail on her to change her reſolution, and give the child the breaſt again, for the diſpoſition of body contracted from hunger, fretting, and crying, will hinder the child from properly digeſting the milk, and a vomiting, and troubleſome looſeneſs will certainly enſue. The child at firſt ſhould not be too often fed, nor too much food given it at once, the moſt proper nouriſhment will be panada, or rice gruel,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0165600400:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſince the ſame ill conſequences will attend feeding the child too much, as we obſerved would follow the miſguided tenderneſs of the nurſe, in giving ſuck to children, whom they have begun to wean. 'Tis impoſſible to uſe too much precaution in bringing the ſtomach to looſe its habit of digeſting no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but milk, the uſe of which ſhould always be inſenſibly left off: from milk the child ſhould paſs to panada, rice-gruel, or water gruel, from theſe to broths, and meat by degrees. A mixture ought never to be made of nouriſhments that are not of the ſame nature, and of an equal conſiſtence, and particularly nurſes ought to obſerve, not to give the infant more ſolid food, than can ſupply by its nutritious particles, the place of the milk it took before. The leanneſs which accompanies the weaning of children is a ſalutary change, it is the effect of the emptying of the ſmall veſſels, filled with a milky juice, that is to give place to a more nouriſhing lymph of another nature, and a more ſolid conſiſtence; reaſon therefore, here agrees with experience, in convincing us that we are to blame to conſider the ſtate of thoſe infants as fatal and dangerous, who become leſs plump after their being weaned, ſince moſt of the diſeaſes children are ſubject to at the time of their being weaned, are owing to the too great quantity of food
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0165600400:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>given them on their being deprived of milk. A looſeneſs, and feveriſh diſorders in young children, are thought to require the uſe of opiates, but where they proceed from weaning, the uſe of ſyrup of diacodion, and other narcotics, cannot be too much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, as the diet alone, when properly managed, is moſt uſeful for the different diſorders that happen to infants when they are weaned, for the ſcurfs, ſcabs, and other diſorders that then ariſe, will diſappear of themſelves, if the nurſe has patience to wait for it.</p>

               <p>ABOUT the fifth or ſixth month after the birth, the cutting of the teeth is plainly diſcovered by the mouth of the infant being overflowed with ſpittle. Their gums ſwell, grow red, and inflamed, cauſed by the growing up of the teeth, which it is neceſſary to favour, by leſſening the reſiſtance of the gums, which oppoſe their riſing up; it is right therefore to compreſs the gums againſt the teeth, which are to paſs through them, to do which the nurſe ſhould paſs and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0165600400:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>repaſs her finger, over the edge of the gums, and preſs, and rub them more or leſs ſtrongly, as circumſtances may require; for theſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions which are very proper to calm the painful tickling, the infant feels in the gums, anſwer the principal view with which they are propoſed, the forcing a paſſage through the gums, for the teeth; the infant is ſo deſirous to prevent this diſagreeable ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that he gnaws his fingers, and rolls in his mouth, whatever he can get hold of, from this circumſtance people have invented the uſe of corals, which ſhould be tied with a ribband round the waiſt, to prevent their being loſt, or being thruſt too far down the child's throat: Breeding of teeth is fatal to many children, but not naturally ſo, for whatever fits, fever, or other dangerous ſymptoms, attend this work of nature, are generally the effects of too great fullneſs, or the corrupt humours of the body put into agitation, by the ſtimulus of the pain the tooth cauſes, in forcing its way thro' the gums, which never happens without ſome pain, and poſſibly a little fever, but if the blood and juices are perfectly ſweet and good, both will be but flight, and paſs off imperceptibly without any bad conſequence whatever, and healthy children ſometimes breed their teeth without any ſuch bad
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0165600400:22" rendition="simple:additions"/>attendants, which gives us reaſon to think the evil is not natural, but commonly brought on thro' the imprudent manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the nurſe.</p>

               <p>CHILDREN are ſubject to many diſeaſes, peculiar to the ſtate of infancy, beſides thoſe they are liable to in common with grown perſons, and whoever examines with attention, thoſe ſymptoms in children, which plainly occur to the ſenſes, and compares them with the ſimplicity of their diet, and the extreme delicacy of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, will find that the method of treating the diſorders of children with propriety, is by no means ſo difficult as is commonly imagined, for the diſeaſes of infancy are few in their kind, and differ only in degree from one another. If we conſider the nature of the fluids in children, we ſhall find that they never degenerate from their natural ſtate, into any thing elſe than an acid acrimony, for whatever diſorder they labour under, their excrements have almoſt always a ſour ſmell, and the ſame may be obſerved of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0165600400:23" rendition="simple:additions"/>their belchings, in ſhort all the complaints of infants ſpring from an acid cauſe. But little can be learnt in the diſeaſes of infants from their pulſe, or urine, our whole in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence muſt proceed from the nurſe; who can eaſily tell whether the child has been troubled with a vomiting, with reſtleſſneſs, pains in the belly, ſour belchings, hiccups, or cough, whether they are coſtive or looſe, the colour of their ſtools, whether white, green, or bilious, whether they are remarkably thirſty, and conſequently feveriſh, whether they have the thruſh, or convulſions in any part of their bodies, whether there appears any ſwelling in their belly, or any other part, whether they have any eruptions, or ſpots on the ſkin, or whether the ſkin is yellowiſh, or red. Theſe enquiries are in general ſufficient to enable the perſons who have the care of children to preſcribe for them with ſucceſs, for with reſpect to the pulſe, it is in children naturally ſo very quick and ſo eaſily diſturbed by the moſt trifling accident, that perſons unacquainted with this circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, would think them always in a fever. Beſides children when ſick are ſo peeviſh, and fretful, that ſcarce any of them can be prevailed on to hold their arm ſteady, long enough for a phyſician to feel their pulſe, in ſhort ſo many accidents quicken or diſturb the circulation of the blood in young
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0165600400:24" rendition="simple:additions"/>children, that the judgement from their pulſe is too precarious, to be in any reſpect depended upon. Nor can any thing more certain be gathered from their urine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in children in health, it is always very thick, ſo that any ignorant perſon upon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting it, would be apt to ſuſpect the child to be very much diſordered, while on the contrary he enjoys a perfect, ſtate of health, beſides the urine of children is ſeldom to be examined, unmixed with the excrements. The cauſes which immediately relate to the production of childrens diſeaſes may be referred to the following heads, 1ſt. to cold, 2dly. to thick milk, 3dly. to allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them too early to eat meat, 4thly. to giving them ſpirituous liquors: Cold catched in the evening, is certainly the occaſion of thoſe feveriſh indiſpoſitions, with which children are ſo often afflicted, therefore proper care ſhould be taken, to provide children with cloaths ſufficiently warm, ſuitable to their age, to defend them from the injuries of the air. Too thick milk may be occaſioned from many different cauſes, but this vitious quality of the milk from whatever cauſe it ariſes, muſt produce many bad effects, and inevitably lay the foundation of fatal obſtructions. Perſons of all ages ſhould be careful with regard to their diet, but the diet of infants, ſhould
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0165600400:25" rendition="simple:additions"/>be managed with the greateſt caution, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they moſt eaſily ſuffer from errors of this kind, and want ſtrength, to reſiſt their pernicious conſequences, the uſing children too ſoon to eat fleſh, is the cauſe of thoſe indigeſtions, which conſtantly attend that voracious age, and if their food be crude, and hard to be digeſted, their humours muſt likewiſe be crude, from whence not only worms will be bred, but a variety alſo of perplexing, and untoward ſymptoms, under which they frequently pine and languiſh. Wine and ſpirituous liquors are ſerviceable to old people, to ſupply the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral warmth, which is always languid in that ſtate of life, but on this very account, muſt be prejudicial to children, ſince they are much warmer than grown perſons, and every kind of ſpirituous liquor, vitiates the tone of their ſtomach, ſpoils their appetite, burns up their nerves, and deſtroys their delicate ſtructure, by continual feveriſh heats.</p>
               <p>To lay a rational foundation for the cure of the diſeaſes incident to infants, the tenderneſs and weakneſs of their conſtitution muſt be conſidered, and to theſe the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines muſt carefully be adapted, the milder the remedies made uſe of, the greater the probability of ſucceſs, for as their diet is ſimple, ſo ought their medicines to be ſimple too, it has been already obſerved that moſt
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0165600400:26" rendition="simple:additions"/>of their diſorders ariſe from acidity, the method of cure therefore depends entirely on removing this cauſe, which is effected by giving them teſtaceous powders, ſuch as prepared oyſter ſhells, prepared coral, and the like, which are of a perfectly mild nature, and efficaciouſly abſorb any prevalent acidity, they are alſo anodines, and never fail to give eaſe to children, when griped, much more certainly than the ſyrup of white poppies or diacodion, which tho' ſo often adviſed by old nurſes, can never be given with ſafety; the only inconvenience attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the free uſe of theſe teſtaceous powders, is that they are apt to occaſion a coſtiveneſs, which is always prejudicial to young chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, the uſe of them therefore requires every now and then, a little manna, or a ſew grains of rhubarb, which is particularly ſuited to childrens conſtitutions, for it gently and ſafely evacuates the febrific matter, purges the ſtomach and whole body, of any vitiated humours, and reſtores the tone of the bowels; but perhaps no other remedy, is equal to a fine inſipid powder, called Magneſia Alba, which at the ſame time, that it corrects, and ſweetens all acidities, even more effectually than the teſtaceous powders, is likewiſe a very gentle purgative, and keeps the body moderately open without
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0165600400:27" rendition="simple:additions"/>any other aſſiſtance: It may be given children from a ſcruple to a quarter of an ounce in a day, a little at a time in all their food, till the acidities are quite deſtroyed, and the diſorders ariſing therefrom entirely removed, it has been very frequently adminiſtred with ſurprizing benefit, even when children have been reduced to the laſt extremity, by diſeaſes proceeding from acidities, and may be eaſily procured at almoſt every apothecaries ſhop, at a very moderate price.</p>

The method of returning it into the body, is by laying the child on its belly, and gently preſſing the gut, with the infant's buttocks, but if this does not ſucceed, and the gut hangs out a conſiderable way, the nurſe ſhould then gently apply the finger moiſtned with a little freſh butter, to the end of the gut, and by little and little, incloſe it in its own cavity, in a proper direction, and then drawing out the finger with care, repeat the ſame operation if the firſt did not entirely replace the bowel; to prevent a return of this complaint, reſtringent fomentations muſt be applied frequently, the following is as good as can poſſibly be contrived for that purpoſe.</p>

There can be no danger happen to the child from this operation, but on the contrary, many have died for the want of it.

                  <head>Rickets.</head>
                  <p>This diſtemper moſt frequently affects children from nine months old, to two years and an half. The child at the beginning is ſeized with an averſion to motion, of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of any kind; the joints grow feeble and weak, and the fleſh ſoft and flaccid; the head is over large, and the child's capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0165600400:49" rendition="simple:additions"/>city exceeds its years. The belly is hard and very prominent; the bones of the arms, and legs, grow crooked, and are knotty at the joints; a cough comes on and difficulty of breathing; the pulſe is low and languid, and an hectic fever carries off the child. Take of the beſt manna a drachm and an half, of dried raiſins an handful, common ale a pint; infuſe them together for twelve hours, and then ſtrain them; let the child drink a draught of this frequently. The exerciſes moſt proper for ricketty children are, thoſe which give the greateſt and moſt equal motion to the body, provided they are not too violent. Children ought to be accuſtomed to the gentleſt kind at firſt, when they are weak, and afterwards by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, to ſuch as give more exerciſe to the body: Friction above every thing muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be neglected, eſpecially on the back, and thoſe parts which are apt to be the weakeſt; and the following ointment may be rubbed with advantage all over the back. Take the nerve ointment, and palm oil, each an ounce, oil of mace one drachm, compound lavender-drops two drachms, ſpirits of ſal armoniac forty drops, oil of amber twenty drops, mix them into a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niment, with which the parts affected may be anointed with a warm hand, two or three times in a day: the child may alſo take
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0165600400:50" rendition="simple:additions"/>two grains of Ens Veneris in a ſpoonful of wine and water, every night; iſſues cut between the ſecond, and third joint of the neck, are of great ſervice, to theſe methods muſt be joined, cold bathing and exerciſe, without which, no complete cure can be made.</p>

                  <p>The diet in this diſorder ſhould be thin and attenuating, light and eaſy of digeſtion, and all ſalt and ſmoke-dried meats ought to be carefully avoided; as alſo, all things in general which are hard of digeſtion, or yield indifferent nourishment; the air ſhould be pure, ſweet, and dry, and the body ſhould be kept moderately open. Take a ſcruple of burnt ſponge, and four grains of rhubarb, mix them together for one doſe, which is to be taken twice in a day, drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after each doſe, a glaſs of ſea-water; or ten grains of the ſea-oak calcined, may be taken night and morning, with a glaſs of ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water, or warm whey, ſweetned with ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rup of violets; lime-water is a good auxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liary in ſcrophulous caſes, and ſometimes, a great deal of good has been done by the

The moſt approved method of removing the inflammation and obſtruction, is to put the child's finger for a conſiderable time, in a cup full of ſpirits of wine and camphor, ſeveral times in a day, or frequently to dip the finger in ſcald<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hot water: if the child finds relief by either of theſe means, it ſhould perſiſt in the uſe of them, 'till the finger is quite well, and free from pain; if not, a pultice of white bread and milk, or chewed bread and butter, muſt be applied to the finger 'till the whitloe is ripe, when it muſt be launced, and dreſt every night and morning, with a pledget of lint, dipped in ſome melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed yellow baſilicon.</p>

                  <p>When warts disfigure children, they ſhould be removed by touching them every day, with a feather dipped in ſpirits of ſea-ſalt, and in order to prevent its acting upon the ſkin around them, care ſhould be taken to cover it with a diachylon plaiſter, that has a hole in the middle for the wart to come through; this precaution, which is neceſſary, for warts ſpread over the ſurface of the body, ought to be more ſcrupulouſly obſerved, when theſe excreſſences are placed on the eye-lids, otherwiſe, there is danger of destroying the child's ſight, by endeav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouring to remove a trifling deformity.</p>
