            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The Reaſons for leaving the blank Spaces under the printed, are to be filled up juſt before ſailing; for as the Markets are ſo fluctuating, ſometimes an Article is in very little Demand, and perhaps in a Week or a Month after, it may advance 10 or 20 per Cent. Alſo the contrary may happen, that if this Book was made up two or three Months before ſailing, an Article might Drop conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably, and then he takes too high a Price to <hi>India.</hi>

               <p>If any Dirt, Stones, or other Rubbiſh is in the Package, which very often happens to the very beſt, the Value is uncertain; therefore, what you buy, let it be fine and clear; and if it be not ſo, ſort it in the Country, taking it out of the Skins, and freeing it from Stones, Dirt and Rubbiſh; for which, if you import it, you muſt pay the Duty, which is very high, and the

               <p>Is the Bark of the baſtard Cinnamon Tree, There are ſeveral Sorts, but the beſt brought home lately was from <hi>China,</hi> which was ſmall long round Sticks, nearly of the Colour and Flavour of real Cinnamon, and is uſed in its ſtead. It cannot be too thin, for if the Bark is thick, though it be equally ſtrong and pungent on the Palate, it will only do for diſtilling, and therefore not near ſo valuable.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Sort of Caſſia Lignea is generally got at <hi>Batavia</hi> and <hi>Ben. oclen,</hi> and is of two Sorts, one a very ſmall Twig, about a Foot long, of a ſtronger pungent Flavour than Cinnamon, and ſold from £15 to £20 per Cwt. The other Sort is in thick long Sticks, and nearly as pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent; but the ſhape and colour makes it not ſo valuable, and only ſells from £5 to £8 per Cwt.</p>
               <p>The way to diſcover the true Cinnamon Sort is to chew it, when, if it is muſilaginous or ſlimy in the mouth, it is not near ſo valuable, though it is often ſtronger than real Cinnamon, but will foul the Cinnamon Water made from it. There is alſo Caſſia Lignea that is of a very bright Colour and good Shape, which has little or no ſmell or Taſte; the breaking a handful of Sticks will aſcertain the Quality almoſt as well as taſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for where there is a fine Smell, there is always a ſtrong Taſte.</p>
