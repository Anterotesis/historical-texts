            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Nature of this Work ſeeming to render ſomething of a Preface neceſſary, I ſhall, for that Reaſon, intirely dedicate it to the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the Reader, in as few Words as poſſibly I can.</p>
            <p>Having formerly written a ſhort Eſſay u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the Royal Family of <hi>STEWART,</hi> to which was prefixed an Hiſtorical Account and Deſcription of the Shire of <hi>Renfrew:</hi> I had no ſooner publiſh'd that little Book; than ſeveral Perſons of eminent Diſtinction for their Learning and Knowledge in the Antiquities of the Nation, for whoſe Judgment I had the moſt profound Regard, ſet upon me to write <hi>A Peerage of SCOTLAND,</hi> a Book very much wanted; which at length, by their Importunity and promiſed Aſſiſtance, I was prevailed with to undertake.</p>
            <p>When I firſt ſet about this Work, as I did entirely devote and dedicate my Time to the Study of Antiquities, particularly thoſe of our own Country, ſo I made it my Buſineſs to collect all thoſe Hiſtorical and Genealogical Tracts that had been done on the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, that I could come to the Knowledge of. The Oldeſt of that Kind I have met with, was a few looſe Sheets on the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nealogies
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0390900200:3"/>
of our Nobility, ſaid to be done by <hi>James</hi> Lord <hi>Ochil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree,</hi> in the Hands of my very worthy Friend, and one of our beſt Antiquaries, Mr. <hi>Baillie</hi> of <hi>Caſtlecary;</hi> but the Accounts even of the few Families that Lord treats of, are very lame; and I obſerve where he goes much higher than his own Time, they are purely traditional, and therefore I could not depend on them.</p>
            <p>I peruſed alſo the large Genealogical Collections concerning the Nobility, by Sir <hi>James Balfour,</hi> who was Lord Lyon King at Arms, in the Reign of King <hi>Charles</hi> I. but they are written ſo very looſely, and I have ſeen them contradicted ſo frequently by Writs and Charters, that I give them but little Credit. I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe Sir <hi>James</hi> never intended theſe Papers ſhould have gone fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than his own Cloſet, for he was a Learned and Curious Gentleman, as appears from his Annals, in which he is much more exact, eſpecially as to what occurred in his own Time.</p>
            <p>I procured likewiſe a Copy of the Hiſtorical Eſſay on the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Families of the Kingdom, Alphabetically digeſted, by the learned Lord Advocate, Sir <hi>George Mackenzie</hi> of <hi>Roſehaugh;</hi> but I apprehend theſe Papers have been only ſome firſt Draught of a greater Work Sir <hi>George</hi> intended, which he lived not to finiſh: Of this there are many Copies in ſeveral Hands, the moſt exact by very far of any of them I have ſeen, was that which I had the Uſe of from <hi>Thomas Crawfurd</hi> of <hi>Cartsburn,</hi> my Brother, who by his own Reading and Knowledge in the Antiquities of the Nation, has rectified a great many of Sir <hi>George</hi>'s Miſtakes, at leaſt of his Amanuenſis, and has with great Accuracy, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belliſhed his own Copy with a vaſt deal of fine Hiſtorical Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks, that it well deſerves the Character of a curious Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuſcript.</p>
            <p>I had moreover a Sight of the Genealogies of the Nobility, collected by Mr. <hi>Dunlop,</hi> the late Principal of the College of <hi>Glaſgow,</hi> who was Hiſtoriographer for <hi>Scotland,</hi> a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of great Integrity and Learning, and an excellent Antiquary. I underſtand he intended to have written <hi>A Peerage of SCOT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LAND,</hi> and for that End made very full Collections on that Subject: But I obſerve that moſt of Mr. <hi>Dunlop</hi>'s Accounts are compoſed of thoſe Genealogical Deſcents that the Nobility have in their own Families, and are handed about by their Friends; and that ingenious Gentleman did with great Accuracy and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0390900200:4"/>
add Hiſtorical Memoirs to the Genealogies, which give them a great Ornament; and he is very exact as to his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities. The M.S. was communicated to me by my very worthy Friend, Mr. <hi>Dunlop,</hi> the preſent Profeſſor of <hi>Greek</hi> in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of <hi>Glaſgow,</hi> the Principal's Son.</p>
            <p>But after I had made all thoſe Collections I have mentioned, and a great deal more of that Kind, I cannot ſtay to particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larize, I found I had not any tolerable Foundation for the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying on the Work I had undertaken, for the Honour of the Country, (the Deſign it was principally for) or my own Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; and therefore, by the Advice and Direction of my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious Friends, who had engaged me in the Deſign, I did with as much Humility and Modeſty as I was Maſter of, addreſs every Peer by myſelf or ſome Friend, for the Aſſiſtance of their own Charters and Writings, to enable me to do their Families Juſtice in this Undertaking.</p>
            <p>Such Helps as I ſought were very generouſly afforded me by the greater Part of the Nobility, who allowed me the Peruſal of their Charter-Cheſts and original Writings, from which I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the Accounts of their Families as they ſtand in my Book. Severals indeed I did not ſee; ſome were unwilling to ſhew their Family Writs for divers Reaſons, ſome were Minors, others were Abroad, and out of the Country; and even to ſuch I have done all the Juſtice was poſſibly in my Power. But if the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts of ſuch Families, whoſe Charters I have not had Acceſs to, be ſhorter and leſs connected than others, that was what cannot be ſuppoſed I could help: I took Care timeouſly to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſe every Body concerned, and if they did not incline to ſhew me their Writs, the Blame cannot be laid on me.</p>
            <p>But that I might be the better able to carry on the Work I had undertaken with Advantage, and to form Accounts of thoſe noble Families whoſe Writs I had not ſeen, and to ſupply, if a <hi>Hiatus</hi> did happen, (as it frequently did) in ſuch Families whoſe Writings I had peruſed I ſearched all the Publick Offices and Libraries about <hi>Edinburgh</hi>
               <note n="a" place="bottom">By the Publick Offices I mean the Regiſters of the Great Seal, which I peruſed from the Charters of King <hi>Robert</hi> I. down to our own Times, in the Laigh Parliament-Houſe, and in the Chancery; I look'd over alſo the Records of the Juſticiary, and all the Chartularies in the Lawyers Library.</note>, and noted every Thing as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0390900200:5"/>
as I could; and the Keepers of theſe Offices were ſo obliging as to allow me Acceſs at all Hours, ordinary and extraordinary, whenever I call'd, and to whom therefore I do, with all due Gratitude, return my moſt humble and hearty Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>But after all my Labour, I am ſo far from being ſo vain as to imagine this Eſſay is not capable of any further Improvement, that on the contrary I am ſenſible, I have, thro' Inadvertency, and the Errors of the Preſs, eſpecially in Dates and Proper Names of the preſent Age, fallen into many Miſtakes; but I beg the ingenious Reader will pardon theſe Omiſſions, which are inevitable in ſuch Books, and where he diſcovers an Error, he will correct it with his Pen.</p>
            <p>Perhaps ſome may think, that I have been fuller upon ſome Families, (even ſome that are extinct) than on others who are much more ancient than thoſe I enlarge more upon. The Reaſon is plain, the Repreſentatives, Relations, or Deſcendents of thoſe noble Families ſhew'd me their Writs, and encouraged my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign. If others had done ſo, I doubt not but I ſhould have been able to have done them as full, and vouched them as well. For I can ſay, and do here declare on the Word of a Gentleman, That I had no Regard in the doing of Juſtice in my Province as an Author, to the Encouragement I received from any Man, otherwiſe than to reckon myſelf very much obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to ſuch; and I own I did not ſpare either Time or Pains to diſcover any Particular, I thought could give an Ornament to the Antiquity, or a Luſtre to the Honour of their Families.</p>
            <p>But where I have been aſſiſted from the Publick Records or Authentick Hiſtory, I have been as full on thoſe Families who never incouraged the Deſign, as I have been upon thoſe who gave me the greateſt Aſſiſtance every Way; and for the Truth of this, I can and do appeal to ſeverals of the Nobility them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, who will find very long deduced, and well vouched De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcents of their Families, in this Peerage, who never encouraged my Undertaking in any Degree. But as I ſaid before, That I had had no Reſpect to; for my chief and only Regard was, and ſhall be Truth, and the Honour of our Country, as far as I am capable to diſcover the one, or defend the other.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:0390900200:6"/>
As to the Work it ſelf, I ſhall ſay nothing: But after ſo great Labour, and Expence of Time, the Eſſay (being new and never before attempted) how defective ſoever it may be, I cannot but hope, will meet with a favourable Reception from the Ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and more particularly have the Approbation and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of Perſons of Diſtinction, who frequently read ſuch Books, and know how uſeful and acceptable Undertakings of this Kind have ever been accounted in all the Polite Nations of <hi>Europe.</hi>

            <p>The Earl of <hi>Fife</hi> and <hi>Menteth</hi> was a Perſon of great Parts and Spirit, which he manifeſted in all his Actions, both in Peace and War. His Father the King had ſo great an Eſteem of his Abilities, that in his old Age, he made him Governor of <hi>Scotland;</hi> and he continued in the Adminiſtration till the Death of the King.</p>
            <p>Upon the Acceſſion of his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Robert</hi> III. to the Crown, the King being aged and valitudinary, thought fit to continue the Earl of <hi>Fife</hi> his Brother in the Regency, and further dignified him with the Title of Duke of <hi>Albany, Anno</hi> 1399, and he diſcharged that great Truſt very well throughout the Whole of his Brother's Reign; and the Prince King <hi>James</hi> I. being a Priſoner in <hi>England</hi> at the Time of his Father's Death, the Duke came of Right to be Governor of the Kingdom, and he enjoyed the Office till his Death, <hi>September</hi> 3d, <hi>Anno</hi> 1420.</p>
            <p>He married firſt <hi>Margaret,</hi> Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Heir of the Earl of <hi>Menteth</hi> aforeſaid, by whom he had <hi>Murdack</hi> his Succeſſor, and ſeveral Daughters, <hi>Iſobel</hi> married to <hi>Alexander</hi> Earl of <hi>Roſs,</hi> and again to Sir <hi>Walter Halli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burton</hi> of <hi>Dirleton, Marjory</hi> to Sir <hi>Duncan Campbell</hi> of <hi>Lochow,</hi> and <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth</hi> to Sir <hi>Malcolm Fleming</hi> of <hi>Big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar;</hi> next, <hi>Mauriella,</hi> Daughter of Sir <hi>William Keith</hi> Mareſchal of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> by her he had <hi>John</hi> Earl of <hi>Buchan,</hi> and Sir <hi>Robert Stewart</hi> Kt.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Albany</hi> was ſucceeded by <hi>Murdack</hi> his Son, both in his Eſtate and in the Government of <hi>Scotland,</hi> but he came very far ſhort of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for being a weak Man, and of ſmall Parts, was ſcarce able to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern his own Family, much leſs the Kingdom: But that which ſhould attone for all his Overſights, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve his Memory from all unkind Reflections, was the glorious Part he acted, in conducing ſo much toward the Reſtauration of King <hi>James</hi> I. in which he was the great Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Not long thereafter, the King growing jealous of the Duke's Power, which no doubt was very great, and diſcovering ſome treaſonable Intrigue in which he was concern'd, he was firſt put under Arreſt, and ſent Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to the Caſtle of <hi>Carlaverock;</hi> and being ſhortly after brought to his Trial, he was found guilty of High-Treaſon by his Peers, for which he loſt his Head on the 19th <hi>May</hi> 1425.</p>
            <p>This great but unfortunate Duke, married <hi>Iſobel,</hi> Daughter and Heir of <hi>Duncan</hi> Earl of <hi>Lennox,</hi> by whom he had Sir <hi>Walter,</hi> and <hi>Alexander,</hi> who being found acceſſory to their Father's Treaſon, both ſuffer'd Death for the ſame, and Sir <hi>James</hi> who fled to <hi>Ireland,</hi> where he ſpent the after Part of his unfortunate Life, and left a Son behind him, Sir <hi>Andrew Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>art</hi> of <hi>Stratheven,</hi> who came over to <hi>Scotland</hi> in the Time of King <hi>James</hi> II. who afterward roſe to great Wealth and Honour, and laid the Foundation of the Family of <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale</hi> and <hi>Ochiltree.</hi>

He left Iſſue by <hi>Katharine,</hi> Daughter of <hi>William</hi> Earl of <hi>Orkney,</hi> from whom he was divorced, a Son <hi>Alexander,</hi> who was declared illegitimate, and thereupon he enter'd into Orders, and was made Biſhop of <hi>Murray.</hi> Alſo by <hi>Anne</hi> his ſecond Wife, Daughter

               <hi>John</hi> Duke of <hi>Albany,</hi> to whom the Adminiſtration of the Affairs of the Kingdom was committed in the Minority of King <hi>James</hi> V. and he diſcharged that great Truſt with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible Conſtancy and Courage, till the King came to Age, that he reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into <hi>France,</hi> where he had a fair Fortune in Right of his Wife. In the Service of that Crown he exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed the higheſt military Commands under <hi>Francis</hi> I. with great Honour and Reputation, even till his Death, <hi>Anno</hi> 1536. The Title by Reaſon he had no lawful Iſſue, did extinguiſh with him.</p>
            <p>The next who had this Honour by Creation, was that comely and graceful Prince, <hi>Henry</hi> Lord <hi>Darnly,</hi> whom Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> a few Days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe took him to be her Husband, did with great Solemnity inveſt in the Title of Duke of <hi>Albany;</hi> which ceas'd again upon his Marriage, that he was proclaim'd King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and had his Name put upon the Coin with the Queen's; <hi>Henricus &amp; Maria Rex &amp; Regina</hi> Scotorum.</p>
            <p>Prince <hi>Charles,</hi> the ſecond Son of King <hi>James</hi> VI. was in the Third Year of his Age, <hi>Anno</hi> 1601, created Duke of <hi>Albany,</hi> and he bore the Title till by the Death of that incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable Prince, Prince <hi>Henry</hi> his elder Brother, he became Prince and Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard of <hi>Scotland, Anno</hi> 1612; after which this Title lay dormant, till his Majeſty King <hi>Charles</hi> II. on the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtauration, did create his Royal Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>James</hi> Duke of <hi>York,</hi> Duke of <hi>Albany,</hi> by Letters Patent 31ſt of <hi>December</hi> 1660<note n="a" place="bottom">Charta in Pub.

            <p>

               <hi>Eliſabeth</hi> to <hi>Alexander</hi> Viſcount of <hi>Kingſtoun,</hi> he departing this Life in 1679, the Honour devolved upon <hi>John Hamilton</hi> Son to Sir <hi>Robert Ha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>milton</hi> of <hi>Preſmanan,</hi> proceeding on his Reſignation ſome Years before.</p>
            <p>Which <hi>John</hi> Lord <hi>Belhaven,</hi> I find did particularly ſignalize himſelf both in the Parliament 1681 and 1685, diſcovering then a firm Reſolution to ſupport the Proteſtant Religion. In 1689 he aſſiſted at the meeting of the <hi>Scots</hi> Nobility at <hi>London,</hi> and concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with them in addreſſing the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> to call a Convention of the Eſtates in <hi>Scotland</hi> for the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the Government there.</p>
            <p>His Lordſhip was preſent at the Convention, where he contributed much to the ſetling the Crown upon King <hi>William</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> who upon their Acceſſion thereto, conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted him one of their Privy Council, and one of the Commiſſioners for exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting the Office of Regiſter.</p>
            <p>Upon Her Majeſty's acceſſion to the Throne, he was named a Privy Counſellour, and after that, one of the Commiſſioners of the Theſaury, which he executed with no little Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation.</p>
            <p>In the Parliament 1706, when the Union came to be debated, he joined with thoſe who oppoſed it, and on this Subject made ſeveral learned and elaborate Speeches containing his Reaſons, for which Poſterity will celebrate his Name with Honour as a Patriot of his Country.</p>
            <p>He married <hi>Margaret</hi> Daughter of Sir <hi>Robert Hamilton</hi> of <hi>Silvertoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill,</hi> by <hi>Anne</hi> Daughter of <hi>John</hi> Lord <hi>Belhaven,</hi> by whom he had only two Sons,</p>

able to ſerve the King with the Church, he was appointed Commiſſioner to the General Aſſembly, <hi>Anno</hi> 1641, wherein he propoſed very temperate Counſels, and earneſtly recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Clergy, that in return of all his Majeſty's Favours toward their Church, they would make Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence by their Doctrine and Example to keep the People in their Duty to God and the King, during the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Times of Anarchy and Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation.

            <p>1. <hi>Alexander,</hi> who ſucceeded in the Honour, but dyed unmarried.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Charles,</hi> killed aboard the Fleet in the great Sea Fight againſt the <hi>Dutch, Anno</hi> 1672.</p>

            <p>This Name has been remarkable in our <hi>Scots</hi> Hiſtory on ſeveral other Occaſions, particularly Sir <hi>Alexander Scrimgeor,</hi> was among the firſt who took the Field for King <hi>Robert Bruce,</hi> and faithfully adhered to him; in Conſideration whereof, when that valiant Prince came to be eſtabliſhed on the Throne, he gave him ſundry Lands about the Burgh of <hi>Innerkeith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> then in the Crown, by the Attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Sir <hi>Philip de Moubray,</hi> Knight.

I need not be at much Pains to ſhow the ſeveral Matches they have made with ſome of the moſt noble Families of this Kingdom, ſince the whole Courſe of this Book makes mention thereof, only I ſhall take notice, that in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of Time, after having flouriſhed long in the State of Barons, they came to the Honour of Peerage the in Perſon of Sir <hi>James Scrimgeor</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable of <hi>Dundee,</hi> who was raiſed to the Honour of Viſcount of <hi>Duddop,</hi> by King <hi>Charles</hi> I. in the Year 1641.

            <p>A Thane in Ancient Times, is thought by the learned <hi>Spel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> and <hi>Selden,</hi> to have been the King's principal Miniſter in a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, no doubt inveſted with a Power of Adminiſtration of Juſtice, to which certain honourary Priviledges were annexed. 'Tis thought it was not at the firſt Inſtitution, properly a Title of Dignity, but of Service. They were of two kinds, either ſuch as ſerved the King in greater Places of Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency, who were called <hi>Thani Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jores,</hi> or <hi>Thani Regis,</hi> as the Thanes of <hi>Fife, Caithneſs, Argyle,</hi> and <hi>Murray</hi> were, theſe that ſerved under them were termed <hi>Thani Minores:</hi> But when the Title of <hi>Comes</hi> and <hi>Dux</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Hereditary (ſo the Learned are of Opinion) the Title and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges of <hi>Thani Majores</hi> did deſcend with the Lands from Fathers to their Children, tho the leſſer did not, yet they ſtill retained the old Name of Thanes and Thanedoms, as the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronies of <hi>Boyn</hi> in <hi>Ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Mr. <hi>Camden</hi> the great <hi>Engliſh</hi> Antiquary, and others of our own Country alſo, are miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken as to the Time of their Anceſtors coming to <hi>Scotland,</hi> as will appear afterward; but they aſſert, and with great Probability, That the firſt of this moſt noble Family was a Son of the Houſe of <hi>Chilingham</hi> (indeed the Armorial Bearing of both Families are ſtill the ſame); and 'tis obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable, that the Lands of <hi>Browfield,</hi> the firſt Inheritance of the <hi>Grays</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> ly in the County of <hi>Roxburgh</hi> or <hi>Teviotdale,</hi> at no great Diſtance from <hi>Chilingham</hi> in <hi>Northumberland,</hi> which Lands were given off in the Reign of King <hi>Robert</hi> I. to Sir <hi>Andrew Gray</hi> his Son, who, and his Poſterity enjoyed the ſame for ſeveral Generations, till <hi>Andrew</hi> Lord <hi>Gray,</hi> who was Juſtice-General in the Time of King <hi>James</hi> III. exchanged them with the Earl of <hi>Angus</hi> for <hi>Brughtie</hi>-Caſtle, <hi>Bagilo,</hi> and the Fiſhings thereof. Now, every Body knows, that ſome Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Counties of <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland</hi> in particular, were ſome Times poſſeſt by the Kings of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> and 'tis well known, that ſome of thoſe who held Lands of the Crown of <hi>Scotland,</hi> in the Northern Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties

of <hi>England</hi> had alſo Poſſeſſions within <hi>Scotland;</hi> the <hi>Bruces</hi> and <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liols,</hi> and many others did ſo: And when War broke out betwixt the Two Nations, the Families ſo ſtated divided among themſelves, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hered to either of the Kings in whoſe Dominions they had largeſt Poſſeſſions. Thus it is probable, that Sir <hi>Andrew Gray,</hi> the firſt whom we find on Record with us, adhered to King <hi>Robert the Bruce,</hi> whoſe Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject he was, upon the Account of his <hi>Scots</hi> Eſtate.

I find that George Falconer of Halkertoun died in the 1511, and was ſucceeded by David his Son, who married Marion Dunbar, Daughter of . . . . . . Dunbar of . . . . . . . and was ſucceeded by Alexander his Son, who improved his Eſtate, and purchaſed the Lands of Midletoun to his Family, in the 1539: He had to Wife Eliſabeth Daughter of Sir Archibald Douglaſs of Glenbervy, immediate Anceſtor to the preſent Duke of Douglaſs, and had by her Alexander Falconer of Halkertoun his ſucceſſor, Archibald Progenitor of Sir James Falconer of Pheſdo, Samuel of Kincorth, in Vic. de Elgin, William of Dinduff, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genitor of Mr. Colin Falconer firſt Biſhop of Argyle, and thereafter of Murray, in the Reign of King Charles II. Sir Alexander Falconer the next Baron of Halkertoun married Margaret Daughter to Patrick Lord Gray, by whom he had two Sons, Sir Alexander and Patrick Falconer of Newtoun, Anceſtor to Falconer of Montoun, in Vic. de Edinburgh. This Sir Alexander was by the after-mentioned Agnes Carnegy, Father to Sir Alexander Falconer the firſt Lord Halkertoun, and of two younger Sons, Sir David Falconer of Glen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>farquhar, and Sir John Falconer of Balmakellie, who was Maſter of the Mint in the Time of King Charles II. This Sir David Falconer of Glenfarquhar, had two Sons, Sir Alexander Falconer of Glenfarquhar, and Sir David Falconer of Newton, who was promoted to be one of the Senators of the College of Juſtice, Anno 1676, and Preſident of the Seſſion on the 5th of July 1682, whoſe Son and Heir is David Falconer of Newtoun <abbr>Eſq</abbr> in Vic. de Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cardin.</note>.

            <p>Sir <hi>Walter</hi> his Son was a Man of great Fame and Character, he had ſeveral Military Commands in the Service of <hi>Robert</hi> I. which he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd with great Diligence and Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, in Conſideration whereof, he had by that Prince's Grant a Charter of the Barony of <hi>Cadzow,</hi> to be held in as ample manner as Sir <hi>Gilbert</hi> his Father held the ſame: Alſo in the 9th of the ſame Reign, to reward his great Merit and acceptable Services, he had a Grant of the Barony of <hi>Machan-ſhire</hi> in the County of <hi>Lanark,</hi> which formerly belonged to <hi>John Cumin</hi> Knight. Further, in the 1324, the King beſtowed on him the Lands of <hi>Kinneil, Larber, Brimage,</hi> and <hi>Auld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cathie</hi> in the Shire of <hi>Linlithgow,</hi> and the very ſame Year the Lands of <hi>Kirkinder</hi> and <hi>Kirkowen</hi> in the County of <hi>Wigtoun,</hi> for good Services done and to be done by him, as the Charter bears. Thus by his Princes Bounty and Favour arriving to great Wealth and Honour, he ſtrengthened his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily by a very noble Alliance, taking to Wife <hi>Iſobel</hi> Daughter of <hi>William</hi> Earl of <hi>Roſs</hi>

                  </gap>t the Lady Mary the King's Siſter, was forced by her Brother to marry James Lord Hamilton, when Thomas Boyd Earl of Arran her Husband was alive: And this is generally believed by every Body who reads George Buchanan's Hiſtory, and enquire no more about it, but depend on our Affairs as wrote by him, who indeed, to do him Juſtice, was a very learned and polite Perſon, and has wrote the Hiſtory of Scotland not much inferior in Style to the beſt Roman Authors. I ſhall here offer what I have obſerved in relation to this Affair. All Hiſtories commend the Lady Mary's Affection to her Husband, and tell us, That ſhe could not be prevailed with to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake or deſert him when he fell into Diſgrace, but tranſported her ſelf with him into foreign Parts to ſhare with him in his Misfortunes, and ſojourned with him in Denmark and Flanders for ſome time, till ſhe underſtood from Scotland, that her Preſence and Solicitation with her Brother might prevail with him to ſuffer my Lord Arran to return home to his Native Country, and accordingly ſhe came to Scotland: But the King continuing inexorable, and the Lady detain'd from going abroad, the poor unfortunate Earl of Arran ſoon after died of Grief at Antwerp: She continuing a Widow till the 1474. is then, I find, married to James Lord Hamilton. Moreover, I'm told by Mr. Hamilton of Wiſhaw, that the Contract of Marriage is ſtill preſerved among the Archives of the Family, but I have not ſeen it; but there is a Charter in my hands dated the 12th of July 1474, to James Lord Hamilton and the Lady Mary Stewart the King's Siſter, of the Lands of Kinneil, &amp;c. Moreover, I think the Teſtimony of Mr John Ballenden Arch Dean of Murray, who was Co temporary with the Lady whom we find alive in the 1515, and for ought I know lived much longer, ought to be regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. He at the Command of King James V. tranſlated Hector Boethius Hiſtory of Scotland into Engliſh, printed in the Year 1536, under this Title, <hi>The Hiſtory and Cronicles of</hi> Scotland <hi>compleated, and newly corrected and amended by the reverend and noble Clerk Mr.</hi> Hector Boeis <hi>Canon of</hi> Aberdeen, <hi>tranſlated by Mr.</hi> John Ballenden <hi>Arch-Dean of</hi> Murray <hi>and Canon of</hi> Roſs. And there he ſays, Book 12 Cap 5. <hi>The first Daughter of King</hi> James II. <hi>was married to the Lord</hi> Boyd, <hi>of whom was begotten a Son, whilk was ſlain by the Lord</hi> Montgomery, <hi>and a Daughter mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to the Earl of</hi> Caſſils; <hi>and after the Death of the Lord</hi> Boyd, <hi>this Daughter of King</hi> James II. <hi>was married on the Lord</hi> Hamilton, <hi>and that way the Houſe of</hi> Hamilton <hi>is Decorit in the King</hi>'s <hi>Blood.</hi> I ſay, I think the Authority of this learned and ingenuous Author ſhould determine any Man of Judgment more than a poſterior Party-writer, ſuch as every one knows George Buchanan was, with all Deference to his Character otherways: For every Body may perceive, who reads his Book, that he takes all Opportunities to blacken and miſrepreſent this nob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>James</hi> Lord <hi>Hamilton</hi> was ſucceeded by <hi>James</hi> his Son, who was conſtituted one of the Lords of the Privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, <hi>Anno</hi> 1440; in which Station he continued, till from ſome Miſtake he entred into that memorable League with the Earls of <hi>Douglaſs, Roſs, Craw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>furd, Murray,</hi> and <hi>Ormond,</hi> wherein they ſolemnly ſwore never to deſert one another during their Lives; that Injuries done to any one of them, ſhould be conſidered as done to them all; that they ſhould concurr againſt whatſoever Perſons within or without the Realm, and ſpend their Lives, Goods and Fortunes in Defence of each other. But when Sir <hi>James Hamilton</hi> diſcerned their violent purpoſes againſt the King, he ſever'd himſelf from them, and returned to his Duty, whereupon enſued the ruin of the Earl of <hi>Douglaſs,</hi> who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in his Rebellion. In the Reign of King <hi>James</hi> III. he was no leſs conſidered and valued than he had been by the former King; for in the 1471, when a Treaty of Peace was ſet on foot with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> he was one of thoſe noble Perſons who met the Lord <hi>Howard</hi> and other Commiſſioners on the Part of the King of <hi>England,</hi> and treated of a

This may likeways ſerve to correct the Miſtake of thoſe Hiſtorians, who ſay, That when James Lord Hamilton married the Siſter of King James III, that he got with her the Earldom of Arran, which Marriage I have made evident, was in the 1474, and yet this Grant of the Earldom of Arran was not to him, nor his Son for Twenty Nine Years after the Marriage of his Father and Mother. From this we may remark how George Buchanan, and other Hiſtorians who copy from him, are to be relyed on, who take Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials and Vouchers of their Hiſtories from other Authors who have wrote before them, and never looked into the National Records, where proper Materials for a Hiſtorian are to be found: For I cannot imagine that Mr. Buchanan ever gave himſelf the Trouble to turn over one Roll in the publick Archives of the Kingdom, otherwiſe he could not but have diſcovered the Error of Robert III's Illegitmacy, and many other Things relating both to the Royal Family, as well as to this Noble Family I now write of; for ſince the Time of King Robert the Bruce the Records are pretty full, ſo that if diligently peruſed, would have rectified many very groſs Errors all our old Hiſtorians have fallen into, whom Buchanan, as to the Hiſtory, has followed exactly; for he only turned their Books into that ornate Latine Style we now read his Hiſtory of Scotland in. For I cannot imagine Buchanan ſaw the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords, otherwiſe he could not have been ſo Wicked, or ſo Perverſe an Hiſtorian as to have concealed Matters of Fact ſo evident there, and of ſuch importance to the Royal Family, except ye ſuppoſe, (as indeed many do) that he was well pleaſed to find that any before him had wrote of the illegitimacy of King Robert III, and thereby to make it a Precedent for the Succeſſion of another Baſtard to the Crown, who was his Patron, in Prejudice of the lawful Heirs; and James Duke of Chatlerault being then the preſumptive Heir of the Crown failling of Queen Mary and her young Son King James VI. I believe Mr. Buchanan had a particular View to that in his malicious and falſe Aſperſions againſt that moſt Noble and Worthy Lord and his Family, both in his Hiſtory, and in another ſcurrilous Paſquil he wrote, entitul'd, <hi>An Admonition to the true Lords,</hi> and which is the moſt falſe, and moſt ſcandalous writing that ever flowed from the Pen of any Man of the leaſt Worth, which ſhall be anſwered elſewhere, to the Conviction of any who will allow themſelves to believe Truth, all clearly made out from original Writings, accidentally come into my Hands.</note>,</p>

            <p>This Speech ſo lively, and ſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirably well adapted to the Humour of the Nation at that time, had its deſired Effect: The Nobility ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded his Deſign, they talked of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but of Means to proſecute the War; and whatever the Event might be, they reſolved to hazard all, rather than ſubmit to the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> So it was agreed to have recourſe to the King of <hi>France,</hi> who they thought alone able to retrieve their Loſſes, and to tranſact with him about marrying the Queen when fit for a Husband, to <hi>Francis</hi> the firſt his Son the <hi>Daul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phine.</hi> Then the ſaid King was pleaſed to create his Lordſhip Duke of <hi>Chatt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerault</hi> in that Kingdom, and to aſſign him for the better ſupport of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour a Revenue of 30000 Livres a Year to him his Heirs and Aſſigneys for ever. After which his Grace continued Governour of <hi>Scotland</hi> for ſix Years, till the 1555, he reſigned that great Poſt in full Parliament to the Queens Mother. He was again declared to

be the preſumptive Heir of the Crown, failing Queen <hi>Mary</hi> and the Iſſue of her Body, and this at a Time when he had deveſted himſelf of all Authority, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered up the <hi>Regalia,</hi> and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently was not in a Condition to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence the Members, nor byaſs the Judgment of the Nation; after which his Grace liv'd much at Home in a State ſuitable to his Quality, imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf in the Service of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try upon all Occaſions with untaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Honour.</p>
            <p>When Queen <hi>Mary</hi> returned Home from <hi>France, Anno</hi> 1561, her Majeſty was pleaſed prudently to make choice of a new Privy Council, all or moſt of whom were Proteſtants, the better to conform her ſelf to the preſent poſture of Affairs; and confiding much in the Duke of <hi>Chattlerault,</hi> he was choſe one of that Number, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he worthily ſerved her Majeſty in ſettling the Kingdom, then in no ſmall Ferment, always ſhowing a great ſteddyneſs to the Intereſt of his Country and the Proteſtant Rel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The Queen having found the benefit of his faithful Services at Home, was pleaſed in 1566<note n="a" place="bottom">Letter under the Privy Seal.</note> to ſend him over to <hi>France</hi> to take care of her Intereſt there, where he did all the Service he could that was conſiſtent with his Honour and the Proteſtant Cauſe. Here he continued till the Queen was forc'd to make the Reſignation of the Government in favours of her Son the Prince: Then the Duke of <hi>Chattle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rault</hi> was called home to be the Head of the Loyaliſts<note n="b" place="bottom">Hiſtory of Scotland ad annum 1569.</note>. So ſoon as he came to <hi>Scotland,</hi> his Grace uſed his utmoſt endeavours to have had the Earl of <hi>Murray</hi> then Regent, degraded from his uſurped Authority, the Queen reponed to the Exerciſe of her royal Power, and the Peace of the Country reſtored; and for that end by vertue of a Commiſſion from her Majeſty, he gathered together what Forces he could raiſe in ſo ſhort a time; but ſeeing no manner of hopes of Aſſiſtance from <hi>England,</hi> and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that a Civil War was juſt break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out in <hi>France,</hi> he reſolved to make no other uſe of his Arms than to obtain to himſelf and his Friends honourable Conditions of Peace, and the benefit of living quietly at Home, till indulgent Providence ſhould afford him an Opportunity of ſerving his Queen and his Country, for which End the Biſhop of St. <hi>Andrews</hi> his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, was ſent to the Regent to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure a ſafe Meeting, in order to bring their Differences to an Accomo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation; and the Time and Place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing agreed to, after many Diſputes on both Sides, the following Articles were drawn up, and mutually ſigned, which I ſhall ſet down in the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Style.</p>

            <p>According to Articles, moſt of the Perſons concerned met at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> on the 10th of <hi>April</hi> 1569, to treat at large of a thorow Agreement, and eſpecially of ſuch Points as related to the baniſhed Queen. Being all in one Room, the Regent firſt roſe, and drawing out a Paper, asked the Duke, if he would inſtantly ſubſcribe an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of the young King's Authority, or not, to which he modeſtly replyed, <hi>That he and his Friends had laid down their Arms con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionally, nor could he think himſelf, or them, obliged to ſubſcribe their Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to the King, unleſs according to</hi>

               <hi>theſe Conditions, the Regent at the ſame time ſhould grant what might be reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably demanded, in behalf of the diſtreſſed Queen, and therefore hoped he would not proceed to Acts of Force and Fraud too, ſince not only he and his Friends, but their Hoſtages likewiſe were in his Hands, deſiring him to remember that they had religiouſly obſerved every Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of the late Treaty, and had come ſecure and unarmed as to a Friend, faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully relying on his Honour, and thoſe aſſurances of Safety he had given them in the moſt ſolemn manner under his own Hand.</hi> To this eaſie Remonſtrance of the Duk's, <hi>Murray</hi> made no manner of return (ſays my Author)<note n="a" place="bottom">Drumſoy's Memoirs.</note> 
               <hi>but againſt all the Laws of Honour ſent him to the Caſtle of</hi> Edinburgh<note n="b" place="bottom">Melvil's Memoirs.</note>, where he was kept cloſe Priſoner till the Regent was murdered by <hi>James Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton</hi> of <hi>Bothwell-haugh</hi> on the 23 of <hi>January</hi> 1570, then he had his Libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, after having purged himſelf by Oath from all manner of Suſpicion in that Affair.</p>
            <p>What a loyal and honeſt Part my Lord Duke of <hi>Chattlerault</hi> acted for the Intereſt of his Sovereign Queen <hi>Mary</hi> in the time of her greateſt Diſtreſs, is ſo well known &amp; was ſo frequently own'd &amp; acknowledg'd, by her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, that I don't think it neceſſary to be further inſiſted on here<note n="c" place="bottom">Queen Mary always called the Duke of Chattlerault <hi>Father.</hi>
               </note>, and that his Loyalty was not eaſie to him, is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from the manifold Sufferings and Hardſhips he underwent during the continuance of the Civil War; for as ſoon as the Earl of <hi>Lennox</hi> was elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Regent, he burnt down the Caſtle &amp; Town of <hi>Hamiltoun;</hi> and that theſe honeſt Patriots might be heartily hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, not ſo much as the Corn-Fields and Trees belonging to a <hi>Hamiltoun</hi> were ſpared, the Duke himſelf with his two Sons, and moſt of the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the Name of <hi>Hamilton</hi> were all forfaulted for their Rebellion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the young King; notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he reſolutely perſiſted in the Queen's Service, and had a large ſhare in the Misfortunes of that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate Queen, but being aged, for the better Security of his Perſon from the violence of his Enemies, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired into <hi>France,</hi> where he ſtayed ſome time during the Rage of the War, which had reduced his Country to the laſt extremity; and returning home he gave way to Fate on the 22 of <hi>January</hi> 1575. As for his Character, notwithſtanding the Envy of ſome, and the Malice of others, it ſhone very bright, in that great and difficult Truſt of Governour of <hi>Scotland,</hi> which he held in the moſt difficult Times, ſo he diſcharged it for twelve Years with no leſs Prudence and Dexterity than Honour and Reputation, a Praiſe which few of his Enemies ever denyed him in any time. For in his Court, ſays a reverend Hiſtorian<note n="d" place="bottom">Arch-Biſhop Spottiſwood's Hiſtory of the Church of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</note>, <hi>There was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be ſeen the ſevereſt Eye could cenſure in the publick Adminiſtration, ſuch a Moderation was kept as no Man was heard to complain.</hi> And continues my Author, <hi>He was a Nobleman well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined, plain, and without all Diſſimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Fraud, that by the goodneſs of God, who always favoureth the Upright, he was carryed thro many Difficulties, and died in Peace and Honour, well ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced in Age.</hi>

            <p>My Lord <hi>Hamilton</hi>'s moſt Loyal and firm Adherence to the Crown was very dear to him, for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Faction who were Maſters of the young King, proſecuted him and his Family with the utmoſt Severity, for no other Reaſon but becauſe they owned Queen <hi>Mary's</hi> Authority, and therefore in one of their Parliaments held in <hi>October</hi> 1579, both he and his Brother Lord <hi>Claud</hi> were forfaulted.

            <p>As ſoon as my Lord Duke was at Liberty, it was believ'd that the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſity was ſo great between him and ſome others of great Name, that he would rather meditate a Revenge, than concur in any Action which might advance the King's Intereſt, but his Grace well conſider'd both his Duty to his Majeſty, and his own Danger at ſuch a Juncture, to think of private Contention and matters of Revenge, when the publick was ſo much at Stake, ſo that his former Treatment made no other Impreſſion upon him, then to make him ſhow his ſteadineſs more and more to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's Service, who then ſo much ſtood in need of the Aſſiſtance of his faithful Subjects.</p>

            <p>In the Year 1648, when the Eſtates of <hi>Scotland</hi> raiſed an Army for the Relief of King <hi>Charles,</hi> when he was made a Priſoner in the Iſle of <hi>Wight,</hi> General <hi>Leſly</hi> ſo well preſerved his Reputation with thoſe of his own Country, who wedded the King's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt moſt, that he had the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Army offered him; but he thought fit to decline it upon Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his Age and Infirmities: which was happy for him conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the unfortunate Iſſue of it.</p>

            <p>When his Majeſty had raiſed an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my againſt the Covenanters in 1639, and was advanced as far as the Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, my Lord <hi>Lowdon</hi> was one of the Peers who ſigned an Addreſs to the King, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Lamenting their ill Fortune, that their Enemies had ſo great Credit with his Majeſty as to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade him to believe that they were or could be diſobedient to him; a Thing that could never enter into their loyal Hearts; that they deſired nothing but to be admitted into the Preſence of their gracious Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, to lay their Grievances at his Royal Feet, and leave the Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of them entirely to his own Wiſdom and Pleaſure."</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Humility of the Stile wrought ſo upon the King's Nature, who thought it great Pity that any Blood ſhould be ſpilt in a Contention which he himſelf might put an End to by his own Royal Word, as ſoon as he ſhould hear their Complaints; That he eaſily conſented to bring the Buſineſs to a fair Treaty, to which the Earl was named one of the Commiſſioners up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Part of the Covenanters, and who accordingly met with ſuch <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Commiſſioners as his Majeſty was pleaſed to appoint at the <hi>Berks,</hi> where they entred upon, and concluded a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cification, whereby <q rend="inline margQuotes">"The Armies were to be disbanded; an Act of Oblivion paſs'd; the King's Forts and Caſtles to be reſtored, and a Parliament and a General Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to be called, for a full Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, &amp; that thereby all Factions &amp; Animoſities might be reconciled and compoſed."</q> But this Peace was of a very ſhort Duration; for the Pacification being ill kept on both Sides, the King diſowning what had been ſaid to have been tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted upon his Part, and the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanters remitting nothing of their
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:0390900200:296"/>
Zeal againſt the Biſhops and the Liturgy, having likewiſe entred a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation <q rend="inline margQuotes">"That they did not intend by any Thing contained in the Treaty to vacate any of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings which had been in the late General Aſſembly of <hi>Glaſgow</hi>:"</q> By theſe Proceedings the Breach became greater and wider, and Preparations for War began to be renewed on both Sides with more Vigour than ever. But before Things ſhould come to the laſt Extremity, and that, if poſſible, Matters might be compoſed without Blood, his Majeſty thought fit to re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>quire the Covenanters to ſend ſome Perſons intruſted by their Body to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend him, to give an Account of their Proceedings, and which was the Thing they always moſt deſired. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly certain Commiſſioners were named, of which Number the Earl of <hi>Lowdon</hi> was one. At this Time when the Commiſſioners repaired to <hi>London</hi> there happened to be a Letter inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, and tranſmitted to his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, that had been ſigned by the Earl of <hi>Lowdon</hi> and the chief of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanters, written to the <hi>French</hi> King, &amp; directed <hi>An Roy,</hi> a Stile only uſed by Subjects to their natural King: <q rend="inline margQuotes">"In which they complained of the Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs &amp; Injuſtice of the Government that was exerciſed over them, put him in mind of the Dependence <hi>Scotland</hi> formerly had upon that Crown, and deſired him now to take them into his Protection, and give them Aſſiſtance<note n="a" place="bottom">Clarendon's Hiſtory of the Civil War.</note>."</q> This Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter being ſeen and peruſed by the Lords of the Council of <hi>England,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Lowdon</hi> being examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and refuſing to give any other Anſwer than, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"That it was writ before the Agreement; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon reſerved, and never ſent, that if he had committed any Offence, he ought to be queſtioned for it in <hi>Scotland,</hi> &amp; not in <hi>England;</hi> &amp; inſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon his ſafe Conduct, demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Liberty to return."</q> But notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all the Defences the Earl was able to make, he was commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Priſoner to the Tower, and tho his Commitment was highly reſented by the Parliament, as a Breach of the publick Faith, yet he continued in Priſon ſome Months thereafter, till, by the Interpoſition and Interceſſion of the Marquis of <hi>Hamilton,</hi> he was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged on the 27<hi>th</hi> of <hi>June</hi> 1640<note n="b" place="bottom">Burnet's Hiſtory of the two Dukes of Hamilton.</note>, when his Lordſhip renewed all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions of Duty to the King, and a Readineſs to engage in his Service, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>oon as he ſhould return to his native Country, (where his Power &amp; Intereſt was as great as any Mans,) which he did by diſpoſing all thoſe upon whom he had Influence to hearken to all Over tures for a Peace with his Majeſty. But notwithſtanding all the Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of the Lord <hi>Lowdon</hi> and others, who heartily deſired an Accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Matters came to a ſecond Rup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and upon a Party of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanters having routed the Lord <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way</hi> at <hi>Newburn,</hi> who appeared for the King, and having taken <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> they thought fit after that to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent a humble Petition and Addreſs to the King for a new Treaty, which his Majeſty condeſcending to, and <hi>Rippon</hi> being named the Place of Meeting, the Earl of <hi>Lowdon</hi> was appointed one of the Commiſſioners for the Treaty. But all they they did there was only to agree to a Ceſſation of Arms, a ſafe Conduct being granted to his Lordſhip and the reſt of his Collegues for going to <hi>London</hi> to carry on and conclude the Treaty there: Which they did with all poſſible Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and which his Majeſty confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and the Lords of the Privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil were made the Conſervators of the Peace, during the Interval of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments.</p>
            <p>The Peace betwixt the two Nations being thus happily concluded, it was judged neceſſary that the Treaty
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:0390900200:297"/>
ſhould be ratified by the Parliament of <hi>Scotland,</hi> which in the 1641, his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty was pleaſed to hold himſelf in his own Royal Perſon, for the full Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of his People, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in all Particulars that had been in Diſpute were adjuſted to the ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Joy and Satisfaction of every Man, and the Security of all that was then eſtabliſhed was ſufficiently provided for. In the End of the Seſſion his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty was pleaſed to beſtow Honours and Offices on ſome principal Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who had merited well at his Hands, and who were beſt able to ſerve him; ſo the Chancellour's Place was beſtowed upon the Lord <hi>Lowdon,</hi> during Life, and that with the full Conſent and Approbation of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament<note n="a" place="bottom">Reſcinded Acts of Parliament.</note>, who looked on him, as he was throughout the whole Kingdom, as a very wiſe Man, excellently fitted and qualified for the Diſcharge of that great Truſt, as the Exigence of Affairs then ſtood.</p>
            <p>When the Civil War broke out in <hi>England,</hi> the Chancellour repaired to the King at <hi>York</hi>
               <note n="b" place="bottom">Clarendon's Hiſtory.</note>, when his Majeſty did ſo fully ſatisfy his Lordſhip with the Juſtice and Honour of his Carriage toward his <hi>Engliſh</hi> Parliament, that he wrote to the <hi>Scots</hi> Commiſſioners at <hi>London,</hi> in the Name and by the Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Lords of the Secret Council; <q rend="inline margQuotes">"That they ſhould preſent to the two Houſes, the deep Senſe they had of the Injuries and Indignities which were offered to the King, whoſe juſt Rights they were bound to deſend, and that they ſhould conjure them to bind up thoſe Wounds which were made, and not to widen them by Sharpneſs of Language, and to give his Majeſty ſuch real Security for his Safety among them, by an effectual declaring againſt Tumults, and ſuch other Actions as were juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly offenſive to his Majeſty, that he might be induced to reſide nearer to them, and comply with them in ſuch Propoſitions as ſhould be reaſonably made<note n="c" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>."</q> Soon after which, taking leave of the King, his Lordſhip renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all imaginable Profeſſions of Duty to his Majeſty, and a Readineſs to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage in his Service; which the King was very well aſſured he could do.</p>
            <p>In the 1643, the Chancellour was ſent Commiſſioner from the Privy Council of <hi>Scotland,</hi> who called them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves <hi>the Conſervators of the Peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two Kingdoms,</hi> to his Majeſty while he was at <hi>Oxford,</hi> deſiring to paſs as a Mediator betwixt the King and the two Houſes in <hi>England,</hi> when his Lordſhip uſed all Importunity and Arguments to perſwade the King in private to conſent to the Alteration of the Government of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> aſſuring him that it would be a Mean not only to hinder the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of <hi>Scotland</hi> from adhering to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Parliament, but that it would oblige them to aſſiſt his Majeſty to the outmoſt, in the Vindication of all his Rights: But he found the King too ſtrongly fixed to be ſway'd, in what he thought a Caſe of Conſcience, by a Conſideration of Convenience.</p>
            <p>He then betook himſelf to his own proper Errand, which conſiſted of two Parts; the one, to offer the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Conſervators of the Peace of the Kingdom, for the Compoſure of the Differences between his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty and the two Houſes; the other, to deſire his Majeſty that he would ſummon a Parliament in <hi>Scotland.</hi> In Anſwer to the firſt Demand of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation; His Majeſty told him, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"That he could not find any colour or pretence of Authority granted by the Act of Pacification, by which the Commiſſioners for <hi>Scotland</hi> could conceive themſelves intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a Faculty of Mediation; that the Clauſe mentioned by them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated only to the Differences that might grow between the two Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which his Majeſty ſaid had

been and ſhould be inviolably ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by him; and therefore he could not admit of any ſuch Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation as they propoſed."</q> For the other Demand, of a Parliament in <hi>Scotland;</hi> The King told him and the reſt of the Commiſſioners, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"That againſt the Time by which they could legally demand a Parliament, naming the Day, which was to be on the firſt Tueſday of <hi>June</hi> 1644, he would iſſue out his Writs, and there being no emergent Cauſe to do it ſooner, he would forbear to put his Subjects there to that Trouble, which thoſe Meetings (how neceſſary ſoever) would na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally carry with them."</q> So his Lordſhip perceiving that he ſhould not receive Satisfaction in either of theſe Propoſals, at laſt returned home <hi>re infecta.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the 1644, when his Majeſty did renew his Offer of Peace to the two Houſes of Parliament, which they likewiſe agreeing to, and <hi>Uxbridge</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſſigned for the Place of Meeting, the Chancellour, the Earl of <hi>Lawder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale,</hi> Sir <hi>Charles Erskine,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Barclay</hi> Member of Parliament for the Burgh of <hi>Irvine,</hi> and Mr. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander Henderſon</hi> (in Matters only which related to the Church) were ſent Commiſſioners from <hi>Scotland:</hi> But that Treaty unhappily coming to nothing, a bloody civil War thereupon enſued.</p>
            <p>When the King put himſelf into the <hi>Scots</hi> Army before <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark,</hi> and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> poſitively de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Delivery up of the King's Perſon, the Earl of <hi>Lowdon</hi> was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to treat with the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> about that important Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair, where, in a free Conference with the two Houſes, he publickly declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"That an eternal Infamy would ly upon the whole Nation, if they ſhould deliver up the Perſon of the King, the ſecuring of which was equally their Duty, as it was the Parliament's, and the Diſpoſal of his Perſon in order to that Securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, did equally belong to them as to the Parliament: However he ſaid, he would uſe all the Perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and all the Importunity he could with the King, that his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty might yield and conſent to the Propoſitions the Parliament had ſent to him."</q>
            </p>
            <p>In the 1647, the Lord Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour was one of the Commiſſioners appointed to attend the King from the Parliament of <hi>Scotland,</hi> while he was at the Iſle of <hi>Wight,</hi> to treat with his Majeſty anent a full Accomodati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with that Kingdom, and which they at laſt concluded on Terms of great Advantage to the Nation; in Recompenſe of which, the Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and his Collegues undertook to raiſe an Army to reſcue and relieve his Majeſty from the Captivity he was then under, and to reſtore him to his juſt Rights, and that no Time might be loſt, as ſoon as the Treaty was ſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Chancellour departed for <hi>Scotland,</hi> where (at firſt) he uſed his outmoſt Endeavours to procure ſuch Perſons to be elected Members to the Parliament, as he knew to be moſt inclined to the Service in hand, in which the Honour of the Country was ſo much concerned.</p>
            <p>When the Parliament met on the 2d of <hi>March</hi> 1648<note n="a" place="bottom">Reſcinded Acts.</note>, the Lord Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour was choſen Preſident of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, wherein he employed all his Power and Intereſt to bring the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament to comply with the Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment &amp; declare for the King; &amp; tho the Affair met with great Oppoſition, yet the Reſolution was carried in put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Country in a Poſture Defence, and raiſing an Army to relieve the King. I need not here recount the Fate of that Army which marched in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>England</hi> under the Conduct of the Duke of <hi>Hamilton,</hi> nor how unſucces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full it proved for the Deſign it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.<note place="bottom">(<hi>b</hi>) Cromwel's Indemnity to the People of Scotland.</note>
               <pb n="285" facs="tcp:0390900200:299"/>
All I ſhall further obſerve is, that as there had been a Party in the Parliament whom the King's Conceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions did not ſatisfy, ſo they declared againſt the Engagement as unlawfull and ungodly, and the violent Party of the Clergy joining with them, they paſſed an Act againſt the <hi>Engagers,</hi> that was, all thoſe who had been the Promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of it, ranking them into ſeveral <hi>Claſses,</hi> whereby they were exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from all Offices of publick Truſt, and vote in Parliament till they had ſatisfied the Church by a publick Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of their Repentance, for their Acceſſion to the <hi>unlawfull Engagement</hi> as it was called.</p>
            <p>When the Parliament met, after the Murder of King <hi>Charles</hi> I. the Lord Chancellour was choſen Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of that Seſſion, who by their 14 Act, proclaimed King <hi>Charles</hi> II. 'Tis beyond all Doubt the Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour gave all imaginable Aſſiſtance he could to bring over the King from <hi>Holland,</hi> and to raiſe the Army that marched with his Majeſty into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> but that Army being unhappily defeated at <hi>Worceſter,</hi> and the Uſurpers abſolutely prevailing over all the three Kingdoms; the Chancellour was not only outed of his Office, but was for ced, for the Security of his Perſon, to fly to the <hi>Highlands,</hi> where he lay concealed, till the Earl of <hi>Glencairn</hi> by vertue of his Majeſty's Commiſſion drew together a ſmall Body of Horſe and Foot for his Majeſty's Service, that the Earl of <hi>Lowdon</hi> repaired to him, for which he was for<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

After which his Lordſhip the Chancellour continued in the <hi>Hills</hi> till all Hope of ſerving the King was given over, that he capitulated to lay down his Arms, and live quietly at his own Houſe, which he did in a Country Retirement, till it pleaſed God to bring back King <hi>Charles</hi> II. to his Throne, which the Lord <hi>Lowdon</hi> did not long ſurvive, for he died in the Beginning of the 1663.

his Claim was allowed and ratified by Act of Parliament: And tho' my Lord <hi>Mar</hi> was a very zealous Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, 'tis worthy our Remark, Queen <hi>Mary</hi> truſted him as much as ſhe could have done any of her own Profeſſion, which ſhe did eminently manifeſt by the Confidence ſhe repo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in him, for as ſoon as ſhe was hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily delivered of the Prince, <hi>James</hi> VI. her Majeſty committed him to the Tuition and Cuſtody of the Earl, in the Caſtle of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> then under his Command, and he diſcharged that great Truſt ſo well, and was ſo much ſuperior to all Tentations of Infidelity that when the Earl of <hi>Bothwell</hi> had married the Queen, he could not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with my Lord <hi>Mar,</hi> either by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes or Menaces, to deliver up the Prince to him, which was the Thing in the World, that wicked Earl had ſet his Heart moſt upon, when 'tis known his Lordſhip could have made his own Terms: In the End, when <hi>Bothwell</hi> found all his Offers rejected, he was glad to allow the Earl to carry the Prince to <hi>Stirling</hi>-Caſtle, of which he himſelf was heritable Governor, and then delivered up <hi>Edinburgh</hi> Caſtle to <hi>Bothwell,</hi> on the 21ſt of <hi>May,</hi> 1566, who immediately plac'd a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of his own, Sir <hi>James Balfour,</hi> in it, by which Means, the Earl of <hi>Mar</hi> became, under God, the happy Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Prince's miraculous Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, during his long Minority: However, he ſtill retained great Duty and Affection to the Queen, even af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Things came to an Extremity; ſo it would appear, that nothing but a pure Principle of Conſcience for the Preſervation of the Heir of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, firſt engaged his Lordſhip in the Company of thoſe who ſet the Crown upon the Head of the Prince, when he was an Infant little more than one Year old. When the Civil War began, I do'nt find this generous and prudent Lord much engaged on either Side, for his particular Province being to take Care of his Royal Pupil, he ſtay'd himſelf much with him, and as he grew up in Years, gave him a Princely Education, appointing the famous Mr. <hi>Buchannan,</hi> Mr. <hi>Peter Young,</hi> Mr. <hi>David Eriskine,</hi> Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dator of <hi>Cambuſkenneth,</hi> and Mr. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam Erskine,</hi> Commendator of <hi>Dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi> to be his Inſtructors, Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men who wanted none of thoſe Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities which were to be wiſhed to be in the Perſons to whom the Education of a great and hopeful Prince was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and for framing his Mind and Manners, in his young and tender Years.</p>
            <p>My Lord <hi>Mar</hi> bore no publick Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice in the State till the 1571, that upon the Death of <hi>Matthew</hi> Earl of <hi>Lennox,</hi> the Regent, the Earl of <hi>Mar,</hi> was a Nobleman ſo generally well eſteemed, that he was, by the unanimous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the King's Party, choſen Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent of <hi>Scotland,</hi> in his Room, <hi>Sept.</hi> 5, 1571. In which great Office he had, ſays one, <hi>Leſs Satisfaction than he expected, for when he had ſtrugled no leſs under the turbulent Councils of his own Party, than the Inſolencies of his Adverſaries, died for very Grief, after he had governed only Thirteen Months, upon the</hi> 28<hi>th of</hi> October 1572, <hi>and left behind him ſo unblemiſhed a Reputation, as cannot be very eaſily parallel'd in the like Circumſtances:</hi> He was interr'd in the Vault of his Family, among his Anceſtors, in the Paroch Church of <hi>Alloa,</hi> under a plain Monument, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any other Inſcription, than ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying him to be the Perſon there in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terr'd.</p>
            <p>To <hi>John</hi> Earl of <hi>Mar</hi> ſucceeded <hi>John</hi> his Son, then under Age, of whom I have found little memorable, till the 1582, his Lordſhip being then very young, he was induced to join with others of the diſcontented Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, who ſeized on the King at <hi>Ruth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi>-Caſtle, and petition'd his Majeſty, that he would remove Sir <hi>James Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>art,</hi>
               <pb n="304" facs="tcp:0390900200:314"/>
who then ſtiled himſelf Earl of <hi>Arran,</hi> from his Councils, being a Perſon of evil Fame, and Diſaffection to the publick Peace of the Kingdom, and an Inſtrument of Diſcontent between the King and his Nobility: But the Way and Manner of that Enterprize being afterwards adjudged treaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, the Earl was obliged to give up the Command of <hi>Stirling</hi>-Caſtle, and to leave his Majeſty's Dominions, which he did, and tranſporting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into <hi>Ireland,</hi> from whence he came over to <hi>England,</hi> and joined the the Lord <hi>Hamiltoun,</hi> and others who had been outlaw'd during the Regency of the Earl of <hi>Mortoun,</hi> with whom he returned to <hi>Scotland Anno</hi> 1585, when he obtained his Majeſty's Pardon, was reſtored to his Command of <hi>Stirling</hi>-Caſtle, and to a more than ordinary Share of his Majeſty's Favour, which his Lordſhip never afterward forfault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by any undutiful Behaviour.</p>
            <p>In the 1593, when it pleaſed God to bleſs his Majeſty with a Son, Prince <hi>Henry,</hi> the King repoſing full Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in his Lordſhip's Fidelity, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the Tuition of his Royal High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to him, and his Majeſty was at the ſame Time pleaſed to write with his own Hand the following Letter to his Lordſhip.<floatingText type="letter">

            <p>His Majeſty, upon his Acceſſion to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> did not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get to diſpenſe his Royal Favours to his Lordſhip: More particularly, he began with conferring the Garter u<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pon him, the Enſigns of which he was inveſted with on St. <hi>George</hi>'s Day, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pril</hi> 23d, 1603, and ſhortly thereafter cauſed him to be ſworn of his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty's moſt honourable Privy-Council of <hi>England,</hi> and made him a Grant of ſundry Abbacies and other Church-Lands then diſſolved from the Crown. But his Majeſty being ſtill more and more deſirous to confer greater Honours on his Lordſhip, was graciouſly pleaſed to conſtitute him Lord High Treaſurer of <hi>Scotland,</hi> upon the Removal of Sir <hi>Robert Ker,</hi> Earl of <hi>Somerſet,</hi> and had the White-Staff delivered to him, on the 2d of <hi>December</hi> 1615, in which Office he demean'd himſelf ſo well, that he did his Maſter much Service, and preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved himſelf in the good Opinion and Acceptation of the whole Nation; and he had the Treaſury ſo full at the King's coming down to <hi>Scotland,</hi> in 1617, that the Court were entertain'd with the greateſt Magnificence ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable, out of the Profits of the Crown, and it was obſerved by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nobility, who attended the King in that Progreſs, that his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty appear'd with no leſs Luſture at <hi>Holy-Rood-Houſe</hi> than at <hi>Whitehall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He continu'd in the Treaſurer's Place till the 1630, his Lordſhip being grown aged and infirm, he reſigned the Office, which was immediately put into the Hands of the Earl of <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toun,</hi> and declining to be put into any other publick Employment, he reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to his Seat in the Country, where Death put a Period to his Days, on the 16th of <hi>December,</hi> 1635, aged 79.</p>

Whether it was this or any other Act of Unkindneſs he met with from the Court, I cannot ſay, but 'tis certain, upon the firſt Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of the Troubles in 1638, his Lordſhip being then Governor of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinburgh</hi>-Caſtle, his Majeſty did not ſeem to be abſolutely ſatisfied of the Affection of the Earl to his Service, and therefore removed him from that Command, and put the Caſtle into the Hands of Major General Ruth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, as a Perſon on whom he could firmly rely, and yet his Majeſty was willing that his Lordſhip's Remove might not be attended with any Act of Diſobligation, and therefore gave him 3000 <hi>lib.</hi> which the Marquis of <hi>Hamiltoun</hi> gave Security for. When the Civil War broke out, he apply'd himſelf with great Reſolution and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity to the King's Service, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was reckon'd among the firſt Rank of Malignants, and ſuffer'd ac<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cordingly.</p>

to the Crown of that Religion, in the firſt Parliament after the Queen's coming to the Crown, the Earl was the firſt who propoſed an Overture for ſettling the Succeſſion to the Crown on the Princeſs <hi>Sophia,</hi> Dutcheſs Dowager of <hi>Hanover,</hi> and the Heirs of her Body, being Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, in Default of Iſſue of her Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty Queen <hi>Anne;</hi> and at the ſame Time preſented another Act for ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and ſettling the Presbyterian Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in Doctrine and Worſhip, as being moſt agreeable to the Word of GOD. But tho' the firſt Overture did not at that Time take, the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament having a View of an Union with <hi>England,</hi> yet the laſt carried, and was approved by a great Majority: And when the Treaty of Union came before the Parliament, his Lordſhip there, as well as in the Commiſſion of the General Aſſembly of the Church, us'd his utmoſt Endeavours to have it brought about, as the only Means he thought could ſecure Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and eſtabliſh a firm and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting Peace betwixt the Two Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; a Proteſtant Succeſſor to the Crown being thereby ſecured, which was the Thing his Lordſhip long'd moſt paſſionately to ſee before he ſhould leave this World.

            <p>
               <hi>James</hi> Earl, afternam'd Marquis of <hi>Montroſe,</hi> was born in the 1612, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing had the Misfortune to loſe his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther when he was young, and being I think the only Son of the Family, his Friends, in order to raiſe up Heirs to his illuſtrious Houſe, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd with him, when he was but a Youth, to marry, which he did into a very noble Family: This Marriage broke off the Courſe, and gave a great Interruption to his Studies, but quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly finding the Loſs he ſhould ſuſtain if he did not go thro' with his Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, he got good Maſters at Home, and enter'd into a cloſe Courſe of Study, wherein he made ſo great a Proficiency and Progreſs, that in a very little Time he became not only a great Maſter, but a Critick in the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin,</hi> after which, for his greater Improvement, and giving an Ornament to his hopeful Perſon, he travel'd into Foreign Parts, where he ſpent ſome Years in attaining the Language, and in learning the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes then in Vogue, in which he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel'd moſt Men, and came over to <hi>England,</hi> by the Time he was Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty two Years of Age.</p>
            <p>He then betook himſelf to the Court, intending to live there in a View of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Crown, and of raiſing himſelf to thoſe Honours and Imployments
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:0390900200:350"/>
both his Birth and perſonal Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions did intitle him to; but in his Attendance there, meeting with ſome Diſcountenance of the King, which was very artfully brought about, he left the Court, and returning to <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> juſt before the breaking out of the Troubles, he joined with the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented Party, who appeared moſt forward for the Redreſs of Grievan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Church, which was all that was at that Time pretended, inſomuch as he ſoon became one of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal and moſt active Lords for the Covenant and Reformation: But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the firſt Expedition of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanters into <hi>England,</hi> the Earl upon his Obſervation of the unwarrantable Proſecution of the Ends of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, he gave over that Party, and his Command in the Army; and made a full Tender of his Service to his Majeſty, which brought him ſo much into the Jealouſy of the Party he had formerly been of, that there was no Room left to doubt of his Sincerity to the King. The Earl of <hi>Clarendon</hi> does very unjuſtly inſinuate in his Hiſtory of the Civil War, that while the King was in <hi>Scotland,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Montroſe</hi> offer'd to make away Two Great Men, he thinks, were not ſo cordial in the King's Intereſt as could have been wiſh'd; but as this Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny is moſt falſe, as I am ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly able from Original Writs and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers to juſtify him from that Aſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, ſo I ſhall offer no more here for his Vindication, but to declare to the World, and which I'm able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate, that the Marquis of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troſe</hi> was a Priſoner in the Caſtle of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> for correſponding with the King from the Month of <hi>June</hi> 1641 till <hi>January</hi> thereafter, and the King came down in <hi>Auguſt</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned in <hi>November;</hi> ſo 'tis clear he was a Priſoner all the while his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty was in <hi>Scotland</hi>
               <note n="a" place="bottom">Original Inſtructions of all this I have had the Honour to peruſe in the Duke of Montroſe's Cuſtody.</note>. After his Releaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he liv'd moſt part privately at his Seat in the Country, till the Meeting of the Convention 1643, he private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly withdrew out of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and came to the King a few Days before the Siege was rais'd from <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> and gave his Majeſty the firſt clear Information of the Proceedings of the Convention, of the Reſolutions would be there taken, and of the Poſture the Kingdom would ſpeedily be in; and made ſome Propoſitions to the King for the Remedy; which there was not, ſays the Earl of <hi>Clarendon,</hi> then Time to conſult of: But aſſoon as his Majeſty return'd to <hi>Oxford,</hi> after the Battle of <hi>Newburry,</hi> he was very willing to hearken to any Overture the Earl ſhould make in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to what could be done, to prevent the Miſchief was like to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue to his Majeſty's Affairs, by a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination betwixt the <hi>Scots</hi> Covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Parliament; wherefore, that his Majeſty might have this important Affair brought to a full Reſolution, he was pleas'd to hold ſeveral Conferences with the Earl: But all the Advances which were made toward the Execution of any Attempt for the King's Service, were check'd by his Majeſty's not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to give any Troops to the Earl, by the Protection whereof, the Loyal Party of the Kingdom might come to his Aſſiſtance, and diſcover their Affections to his Majeſty, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding of which, the vigorous Spirit of the Earl of <hi>Montroſe,</hi> ſtirred him up to make ſome Attempt, which he thought might be of Service to the King: And therefore propoſed that his Majeſty ſhould give a Command to the Earl of <hi>Antrim,</hi> to raiſe, and ſend over a Body of Two Thouſand Men, into the Highlands of <hi>Scotland,</hi> to be a Foundation for raiſing For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces there, and that if his Majeſty would grant him a Commiſſion to command that Army, he would him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf be in the <hi>Highlands</hi> to receive them, and run his Fortune with them; and that if no Time were loſt in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting that Deſign, he did hope
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:0390900200:351"/>
that by the Time the <hi>Scots</hi> Army ſhould be ready to take the Field, they ſhould receive ſuch an Alarm from their own Country, as ſhould hinder their Advance into <hi>England</hi>

to proſecute his intended Deſcent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Scotland;</hi> and the King, ſays my Author the Earl of <hi>Clarendon,</hi> glad that he did not preſs for ready Money, which he was not able to ſupply him with, gave him ſuch Letters as he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd, and a Commiſſion to gather ſuch a Force together, as by the Help of thoſe Princes he might be enabled to do: Upon which the Marquis went for <hi>Hamburgh,</hi> which he appointed for the Rendezvous for all thoſe Troops, which he expected from <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> and from whence he could in the mean Time viſit ſuch Courts of the Neighbour Princes, as he ſhould be encouraged to do, and keep ſuch Intelligence with his Friends in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> as ſhould provide for his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception. In a Word, he ſent or went in Perſon, both to <hi>Sweden</hi> and <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,</hi> where he found the Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance very diſproportionable to the Hopes and Encouragement he had received from thence; ſo that the Marquis was obliged to return to <hi>Hamburgh,</hi> with very ſmall Supplies, from either or both theſe Kingdoms; and there he received no better Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count from thoſe Officers whom he had ſent to <hi>Germany;</hi> and therefore concluding upon the Whole, that all his Hopes from <hi>Germany</hi> and thoſe Northern Princes would not increaſe the Strength he had already, which did not amount to above Five Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, he caus'd thoſe Soldiers he had drawn together, to be imbark'd for <hi>Scotland,</hi> and ſent Officers with them, who knew the Country, with Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections that they ſhould land in ſuch a Place, and remain there till he came to them, or ſent them Orders; and then in another Veſſel comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by a Captain very faithful to the King, he embarked himſelf, and near an Hundred Officers, and landed in another Creek, not far from the other Place whither his Soldiers were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected; and both the one and the other Party were ſet ſafely on Shore, in the <hi>Orkneys,</hi> on the 15th of <hi>April</hi> 1650<note n="a" place="bottom">Memoirs of the Marquis of Montroſe.</note>; from thence he came over to <hi>Caithneſs</hi>
               <note n="b" place="bottom">Hiſtory of the Revolutions in England, by a French Clergyman, where Montroſe's Expedition is particularly narrated.</note>, and preſently repair'd to the Houſe of a Gentleman of Quality, with whom he correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; by whom he was well received, and thought himſelf to be in Security, till he might put his Affairs in ſome Method: After he had ſtaid there a ſhort Time, he quickly poſſeſs'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of an old Caſtle, which, in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the Situation, in a Country ſo impoſſible for an Army to march in, thought ſtrong enough for his Purpoſe. Thither he convoy'd the Arms, Ammunition and Troops, which he had brought with him; and then he publiſhed his Declaration, <hi>That he came with the King's Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, to aſſiſt thoſe his good Subjects, and to preſerve them from Oppreſſion: That he did not intend to give any Interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Treaty that he hear'd was enter'd into with his Majeſty; but, on the contrary, hoped, that his being in the Head of an Army, how ſmall ſoever, that was faithful to the King, might advance the ſame. However, he had given ſufficient Proof in his former Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that if any Agreement were made with the King, upon the firſt Order from his Majeſty, he ſhould lay down his Arms, and diſpoſe himſelf according to his Majeſty's good Pleaſure.</hi> With theſe Declarations which he ſent to his Friends, to be ſcatter'd by them, and diſperſed among the People, as they could be able, he writ likewiſe to thoſe of the Nobility, and the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Heads of the <hi>Highland</hi> Clans, to draw ſuch Forces together as they thought neceſſary, to join with him; and he received Anſwers from many of them, by which they deſir'd him to advance more into the Low-Lands,
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:0390900200:354"/>
and aſſured him, that they would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort to him, with good Numbers of their Friends and Followers, which many of them did prepare to do, with great Sincerity.</p>
            <p>The Alarm of <hi>Montroſe</hi>'s Landing ſtartled the Parliament, which was then ſitting at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> in ſo much, that it gave them no Leiſure to think of any Thing elſe, than of ſending Forces to hinder the Recourſe of others to join with him; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſent Colonel <hi>Strachan</hi> with a choice Party of the beſt Horſe they had, to make all poſſible Haſte to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward him, and to prevent the Inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections which they feared would be in ſeveral Parts of the <hi>Highlands;</hi> and within few Days after, Lieutenant General <hi>Leſly</hi> followed with a ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Party of Horſe and Foot. The Encouragement the Marquis received from his Friends, and the Unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantneſs of the Quarters, in which he was, prevail'd with him to march with theſe few Troops more into the Land; and the <hi>Highlanders</hi> flocking to him from all Quarters, made him undervalue any Enemy who he thought was yet like to encounter him; and the Marquis being without any Body of Horſe to diſcover the Mo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion of an Enemy, but depending upon all neceſſary Intelligence from the Affections of the People; <hi>Strachan</hi> made ſuch Haſte toward him, that he was within a ſmall Diſtance of him, before he heard of his Approach, and thoſe <hi>Highlanders</hi> who had ſeem'd to come with much Zeal to him, whether terrified or corrupted, left him on a ſudden, or threw down their Arms; ſo that he had none left but a Company of good Officers, and Five or Six Hundred Foreigners, <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>Germans;</hi> with theſe he betook him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to a Place of ſome Advantage, by the Inequality of the Ground; and there they made a Defence for ſome Time with notable Courage; but the Enemy being ſo much ſuperior in Number, the common Soldiers being all Foreigners, after about a Hundred of them were kill'd upon the Place, threw down their Arms; And the Marquis ſeeing all loſt, threw away his Ribband and <hi>George,</hi> and found Means to change his Clothes with a Fellow of the Country; and ſo after having gone on Foot Two or Three Miles, he got into a Houſe of a Gentleman, <hi>M'Leod</hi> of <hi>Aſſint,</hi>
               <note n="a" place="bottom">Mercurius Politicus ad Annum 1661.</note>, where he remain'd conceal'd about Two Days; but whether by the Own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Houſe, or any other Way, the Marquis was diſcovered, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came their Priſoner, and was the next Day or ſoon thereafter delivered to the General, who was come up with his Forces, and had now nothing left to do, but to carry him in Triumph to <hi>Edinburgh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When he came to one of the Gates of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> he was met by ſome of the Magiſtrates, to whom he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered, and by them preſently put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a new Cart purpoſely made, in which there was a high Chair, or Bench, upon which he ſat, that the People might have a full View of him, being bound with a Cord drawn over his Breaſt and Shoulders, and faſten'd thro' Holes made in the Cart. When he was in this Poſture, the Hangman took off his Hat, and rode himſelf before the Cart in his Livery, and with his Bonnet on; the other Officers, who were taken Priſoners with him, walking Two and Two before the Cart; in this Manner he was carried to the common Goal, and received and treated as a common Malefactor.</p>
            <p>Within Two Days after, he was brought before the Parliament, where the Chancellor made a very bitter
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:0390900200:355"/>
and virulent Speech againſt him, told him, <hi>He had broken all the Covenants by which the Nation ſtood obliged, and had impiouſly rebelled againſt GOD, the King and the Kingdom; that he had committed many horrible Murthers, Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and Impieties, for all which he was now brought to ſuffer condign Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> with all thoſe Reproaches, ſays my Author, againſt his Perſon and his Actions, which the Liberty of that Place gave him Leave to uſe.</p>
            <p>Permiſſion was then given him to ſpeak, and without the leaſt Trouble in his Countenance, or Diſorder, upon all the Indignities he had ſuffer'd, he told them, <hi>Since the King had own'd them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>o far as to treat with them, he had appear'd before them with Reverence, and bare headed, which otherwiſe he would not willingly have done: That he had done nothing of which he was aſham'd, or had Cauſe to repent; that the firſt Covenant, he had taken, and comply'd with it, and with them who took it, as long as the Ends for which it was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd were obſerv'd; but when he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd, which was now evident to all the World, that private and particular Men deſign'd to ſatisfy their own Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Intereſt, inſtead of conſidering the Publick Benefit; and that, under the Pretence of reforming ſome Errors in Religion, they reſolv'd to abridge, and take away the King's juſt Power, and lawful Authority, he had withdrawn himſelf from that Engagement: That for the League and Covenant, he had never taken it, and therefore could not break it: And it was now too apparent to the whole Chriſtian World, what mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruous Miſchiefs it had produced: That when, under Colour of it, an Army from</hi> Scotland <hi>had invaded</hi> England <hi>in Aſſiſtance of the Rebellion that was then againſt their Lawful King, he had, by his Majeſty's Command, received a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion from him to raiſe Forces in</hi> Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, <hi>that he might thereby divert them from the other odious Perſecution: That he had executed that Commiſſion with the Obedience and Duty he ow'd to the King; and in all the Circumſtances of it, had proceeded like a Gentleman; and had never ſuffer'd any Blood to be ſhed but in the Heat of the Battle; and that he ſaw many Perſons there, whoſe Lives he had ſaved: that when the King com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him, he laid down his Arms, and withdrew out of the Kingdom; which they could not have compell'd him to have done.</hi> He ſaid, <hi>he was now again enter'd into the Kingdom by his Majeſty's Command, and with his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority: And what Succeſs ſoever it might have pleaſed GOD to have given him, he would always have obeyed any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands he ſhould have received from him.</hi> He adviſed them, <hi>to conſider well of the Conſequence before they proceeded againſt him, and that all his Actions might be examin'd, and judged by the Laws of the Land, or thoſe of Nations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Aſſoon as he had ended his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, he was ordered to withdraw; and, after a ſhort Space, was again brought in; and told by the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor, <hi>That he was, on the Morrow, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the one and Twentieth of</hi> May 1650, <hi>to be carried to</hi> Edinburgh <hi>Croſs, and there to be hanged up on a Gallows Thirty Foot high, for the Space of Three Hours, and then to be taken down, and his Head to be cut off upon a Scoffold, and hanged on</hi> Edinburgh <hi>Tolboth; his Legs and Arms to be hanged up in other publick Towns of the Kingdom, and his Body to be buried at the Place where he was to be executed, except the Kirk ſhould take off his Excommunication; and then his Body might be buried in the common Place of Burial.</hi> And 'tis admirable to conſider with what Magnanimity &amp; Firmneſs of Soul he heard the Judgment that condemned him to be quartered, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which he ſaid to the Chancellor that pronounced it, <hi>That he was prouder to have his Head ſet upon the Place it was appointed to be, than he could have been to have had his Picture hang in the King's Bed-Chamber: That he was ſo far from being troubled, that his Four</hi>
               <pb n="346" facs="tcp:0390900200:356"/>
               <hi>Limbs were to be hang'd in Four princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Cities of the Kingdom, that he hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily wiſhed he had Fleſh enough to be ſent to every City in</hi> Chriſtendom, <hi>as a Teſtimony of the Cauſe for which he ſuffer'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He deſir'd after the Sentence to have ſaid ſomewhat to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but was not ſuffer'd, and ſo was carried back to Priſon; and the next Day every Part and Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Sentence was executed upon him with all the Inhumanity imaginable; and he bore it with all the Courage and Magnanimity, and the greateſt Piety that a good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian could manifeſt. When he had ended all he had to ſay, and was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting to expire, they acted yet one Scene more of their Barbarity upon him; the Hangman brought the Book that had been publiſhed, of his truly Heroick Actions whilſt he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the Kingdom, which, together with his Declaration, was tied in a ſmall Cord, that was put about his Neck. At this new Inſtance of their Malice the Marquis ſmil'd, and thanked them for it, and ſaid, <hi>he was glad it ſhould be there, and was prouder of wearing it, than ever he had been of the Garter.</hi> and ſo renewing ſome devote Ejacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, he patiently endured the laſt Act of the Executioner.</p>
            <p>Thus died the gallant Marquis of <hi>Montroſe,</hi> after he had given, ſays the Earl of <hi>Clarendon,</hi> in his Character of him, <q rend="inline margQuotes">'as great a Teſtimony of Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty and Courage as a Subject can do, and performed as wonderful Actions in ſeveral Battles, upon as great Inequality of Numbers, and as great Diſadvantages in Reſpect of Arms, and other Preparations for War, as have been performed in this Age.' And he adds, 'That <hi>Montroſe</hi> was in his Nature fearleſs of Danger, and never declined any Enterpriſe for the Difficulty of going thro' with it, but exceedingly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected thoſe which ſeem'd deſperate to other Men, and did believe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to be in himſelf above other Men, which made him live more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy towards thoſe who were, or were wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

            <p>This noble Lord was too young to have had a Part in the War under his Father: After whoſe Death being diveſted of his Eſtate, he liv'd quietly and privately under the Powers that then prevail'd, retaining his Affection and Fidelity to the Crown, which he made manifeſt in performing all the Offices of Fidelity and Duty to the King, throughout the whole Courſe of the Uſurpation, that a generous and worthy Perſon could find any Opportunity for; with which his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty was abundanty ſatisfied and pleas'd.</p>

            </p>
            <p>In the 1558. the Earl of <hi>Morton</hi> was one of the Peers who entered into a Bond of Aſſociation to promote the Reformation of Religion, and the Year thereafter was ſent Ambaſſador to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> to treat with Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the maintaining a firm and laſting Peace betwixt the Two Crowns, when he eſtabliſhed himſelf ſo much in the Favour of that Princeſs, that her Friendſhip was never in any Degree diminiſhed toward him till his dying Day.</p>
            <p>After Queen <hi>Mary</hi> returned home from <hi>France</hi> in 1561, her Majeſty made Choice of the Earl as one of her Privy-Council, and in leſs than a Year thereafter, he was ſent Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor to the Queen of <hi>England,</hi> in which Negotiation he behaved himſelf with great Prudence and Dexterity, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as upon his Return he was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd to be Lord High-Chancellor; and he continued in the Office till the 20th of <hi>March</hi> 1565, he was deprived, and forced to flee to <hi>England,</hi> for alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Acceſſion to the Murder of <hi>David Rizio,</hi> the Queen's <hi>French</hi> Secretary:
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:0390900200:362"/>
But in a ſhort Time thereafter, by the Mediation and Interpoſition of the Earl of <hi>Bothwell,</hi> he obtained his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, which he paid dear for after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; for that Earl thought by this Favour, to bring the Earl of <hi>Morton</hi> over to his Intereſt; but he ſoon found himſelf miſtaken. For tho' he had all Duty and Gratitude to him as a Friend, yet the wicked Earl <hi>Bothwel</hi> did no ſooner propoſe to him the Deſign, and craved his Aſſiſtance, toward the Murder of the Lord <hi>Darnly,</hi> the Queen's Husband, as a Piece of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice which would be very acceptable to her Majeſty; but he conjured him to lay <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſide the Thoughts of ſo baſe and unworthy an Enterprize; and which would be attended with ſo much Infamy and Danger: And when he could not prevail in that Point, in Teſtimony he did abhor ſo deteſtable a Deſign, he left the Court, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired to the Country, when that bloody and barbarous Tragedy was to be acted. And I think the Earl of <hi>Morton</hi>'s Circumſtances at this Time, cannot but be pitied; for if he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed the Earl of <hi>Bothwel</hi>'s Deſign of taking away the King's Life, it had coſt him his own; and his conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it then, brought him to die upon a Scaffold many Years there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
            <p>After the Murder of King <hi>Henry,</hi> when the Nation, both Proteſtants and Papiſts, began to be alarmed with the Queen's Marriage with the Earl of <hi>Bothwell,</hi> who was ſhrewdly ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected as the Murderer of her former Husband, and the Danger the young Prince was in by ſuch an Union; the Earl of <hi>Morton</hi> was one of the moſt forward among the Nobility, who enter'd into an Aſſociation for the Preſervation of the Prince; and when the Queen reſigned the Government to the End her Son might be inveſted in the Sovereignty the Earl of <hi>Morton</hi> took the Coronation Oath for the Infant King, at his Inauguration, on the 29th of <hi>July</hi> 1567.</p>
            <p>In this new Turn of Affairs the Earl of <hi>Morton's</hi> Share was ſo conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that aſſoon as the Earl of <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray</hi> had accepted the Regency, the Earl of <hi>Morton</hi> was declared Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, upon the Removal of the Earl of <hi>Huntly,</hi> who adhered to the Queen, and made heritable Lord High Admiral of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and Sheriff-Principal of <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh</hi>-Shire<note n="a" place="bottom">Charta penes Comitem de Morton, ad Annum 1570.</note>.

               <hi>could.</hi> This Anſwer gave Occaſion to the Queen to ſignifie to the Prior, <hi>That ſhe ſuſpected that Religion was the leaſt Thing he or his Party had in their Thoughts, and that ſhe did not doubt, but that under the Covert and Pretext of Religion, he intended to make an At<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tempt upon the Crown.</hi> The Prior in the mean Time diſowns the Charge, and thought himſelf obliged for his further Vindication, to make a very ſolemn Proteſtation, that he had no other View or Deſign in what he had done, than the Advancement of the true Reformed Religion, and the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the Liberties of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>try, which he could not but bewail he ſaw ſo ſignally invaded by her, at leaſt by thoſe who pretended to act by, and derive their Authority from her; after which he was ſo hearty a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moter of the Reformation, that he became the Head of the Proteſtant Party.</p>
            <p>When Queen <hi>Mary</hi> became a Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow by the Death of King <hi>Francis</hi> II. the Prior of <hi>St. Andrews</hi> was ſent by the Proteſtant Nobility, to invite the Queen home; and ſoon after her Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival, her Majeſty having nam'd a new Privy Council, the Lord <hi>James</hi> her Brother was appointed one of the Number, and not long thereafter he was ſent with a Commiſſion of Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenancy to the Borders, to ſuppreſs an Inſurrection that was threatned in thoſe Parts; and he diſcharged the Truſt repoſed in him with ſuch Cou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rage and Fidelity, that upon his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn the Queen was graciouſly pleas'd to beſtow upon her Brother the Earl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Mar,</hi> then in the Crown; but the Lord <hi>Erskine</hi> being found to have Right to the Earldom of <hi>Mar,</hi> that Lord was by Way of Juſtice reſtored to that Honour, in Lieu whereof the Prior of <hi>St. Andrews</hi> was made Earl of <hi>Murray,</hi> 10th <hi>February</hi> 1562<note n="a" place="bottom">Charta in Pub.

            <p>After this the Earl continued in the greateſt Favour with the Queen, without any Interruption, till the 1565 that her Majeſty declared her Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to marry the Lord <hi>Darnly,</hi> that my Lord <hi>Murray</hi> and many others did oppoſe the Match, upon Pretext of the Danger that might ariſe to Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and to the State by that Union, foraſmuch as it had not been practiſed at any Time, to impoſe a King upon the Nation without the Advice and Conſent of Parliament; and in order to put a more effectual Stop thereto, <hi>They made,</hi> ſays Sir <hi>James Melvil, an Eſſay to take the Lord</hi> Darnly <hi>in the Queen's Company at the Raid of</hi> Baith, <hi>and as they alledged, to have ſent him to</hi> England: But ſailing in their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe, they were ſo cloſely purſued by the Queen's Troops, that they thought it the ſafeſt Courſe for them to flee to <hi>England,</hi> where they met but with a very cold Reception from Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> tho' ſhe had very much encourag'd them under-hand to enter into thoſe Meaſures, to diſturb the Peace and Tranquillity of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and to fully the Glory of Queen <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>'s Reign.</p>
            <p>After the Queen's Marriage with the Lord <hi>Darnly,</hi> a Parliament was call'd, before which the Earl of <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray</hi> and his Aſſociates were ſummon'd to anſwer a Charge of High-Treaſon, which was prepar'd againſt them, and the Earl would have undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly been denounced Rebel, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faulted, had not the Murther of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid Rizio</hi> prevented it, which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd Three Days before the ſitting down of the Parliament.

            <p>Sir <hi>Laurence Oliphant</hi> of <hi>Aberdalgy,</hi> in his Youth went over to <hi>France,</hi> in Company with the Earl of <hi>Douglaſs,</hi> and other young Noblemen, to learn the Art of War<note n="n" place="bottom">Hathornden's Hiſtory.</note>; and after that he travell'd into <hi>Italy</hi> and ſeveral Foreign Parts.

               <note n="o" place="bottom">Charta in Pub. Arch.</note>, and appointed one of the Lords of the Seſſion, for Adminiſtration of Juſtice, whoſe Power was then, if we may believe ſome Authors, ſo great that from them there was no Appeal, either to the King or Parliament.</p>
            <p>In the 1484, the Lord <hi>Oliphant</hi> was named one of the Plenipotentiaries on the Part of <hi>Scotland,</hi> who met at the Congreſs at <hi>Nottingham,</hi> with others commiſſion'd by the King of <hi>England,</hi> in order to take away all Grievances betwixt the Two Realms; by whom at Length a Truce was agreed to, which was to begin at the Riſing of the Sun on the 29th of the Inſtant Month of <hi>September,</hi> and to laſt till the Setting of the Sun on the 29th of <hi>September</hi> 1487, of which his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip was one of the Conſervators<note n="p" place="bottom">Rymer.</note>;
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:0390900200:389"/>
And in order to take away, as much as poſſible, all Grounds and Occaſions of Diſcord betwixt the Two Nations, he was one of the Ambaſſadors on the Part of <hi>Scotland,</hi> authoriz'd to treat about a Marriage betwixt <hi>James</hi> Prince of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Anne de la Pool,</hi> Daughter of <hi>John</hi> Duke of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> and Niece of King <hi>Richard</hi> of <hi>England;</hi> which, tho' it was agreed to, yet by Reaſon of the ſhort Life of King <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard</hi> her Uncle, and the ſubſequent Revolution in <hi>England,</hi> the Marriage did never take Effect. What Part this Lord acted in the troubleſome Times that enſu'd in the End of this Reign, I have not been able to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover. But upon the Acceſſion of King <hi>James</hi> IV. to the Crown, his Lordſhip was appointed by the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, one of the Lords of the King's Privy-Council, <hi>Anno</hi> 1490<note n="a" place="bottom">Black Acts of Parliament.</note>, and impower'd and ordained to exerciſe Juſtice, and to ſuppreſs all Sorts of Diſorders, not only within the Bounds of his own Lands; but had the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of <hi>Strathbrawin</hi> appointed him for the Exerciſe of that Juriſdiction<note n="b" place="bottom">Ibidem.</note>.</p>
            <p>Thereafter, in the 1491, he was ſent upon a Foreign Embaſſy; and upon his Return, when a new Treaty was ſet on Foot, <hi>Anno</hi> 1492, for prolong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Truce with <hi>England,</hi> the Lord <hi>Oliphant</hi> was one of the <hi>Scots</hi> Lords appointed for that Effect<note n="c" place="bottom">Rymer's Foedera Angliae.</note>; who accordingly met at <hi>Coldſtream;</hi> and on the 21ſt of <hi>December</hi> agreed to a Truce, which was to continue till the 21ſt of the ſame Month 1496, for the Ratification of which the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners ſet to the Seals of their reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pective Kings, which ſeemed to be a Practice was not obſerved till that Time. And beſides what elſe I have obſerved of this Lord to make a further Manifeſtation of his Greatneſs; and of the Intereſt and Dependency he had in the County where he reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, I ſhall here exhibite a Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue of the Names of ſuch Perſons, as were retained to ſerve him both in Peace and War, during their reſpective Lives, as I extracted them from the very Indentures themſelves, in the Cuſtody of <hi>James Oliphant</hi> of <hi>Gask,</hi> his lineal Deſcendant.

            <p>He was a great Lover of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, which he alwiſe manifeſted; for in the Matter of the Billoting in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, tho' he was the Parl of <hi>Middleton</hi>'s Friend, yet he could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be brought to favour that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject but oppoſed it with all his Power: Which the Earl of <hi>Middleton</hi> did not reſent againſt Sir <hi>Archbald,</hi> well know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as he himſelf owns, that the Lord Regiſter's oppoſing him in the Project of the Billoting, did not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from any Diſlike to his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips Perſon, but from his known Principles of Moderation, and the Earl did not only then acknowledge the Sincerity of the Regiſter's Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to him, but even afterwards, at a Time when Profeſſing to be the Lord <hi>Middleton</hi>'s Friend, was not thought very meritorious.</p>

               <hi>James</hi> Duke of <hi>Queensbery</hi> his Son and Succeſſor, was born on the 18th of <hi>December</hi> 1662, after he had gone thro' the Courſe of his Studies at the Univerſity of <hi>Glaſgow,</hi> he went into Foreign Parts, to accompliſh himſelf by Travels, <hi>Anno</hi> 1680. and upon his Return in 1684, was by King <hi>Charles</hi> II. made one of the Privy Council, and Lieutenant Colonel of a Regiment of Horſe commanded by Lieutenant General <hi>Graham,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after Viſcount of <hi>Dundee;</hi> and he continued in theſe Poſts till the Year 1688, about which Time he quitted them for Ill Uſage at Court, and upon the Account of the Diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Principles with their Meaſures.</p>
            <p>The Revolution then happening to come on, he appear'd early in it, and was by the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> upon his Acceptance of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, made Colonel of the <hi>Scots</hi> Horſe-Guards, and at the ſame Time one of the Privy Council, and one of the Gentlemen of his Majeſty's Bed-Chamber.</p>
            <p>In the 1690 King <hi>William</hi> ſent him into <hi>Scotland,</hi> to command a ſeparate Body of Troops under Lieutenant Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <hi>Mackay;</hi> Two Years after, he was made one of the Lords of the Treaſury; and in the Parliament 1693, he was authorized to ſit and vote as Lord High Treaſurer, his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther being then alive, and he not a Peer, could not otherwiſe ſit, but as an Officer of State, which depends on the Sovereign's Nomination.</p>
            <p>The Duke his Father departing this Life as aforeſaid in 1695, he laid aſide all Thoughts of Military Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, quitted the Command of the Guards, and was thereupon made Lord Privy Seal, and one of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Lords of the Seſſion.</p>
            <p>His Majeſty in 1700 was pleas'd to make him Lord High Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to repreſent his Royal Perſon in Parliament, where he held Two Seſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions by virtue of Two diſtinct Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents; and upon his Return to Court, his Majeſty on the 18th <hi>June</hi> 1701, was pleas'd to honour the Duke with a diſtinguiſhing Mark of his Royal Favour, for that Evening, a Chapter being held of the moſt noble Order of the Garter at <hi>Kenſingtoun,</hi> where the Sovereign was preſent, the Duke was then elected a Companion of the Order, and inſtall'd at <hi>Windſor</hi> the 10th of <hi>July</hi> thereafter.

               <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> the 9th of <hi>June</hi> 1702; but the Legality of that Seſſion meeting with great Oppoſition from a ſtrong Party in the Parliament, who declared openly that they did not conceive themſelves warranted to meet and act in that Seſſion as a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament<note n="a" place="bottom">The Duke of Hamilton preſented a Paper, which contained the Reaſons of his Diſſent, which may be ſeen at large in the Hiſtory of Europe, and the Memoirs of Scotland, but is fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign to my Purpoſe to inſert it here.</note>, and therefore did not only diſſent from any Thing that ſhould be done or acted therein, but withdrew, and remov'd from their Attendance: Wherefore her Majeſty, to quiet the Minds of her People, was pleas'd to order the Duke to prorogue the Parliament, which his Grace did, and thereupon ſet out for <hi>London;</hi> where he was ſoon thereafter appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted One of the Commiſſioners upon the Part of <hi>Scotland,</hi> for treating of an Union betwixt both Nations; but tho' the Commiſſioners of the reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Kingdoms met ſeveral Times, and ſettled Preliminaries on both Sides; yet upon a more mature De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation, the Court concluded that it was not a fit Seaſon to promote that Buſineſs, but to ſuſpend the further Proſecution of it until a more favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Conjuncture. The former Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament being diſſolved, it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary another ſhould be call'd, as had been uſual at the Entrance of all Sovereigns to the Crown; and therefore her Majeſty iſſued out Writs for the Calling of a new Parliament, which met according to Summons upon the 6th of <hi>May</hi> 1703, to which the Queen was pleas'd to honour the Duke of <hi>Queensberry,</hi> by appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Grace to repreſent her Royal Perſon, as Lord High Commiſſioner. The Parliament being open'd with great Solemnity, they began chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully in paſſing an Act, recognizing her Majeſty's Title to the Crown; but that Unanimity did not long continue among them; for a very ſtrong Party in the Parliament ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving brought in and carried an Act for the Security of the Kingdom, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented it to the Lord Commiſſioner, for the Royal Aſſent; but the <hi>Act of Security</hi> being tranſmitted to the Court, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Miniſtry were ſo wholly averſe to it, and the Country Party in the Parliament of <hi>Scotland</hi> as ſtrenuouſly inſiſting to have it paſs, all the Duke could well do in ſuch a Conjuncture, was to keep it off till he ſhould receive Inſtructions from above; which he did with the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Dexterity, till her Maj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>How great ſoever theſe Services of the Duke's were eſteemed to be for a Time, yet 'tis certain, that in leſs than a Year thereafter, upon a Change of ſome Meaſures at Court, his Grace was remov'd from all Publick Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, except that of one of the Extraordinary Lords of the Seſſion, which was for Life, and of which he could not be deprived.</p>

            <p>Which <hi>George</hi> being a Nobleman of great Wiſdom and Prudence, was much eſteemed by King <hi>James</hi> V. who carried him over to <hi>France</hi> in the 1537, when his Majeſty was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpouſed to <hi>Magdalen</hi> a Daughter of that Crown: After whoſe Death, during the Regency of the Duke of <hi>Chattlerault,</hi> he was ſent Ambaſſador to <hi>Denmark,</hi> in which Negociation he behav'd himſelf with great Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and Dexterity; and being look'd on generally throughout the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom as a very wiſe Man, he was na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med one of the Commiſſioners to go to <hi>France,</hi> to the Queen's Marriage with the Dauphine, where he died at <hi>Deip,</hi> on the 9th of <hi>November</hi> 1558, not without Suſpicion of being poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned.</p>
            <p>I'm heartily ſorry, there are not ſuch Documents in my Hands as ſhould fully enable me to ſet the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages of this noble Earl in a true Light. Mr. <hi>Leſly</hi> gives the Preference to Lady <hi>Margaret Crichton,</hi> as the Earl's firſt Lawful Wife, tho' I think his Authority is little to be valued; for 'tis clear from a Charter of <hi>George</hi> Earl of <hi>Rothes</hi> in the 1528, wherein he gives both <hi>Nicolas Somervel</hi> and <hi>Margaret Crichton</hi> a Liferent out of the ſame Lands; Mrs. <hi>Somervel</hi> is expreſly call'd his Wife, and is firſt mentioned before the other La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, who is no otherwiſe deſigned than by her Name, tho' ſhe was of much greater Quality of Birth than the other: Yet 'tis alſo clear by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Charter, in the 1542, That La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <hi>Margaret Crichton</hi> is deſigned, <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs of Rothes</hi>
               <note n="h" place="bottom">Charta in Pub. Arch. ad Annum 1542.</note>, and then is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly his lawful Wife. For the clearing this Matter, I ſhall humbly
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:0390900200:439"/>
offer my Opinion about it, from ſuch Writs, as I have ſeen relative to it. The Caſe I take to have been this, The Earl of <hi>Rothes</hi> in the Heat of Youth, and without a Diſpenſation, according to the Rites of the Chuch, for the Earl and the Lady were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the forbidden Degrees, did unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonically marry Lady <hi>Mary Crichton,</hi> the Lord <hi>Crichton</hi>'s Daughter, which then in the Conſtruction of the Law, could not be valid without a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation, or the Children conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as begot in lawful Marriage, tho' certainly the Earl thought otherwiſe himſelf; for when <hi>Norman</hi> his Son by her, was a very young Man, he put him in Fie of his Eſtate, and in all the Tranſactions afterwards about it, upon his Forfaulture, he's never deſigned the Earl's natural Son, but only his Son ſimply, and Fiar of the Earldom of <hi>Rothes,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And probably the Earl and the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy diſagreeing, they choſe to live ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate, or ſhe left him, and he mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried again, as was commonly done in that Time, <hi>Nicholas Somervel,</hi> Daughter of Sir <hi>John Somervel</hi> of <hi>Camnethan,</hi> and Widow of <hi>John</hi> Lord <hi>Fleming,</hi> by whom he had <hi>Andrew</hi> his Father's Succeſſor in the Eſtate and Honour; and the Lady dying ſoon thereafter, the Earl was again reconciled to Lady <hi>Margaret Chrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> and legally married her, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſhe could not have been, as I obſerved, ſhe was, deſigned Counteſs of <hi>Rothes;</hi> and in this State of law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Marriage, ſhe bare the Earl a Son, <hi>Robert Leſly,</hi> the Founder of the Houſe of <hi>Findraſſy;</hi> and from his being Brother to <hi>Norman</hi> the Maſter of <hi>Rothes,</hi> both of the ſame Father and Mother, has the Miſtake pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, and the Story been patch'd up of his being, as he is call'd, the <hi>righteous Rothes;</hi> for 'tis plain, that <hi>Norman</hi> being forfaulted for the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Cardinal <hi>Beaton,</hi> his Father the Earl redeemed his own Eſtate again in the Terms he had made it over to him, and ſo could not but in Juſtice ſettle it upon his Son <hi>Andrew,</hi> who being indiſputeably born in law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Marriage, was preferable to <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert,</hi> who was not born of <hi>Margaret Crichton,</hi> till very long after the Death of Dame <hi>Nicholas Somervel;</hi> for 'tis plain at firſt the Earl had no other Son by <hi>Margaret Crichton,</hi> but the aforeſaid <hi>Norman</hi> Maſter of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes.</hi>

While Mr. <hi>Dalrymple</hi> continued in this Station, he ſtudied the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> with the Hiſtory and Antiquities of <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> the better to qualifie him for the Study of the Civil Law, to which he betook himſelf, and wherein he made a very eminent Progreſs.</p>

About this Time his Majeſty, as a further Mark of his Royal Favour to the Lord <hi>Stair,</hi> was pleaſed to create him a Knight Baronet, and to the Heirs Male of his Body for ever.</p>

In the 1670, when a Treaty was ſet on Foot for uniting the Two King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> the Lord <hi>Stair</hi> was named one of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners for that important Affair; and tho the Treaty did not take Effect, yet the Lord <hi>Stair</hi> in the ſeveral Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes that paſſed on that Subject, gave ſuch clear Proofs of his great Knowledge in our Conſtitution and the Laws, that the next enſuing Year Sir <hi>John Gilmoir</hi> Lord Preſident re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning his Office, his Majeſty was pleaſed to confer it upon him, and his Promotion was not attended with any Envy or Diſlike, ſo far as I have ever heard.</p>
            <p>As my Lord <hi>Stair</hi> was a great Lover of his Country, and had the true Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of it always very much at Heart, ſo he embraced every Opportunity to promote and advance the Good of the Nation; for it was the Lord Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident, and ſeveral other Patriots, who concur'd with him, who repreſented to the Duke of <hi>Lauderdale,</hi> upon his coming down in the 1677, ſeveral A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſes and illegal Practices that had been committed; and the Duke there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon was pleaſed to get ſeveral Acts of Council made correctory of theſe Abuſes, particularly that of citing Perſons for Church-Irregularities, without libelling ſpecial Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Time and Place, which was very ill taken, and highly reſented by the Archbiſhop of <hi>St. Andrews,</hi> and ſeveral of his High-flying Brethren.</p>
            <p>My Lord <hi>Stair</hi> did with the ſame Fidelity labour to diſſwade the Duke from bringing in the <hi>Highland</hi> Hoſt upon the Weſt, and from obtaining an Order of Council for a Bond to be taken for diſcovering, apprehending, and bringing to Judgment, <hi>Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Miniſters who held Conventicles: But tho' he did not prevail in this Point, yet the Lord Preſident could never be induc'd either to ſubſcribe the Bond, or approve the <hi>Highland</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>road, for Reaſons founded both in Law and Religion.</p>
            <p>When his Royal Highneſs the Duke of <hi>Albany</hi> came down to <hi>Scotland</hi> in the End of the 1679, the Lords of the Seſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and other Members of the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of Juſtice thought it their Duty to wait on his Highneſs at the <hi>Abbay</hi> of <hi>Holy-rood-houſe,</hi> when the Lord Preſident made a fine congratulatory Speech in the Name of the Society, wherein among other Expreſſions he had one to this Effect, <hi>That it was a Matter of great Joy to the Nation to ſee one of the Royal Family among them, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter being for ſo many Years depriv'd of that Honour; and the Nation being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely Proteſtant, it was the fitteſt Place his Highneſs could make his Receſs to at that Time.</hi> His Lordſhip did after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, with a becoming Freedom and the ourmoſt Fidelity, diſſwade his Highneſs not to attempt any Thing that might ſeem to have the leaſt Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to weaken the Eſtabliſhment of the reform'd Religion, as it was ſecur'd by the Laws. In the Parliament 1681, to which his Royal Highneſs the Duke of <hi>Albany</hi> was his Majeſty's High Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioner, the Lord Preſident was choſen a Member for the Shire of <hi>Wigtoun.</hi> In the Beginning of the Seſſion, his Lordſhip, the Earl of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gile,</hi> and ſeveral others, were named on a Committee of the Articles for Religion, which by the Cuſtom of all <hi>Scots</hi> Parliaments was the firſt Thing treated of: Accordingly the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee did prepare an Act ſecuring the Proteſtant Religion; which Act did ratifie the Act approving the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Faith, and alſo the Act con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the Coronation Oath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by ſeveral ſtanding Laws and Acts of Parliament, to be taken by our Kings before their Entry to the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of the Government: But this Draught which the Committee had prepar'd was laid aſide, in reſpect it was thought to limit too much the Power of a Popiſh Succeſſor to the Crown; in Place whereof a general Statute did paſs, ratifying all former Laws for ſettling and ſecuring the
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:0390900200:467"/>
Liberty and Freedom of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Religion. However, when the Act <hi>aſſerting the Right of Succeſſion to the Crown, according to the Proximity of Blood, without Reſpect to any Difference in Religion,</hi> did paſs, it was thought expedient, even by thoſe who promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it, to have a more ſpecial Law made for Security of the Proteſtant Religion: Accordingly a D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The Lord <hi>Stair,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Argyle,</hi> and other Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triots were forward to have a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Standard of the Proteſtant Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on eſtabliſhed, that might more effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually prevent <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting into Publick Offices, in the Event of a Popiſh Prince upon the Throne; and the Lord Preſident urged the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with ſo much Strength of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that the firſt Clauſe in the <hi>Teſt</hi> which was agreed to, did exclude all Perſons from Publick Truſt in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, who did not ſwear, <hi>That they own'd and ſincerely profeſsed the true Proteſtant Religion, contain'd in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Faith, recorded in the Parliament</hi> 1567; <hi>and that they believed the ſame to be founded on and agreeable to the written Word of GOD; and that they ſhould adhere thereunto all the Days of their Lifetime, and educate their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren therein, and that they ſhould never conſent to any Change or Alteration con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary thereunto.</hi> Tho' the Act paſſed, yet the urging of that Clauſe by the Lord Preſident was highly re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ented by his Royal Highneſs the Duke of <hi>Alba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> the Lord High Commiſſioner, who the very Night the Act paſſed, ſaid to ſome about him, and in his neareſt Confidence, <hi>That the Lord</hi> Stair, by bringing in the Confeſſion of Faith in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Teſt, had ruined all honeſt Men,</hi> meaning <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Tho' the Lord Preſident was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with the firſt Part of the Teſt-Act, which ſeem'd to be a very effectual Security againſt Popery; yet he could not ſign the latter Part of it, which ſtruck againſt <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Diſſenters, therein call'd <hi>Fanaticks;</hi> and therefore he went up to the King to declare ſo much, and to deſire his Majeſty's Leave to retire, and to lay down his Employment; but before he arrived at <hi>London,</hi> his Behaviour in the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was improv'd as ſo heavy a Charge againſt him at Court, that he was remov'd from his Office in the Seſſion, without mentioning of any Cauſe, tho' he held his Place in the ordinary Way of Judges, <hi>ad vitam aut culpam.</hi> But his Remove from his Place was not all he was like to ſuffer; for after that he was not allowed to live without Diſturbance in his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement at his Seat in the Country; for his Tenents were haraſſed with grievous Fynes for Non-conformity; and he got a Hint from his Friend Sir <hi>George Mackenzie</hi> the Lord Advocate; that he could not ſecure him, that he might not be thrown in Priſon. My Lord <hi>Stair</hi> finding himſelf in theſe Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, thought it ſafer for him to retire, and to go into a voluntary Exile into <hi>Holland</hi> in the End of 1682, where he printed his <hi>Philoſophia nova Experimentalis,</hi> which, as it gain'd him great Reputation with the Learned, ſo 'tis generally read with great Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe.</p>
            <p>While the Lord <hi>Stair</hi> was abroad, many Witneſſes were examined and re-examined, not only his own Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks, but ſome of his neareſt Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to find out Matter for a Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Purſuit againſt him; but nothing was diſcovered, ſave that ſome Perſons ſuſpected to have been engaged in the Rebellion 1679 liv'd upon his Ground, or lu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

and then before the Parliament, upon the common Ground of Harbour and Reſet of Rebels: But the Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was ſo ſcrimp, that by their own Rules they could not condemn him; for he was a wiſe Man, and had taken Care to live with all poſſible Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection and Caution.</p>
            <p>The Lord <hi>Stair</hi> ſojourn'd in <hi>Holland</hi> till the 1688, he came over with the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> in his Expedition to <hi>Britain,</hi> to relieve theſe Nations from Popery and Arbitrary Power; in which glorious Deſign no Man en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged more frankly than the old Lord <hi>Stair:</hi> And when the Prince was juſt ſetting Sail for <hi>England,</hi> 'tis reported his Lordſhip took the Freedom to ask his Highneſs, <hi>What his true Deſign was in going to</hi> England? To which the Prince was pleaſed to anſwer, <hi>That he deſigned the Glory of GOD, and the Security of the Proteſtant Religion:</hi> Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which, 'tis ſaid, the Lord <hi>Stair</hi> pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led off his Wig, and ſaid, <hi>Tho' I be now in the</hi> 70<hi>th Year of mine Age, I'm willing to venture that,</hi> meaning his Head, <hi>and his own and his Childrens Fortunes in ſuch an Undertaking.</hi> This the Prince took in very good Part, and reported it to others, as that which very much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged him to proſecute his Deſign.</p>
            <p>When the Prince landed at <hi>Torby,</hi> his Highneſs expreſſed a particular Concern about the Lord <hi>Stair,</hi> and ſent to enquire concerning his Health, and underſtanding his Horſes were not come up, the Prince ſent him Horſes of his for his Accomodation.</p>
            <p>Upon the Advancement of the Prince and Princeſs of <hi>Orange</hi> to the Throne, their Majeſties, who had a very great Kindneſs and Eſteem for the Lord <hi>Stair,</hi> as a Perſon of great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity, and of unqueſtionable Zeal for the Proteſtant Religion, were pleaſed to reſtore him to his Office of Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of the Seſſion in the 1689, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to the <hi>Claim of Right:</hi> But their Majeſties thought this Piece of Juſtice was not enough to reward the Lord <hi>Stair</hi>'s great Merit; wherefore they were further pleaſed to raiſe him to the Peerage, by the Stile and Title of Viſcount of <hi>Stair,</hi> by Letters Patent bearing Date 20th <hi>April</hi> 1690, after which his Lordſhip continued with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt Interruption in the favour of his Prince, and enjoyed his Office, which he had diſcharged in all Times, with great Abilities and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Integrity till his Death, which happened on the 25th of <hi>November</hi> 1695, aged 76, and was with great Funeral Solemnity interred in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedral Church of St. <hi>Giles.</hi>

            <p>Tho' Sir <hi>John Dalrymple</hi> was very much frown'd on at this Time by the Court, he would by no Means forego his Principles, tho' his Wiſdom and Experience put him upon acting cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpectly, and with great Caution, during the Remainder of King <hi>Charles</hi> his Reign: But after King <hi>James</hi>'s co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to the Crown, that Prince, upon his own Obſervation of Sir <hi>John Dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rymple</hi>'s Abilities in his Pleadings as a Lawyer, was pleaſed to conceive a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good Opinion of him; inſomuch as he was pleaſed to make him Lord Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate, upon the Removal of Sir <hi>George Mackenzie,</hi> who was laid aſide in the 1686, for not complying with the Deſign of the Court, in taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the penal Laws againſt Popery; tho' it could never be ſaid by Sir <hi>John Dalrymple</hi>'s greateſt Enemies, that he had in any Degree contributed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; but on the contrary endeavour'd all he could to animate the Members of Parliament to ſtand firm to their Religion, and not to open a Door to let in Popery and many other Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies.

            </p>
            <p>Sir <hi>John Dalrymple</hi> being a very zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Proteſtant, all the Favours he had confer'd on him by King <hi>James</hi> and others, he might have expected were no Temptations to bring him into the Court-Meaſures at that Time; and the Revolution coming about, he fell heartily in with it, and with thoſe who were the moſt zealous Promoters of it.</p>
            <p>In the Convention of Eſtates 1689, Sir <hi>John Dalrymple</hi> ſhewed himſelf a ſteady Aſſerter of the Religion and Liberties of his Country, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly expreſſed on that Occaſion a hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Deſire, that a Treaty might be ſet on Foot for a nearer Union of the Two Nations: But that Deſign meeting with Oppoſition from Perſons of very different Principles, it was dropt at that Time; and when the grand Affair of ſettling the Crown came to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated, the Eſtates found at firſt great Difficulty how to declare the Throne vacant; at length Sir <hi>John Dalrymple</hi> ended the Debate by ſuch Reaſons, that the Convention went into his Propoſals, and ſettled the Crown up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Prince and Princeſs of <hi>Orange.</hi> So ſoon as it paſſed into an Act, he was one of the Commiſſioners ſent up from the Convention with the Offer of the Crown to the Prince and Princeſs of <hi>Orange,</hi> with the Nations Grievances and Claim of Right, which their High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes having accepted of, they were graciouſly pleaſed to reward Sir <hi>John</hi>'s Merit and Zeal ſhown for their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement to the Throne, by making him Lord Advocate in 1690, and in leſs than a Year thereafter he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted one of the Principal Secretaries of State; and he diſcharged the Office with eminent Sufficiency, till the 1695, that the Parliament having made ſome Attempts againſt him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Affair of the horrid Maſſacre of <hi>Glenco,</hi> he reſigned his Place, mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that the King might not be made uneaſie by his continuing in ſo emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent a Poſt ſo near his Royal Perſon, tho' his Majeſty did highly reſent the Treatment the Secretary had met with, and turn'd all thoſe out of his

Service, who had been the greateſt Sticklers againſt him.</p>
            <p>Tho' the Maſter of <hi>Stair</hi> did not think he had been well uſed, yet he never ſhewed the leaſt Reſentment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Court; but on the contrary by his great Wiſdom and Temper in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſed to moderate the Heats and Animoſities which aroſe both in the Parliament and in the Country, upon the Diſappointments of <hi>Darien;</hi> and the Figure he made in the publick De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates by his Speeches in Parliament were ſufficient to convince every Body that he might have been employed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain in ſome of the higheſt Offices of State, but he conſtantly declin'd Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment; for he was reſolv'd never to be further concern'd in publick Affairs, than as a Privy Councellour; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>John</hi> the preſent Earl of <hi>Stair</hi> was born at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> the 20th of <hi>July</hi> 1673.

In a very few Months he acquired the Habit of ſpeaking <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Dutch;</hi> in both which he has been ſince improved to a Degree of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, to which ſeldom any Stranger has attained. His Maſters at <hi>Leyden</hi> were exceedingly pleaſed with him, and remaked, that though he ſeem'd fond of Play, and ſolicited his Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows to it, yet he was never found
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:0390900200:472"/>
out of his Place at School: But while he ſeemed thus devoted to his Play, he advanc'd in his Learning as if he had minded nothing elſe: He was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted from Claſs to Claſs, with the Approbation of the Magiſtrates, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors and Maſters of the School at <hi>Leyden,</hi> and had one of the firſt <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miums</hi> at every Promotion, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Cuſtom of that School, for diſtinguiſhing the Merit of the beſt Scholars, and for exciting in them a greater Deſire of going for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
            <p>After the Earl had made a good Progreſs in the Schools there, he returned to his Father in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and in the Univerſity of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued the Study of the Greek and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin, adding the Study of the Logicks and other Parts of Philoſophy, under Mr. <hi>Kennedy,</hi> then Regent in that Univerſity. He ſtudied the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicks under the learned and very juſtly celebrated Doctor <hi>David Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory,</hi> then Profeſſor at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and afterwards <hi>Savilian</hi> Profeſſor at <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford.</hi> The Earl had alſo the Aſſiſtance of Mr. <hi>Gregory</hi> the preſent Profeſſor of the Mathematicks at <hi>Edinburgh.</hi> And he had the conſtant Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs to be the Favourite of his Maſters, and to be much beloved by his follow Students.</p>
            <p>In the Beginning of the Year 1688 he went again to <hi>Holland</hi> to viſit his Grandfather and Grandmother, to whom he was very dear, and return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>October</hi> that Year to <hi>Scotland,</hi> to reaſſume his Studies in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity, but the Commotions that happened at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> in <hi>November,</hi> interrupted the ſtated Courſe of every Thing till the Revolution was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleted, and the Government eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in the Perſon of King <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam.</hi> In the Beginning of the Year 1689 he went with his Father to <hi>London.</hi> From this Time forward the preſent Earl, then Mr. <hi>Dalrymple,</hi> begun to ply the Study of the living Languages, as well as that of the dead, and to improve himſelf in theſe Kinds of Exerciſes that belong to a young Gentleman, ſtill with the ſame Conſtancy and good Effect.</p>
            <p>He returned again to <hi>Scotland</hi> with his Father, and ſaw the Meeting of the Eſtates, and the two firſt Seſſions of the Parliament of <hi>Scotland</hi> under King <hi>William</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary</hi> in the Year 1689 and 1690.</p>
            <p>His Father being made Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary of State in the Beginning of the Year 1691, his Son, the preſent Earl, had the Advantage to be much at Court, which was a new Kind of Education, that added both Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and uſeful Improvement to thoſe he had acquired before: And when his Father followed the King to <hi>Flanders,</hi> the Earl went along. In the Summer he was in the Camp, and was preſent at the Battle of <hi>Steen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kirk,</hi> where the brave Earl of <hi>Angus</hi> was kill'd on the Head of his Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, with whom the preſent Earl of <hi>Stair</hi> advanced to the Enemy as a Volunteer.</p>
            <p>In the Winter the Earl returned once more to his Studies at <hi>Leyden,</hi> heard the famous Profeſſors there read on <hi>Grotius</hi> and the Inſtitutions of the Civil Law, and had at the ſame Time Colleges of Hiſtory, imploying every Minute to the beſt Advantage.</p>
            <p>After theſe Foundations laid, there remained nothing more to fit the Earl for Buſineſs but travelling to ſee how Men of different Tempers and Religions lived among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and other Men, and to learn from the firſt Hand the Genius, Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, Conſtitutions and Languages of ſome of the moſt conſiderable Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in <hi>Europe.</hi> He ſet out with the Lord <hi>Lexington,</hi> who went in the Year 1700 to <hi>Vienna</hi> Ambaſſador. The Earl having been ſome Time at that Court went on to <hi>Italy,</hi> viſiting
<pb n="*462" facs="tcp:0390900200:473"/>
on his Way the ſeveral great Cities, Republicks and Courts in <hi>Italy.</hi> At <hi>Rome</hi> he applied himſelf to the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of Antiquities, Architecture, and other Things which are taught there, ſtudying with much Application the <hi>Italian</hi> Language; and becauſe he could not then go into <hi>France,</hi> during the War then between King <hi>William</hi> and that Crown, he ſtudied the <hi>French</hi> very carefully by the Help of a <hi>French Abbé,</hi> whom he found at <hi>Rome,</hi> that he might enter deeper into the Strength, Genius and Beauties of that Language ſo univerſally in Uſe.</p>
            <p>Having made the Tour of <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> he returned to <hi>England</hi> in the 1701, and that Year came to <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> with his Father, where he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued until the 1702, at which Time there being new Regiments to be raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>Scotland,</hi> he went to Court, to offer his Service upon the Appearance of an approaching War. The King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him very graciouſly, but a Scheme of Officers was formed for theſe Regiments leaving him out. His Majeſty having obſerved it, told, that he was reſolved to provide for Mr. <hi>Dalrymple,</hi> who by that Scheme was neglected, and for that Reaſon his Majeſty reſolved to make him Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Lieutenant Colonel of his Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Foot Guards in <hi>Scotland.</hi> But King <hi>William</hi>'s Death happening juſt then, his Commiſſion as Second Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant Colonel of the Regiment of Foot Guards was ſigned by Queen <hi>Anne,</hi> on one of the firſt Days of her Reign.</p>
            <p>Being now in the Army (where his Inclination had ever led him to ſerve) he embraced the firſt Opportunities to appear in that Way, which ſoon hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened: For the late Queen being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged with the Confederates in the Second War againſt <hi>France,</hi> and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſent over an Army under the Command of the Duke of <hi>Marlbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough,</hi> the Earl made the very firſt Campaign as a Volunteer, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed himſelf in the Actions of greateſt Hazard and Conſequence, as at the taking of <hi>Venlo</hi> and <hi>Liege,</hi> and at the Cannonade of <hi>Peer.</hi> He was alſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed by the Duke as his <hi>Aidde Camp.</hi> It was in this Campaign that he laid the Foundation of that Friendſhip with which that great General has conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly honoured him ſince.</p>
            <p>The Account of the Earl from that Period is ſo interwoven with the great Events Civil and Military, that have happen'd, that tho all the Materials for going thro' with a juſt and exact Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory were at Hand, yet the Nature of this Undertaking would not admit of purſuing it, or the Share he had in theſe great Actions; which beſides has been remarkable enough by many very conſiderable Circumſtances well known. I have therefore contented my ſelf in a plain Way, and without enlarging on Particulars, to ſet forth what concerns his Youth and Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which has been one conſtant Series of Application to thoſe Things which might fit him for the eminent Station where he is now placed.</p>
            <p>I ſhall therefore finiſh what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns him with the bare Enumeration of the Employments he has gone through.</p>
            <p>He had a Commiſſion as Colonel of Foot in the <hi>Dutch</hi> Service in <hi>April</hi> 1703; in the Year 1705 he ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Brigadeer General <hi>Ferguſſon</hi> deceaſt, in a Regiment of Foot on the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Eſtabliſhment; and after the Death of Lord <hi>John Hay,</hi> he had the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand given him of the Royal <hi>Scots</hi> Dragoons, by the Name of the <hi>Royal Greys,</hi> by a Commiſſion bearing Date the 24th <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1706, which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to command till the laſt Year of the late Queen, when he was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to ſell it to the Earl of <hi>Portmore.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He commanded a Brigade of Foot at the Battle of <hi>Ramellies,</hi> and was immediately after that Battle made
<pb n="**462" facs="tcp:0390900200:474"/>
Brigadeer. His Commiſſion bears Date from the Day of that Battle. He was Brigadeer in the Battle of <hi>Audenard,</hi> and carried the News of the Victory into <hi>England;</hi> he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marded as Major-General at the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of <hi>Tanier</hi> near <hi>Mons;</hi> and was made Lieutenant-General at the Siege of <hi>Deway</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He was ſent Envoy Extraordinary to the King of <hi>Poland</hi> in the Winter of the Year 1709, where he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided till <hi>May</hi> 1710, that he returned to the Siege of <hi>Doway,</hi> and having left his Secretary in <hi>Poland,</hi> continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in that Character till the Year 1711, that Mr. <hi>Scot</hi> was ſent to that Court.</p>
            <p>Since King <hi>George</hi>'s Acceſſion to the Crown, the Earl has been made Lord of the Bedchamber; one of His Majeſty's moſt honourable Privy-Council in the 17<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>4; and in <hi>January</hi> thereafter he was ſent Envoy Extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary to the Court of <hi>France,</hi> but at the ſame time he had Powers and Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentials to treat as Ambaſſador and Plenipotentiary, and when his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip ſhould judge it neceſſary, to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume that Character.</p>

Learning. Mr. <hi>Alexander</hi> having an Inclination and a Talent from his Youth to Poetry, he declined all other Buſineſs, and delivered himſelf up in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tirely to his own Genius, in which he made a wonderful Proficiency in the Study of the ancient Poets, by whom he form'd an excellent <hi>Gouſt</hi> of Poetry; inſomuch as in a ſhort Time he came to be looked on as one of the moſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent of that Profeſſion. K. <hi>James</hi> who then reigned, was a Prince of great Learning and Knowledge, and delighted much in the Converſation of learned Men, particularly Mr. <hi>Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xander,</hi> who preſented him with ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral elegant Poems to the King's great Delight, and the gaining the Applauſe of Perſons of the firſt Rank for Quality and Wit to himſelf, to whom in a ſhort Time he grew very acceptable. After he had lived ſome Years about the Court, his Majeſty, who looked on him as a wiſe Man, was pleaſed to prefer him to be Maſter of Requeſts, and a Knight in 1614: But his Majeſty's Bounty did not reſt in the conferring one ſingle Favour on him; for Sir <hi>William</hi> being a learned and projecting Man, and having ſettled a Colony in <hi>Nova Scotia</hi> in <hi>America</hi> upon his own Charges, King <hi>James</hi> made him a Grant of it by his Royal Deed on the 21. of <hi>September</hi> 1621, and did intend to erect the Order of Baronet for encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging and advancing ſo good a Work: But the Two or Three laſt Years of that Prince's Reign having been leſs pleaſant to him, by the Jealouſies which about that Time began in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> he thought fit to ſuſpend the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Proſecution of that Affair until a more favourable Conjuncture, which he lived not to ſee. But King <hi>Charles</hi> I. who with his Father's other Virtues, inherited his Affection to his native Kingdom, immediately upon his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to the Crown, propoſed nothing more than the furthering of that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, which was projected to be of ſo great a Benefit to the Nation, and therefore made Sir <hi>William Alexander</hi> Lieutenant of <hi>New Scotland,</hi> and inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted the Order of Knight-Baronet for the encouraging and advancing of that Colony, and gave him the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of coining ſmall Copper-Money, a Gift which was inveighed againſt, even at that Time, with great Bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: But his Majeſty, who thought that too great Encouragement could not be given to learned and worthy Men, ſuch as Sir <hi>William</hi> was, and being fully ſatisfied of his great Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Integrity, was graciouſly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in 1626 to make him Secretary of State, in place of the Earl of <hi>Hadding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toun,</hi> and a Peer, by the Title of Viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count <hi>Stirling</hi>

Of this the Lord <hi>Clarendon</hi> clears him, and ſays, <hi>That there was never any Ground, either then, or in all the after Part of his Life, for that Suſpicion; but that if the Lord Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer had been as much depended upon to adviſe the Biſhops in the Proſecution of the Liturgy, and for the Conduct of it, as he was to aſſiſt them in the carrying on whatſoever they propoſed, it is very proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble either ſo much would not have been undertaken together, or that it would have ſucceeded better.</hi> But whatever Suſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion ſome of the Biſhops might enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the Lord Treaſurer's not being devoted to ſome of them, 'tis certain the King had no Jealouſie of the Earl, as if he had been in any Degree corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted or diſaffected to the Government as it was eſtabliſh'd by Law; inſomuch as when his Majeſty was pleaſed in the 1639. to call a Parliament and an Aſſembly of the Clergy, in order to appeaſe the Commotions, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh the Fire that the Endeavour of bringing in the Liturgy and the Book of Canons had kindled, he pitch'd on the Lord Treaſurer, whom he knew to be as wiſe a Man as the Nation then had, and very equal to the Work to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent his Royal Perſon, both in the Parliament and the Aſſembly; in that great and difficult Truſt he acquitted himſelf to his Majeſty's great Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and did with the outmoſt Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour and Fidelity aſſert the Royal Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative, as eſtabliſhed by Law or ancient Cuſtom; and when he thought that was invaded either in the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or in the Aſſembly of the Church, he oppoſed it with all his Power, and gave them all the Trouble he could.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="483" facs="tcp:0390900200:495"/>
As the faithful Diſcharge of his great Truſt did very much eſtabliſh and confirm the Treaſurer in his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's good Opinion, ſo it drew upon him the implacable Reſentment of the other Party, who purſued him with ſo extraordinary Animoſity, that in the next Parliament of 1641, they prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with his Majeſty to take the White-Staff from him, and impeach'd him of High Treaſon, of which they likewiſe found him guilty; but having refer'd his Puniſhment to the King, his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty was ſo far from conceiving the Earl had merited ſuch a ſevere Proſecution, that he gave Orders, that in all Events a Pardon might be prepared under the Great Seal<note n="a" place="bottom">The Remiſſion I have ſeen and peruſed in the Hands of the Earl of Traquair.</note>, wherein his Majeſty does not only very fully abſolve him from the Crimes objected againſt him in the Impeachment, but annexes to the Remiſſion an ample Teſtimony of his great Abilities and ſingular Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity in the Diſcharge of all the great Employments he had been intruſted with under the Crown:</p>
            <p>But this Teſtimony of the King's gracious Affection to the Earl did him very little Service; for during the Civil War, by Virtue of the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that had formerly paſſed on him, his Eſtate was ſequeſtrated and taken from him; and for the greater Security of his Perſon, he was forced to flee out of the Country; and tho' they allowed him to return Home, and live at his own Houſe, yet he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued under Reſtraint till the 1647, that he was enlarged and ſuffered to ſit in the Parliament, where he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured all he could to bring the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to a thorough Engagement to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem and relieve the King, who was then a Priſoner in the Iſle of <hi>Wight;</hi> and the Parliament having raiſed an Army, the Earl of <hi>Traquair</hi> upon his own Charges levied a Regiment of Horſe, and ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
