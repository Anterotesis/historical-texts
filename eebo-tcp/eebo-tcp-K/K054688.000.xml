            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
TRANSLATOR'S PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE following work was found in the
library of an ancient Catholic family
in the north of <hi>England.</hi> It was printed at
<hi>Naples,</hi> in the black letter, in the year 1529.
How much ſooner it was written does not
appear. The principal incidents are ſuch
as were believed in the darkeſt ages of
Chriſtianity; but the language and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
have nothing that ſavours of barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſm.
The ſtile is the pureſt <hi>Italian.</hi> If
the ſtory was written near the time when
it is ſuppoſed to have happened, it muſt
have been between 1095, the aera of the
firſt cruſade, and 1243, the date of the laſt,
or not long afterwards. There is no other
circumſtance in the work, that can lead us
to gueſs at the period in which the ſcene is
laid: The names of the actors are evidently
fictitious, and probably diſguiſed on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe:
Yet the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> names of the domeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics
ſeem to indicate that this work was not
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0507001200:4"/>
compoſed, until the eſtabliſhment of the
<hi>Arragonian</hi> Kings in <hi>Naples</hi> had made <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi>
appellations familiar in that country.
The beauty of the diction, and the zeal of
the author [moderated, however, by ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
judgment] concur to make me think
that the date of the compoſition was little
antecedent to that of the impreſſion. Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
were then in their moſt flouriſhing ſtate
in <hi>Italy,</hi> and contributed to diſpel the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
of ſuperſtition, at that time ſo forcibly
attacked by the reformers. It is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely
that an artful prieſt might endeavour
to turn their own arms on the innovators;
and might avail himſelf of his abilities as
an author to confirm the populace in their
ancient errors and ſuperſtitions. If this
was his view, he has certainly acted with
ſignal addreſs. Such a work as the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
would enſlave a hundred vulgar minds
beyond half the books of controverſy that
have been written from the days of <hi>Luther</hi>
to the preſent hour.</p>
            <p>This ſolution of the author's motives is
however offered as a mere conjecture.
Whatever his views were, or whatever ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
the execution of them might have,
his work can only be laid before the public
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:0507001200:5"/>
at preſent as a matter of entertainment.
Even as ſuch, ſome apology for it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary.
Miracles, viſions, necromancy,
dreams, and other preternatural events, are
exploded now even from romances. That
was not the caſe when our author wrote;
much leſs when the ſtory itſelf is ſuppoſed
to have happened. Belief in every kind of
prodigy was ſo eſtabliſhed in thoſe dark
ages, that an author would not be faithful
to the <hi>manners</hi> of the times, who ſhould
omit all mention of them. He is not
bound to believe them himſelf, but he muſt
repreſent his actors as believing them.</p>
            <p>If this <hi>air</hi> of <hi>the miraculous</hi> is excuſed, the
reader will find nothing elſe unworthy of
his peruſal. Allow the poſſibility of the
facts, and all the actors comport themſelves
as perſons would do in their ſituation.
There is no bombaſt, no ſimiles, flowers,
digreſſions, or unneceſſary deſcriptions. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
thing tends directly to the cataſtrophe.
Never is the reader's attention relaxed.
The rules of the drama are almoſt obſerved
throughout the conduct of the piece. The
characters are well drawn, and ſtill better
maintained. Terror, the author's principal
engine, prevents the ſtory from ever lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing;
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0507001200:6"/>
and it is ſo often contraſted by
pity, that the mind is kept up in a conſtant
viciſſitude of intereſting paſſions.</p>
            <p>Some perſons may perhaps think the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters
of the domeſtics too little ſerious for
the general caſt of the ſtory; but beſides
their oppoſition to the principal perſonages,
the art of the author is very obſervable in
his conduct of the ſubalterns. They diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
many paſſages eſſential to the ſtory,
which could not be well brought to light
but by their naivetè and ſimplicity: In
particular, the womaniſh terror and foibles
of <hi>Bianca,</hi> in the laſt chapter, conduce eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentially
towards advancing the cataſtrophe.</p>
            <p>It is natural for a tranſlator to be preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced
in favour of his adopted work. More
impartial readers may not be ſo much ſtruck
with the beauties of this piece as I was.
Yet I am not blind to my author's defects.
I could wiſh he had grounded his plan on a
more uſeful moral than this; that <hi>the ſins
of fathers are viſited on their children to the
third and fourth generation.</hi> I doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
in his time, any more than at preſent,
ambition curbed its appetite of dominion
from the dread of ſo remote a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
And yet this moral is weakened by
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:0507001200:7"/>
that leſs direct inſinuation, that even ſuch
anathema may be diverted by devotion to
St. <hi>Nicholas.</hi> Here the intereſt of the Monk
plainly gets the better of the judgment of
the Author. However, with all its faults,
I have no doubt but the <hi>Engliſh</hi> reader will
be pleaſed with a ſight of this performance.
The piety that reigns throughout, the leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of virtue that are inculcated, and the
rigid purity of the ſentiments, exempt this
work from the cenſure to which romances
are but too liable. Should it meet with
the ſucceſs I hope for, I may be encouraged
to re-print the original <hi>Italian,</hi> though it
will tend to depreciate my own labour.
Our language falls far ſhort of the charms
of the <hi>Italian,</hi> both for variety and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.
The latter is peculiarly excellent
for ſimple narrative. It is difficult in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
to relate</hi> without falling too low or riſing
too high; a fault obviouſly occaſioned by
the little care taken to ſpeak pure language
in common converſation. Every <hi>Italian</hi> or
<hi>Frenchman</hi> of any rank piques himſelf on
ſpeaking his own tongue correctly and with
choice. I cannot flatter myſelf with hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
done juſtice to my author in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect:
His ſtile is as elegant, as his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:0507001200:8"/>
of the paſſions is maſterly. It is pity
that he did not apply his talents to what
they were evidently proper for, the theatre.</p>
            <p>I will detain the reader no longer, but
to make one ſhort remark. Though the
machinery is invention, and the names of
the actors imaginary, I cannot but believe,
that the ground-work of the ſtory is founded
on truth. The ſcene is undoubtedly laid in
ſome real caſtle. The author ſeems fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
without deſign, to deſcribe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
parts. <hi>The chamber,</hi> ſays he, <hi>on
the right-hand; the door on the left-hand; the
diſtance from the chapel to</hi> Conrad'<hi>s apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi>
Theſe and other paſſages are ſtrong
preſumptions that the author had ſome cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
building in his eye. Curious perſons,
who have leiſure to employ in ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearches,
may poſſibly diſcover in the <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi>
writers the foundation on which our
author has built. If a cataſtrophe, at all
reſembling that which he deſcribes, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
to have given riſe to this work, it
will contribute to intereſt the reader, and
will make the caſtle of <hi>Otranto</hi> a ſtill more
moving ſtory.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>MANFRED,</hi> Prince of <hi>Otranto,</hi> had
one ſon and one daughter: The lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a moſt beautiful virgin, aged eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen,
was called <hi>Matilda. Conrad,</hi> the ſon, was
three years younger, a homely youth, ſickly,
and of no promiſing diſpoſition; yet he was the
darling of his father, who never ſhowed any
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0507001200:10"/>
ſymptoms of affection to <hi>Matilda. Manfred</hi> had
contracted a marriage for his ſon with the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis
of <hi>Vicenza</hi>'s daughter, <hi>Iſabella</hi>; and ſhe
had already been delivered by her guardians into
the hands of <hi>Manfred,</hi> that he might celebrate
the wedding as ſoon as <hi>Conrad</hi>'s infirm ſtate of
health would permit. <hi>Manfred</hi>'s impatience for
this ceremonial was remarked by his family and
neighbours. The former indeed, apprehending
the ſeverity of their Prince's diſpoſition, did not
dare to utter their ſurmiſes on this precipitation.
<hi>Hippolita,</hi> his wife, an amiable lady, did ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
venture to repreſent the danger of marry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their only ſon ſo early, conſidering his great
youth, and greater infirmities; but ſhe never
received any other anſwer than reflections on her
own ſterility, who had given him but one heir.
His tenants and ſubjects were leſs cautious in
their diſcourſes: They attributed this haſty
wedding to the Prince's dread of ſeeing accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed
an ancient prophecy, which was ſaid to
have pronounced, that <hi>the Caſtle and Lordſhip of</hi>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:0507001200:11"/>
Otranto <hi>ſhould paſs from the preſent family, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
the real owner ſhould be grown too large to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habit
it.</hi> It was difficult to make any ſenſe of
this prophecy; and ſtill leſs eaſy to conceive
what it had to do with the marriage in queſtion.
Yet theſe myſteries, or contradictions, did not
make the populace adhere the leſs to their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</p>
               <p>Young <hi>Conrad</hi>'s birth-day was fixed for his
eſpouſals. The company was aſſembled in the
chapel of the Caſtle, and every thing ready for
beginning the divine office, when <hi>Conrad</hi> himſelf
was miſſing. <hi>Manfred</hi> impatient of the leaſt
delay, and who had not obſerved his ſon retire,
diſpatched on of his attendants to ſummon the
young Prince. The ſervant, who had not ſtaid
long enough to have croſſed the court to <hi>Conrad</hi>'s
apartment, came running back breathleſs, in a
frantic manner, his eyes ſtaring, and foaming
at the mouth. He ſaid nothing, but pointed to
the court. The company were ſtruck with ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
and amazement. The Princeſs <hi>Hippolita,</hi>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:0507001200:12"/>
without knowing what was the matter, but anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
for her ſon, ſwooned away. <hi>Manfred,</hi> leſs
apprehenſive than enraged at the procraſtination
of the nuptials, and at the folly of his domeſtic,
aſked imperiouſly, what was the matter? The
fellow made no anſwer, but continued pointing
towards the court-yard; and at laſt, after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated
queſtions put to him, cried out, oh! The
helmet! the helmet! In the mean time, ſome
of the company had run into the court, from
whence was heard a confuſed noiſe of ſhrieks,
horror, and ſurpriſe. <hi>Manfred,</hi> who began to
be alarmed at not ſeeing his ſon, went himſelf
to get information of what occaſioned this ſtrange
confuſion. <hi>Matilda</hi> remained endeavouring to
aſſiſt her mother, and <hi>Iſabella</hi> ſtaid for the ſame
purpoſe, and to avoid ſhowing any impatience
for the bridegroom, for whom, in truth, ſhe
had conceived little affection.</p>
               <p>The firſt thing that ſtruck <hi>Manfred</hi>'s eyes
was a groupe of his ſervants endeavouring to
raiſe ſomething that appeared to him a mountain
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0507001200:13"/>
of fable plumes. He gazed without believing
his ſight. What are ye doing? cried <hi>Manfred</hi>
wrathfully; where is my ſon? A volley of voices
replied, Oh! My Lord! The Prince! the
Prince, the helmet! the helmet! ſhocked with
theſe lamentable ſounds, and dreading he know
not what; he advanced haſtily,—but what a
ſight for a father's eyes!—he beheld his child
daſhed to pieces, and almoſt buried under an
enormous helmet, an hundred times more large
than any caſque ever made for human being, and
ſhaded with a proportionable quantity of black
feathers.</p>
               <p>The horror of the ſpectacle, the ignorance of
all around how this misfortune had happened,
and above all, the tremendous phaenomenon
before him, took away the Prince's ſpeech.
Yet his ſilence laſted longer than even grief
could occaſion. He fixed his eyes on what he
wiſhed in vain to believe a viſion; and ſeemed
leſs attentive to his loſs, than buried in medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
on the ſtupendous object that had occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0507001200:14"/>
it. He touched, he examined the fatal
caſque; nor could even the bleeding mangled
remains of the young Prince, divert the eyes of
<hi>Manfred</hi> from the portent before him. All
who had known his partial fondneſs for young
<hi>Conrad,</hi> were as much ſurprized at their Prince's
inſenſibility, as thunder-ſtruck themſelves at
the miracle of the helmet. They conveyed the
disfigured corpſe into the hall, without receiving
the leaſt direction from <hi>Manfred.</hi> As little was
he attentive to the Ladies who remained in the
chapel: On the contrary, without mentioning
the unhappy Princeſſes, his wife and daughter,
the firſt ſounds that dropped from <hi>Manfred</hi>'s lips
were, take care of the lady <hi>Iſabella.</hi>

               <p>The domeſtics, without obſerving the ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity
of this direction, were guided by their
affection to their miſtreſs, to conſider it as pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly
addreſſed to her ſituation, and flew to her
aſſiſtance. They conveyed her to her chamber
more dead than alive, and indifferent to all the
ſtrange circumſtances ſhe heard, except the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0507001200:15"/>
death of her ſon. <hi>Matilda,</hi> who doated on her
mother, ſmothered her own grief and amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and thought of nothing but aſſiſting and
comforting her afflicted parent. <hi>Iſabella,</hi> who
had been treated by <hi>Hippolita</hi> like a daughter,
and who returned that tenderneſs with equal
duty and affection, was ſcarce leſs aſſiduous
about the Princeſs; at the ſame time endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
to partake and leſſen the weight of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
which ſhe ſaw <hi>Matilda</hi> ſtrove to ſuppreſs,
for whom ſhe had conceived the warmeſt ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy
of friendſhip. Yet her own ſituation could
not help finding its place in her thoughts. She
felt no concern for the death of young <hi>Conrad,</hi>
except commiſeration; and ſhe was not ſorry
to be delivered from a marriage which had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
her little felicity, either from her deſtined
bridegroom, or from the ſevere temper of <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred,</hi>
who, though he had diſtinguiſhed her by
great indulgence, had imprinted her mind with
terror, from his cauſeleſs rigour to ſuch amiable
Princeſſes as <hi>Hippolita</hi> and <hi>Matilda.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:0507001200:16"/>
While the Ladies were conveying the wretched
mother to her bed, <hi>Manfred</hi> remained in the
court, gazing on the ominous caſque, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardleſs
of the crowd which the ſtrangeneſs of
the event had now aſſembled around him. The
few words he articulated, tended ſolely to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries,
whether any man knew from whence
it could have come? Nobody could give him
the leaſt information. However, as it ſeemed
to be the ſole object of his curioſity, it ſoon
became ſo to the reſt of the ſpectators, whoſe
conjectures were as abſurd and improbable, as
the cataſtrophe itſelf was unprecedented. In
the midſt of their ſenſeleſs gueſſes, a young pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant,
whom rumour had drawn thither from a
neighbouring village, obſerved that the mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous
helmet was exactly like that on the figure
in black marble of <hi>Alfonſo</hi> the Good, one of
their former Princes, in the church of St. <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholas.</hi>
Villain! What ſayeſt thou! cried <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred,</hi>
ſtarting from his trance in a tempeſt of
rage, and ſeizing the young man by the collar;
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0507001200:17"/>
how dareſt thou utter ſuch treaſon? thy life
ſhall pay for it. The ſpectators, who as little
comprehended the cauſe of the Prince's fury as
all the reſt they had ſeen, were at a loſs to unravel
this new circumſtance. The young peaſant
himſelf was ſtill more aſtoniſhed, not conceiving
how he had offended the Prince: Yet recollect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himſelf, with a mixture of grace and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility,
he diſengaged himſelf from <hi>Manfred</hi>'s
gripe, and then with an obeiſance, which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
more jealouſy of innocence, than diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>may;
he aſked, with reſpect, of what he was
guilty! <hi>Manfred,</hi> more enraged at the vigour,
however decently exerted, with which the young
man had ſhaken off his hold, than appeaſed by
his ſubmiſſion, ordered his attendants to ſeize
him, and, if he had not been withheld by his
friends, whom he had invited to the nuptials,
would have poignarded the peaſant in their arms.</p>
               <p>During this altercation, ſome of the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
ſpectators had run to the great church, which ſtood near the caſtle, and came back
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0507001200:18"/>
open-mouthed, declaring, that the helmet was
miſſing from <hi>Alfonſo</hi>'s ſtatue. <hi>Manfred,</hi> at this
news, grew perfectly frantic; and, as if he
ſought a ſubject on which to vent the tempeſt
within him, he ruſhed again on the young pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant,
crying, Villain! Monſter! Sorcerer! 'tis
thou haſt done this! 'tis thou haſt ſlain my ſon!
The mob, who wanted ſome object within the
ſcope of their capacities, on whom they might
diſcharge their bewildered reaſonings, caught
the words from the mouth of their Lord, and
re-ecchoed, ay, ay; 'tis he, 'tis he: He has
ſtolen the helmet from good <hi>Alfonſo</hi>'s tomb, and
daſhed out the brains of our young Prince with
it,—never reflecting how enormous the diſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
was between the marble helmet that
had been in the church, and that of ſteel before
their eyes; nor how impoſſible it was for a youth,
ſeemingly not twenty, to weild a piece of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
of ſo prodigious a weight.</p>
               <p>The folly of theſe ejaculations brought <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred</hi>
to himſelf: Yet whether provoked at the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0507001200:19"/>
peaſant having obſerved the reſemblance between
the two helmets, and thereby led to the farther
diſcovery of the abſence of that in the church;
or wiſhing to bury any freſh rumours under ſo
impertinent a ſuppoſition; he gravely pronounced
that the young man was certainly a negro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mancer,
and that till the church could take cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance
of the affair, he would have the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gician,
whom they had thus detected, kept pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner
under the helmet itſelf, which he ordered
his attendants to raiſe, and place the young man
under it; declaring he ſhould be kept there
without food, with which his own inſernal art
might furniſh him.</p>
               <p>It was in vain for the youth to repreſent againſt
this prepoſterous ſentence: In vain did <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred</hi>'s
friends endeavour to divert him from this
ſavage and ill-grounded reſolution. The gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
were charmed with their Lord's deciſion,
which, to their apprehenſions, carried great
appearance of juſtice, as the Magician was to
be puniſhed by the very inſtrument with which
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0507001200:20"/>
he had offended: Nor were they ſtruck with
the leſt compunction at the probability of the
youth being ſtarved, for they firmly believed,
that, by his diabolical ſkill, he could eaſily ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
himſelf with nutriment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Manfred</hi> thus ſaw his commands even chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
obeyed, and appointing a guard with ſtrict
orders to prevent any food being conveyed to
the priſoner; he diſmiſſed his friends and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants,
and retired to his own chamber, after
locking the gates of the caſtle, in which he
ſuffered none but his domeſtics to remain.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, the care and zeal of the
young Ladies had brought the Princeſs <hi>Hippolita</hi>
to herſelf, who amidſt the tranſports of her own
ſorrow, frequently demanded news of her Lord,
would have diſmiſſed her attendants to watch
over him, and at laſt enjoined <hi>Matilda</hi> to leave
her, and viſit and comfort her father. <hi>Matilda,</hi>
who wanted no affectionate duty to <hi>Manfred,</hi>
though ſhe trembled at his auſterity, obeyed the
orders of <hi>Hippolita,</hi> whom ſhe tenderly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0507001200:21"/>
to <hi>Iſabella</hi>; and enquiring of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtics
for her father, was informed that he was
retired to his chamber, and had commanded
that nobody ſhould have admittance to him.
Concluding that he was immerſed in ſorrow for
the death of her brother, and fearing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new
his tears by the ſight of his ſole remaining
child, ſhe heſitated whether ſhe ſhould break
in upon his affliction; yet ſolicitude for him,
backed by the commands of her mother, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
her to venture diſobeying the orders
he had given, a fault ſhe had never been guilty
of before. The gentle timidity of her nature
made her pauſe for ſome minutes at his door.
She heard him traverſe his chamber backwards
and forwards with diſordered ſteps; a mood which
increaſed her apprehenſions. She was how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
juſt going to beg admittance, when <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred</hi>
ſuddenly opened his door; and as it was
now twilight, concurring with the diſorder of
his mind, he did not diſtinguiſh the perſon, but
aſked angrily, who it was? <hi>Matilda</hi> replied
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0507001200:22"/>
trembling, my deareſt father, it is I, your
daughter. <hi>Manfred</hi> ſtepping back haſtily, cried,
Begone, I do not want a daughter; and flinging
back abruptly, clapped the door againſt the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified
<hi>Matilda.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>She was too well acquainted with her father's
impetuoſity to venture a ſecond intruſion. When
ſhe had a little recovered the ſhock of ſo bitter
a reception, ſhe wiped away her tears to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
the additional ſtab that the knowledge of
it would give to <hi>Hippolita,</hi> who queſtioned her
in the moſt anxious terms on the health of <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred,</hi>
and how he bore his loſs. <hi>Matilda</hi> aſſured
her he was well, and ſupported his misfortune
with manly fortitude. But will he not let me
ſee him? ſaid <hi>Hippolita</hi> mournfully; will he not
permit me to blend my tears with his, and ſhed
a mother's ſorrows in the boſom of her Lord?
Or do you deceive me, <hi>Matilda?</hi> I know how
<hi>Manfred</hi> doated on his ſon: Is not the ſtroke
too heavy for him? has he not ſunk under it?
—You do not anſwer me—alas! I dread the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0507001200:23"/>
worſt!—raiſe me, my maidens; I will, I will
ſee my Lord. Bear me to him inſtantly: He
is dearer to me even than my children. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilda</hi>
made ſigns to <hi>Iſabella</hi> to prevent <hi>Hippolita</hi>'s
riſing; and both thoſe lovely young women
were uſing their gentle violence to ſtop and
calm the Princeſs, when a ſervant, on the part
of <hi>Manfred,</hi> arrived and told <hi>Iſabella</hi> that his
Lord demanded to ſpeak with her.</p>
               <p>With me! cried <hi>Iſabella.</hi> Go, ſaid <hi>Hippolita,</hi>
relieved by a meſſage from her Lord: <hi>Manfred</hi>
cannot ſupport the ſight of his own family. He
thinks you leſs diſordered than we are, and
dreads the ſhock of my grief. Conſole him,
dear <hi>Iſabella,</hi> and tell him I will ſmother my
own anguiſh rather than add to his.</p>
               <p>As it was now evening, the ſervant, who
conducted <hi>Iſabella,</hi> bore a torch before her.
When they came to <hi>Manfred,</hi> who was walking
impatiently about the gallery, he ſtarted and
ſaid haſtily, take away that light, and begone.
Then ſhutting the door impetuouſly, he flung
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0507001200:24"/>
himſelf upon a bench againſt the wall, and bad
<hi>Iſabella</hi> ſit by him. She obeyed trembling. I
ſent for you, Lady, ſaid he,—and then ſtopped
under great appearance of confuſion. My Lord!
—Yes, I ſent for you on a matter of great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
reſumed he,—dry your tears, young
Lady—you have loſt your bridegroom.—Yes,
cruel fate! and I have loſt the hopes of my
race!—but <hi>Conrad</hi> was not worthy of your
beauty—how! my Lord, ſaid <hi>Iſabella</hi>; ſure
you do not ſuſpect me of not feeling the concern
I ought: My duty and affection would have
always—think no more of him, interrupted
<hi>Manfred</hi>; he was a ſickly puny child, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
has perhaps taken him away, that I might
not truſt the honours of my houſe on ſo frail a
foundation. The line of <hi>Manfred</hi> calls for nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous
ſupports. My fooliſh fondneſs for that
boy blinded the eyes of my prudence—but it is
better as it is. I hope, in a few years, to have
reaſon to rejoice at the death of <hi>Conrad.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:0507001200:25"/>
Words cannot paint the aſtoniſhment of <hi>Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella.</hi>
At firſt ſhe apprehended that grief had
diſordered <hi>Manfred</hi>'s underſtanding. Her next
thought ſuggeſted that this ſtrange diſcourſe was
deſigned to enſnare her: She feared that <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred</hi>
had perceived her indifference for his ſon:
And in conſequence of that idea ſhe replied,
Good my Lord, do not doubt my tenderneſs:
My heart would have accompanied my hand.
<hi>Conrad</hi> would have engroſſed all my care; and
wherever fate ſhall diſpoſe of me, I ſhall always
cheriſh his memory, and regard your Highneſs
and the virtuous <hi>Hippolita</hi> as my parents. Curſe
on <hi>Hippolita!</hi> cried <hi>Manfred:</hi> Forget her from
this moment as I do. In ſhort, Lady, you have
miſſed a huſband undeſerving of your charms:
They ſhall now be better diſpoſed of. Inſtead
of a ſickly boy, you ſhall have a huſband in the
prime of his age, who will know how to value
your beauties, and who may expect a numerous
offspring. Alas! My Lord, ſaid <hi>Iſabella,</hi> my
mind is too ſadly engroſſed by the recent cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrophe
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0507001200:26"/>
in your family to think of another mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.
If ever my father returns, and it ſhall
be his pleaſure, I ſhall obey, as I did when I
conſented to give my hand to your ſon: But until
his return, permit me to remain under your
hoſpitable roof, and employ the melancholy
hours in aſſwaging yours, <hi>Hippolita</hi>'s, and the
fair <hi>Matilda</hi>'s affliction.</p>
               <p>I deſired you once before, ſaid <hi>Manfred</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grily,
not to name that woman: From this
hour ſhe muſt be a ſtranger to you, as ſhe muſt
be to me;—in ſhort, <hi>Iſabella,</hi> ſince I cannot
give you my ſon, I offer you myſelf.—Heavens!
cried <hi>Iſabella,</hi> waking from her deluſion, what
do I hear! You! My Lord! You! My fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-in-law!
the father of <hi>Conrad!</hi> the huſband
of the virtuous and tender <hi>Hippolita!</hi>—I tell
you, ſaid <hi>Manfred</hi> imperiouſly, <hi>Hippolita</hi> is no
longer my wife, I divorce her from this hour.
Too long has ſhe curſed me by her unfruitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:
My fate depends on having ſons,—and
this night I truſt will give a new date to my
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0507001200:27"/>
hopes. At thoſe words he ſeized the cold hand
of <hi>Iſabella,</hi> who was half-dead with fright and
horror. She ſhrieked and ſtarted from him.
<hi>Manfred</hi> roſe to purſue her, when the moon,
which was now up and gleamed in at the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
caſement, preſented to his fight the plumes
of the fatal helmet, which roſe to the height of
the windows, waving backwards and forwards
in a tempeſtuous manner, and accompanied
with a hollow and ruſtling sound. <hi>Iſabella,</hi> who
gathered courage from her ſituation, and who
dreaded nothing ſo much as <hi>Manfred</hi>'s purſuit of
his declaration, cried, Look! My Lord; ſee,
heaven itſelf declares againſt your impious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions!
—Heaven nor hell ſhall impede my
deſigns, ſaid <hi>Manfred,</hi> advancing again to ſeize
the Princeſs. At that inſtant the portrait of his
grandfather, which hung over the bench where
they had been ſitting, uttered a deep ſigh, and
heaved its breaſt. <hi>Iſabella,</hi> whoſe back was
turned to the picture, ſaw not the motion, nor
knew whence the ſound came, but ſtarted, and
ſaid, Hark, my Lord! What sound was that?
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0507001200:28"/>
and at the ſame time made towards the door.
<hi>Manfred,</hi> diſtracted between the flight of <hi>Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella,</hi>
who had now reached the ſtairs, and yet
unable to keep his eyes from the picture which
began to move, had however advanced ſome
ſteps after her, ſtill looking backwards on the
portrait, when he ſaw it quit its pannel, and
deſcend on the floor with a grave and melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly
air. Do I dream? cried <hi>Manfred</hi> return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or are the devils themſelves in league
againſt me? ſpeak, infernal ſpectre! or, if
thou art my grandſire, why doſt thou too con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire
againſt thy wretched deſcendent, who too
dearly pays for—e'er he could finiſh the
ſentence, the viſion ſighed again, and made a
ſign to <hi>Manfred</hi> to follow him. Lead on! cried
<hi>Manfred</hi>; I will follow thee to the guiph of
perdition. The ſpectre marched ſedately, but
dejected, to the end of the gallery, and turned
into a chamber on the right-hand. <hi>Manfred</hi>
accompanied him at a little diſtance, full of
anxiety and horror, but reſolved. As he would
have entered the chamber, the door was clapped
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0507001200:29"/>
to with violence by an inviſible hand. The
Prince, collecting courage from this delay,
would have forcibly burſt open the door with
his foot, but found that it reſiſted his utmoſt
efforts. Since hell will not ſatisfy my curioſity,
ſaid <hi>Manfred,</hi> I will uſe the human means in
my power for preſerving my race; <hi>Iſabella</hi> ſhall
not eſcape me.</p>
               <p>That Lady, whoſe reſolution had given way
to terror the moment ſhe had quitted <hi>Manfred,</hi>
continued her flight to the bottom of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
ſtaircaſe. There ſhe ſtopped, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
whither to direct her ſteps, nor how to
eſcape from the impetuoſity of the Prince. The
gates of the caſtle ſhe knew were locked, and
guards placed in the court. Should ſhe, as her
heart prompted her, go and prepare <hi>Hippolita</hi>
for the cruel deſtiny that awaited her; ſhe did
not doubt but <hi>Manfred</hi> would ſeek her there,
and that his violence would incite him to double
the injury he meditated, without leaving room
for them to avoid the impetuoſity of his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0507001200:30"/>
Delay might give him time to reflect on
the horrid meaſures he had conceived, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
ſome circumſtance in her favour, if ſhe
could for that night at leaſt avoid his odious
purpoſe.—Yet where conceal herſelf! how
avoid the purſuit he would infallibly make
throughout the caſtle! As theſe thoughts paſſed
rapidly through her mind, ſhe recollected a
ſubterraneous paſſage which led from the vaults
of the caſtle to the church of St. <hi>Nicholas.</hi>
Could ſhe reach the altar before ſhe was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken,
ſhe knew even <hi>Manfied</hi>'s violence would
not dare to profane the ſacredneſs of the place;
and ſhe determined, if no other means of deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance
offered, to ſhut herſelf up for ever
among the holy virgins, whoſe convent was
contiguous to the cathedral. In this reſolution,
ſhe ſeized a lamp that burned at the foot of the
ſtaircaſe, and hurried towards the ſecret paſſage.</p>
               <p>The lower part of the caſtle was hollowed
into ſeveral intricate cloyſters; and it was not
eaſy for one under ſo much anxiety to find the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0507001200:31"/>
door that opened into the cavern. An awful
ſilence reigned throughout thoſe ſubterraneous
regions, except now and then ſome blaſts of
wind that ſhook the doors ſhe had paſſed, and
which grating on the ruſty hinges, were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecchoed
through that long labyrinth of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
Every murmur ſtruck her with new ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror;
—yet more ſhe dreaded to hear the wrath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
voice of <hi>Manfred</hi> urging his domeſtics to
purſue her. She trod as ſoftly as impatience
would give her leave,—yet frequently ſtopped
and liſtened to hear if ſhe was followed. In
one of thoſe moments ſhe thought ſhe heard a
ſigh. She ſhuddered, and recoiled a few paces.
In a moment ſhe thought ſhe heard the ſtep of
ſome perſon. Her blood curdled; ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
it was <hi>Manfred.</hi> Every ſuggeſtion that
horror could inſpire ruſhed into her mind. She
condemned her raſh flight, which had thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
her to his rage in a place where her cries
were not likely to draw any body to her aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.
—Yet the ſound ſeemed not to come from
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0507001200:32"/>
behind,—if <hi>Manfred</hi> knew where ſhe was, he
muſt have followed her: She was ſtill in one
of the cloyſters, and the ſteps ſhe had heard
were too diſtinct to proceed from the way ſhe
had come. Cheared with this reflection, and
hoping to find a friend in whoever was not the
Prince; ſhe was going to advance, when a
door that ſtood a jar, at ſome diſtance to the
left, was opened gently: But e'er her lamp,
which ſhe held up, could diſcover who opened
it, the perſon retreated precipitately on ſeeing
the light.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iſabella,</hi> whom every incident was ſufficient
to diſmay, heſitated whether ſhe ſhould proceed.
Her dread of <hi>Manfred</hi> ſoon outweighed every
other terror. The very circumſtance of the
perſon avoiding her, gave her a ſort of courage.
It could only be, ſhe thought, ſome domeſtic
belonging to the caſtle. Her gentleneſs had
never raiſed her an enemy, and conſcious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence
bade her hope that, unleſs ſent by the
Prince's order to ſeek her, his ſervants would
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0507001200:33"/>
rather aſſiſt than prevent her flight. Fortifying
herſelf with theſe reflections, and believing by
what ſhe could obſerve, that ſhe was near the
mouth of the ſubterraneous cavern, ſhe approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the door that had been opened; but a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
guſt of wind that met her at the door,
extinguiſhed her lamp, and left her in total
darkneſs.</p>
               <p>Words cannot paint the horror of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs's
ſituation. Alone in ſo diſmal a place,
her mind imprinted with all the terrible events
of the day, hopeleſs of eſcaping, expecting every
moment the arrival of <hi>Manfred,</hi> and far from
tranquil on knowing ſhe was within reach of
ſomebody, ſhe knew not whom, who for ſome
cauſe ſeemed concealed thereabouts, all theſe
thoughts crouded on her diſtracted mind, and
ſhe was ready to ſink under her apprehenſions.
She addreſſed herſelf to every Saint in heaven,
and inwardly implored their aſſiſtance. For a
conſiderable time ſhe remained in an agony of
deſpair. At laſt, as ſoftly as was poſſible, ſhe
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0507001200:34"/>
felt for the door, and having found it, entered
trembling into the vault from whence ſhe had
heard the ſigh and ſteps. It gave her a kind of
momentary joy to perceive an imperfect ray of
clouded moonſhine gleam from the roof of the
vault, which ſeemed to be fallen in, and from
whence hung a fragment of earth or building,
ſhe could not diſtinguiſh which, that appeared
to have been cruſhed inwards. She advanced
eagerly towards this chaſm, when ſhe diſcerned
a human form ſtanding cloſe againſt the wall.</p>
               <p>She ſhrieked, believing it the ghoſt of her
betrothed <hi>Conrad.</hi> The figure advancing, ſaid
in a ſubmiſſive voice, be not alarmed, Lady; I
will not injure you. <hi>Iſabella</hi> a little encouraged by
the words and tone of voice of the ſtranger,
and recollecting that this muſt be the perſon
who had opened the door, recovered her ſpirits
enough to reply, Sir, whoever you are, take
pity on a wretched Princeſs, ſtanding on the
brink of deſtruction: Aſſiſt me to eſcape from
this fatal caſtle, or in few moments I may be
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0507001200:35"/>
made miſerable for ever. Alas! ſaid the ſtranger,
what can I do to aſſiſt you? I will die in
your defence; but I am unacquainted with the
caſtle, and want—Oh! ſaid <hi>Iſabella,</hi> haſtily
interrupting him, help me but to find a trap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>door
that muſt be hereabout, and it is the
greateſt ſervice you can do me, for I have not
a minute to loſe. Saying theſe words, ſhe felt
about on the pavement, and directed the
ſtranger to ſearch likewiſe for a ſmooth piece of
braſs incloſed in one of the ſtones. That, ſaid
ſhe, is the lock, which opens with a ſpring, of
which I know the ſecret. If we can find that,
I may eſcape—if not, alas! courteous ſtranger,
I fear, I ſhall have involved you in my misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes:
<hi>Manfred</hi> will ſuſpect you for the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plice
of my flight, and you will fall a victim to
his reſentment. I value not my life, ſaid the
ſtranger, and it will be ſome comfort to loſe it, in
trying to deliver you from his tyranny. Generous
youth, ſaid <hi>Iſabella,</hi> how ſhall I ever requite—
as ſhe uttered thoſe words, a ray of moonſhine
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0507001200:36"/>
ſtreaming through a cranny of the ruin above
ſhone directly on the lock they ſought—Oh!
tranſport! ſaid <hi>Iſabella,</hi> here is the trap-door!
and taking out a key, ſhe touched the ſpring,
which ſtarting aſide, diſcovered an iron ring.
Lift up the door, ſaid the Princeſs. The ſtranger
obeyed; and beneath appeared ſome ſtone
ſteps deſcending into a vault totally dark. We
muſt go down here, ſaid <hi>Iſabella:</hi> Follow me;
dark and diſmal as it is, we cannot miſs our
way; it leads directly to the church of St. <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholas</hi>
—but perhaps, added the Princeſs mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtly,
you have no reaſon to leave the caſtle,
nor have I farther occaſion for your ſervice; in
few minutes I ſhall be ſafe from <hi>Manfred</hi>'s rage
—only let me know to whom I am ſo much
obliged. I will never quit you, ſaid the ſtranger
eagerly, until I have placed you in ſafety—
nor think me, Princeſs, more generous than I
am; though you are my principal care—the
ſtranger was interrupted by a ſudden noiſe of voices
that ſeemed approaching, and they ſoon diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0507001200:37"/>
theſe words: Talk not to me of necro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mancers:
I tell you ſhe muſt be in the caſtle:
I will find her in ſpite of enchantment—Oh!
heavens, cried <hi>Iſabella,</hi> it is the voice of <hi>Manfred!</hi>
make haſte or we are ruined! and ſhut the trap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>door
after you. Saying this, ſhe deſcended the
ſteps precipitately, and as the ſtranger haſtened
to follow her, he let the door ſlip out of his
hands: it fell, and the ſpring cloſed over it.
He tried in vain to open it, not having obſerved
<hi>Iſabella</hi>'s method of touching the ſpring: nor
had he many moments to make an eſſay. The
noiſe of the falling door had been heard by
<hi>Manfred,</hi> who directed by the ſound, haſtened
thither, attended by his ſervants with torches.
It muſt be <hi>Iſabella</hi>; cried <hi>Manfred</hi> before he
entered the vault; ſhe is eſcaping by the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terraneous
paſſage, but ſhe cannot have got
far.—What was the aſtoniſhment of the
Prince, when, inſtead of <hi>Iſabella,</hi> the light of the
torches diſcovered to him the young peaſant,
whom he thought conſined under the fatal
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0507001200:38"/>
helmet: Traitor! ſaid <hi>Manfred,</hi> how cameſt thou
here? I thought thee in durance above in the
court. I am no traitor, replied the young
man boldly, nor am I anſwerable for your
thoughts. Preſumptuous villain! cried <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred,</hi>
doſt thou provoke my wrath? tell me;
how haſt thou eſcaped from above? thou haſt
corrupted thy guards, and their lives ſhall an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
it. My poverty, ſaid the peaſant calmly,
will diſculpate them: Though the miniſters
of a tyrant's wrath, to thee they are faithful,
and but too willing to execute the orders
which you unjuſtly impoſed upon them. Art
thou ſo hardy as to dare my vengeance? ſaid
the Prince—but tortures ſhall force the truth
from thee. Tell me, I will know thy accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices.
There was my accomplice! ſaid the
youth ſmiling, and pointing to the roof.
<hi>Manfred</hi> ordered the torches to be held up,
and perceived that one of the cheeks of the
enchanted caſque had forced its way through
the pavement of the court, as his ſervants had
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0507001200:39"/>
let it fall over the peaſant, and had broken
through into the vault, leaving a gap through
which the peaſant had preſſed himſelf ſome
minutes before he was found by <hi>Iſabella.</hi> Was
that the way by which thou didſt deſcend? ſaid
<hi>Manfred.</hi> It was; ſaid the youth. But what
noiſe was that, ſaid <hi>Manfred,</hi> which I heard
as I entered the cloyſter? a door clapped: ſaid
the peaſant; I heard it as well as you. What
door? ſaid <hi>Manfred</hi> haſtily. I am not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with your caſtle; ſaid the peaſant;
this is the firſt time I ever entered it; and
this vault the only part of it within which
I ever was. But I tell thee, ſaid <hi>Morfred</hi>
[wiſhing to sind out if the youth had diſcovered
the trap-door] it was this way I heard the noiſe:
My ſervants heard it too—my Lord, interrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
one of them officiouſly, to be ſure it was
the trap-door, and he was going to make his
eſcape. Peace! blockhead, ſaid the Prince
angrily; if he was going to eſcape, how ſhould
he come on this ſide? I will know from his
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0507001200:40"/>
own mouth what noiſe it was I heard. Tell me
truly; thy life depends on thy veracity. My
veracity is dearer to me than my life; ſaid the
peaſant; nor would I purchaſe the one by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiting
the other. Indeed! young philoſopher!
ſaid <hi>Manfred</hi> contemptuouſly; tell me then, what
was the noiſe I heard? Aſk me what I can an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
ſaid he, and put me to death inſtantly if
I tell you a lie. <hi>Manfred</hi> growing impatient at
the ſteady valour and indifference of the youth,
cried, Well then, thou man of truth! anſwer; was
it the fall of the trap-door that I heard? It was;
ſaid the youth. It was! ſaid the Prince; and how
didſt thou come to know there was a trap-door
here? I ſaw the plate of braſs by a gleam of
moonſhine; replied he. But what told thee it
was a lock? ſaid <hi>Manfred</hi>; How didſt thou
diſcover the ſecret of opening it? Providence,
that delivered me from the helmet, was able to
direct me to the ſpring of a lock; ſaid he. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
ſhould have gone a little farther, and
have placed thee out of the reach of my reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0507001200:41"/>
ſaid <hi>Manfred:</hi> When Providence had
taught thee to open the lock, it abandoned thee
for a fool, who did not know how to make uſe
of its favours. Why didſt thou not purſue the
path pointed out for thy eſcape? Why didſt
thou ſhut the trap-door before thou hadſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended
the ſteps? I might aſk you, my Lord,
ſaid the peaſant, how I, totally unacquainted
with your caſtle, was to know that thoſe ſteps
led to any outlet? but I ſcorn to evade your
queſtions. Wherever thoſe ſteps lead to, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
I ſhould have explored the way—I could
not be in a worſe ſituation than I was. But the
truth is, I let the trap-door fall: Your imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
arrival followed. I had given the alarm—
what imported it to me whether I was ſeized a
minute ſooner or a minute later? Thou art a
reſolute villain for thy years; ſaid <hi>Manfred</hi>—
yet on reflection I ſuſpect thou doſt but trifle
with me: Thou haſt not yet told me how thou
didſt open the lock. That I will ſhow you, my
Lord; ſaid the Peaſant, and taking up a frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0507001200:42"/>
of ſtone that had fallen from above,
he laid himſelf on the trap-door, and began to
beat on the piece of braſs that covered it; mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to gain time for the eſcape of the Princeſs.
This preſence of mind, joined to the frankneſs
of the youth, ſtaggered <hi>Manfred.</hi> He even felt
a diſpoſition towards pardoning one who had
been guilty of no crime. <hi>Manfred</hi> was not one
of thoſe ſavage tyrants who wanton in cruelty
unprovoked. The circumſtances of his fortune
had given an aſperity to his temper, which was
naturally humane; and his virtues were always
ready to operate, when his paſſions did not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure
his reaſon.</p>
               <p>While the Prince was in this ſuſpence, a
confuſed noiſe of voices ecchoed through the
diſtant vaults. As the ſound approached, he
diſtinguiſhed the clamours of ſome of his dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtics,
whom he had diſperſed through the caſtle
in ſearch of <hi>Iſabella,</hi> calling out, where is my
Lord? where is the Prince? Here I am; ſaid
<hi>Manfred,</hi> as they came nearer; have you found
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0507001200:43"/>
the Princeſs? the firſt that arrived, replied, oh!
my Lord! I am glad we have found you—found
me! ſaid <hi>Manfred</hi>; have you found the Princeſs!
We thought we had, my Lord, ſaid the fellow,
looking terrified—but—but what? cried the
Prince; has ſhe eſcaped?—<hi>Jaquez</hi> and I, my
Lord—yes, I and <hi>Diego,</hi> interrupted the ſecond,
who came up in ſtill greater conſternation—
ſpeak one of you at a time, ſaid <hi>Manfred</hi>; I
aſk you where is the Princeſs? We do not
know; ſaid they both together; but we are
frightened out of our wits—ſo I think, block<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads,
ſaid <hi>Manfred</hi>; what is it has ſcared you
thus?—oh! my Lord, ſaid <hi>Jaquez, Diego</hi>
has ſeen ſuch a ſight! your Highneſs would not
believe our eyes—what new abſurdity is this!
cried <hi>Manfred</hi>—give me a direct anſwer, or
by heav'n—why, my Lord, if it pleaſe your
Highneſs to hear me, ſaid the poor fellow;
<hi>Diego</hi> and I—yes I and <hi>Jaquez,</hi> cried his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rade
—did not I forbid you to ſpeak both at a
time? ſaid the Prince: You, <hi>Jaquez,</hi> anſwer;
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0507001200:44"/>
for the other fool ſeems more diſtracted than
thou art: What is the matter? my gracious
Lord, ſaid <hi>Jaquez,</hi> if it pleaſe your Highneſs
to hear me; <hi>Diego</hi> and I according to your
Highneſs's orders went to ſearch for the young
Lady; but being comprehenſive that we might
meet the ghoſt of my young Lord, your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs's
ſon, God reſt his ſoul, as he has not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
chriſtian burial—ſot! cried <hi>Manfred</hi> in a
rage, is it only a ghoſt then that thou haſt ſeen?
oh! worſe! worſe! my Lord, cried <hi>Diego:</hi> I
had rather have ſeen ten whole ghoſts—grant me
patience! ſaid <hi>Manfred</hi>; theſe blockheads diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
me—out of my ſight, <hi>Diego!</hi> and thou,
<hi>Jaquez,</hi> tell me in one word, art thou ſober?
art thou raving? thou waſt wont to have ſome
ſenſe: has the other ſot frightened himſelf and
thee too! ſpeak; what is it he fancies he has
ſeen? Why, my Lord, replied <hi>Jaquez</hi> trembling,
I was going to tell your Highneſs, that ſince
the calamitous misfortune of my young Lord,
God reſt his precious ſoul! not one of us your
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0507001200:45"/>
Highneſs's faithful ſervants, indeed we are, my
Lord, though poor men; I ſay, not one of us
has dared to ſet a ſoot about the caſtle, but two
together: So <hi>Diego</hi> and I, thinking that my
young Lady might be in the great gallery, went
up there to look for her, and tell her your
Highneſs wanted ſomething to impart to her—
O blundering fools! cried <hi>Manfred:</hi> And in the
mean time ſhe has made her eſcape, becauſe
you were afraid of goblins!—Why, thou
knave! ſhe left me in the gallery; I came from
thence myſelf. For all that, ſhe may be there
ſtill for ought I know; ſaid <hi>Jaquez</hi>; but the
devil ſhall have me before I ſeek her there
again!—poor <hi>Diego!</hi> I do not believe he will
ever recover it! recover what? ſaid <hi>Manfred</hi>;
am I never to learn what it is has terrified theſe
raſcals?—but I loſe my time; follow me
ſlave; I will ſee if ſhe is in the gallery—for
heaven's ſake, my dear good Lord, cried <hi>Jaquez,</hi>
do not go to the gallery! Satan himſelf I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
is in the great chamber next to the gallery
—<hi>Manfred,</hi> who hitherto had treated th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:0507001200:46"/>
terror of his ſervants as an idle panic, was
ſtruck at this new circumſtance. He recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
the apparition of the portrait, and the
ſudden cloſing of the door at the end of the
gallery—his voice faltered, and he aſked
with diſorder, what is in the great chamber?
my Lord, ſaid <hi>Jaquez,</hi> when <hi>Diego</hi> and I
came into the gallery, he went firſt, for he
ſaid he had more courage than I. So when
we came into the gallery, we found nobody.
We looked under every bench and ſtool; and
ſtill we found nobody—were all the pictures in
their places? ſaid <hi>Manfred.</hi> Yes, my Lord,
anſwered <hi>Jaquez</hi>; but we did not think of look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
behind them—well, well! ſaid <hi>Manfred,</hi>
proceed. When we came to the door of the
great chamber, continued <hi>Jaquez,</hi> we found it
ſhut—and could not you open it? ſaid <hi>Manfred.</hi>
Oh! yes, my Lord, would to heaven we had
not! replied he—nay, it was not I neither,
it was <hi>Diego:</hi> he was grown fool-hardy, and
would go on, though I adviſed him not—if
ever I open a door that is ſhut again—trifle
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0507001200:47"/>
not, ſaid <hi>Manfred</hi> ſhuddering, but tell me what
you ſaw in the great chamber on opening the
door—I! my Lord! ſaid <hi>Jaquez,</hi> I ſaw
nothing; I was behind <hi>Diego</hi>;—but I heard
the noiſe—<hi>Jaquez,</hi> ſaid <hi>Manfred</hi> in a ſolemn
tone of voice; tell me I adjure thee by the ſouls
of my anceſtors, what was it thou ſaweſt? what
was it thou heardſt? It was <hi>Diego</hi> ſaw it, my
Lord, it was not I; replied <hi>Jaquez</hi>; I only
heard the noiſe. <hi>Diego</hi> had no ſooner opened
the door, than he cried out, and ran back—I ran
back too, and ſaid, is it the ghoſt? the ghoſt!
no, no, ſaid <hi>Diego,</hi> and his hair ſtood an end—it
is a giant I believe; he is all clad in armour,
for I ſaw his foot and part of his leg, and they
are as large as the helmet below in the court.
As he ſaid theſe words, my Lord, we heard a
violent motion and the ratling of armour, as
if the giant was riſing, for <hi>Diego</hi> has told me
ſince, that he believes the giant was lying
down, for the foot and leg were ſtretched at
length on the floor. Before we could get to
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0507001200:48"/>
the end of the gallery, we heard the door of
the great chamber clap behind us, but we did not
dare turn back to ſee if the giant was following
us—yet now I think on it, we muſt have heard
him if he had purſued us—but for heaven's
ſake, good my Lord, ſend for the chaplain and
have the caſtle exorciſed, for, for certain, it is
enchanted. Ay, pray do, my Lord, cried all the
ſervants at once, or we muſt leave your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs's
ſervice—peace! dotards; ſaid <hi>Manfred,</hi>
and follow me; I will know what all this
means. We! my Lord! cried they with one
voice, we would not go up to the gallery for
your Highneſs's revenue. The young peaſant,
who had ſtood ſilent, now ſpoke. Will your
Highneſs, ſaid he, permit me to try this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture?
my life is of conſequence to nobody:
I fear no bad angel, and have offended no good
one. Your behaviour is above your ſeeming;
ſaid <hi>Manfred,</hi> viewing him with ſurpriſe and
admiration—hereafter I will reward your
bravery—but now, continued he with a ſigh,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0507001200:49"/>
I am ſo circumſtanced, that I dare truſt no eyes
but my own—however, I give you leave to
accompany me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Manfred,</hi> when he firſt followed <hi>Iſabella</hi> from
the gallery, had gone directly to the apartment
of his wife, concluding the Princeſs had retired
thither. <hi>Hippolita,</hi> who knew his ſtep, roſe with
anxious fondneſs to meet her Lord, who ſhe
had not ſeen ſince the death of their ſon. She
would have flown in a tranſport mixed of joy
and grief to his boſom, but the puſhed her
rudely off, and ſaid, Where is <hi>Iſabella? Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella!</hi>
My Lord! ſaid the aſtoniſhed <hi>Hippolita.</hi>
Yes; <hi>Iſabella</hi>; cried <hi>Manfred</hi> imperiouſly; I
want <hi>Iſabella.</hi> My Lord, replied <hi>Matilda,</hi> who
perceived how much his behaviour had ſhocked
her mother, ſhe has not been with us ſince your
Highneſs ſummoned her to your apartment.
Tell me where ſhe is; ſaid the Prince; I do
not want to know where ſhe has been. My
good Lord, ſaid <hi>Hippolita,</hi> your daughter tells
you the truth: <hi>Iſabella</hi> left us by your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0507001200:50"/>
and has not returned ſince;—but, my
good Lord, compoſe yourſelf: Retire to your
reſt: This diſmal day has diſordered you. <hi>Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella</hi>
ſhall wait your orders in the morning.
What then, you know where ſhe is! cried
<hi>Manfred:</hi> Tell me directly, for I will not loſe
an inſtant—and you, woman, ſpeaking to his
wife, order your chaplain to attend me forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with.
<hi>Iſabella,</hi> ſaid <hi>Hippolita</hi> calmly, is retired,
I ſuppoſe to her chamber: She is not accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to watch at this late hour. Gracious my
Lord, continued ſhe, let me know what has
diſturbed you: Has <hi>Iſabella</hi> offended you?
Trouble me not with queſtions, ſaid <hi>Manfred,</hi>
but tell me where ſhe is. <hi>Matilda</hi> ſhall call her,
ſaid the Princeſs—Sit down, my Lord, and
reſume your wonted fortitude.—What, art thou
jealous of <hi>Iſabella,</hi> replied he, that you wiſh to
be preſent at our interview? Good heavens!
my Lord, ſaid <hi>Hippolita,</hi> what is it your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
means? Thou wilt know ere many mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes
are paſſed; ſaid the cruel Prince. Send
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0507001200:51"/>
your chaplain to me, and wait my pleaſure here.
At theſe words he flung out of the room in
ſearch of <hi>Iſabella</hi>; leaving the amazed Ladies
thunder-ſtruck with his words and frantic de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment,
and loſt in vain conjectures on what
he was meditating.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Manfred</hi> was now returning from the vault,
attended by the peaſant and a few of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
whom he had obliged to accompany him.
He aſcended the ſtair-caſe without ſtopping till
he arrived at the gallery, at the door of which
he met <hi>Hippolita</hi> and her chaplain. When <hi>Diego</hi>
had been diſmiſſed by <hi>Manfred,</hi> he had gone di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
to the Princeſs's apartment with the alarm
of what he had ſeen. That excellent Lady,
who no more than <hi>Manfred,</hi> doubted of the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of the viſion, yet affected to treat it as a
delirium of the ſervant. Willing, however, to
ſave her Lord from any additional ſhock, and
prepared by a ſeries of grief not to tremble at
any acceſſion to it; ſhe determined to make
herſelf the firſt ſacrifice, if fate had marked the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0507001200:52"/>
preſent hour for their deſtruction. Diſmiſſing
the reluctant <hi>Matilda</hi> to her reſt, who in vain
ſued for leave to accompany her mother, and
attended only by her chaplain, <hi>Hippolita</hi> had
viſited the gallery and great chamber; and now
with more ſerenity of ſoul than ſhe had felt for
many hours, ſhe met her Lord, and aſſured him
that the viſion of the gigantic leg and foot was
all a fable; and no doubt an impreſſion made
by fear, and the dark and diſmal hour of the
night on the minds of his ſervants. She and the
chaplain had examined the chamber, and found
every thing in the uſual order.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Manfred,</hi> though perſuaded, like his wife, that
the viſion had been no work of fancy, recovered
a little from the tempeſt of mind into which
ſo many ſtrange events had thrown him. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed
too of his inhuman treatment of a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs,
who returned every injury with new marks
of tenderneſs and duty; he felt returning love
forcing itſelf into his eyes—but not leſs aſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of ſeeling remorſe towards one, againſt whom
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0507001200:53"/>
he was inwardly meditating a yet more bitter
outrage; he curbed the yearnings of his heart,
and did not dare to lean even towards pity.
The next tranſition of his ſoul was to exquiſite
villainy. Preſuming on the unſhaken ſubmiſſion
of <hi>Hippolita,</hi> He flattered himſelf that ſhe wou'd
not only acquieſce with patience to a divorce, but
would obey if it was his pleaſure, in endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
to perſuade <hi>Iſabella</hi> to give him her hand
—but e'er he could indulge this horrid hope,
he reflected that <hi>Iſabella</hi> was not to be found.
Coming to himſelf, he gave orders that every
avenue to the caſtle ſhould be ſtrictly guarded,
and charged his domeſtics on pain of their lives
to ſuffer nobody to paſs out. The young pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant,
to whom he ſpoke favourably, he ordered
to remain in a ſmall chamber on the ſtairs, in
which there was a pallet-bed, and the key of
which he took away himſelf, telling the youth
he would talk with him in the morning. Then
diſmiſſing his attendants, and beſtowing a ſullen
kind of half-nod on <hi>Hippolita,</hi> he retired to his
own chamber.</p>

                  <hi>MATILDA,</hi> who by <hi>Hippolita</hi>'s order, had
retired to her apartment, was ill-diſpoſed
to take any reſt. The ſhocking fate of her
brother had deeply affected her. She was ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized
at not ſeeing <hi>Iſabella:</hi> But the ſtrange
words which had fallen from her father, and his
obſcure menace to the Princeſs his wife, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
by the moſt furious behaviour, had
filled her gentle mind with terror and alarm.
She waited anxiouſly for the return of <hi>Bianca,</hi>
a young damſel that attended her, whom ſhe
had ſent to learn what was become of <hi>Iſabella.
Bianca</hi> ſoon appeared and informed her miſtreſs
of what ſhe had gathered from the ſervants,
that <hi>Iſabella</hi> was no where to be found. She
related the adventure of the young peaſant, who
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0507001200:55"/>
had been diſcovered in the vault, tho' with many
ſimple additions from the incoherent accounts of
the domeſtics; and ſhe dwelled principally on
the gigantic leg and foot which had been ſeen
in the gallery-chamber. This laſt circumſtance
had terrified <hi>Bianca</hi> ſo much, that ſhe was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joiced
when <hi>Matilda</hi> told her that ſhe would not
go to reſt, but would watch till the Princeſs
ſhould riſe.</p>
               <p>The young Princeſs wearied herſelf in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures
on the flight of <hi>Iſabella,</hi> and on the
threats of <hi>Manfred</hi> to her mother. But what
buſineſs could he have ſo urgent with the chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain?
ſaid <hi>Matilda.</hi> Does he intend to have my
brother's body interred privately in the chapel?
Oh! Madam, ſaid <hi>Bianca,</hi> now I gueſs. As
you are become his heireſs, he is impatient to
have you married: He has always been raving
for more ſons; I warrant he is now impatient
for grandſons. As ſure as I live, Madam, I
ſhall ſee you a bride at laſt—Good Madam, you
won't caſt off your faithful <hi>Bianca:</hi> You wont
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0507001200:56"/>
put <hi>Donna Roſara</hi> over me, now you are a great
Princeſs. My poor <hi>Bianca,</hi> ſaid <hi>Matilda,</hi> how
faſt your thoughts amble! I a great Princeſs!
What haſt thou ſeen in <hi>Manfred</hi>'s behaviour
ſince my brother's death that beſpeaks any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
of tenderneſs to me? No, <hi>Bianca</hi>; his
heart was ever a ſtranger to me—but he is my
father, and I muſt not complain. Nay, if hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
ſhuts my father's heart againſt me, it over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pays
my little merit in the tenderneſs of my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
—O that dear mother! yes, <hi>Bianca,</hi> 'tis
there I feel the rugged temper of <hi>Manfred.</hi> I
can ſupport his harſhneſs to me with patience;
but it wounds my ſoul when I am witneſs to his
cauſeleſs ſeverity towards her. Oh! Madam,
ſaid <hi>Bianca,</hi> all men uſe their wives ſo, when
they are weary of them—and yet you congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulated
me but now, ſaid <hi>Matilda,</hi> when you
fancied my father intended to diſpoſe of me. I
would have you a great Lady, replied <hi>Bianca,</hi>
come what will. I do not wiſh to ſee you moped
in a convent, as you would be if you had your
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0507001200:57"/>
will, and if my Lady, your mother, who knows
that a bad huſband is better than no huſband at
all, did not hinder you—bleſs me! what noiſe
is that! St. <hi>Nicholas</hi> forgive me! I was but in
jeſt. It is the wind, ſaid <hi>Matilda,</hi> whiſtling
through the battlements in the tower above:
You have heard it a thouſand times. Nay, ſaid
<hi>Bianca,</hi> there was no harm neither in what I
ſaid: It is no ſin to talk of matrimony—and
ſo, Madam, as I was ſaying; if my Lord <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred</hi>
ſhould offer you a handſome young Prince
for a bridegroom, you would drop him a curtſy,
and tell him you had rather take the veil.
Thank heaven! I am in no ſuch danger, ſaid
<hi>Matilda:</hi> You know how many propoſals for
me he has rejected—and you thank him, like
a dutiful daughter, do you, Madam?—but
come, Madam; ſuppoſe, to-morrow morning
he was to ſend for you to the great council
chamber, and there you ſhould find at his elbow
a lovely young Prince, with large black eyes,
a ſmooth white forehead, and manly curling
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0507001200:58"/>
locks like jet; in ſhort, Madam, a young Hero
reſembling the picture of the good <hi>Alfonſo</hi> in the
gallery, which you ſit and gaze at for hours
together—do not ſpeak lightly of that picture,
interrupted <hi>Matilda</hi> ſighing: I know the ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
with which I look at that picture is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common
—but I am not in love with a coloured
pannel. The character of that virtuous Prince,
the veneration with which my mother has in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired
me for his memory, the oriſons which
I know not why ſhe has enjoined me to pour
forth at his tomb, all have concurred to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade
me that ſome how or other my deſtiny is
linked with ſomething relating to him—Lord!
Madam, how ſhould that be? ſaid <hi>Bianca:</hi> I
have always heard that your family was no way
related to his: And I am ſure I cannot conceive
why my Lady, the Princeſs, ſends you in a
cold morning or a damp evening to pray at his
tomb: He is no Saint by the <hi>Almanack.</hi> If you
muſt pray, why does not ſhe bid you addreſs
yourſelf to our great St. <hi>Nicholas?</hi> I am ſure he
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0507001200:59"/>
is the Saint I pray to for a huſband. Perhaps
my mind would be leſs affected, ſaid <hi>Matilda,</hi> if
my mother would explain her reaſons to me:
But it is the myſtery ſhe obſerves, that inſpires
me with this—I know not what to call it. As
ſhe never acts from caprice, I am ſure there is
ſome fatal ſecret at bottom—nay, I know there
is: In her agony of grief for my brother's death
ſhe dropped ſome words that intimated as much
—oh! dear Madam, cried <hi>Bianca,</hi> What were
they? No; ſaid <hi>Matilda,</hi> if a parent lets fall a
word, and wiſhes it recalled, it is not for a
child to utter it. What! was ſhe ſorry for
what ſhe had ſaid? aſked <hi>Bianca.</hi>—I am ſure,
Madam, you may truſt me—with my own
little ſecrets, when I have any, I may; ſaid
<hi>Matilda</hi>; but never with my mother's: A child
ought to have no ears or eyes, but as a parent
directs. Well! to be ſure, Madam, you was
born to be a ſaint, ſaid <hi>Bianca,</hi> and there is no
reſiſting one's vocation: You will end in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
at laſt. But there is my Lady <hi>Iſabella</hi>
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:0507001200:60"/>
would not be ſo reſerved to me: She will let
me talk to her of young men; and when a
handſome cavalier has come to the caſtle, ſhe
had owned to me that ſhe wiſhed your brother
<hi>Conrad</hi> reſembled him. <hi>Bianca,</hi> ſaid the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs,
I do not allow you to mention my friend
diſreſpectfully. <hi>Iſabella</hi> is of a chearful diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition,
but her ſoul is pure as virtue itſelf. She
knows your idle babling humour, and perhaps
has now and then encouraged it, to divert me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy,
and enliven the ſolitude in which my
father keeps us—Bleſſed <hi>Mary!</hi> ſaid <hi>Bianca</hi>
ſtarting, there it is again!—dear Madam, Do
you hear nothing?—this caſtle is certainly
haunted!—peace! ſaid <hi>Matilda,</hi> and liſten! I
did think I heard a voice—but it muſt be fancy;
your terrors, I ſuppoſe, have infected me. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed!
indeed! Madam, ſaid <hi>Bianca,</hi> half-weeping
with agony, I am ſure I heard a voice. Does any
body lie in the chamber beneath? ſaid the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs.
Nobody has dared to lie there, anſwered
<hi>Bianca,</hi> ſince the great aſtrologer that was your
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0507001200:61"/>
brother's tutor, drowned himſelf. For certain,
Madam, his ghoſt and the young Prince's are
now met in the chamber below—for heaven's
ſake let us fly to your mother's apartment! I
charge you not to ſtir; ſaid <hi>Matilda.</hi> If they
are ſpirits in pain, we may eaſe their ſufferings
by queſtioning them. They can mean no hurt
to us, for we have not injured them—and if
they ſhould, ſhall we be more ſafe in one cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
than in another? Reach me my beads; we
will ſay a prayer, and then ſpeak to them. Oh!
dear Lady, I would not ſpeak to a ghoſt for the
world; cried <hi>Bianca</hi>—as ſhe ſaid thoſe words,
they heard the caſement of the little chamber
below <hi>Matilda</hi>'s open. They liſtened attentive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and in few minutes thought they heard a
perſon ſing, but could not diſtinguiſh the words.
This can be no evil ſpirit; ſaid the Princeſs in
a low voice: It is undoubtedly one of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily—
open the window, and we ſhall know
the voice. I dare not indeed, Madam; ſaid
<hi>Bianca.</hi> Thou art a very fool; ſaid <hi>Matilda,</hi>
opening the window gently herſelf. The noiſe
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0507001200:62"/>
the Princeſs made was however heard by the
perſon beneath, who ſtopped; and they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
had heard the caſement open. Is any
body below? ſaid the Princeſs: If there is,
ſpeak. Yes; ſaid an unknown voice. Who is
it? ſaid <hi>Matilda.</hi> A ſtranger; replied the voice.
What ſtranger? ſaid ſhe; and how didſt thou
come there at this unuſual hour, when all the
gates of the caſtle are locked? I am not here
willingly: Anſwered the voice—but pardon
me, Lady, if I have diſturbed your reſt: I
knew not that I was overheard. Sleep had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken
me: I left a reſtleſs couch, and came to
waſte the irkſome hours with gazing on the fair
approach of morning, impatient to be diſmiſſed
from this caſtle. Thy words and accents, ſaid
<hi>Matilda,</hi> are of a melancholy caſt: If thou art
unhappy, I pity thee. If poverty afflicts thee,
let me know it: I will mention thee to the
Princeſs, whoſe beneficent ſoul ever melts for
the diſtreſſed; and ſhe will relieve thee. I am
indeed unhappy, ſaid the ſtranger; and I know
what wealth is: But I do not complain of the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0507001200:63"/>
lot which heaven has caſt for me: I am young
and healthy, and am not aſhamed of owing my
ſupport to myſelf—yet think me not proud, or
that I diſdain your generous offers. I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
you in my oriſons, and will pray for
bleſſings on your gracious ſelf and your noble
miſtreſs—if I ſigh, Lady, it is for others, not
for myſelf. Now I have it, Madam; ſaid <hi>Bianca,</hi>
whiſpering the Princeſs. This is certainly the
young peaſant; and by my conſcience he is in
love—Well! this is a charming adventure!
—do, Madam, let us ſift him. He does not
know you, but takes you for one of my Lady
<hi>Hippolita</hi>'s women. Art thou not aſhamed, <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anca!</hi>
ſaid the Princeſs: What right have we
to pry into the ſecrets of this young man's
heart? he ſeems virtuous and frank, and tells
us he is unhappy: Are thoſe circumſtances that
authorize us to make a property of him? how
are we intitled to his confidence? Lord! Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
how little you know of love! replied <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anca:</hi>
Why lovers have no pleaſure equal to
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0507001200:64"/>
talking of their miſtreſs. And would you have
<hi>me</hi> become a peaſant's confident? ſaid the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs.
Well then, let me talk to him: Said <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anca:</hi>
Though I have the honour of being your
Highneſs's maid of honour, I was not always
ſo great: Beſides, if love levels ranks, it raiſes
them too: I have a reſpect for any young man
in love—peace! ſimpleton; ſaid the Princeſs.
Though he ſaid he was unhappy, it does not
follow that he muſt be in love. Think of all
that has happened to-day, and tell me if there
are no misfortunes but what love cauſes. Stranger,
reſumed the Princeſs, if thy misfortunes have
not been occaſioned by thy own fault, and are
within the compaſs of the Princeſs <hi>Hippolita</hi>'s
power to redreſs, I will take upon me to anſwer
that ſhe will be thy protectreſs. When thou
art diſmiſſed from this caſtle, repair to holy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Jerome</hi> at the convent adjoining to the
church of St. <hi>Nicholas,</hi> and make thy ſtory
known to him, as far as thou thinkeſt meet:
He will not fail to inform the Princeſs, who is
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0507001200:65"/>
the mother of all that want her aſſiſtance. Fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel:
It is not ſeemly for me to hold farther
converſe with a man at this unwonted hour.
May the Saints guard thee, gracious Lady! re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
the peaſant—but oh! if a poor and worth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
ſtranger might preſume to beg a minute's
audience farther—am I ſo happy?—the caſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is not ſhut—might I venture to aſk—ſpeak
quickly; ſaid <hi>Matilda</hi>; the morning dawns a
pace: Should the labourers come into the fields
and perceive us—What wouldſt thou aſk?—I
know not how—I know not if I dare—ſaid the
young ſtranger faltering—yet the humanity
with which you have ſpoken to me emboldens
—Lady! dare I truſt you?—Heavens! ſaid
<hi>Matilda,</hi> What doſt thou mean? with what
wouldſt thou truſt me?—ſpeak boldly, if thy
ſecret is fit to be entruſted to a virtuous breaſt
—I would aſk, ſaid the Peaſant, recollecting
himſelf, whether what I have heard from the
domeſtics is true, that the Princeſs is miſſing
from the caſtle? What imports it to thee to
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0507001200:66"/>
know? replied <hi>Matilda.</hi> Thy firſt words be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoke
a prudent and becoming gravity. Doſt
thou come hither to pry into the ſecrets of <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred?</hi>
—Adieu. I have been miſtaken in thee. Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
theſe words, ſhe ſhut the caſement haſtily,
without giving the young man time to reply.
I had acted more wiſely, ſaid the Princeſs to
<hi>Bianca</hi> with ſome ſharpneſs, if I had let thee
converſe with this peaſant: His inquiſitiveneſs
ſeems of a piece with thy own. It is not fit for
me to argue with your Highneſs, replied <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anca</hi>;
but perhaps the queſtions I ſhould have
put to him, would have been more to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
than thoſe you have been pleaſed to aſk
him. Oh! no doubt; ſaid <hi>Matilda</hi>; you are
a very diſcreet perſonage! may I know what
<hi>you</hi> would have asked him? A by-ſtander often
ſees more of the game than thoſe that play:
anſwered <hi>Bianca.</hi> Does your Highneſs think,
Madam, that his queſtion about my Lady <hi>Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella</hi>
was the reſult of mere curioſity? No, no,
Madam; there is more in it than you great
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0507001200:67"/>
folks are aware of. <hi>Lopez</hi> told me that all the
ſervants believe this young fellow contrived my
Lady <hi>Iſabella</hi>'s eſcape—now, pray, Madam,
obſerve—you and I both know that my Lady
<hi>Iſabella</hi> never much fancied the Prince your bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
—Well! he is killed juſt in the critical
minute—I accuſe nobody. A helmet falls from
the moon—ſo, my Lord, your father ſays; but
<hi>Lopez</hi> and all the ſervants ſay that this young
ſpark is a magician, and ſtole it from <hi>Alfonſo</hi>'s
tomb—have done with this rhapſody of imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinence,
ſaid <hi>Matilda.</hi> Nay, Madam, as you
pleaſe; cried <hi>Bianca</hi>—yet it is very particular
tho', that my Lady <hi>Iſabella</hi> ſhould be miſſing the
very ſame day, and that this young ſorcerer
ſhould be found at the mouth of the trap-door
—I accuſe nobody—but if my young Lord
came honeſtly by his death—Dare not on thy
duty, ſaid <hi>Matilda,</hi> to breathe a ſuſpicion on
the purity of my dear <hi>Iſabella</hi>'s fame—purity, or
not purity, ſaid <hi>Bianca,</hi> gone ſhe is—a ſtranger
is found that nobody knows: You queſtion him
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0507001200:68"/>
yourſelf: He tells you he is in love, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy,
it is the ſame thing—nay; he owned
he was unhappy about others; and is any body
unhappy about another, unleſs they are in love
with them? and at the very next word, he
aſks innocently, poor ſoul! if my Lady <hi>Iſabella</hi>
is miſſing—to be ſure, ſaid <hi>Matilda,</hi> thy obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations
are not totally without foundation—
<hi>Iſabella</hi>'s flight amazes me: The curioſity of
this ſtranger is very particular—yet <hi>Iſabella</hi> never
concealed a thought from me—ſo ſhe told you,
ſaid <hi>Bianca,</hi> to fiſh out your ſecrets—but who
knows, Madam, but this ſtranger may be ſome
Prince in diſguiſe?—do, Madam, let me open
the window, and ask him a few queſtions. No,
replied, <hi>Matilda,</hi> I will ask him myſelf, if he
knows aught of <hi>Iſabella:</hi> He is not worthy that
I ſhould converſe farther with him. She was
going to open the caſement, when they heard
the bell ring at the poſtern-gate of the caſtle,
which is on the right-hand of the tower, where
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0507001200:69"/>
                  <hi>Matilda</hi> lay. This prevented the Princeſs from
renewing the converſation with the ſtranger.</p>
               <p>After continuing ſilent for ſome time; I am
perſuaded, ſaid ſhe to <hi>Bianca,</hi> that whatever be
the cauſe of <hi>Iſabella</hi>'s flight, it had no unworthy
motive. If this ſtranger was acceſſary to it,
ſhe muſt be ſatisfied of his ſidelity and worth.
I obſerved, did not you, <hi>Bianca?</hi> that his words
were tinctured with an uncommon effuſion of
piety. It was no ruffian's ſpeech: His phraſes
were becoming a man of gentle birth. I told
you, Madam, ſaid <hi>Bianca,</hi> that I was ſure he
was ſome Prince in diſguiſe—yet, ſaid <hi>Matilda,</hi>
if he was privy to her eſcape, how will you account
for his not accompanying her in her flight?
why expoſe himſelf unneceſſarily and raſhly to
my Father's reſentment? As for that, Madam,
replied ſhe, if he could get from under the hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met,
he will find ways of eluding your Father's
anger. I do not doubt but he has ſome taliſman
or other about him—You reſolve every thing
into magic; ſaid <hi>Matilda</hi>—but a man, who has
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0507001200:70"/>
any intercourſe with infernal ſpirits, does not
dare to make uſe of thoſe tremendous and holy
words, which he uttered. Didſt thou not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
with what fervour he vowed to remember
<hi>me</hi> to heaven in his prayers?—yes; <hi>Iſabella</hi>
was cindoubtedly convinced of his piety. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
me to the piety of a young fellow and a
damſel that conſult to elope! ſaid <hi>Bianca.</hi> No,
no, Madam; my Lady <hi>Iſabella</hi> is of another
gueſs mould than you take her for. She uſed
indeed to ſigh and lift up her eyes in your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
becauſe ſhe knows you are a Saint—but
when your back was turned—You wrong her;
ſaid <hi>Matilda: Iſabella</hi> is no hypocrite: She has
a due ſenſe of devotion, but never affected a call
ſhe has not. On the contrary, ſhe always com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated
my inclination for the cloyſter: And
though I own the myſtery ſhe has made to me
of her flight, confounds me; though it ſeems
inconſiſtent with the friendſhip between us; I
cannot forget the diſintereſted warmth with which
ſhe always oppoſed my taking the veil: ſhe
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:0507001200:71"/>
wiſhed to ſee me married, though my dower
would have been a loſs to her and my brother's
children. For her ſake I will believe well of this
young peaſant. Then you do think there is
ſome liking between them; ſaid <hi>Bianca</hi>—While
ſhe was ſpeaking, a ſervant came haſtily into the
chamber and told the Princeſs, that the Lady
<hi>Iſabella</hi> was found. Where? ſaid <hi>Matilda.</hi> She
has taken ſanctuary in St. <hi>Nicholas</hi>'s church; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
the ſervant: Father <hi>Jerome</hi> has brought
the news himſelf: he is below with his Highneſs.
Where is my Mother! ſaid <hi>Matilda.</hi> She is
in her own chamber, Madam, and has aſked
for you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Manfred</hi> had riſen at the firſt dawn of light,
and gone to <hi>Hippolita</hi>'s apartment, to inquire if
ſhe knew ought of <hi>Iſabella.</hi> While he was
queſtioning her, word was brought that <hi>Jerome</hi>
demanded to ſpeak with him. <hi>Manfred,</hi> little
ſuſpecting the cauſe of the Friar's arrival, and
knowing he was employed by <hi>Hippolita</hi> in her
charities, ordered him to be admitted, intending
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0507001200:72"/>
to leave them together, while he purſued his
ſearch after <hi>Iſabella.</hi> Is your buſineſs with me
or the Princeſs? ſaid <hi>Manfred.</hi> With both.
Replied the holy man. The Lady <hi>Iſabella</hi>—
what of her! interrupted <hi>Manfred</hi> eagerly—
is at St. <hi>Nicholas</hi>'s altar, replied <hi>Jerome.</hi> That
is no buſineſs of <hi>Hippolita</hi>; ſaid <hi>Manfred</hi> with
confuſion. Let us retire to my chamber, Father;
and inform me how ſhe came thither. No;
my Lord; replied the good man with an air of
firmneſs and authority, that daunted even the
reſolute <hi>Manfred,</hi> who could not help revering
the ſaint-like virtues of <hi>Jerome:</hi> My commiſſion
is to both; and with your Highneſs's good-liking,
in the preſence of both I ſhall deliver
it—but firſt, my Lord, I muſt interrogate the
Princeſs, whether ſhe is acquainted with the
cauſe of the Lady <hi>Iſabella</hi>'s retirement from your
caſtle—no, on my ſoul; ſaid <hi>Hippolita:</hi> does <hi>Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella</hi>
charge me with being privy to it?—Father,
interrupted <hi>Manfred,</hi> I pay due reverence to
your holy profeſſion; but I am ſovereign here,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0507001200:73"/>
and will allow no meddling prieſt to interfore
in the affairs of my domeſtic. If you have
ought to ſay, attend me to my chamber—I do
not uſe to let my Wife be acquainted with the
ſecret affairs of my State; they are not within
a woman's province. My Lord, ſaid the holy
man, I am no intruder into the ſecrets of
families. My office is to promote peace, to
heal diviſions, to preach repentance, and teach
mankind to curb their headſtrong paſſions. I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give
your Highneſs's uncharitable apoſtrophe: I
know my duty, and am the miniſter of a mightier
prince than <hi>Manfred.</hi> Hearken to him who ſpeaks
through my organs. <hi>Manfred</hi> trembled with
rage and ſhame <hi>Hippolita</hi>'s countenance de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
her aſtoniſhment and impatience to know
where this would end: her ſilence more ſtrongly
ſpoke her obſervance of <hi>Manfred.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Lady <hi>Iſabella,</hi> reſumed <hi>Jerome,</hi> commends
herſelf to both your Highneſſes; ſhe thanks
both for the kindneſs with which ſhe has been
treated in your caſtle: She deplores the loſs of
your ſon, and her own misfortune in not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0507001200:74"/>
the daughter of ſuch wiſe and noble
Princes, whom ſhe ſhall always reſpect as <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents</hi>;
ſhe prays for uninterrupted union and
felicity between you: <hi>[Manfred</hi>'s colour changed]
but as it is no longer poſſible for her to be allied
to you, ſhe intreats your conſent to remain in
ſanctuary, till ſhe can learn news of her father,
or, by the certainty of his death, be at liberty,
with the approbation of her guardians, to diſpoſe
of herſelf in ſuitable marriage. I ſhall give no
ſuch conſent; ſaid the Prince, but inſiſt on
her return to the caſtle without delay: I am an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable
for her perſon to her guardians and will
not brook her being in any hands but my own.
Your Highneſs will recollect whether that can
any longer be proper: replied the Friar. I
want no monitor, ſaid <hi>Manfred</hi> colouring.
<hi>Iſabella</hi>'s conduct leaves room for ſtrange ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions—
and that young villain, who was at
leaſt the accomplice of her flight, if not the
cauſe of it—the cauſe! interrupted <hi>Jerome</hi>;
was a young man the cauſe! This is not to be
borne! cried <hi>Manfred.</hi> Am I to be bearded in my
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:0507001200:75"/>
own palace by an Inſolent Monk! thou art privy
I gueſs, to their amours. I would pray to heaven
to clear up your uncharitable ſurmizes, ſaid
<hi>Jerome,</hi> if your Highneſs were not ſatisfied in
your conſcience how unjuſtly you accuſe me.
I do pray to heaven to pardon that uncharitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:
And I implore your Highneſs to leave
the Princeſs at peace in that holy place, where
ſhe is not liable to be diſturbed by ſuch vain and
worldly fantaſies as diſcourſes of love from any
man. Cant not to me, ſaid <hi>Manfred,</hi> but
return and bring the Princeſs to her duty. It is
my duty to prevent her return hither; ſaid
<hi>Jerome.</hi> She is where orphans and virgins are
ſafeſt from the ſnares and wiles of this world;
and nothing but a parent's authority ſhall take
her thence. I am her parent, cried <hi>Manfred,</hi> and
demand her. She wiſhed to have you for her
parent; ſaid the Friar: But heaven that forbad
that connection, has for ever diſſolved all ties
betwixt you: And I announce to your Highneſs
—ſtop! audacious man, ſaid <hi>Manfred,</hi> and
dread my diſpleaſure. Holy father, ſaid <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polita,</hi>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:0507001200:76"/>
it is your office to be no reſpecter of
perſons: you muſt ſpeak as your duty preſcribes:
But it is my duty to hear nothing that it pleaſes
not my Lord I ſhould hear. Attend the Prince
to his chamber. I will retire to my oratory,
and pray to the bleſſed virgin to inſpire you
with her holy councils, and to reſtore the heart
of my gracious Lord to its wonted peace and
gentleneſs. Excellent woman! ſaid the Friar—
my Lord, I attend your pleaſure.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Manfred,</hi> accompanied by the Friar, paſſed
to his own apartment, where ſhutting the door,
I perceive, father, ſaid he, that <hi>Iſabella</hi> has
acquainted you with my purpoſe. Now hear
my reſolve, and obey. Reaſons of ſtate, moſt
urgent reaſons, my own and the ſafety of my
people, demand that I ſhould have a ſon.
It is in vain to expect an heir from <hi>Hippolita.</hi>
I have made choice of <hi>Iſabella.</hi> You muſt bring
her back; and you muſt do more. I know
the influence you have with <hi>Hippolita:</hi> her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
is in your hands. She is, I allow, a
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0507001200:77"/>
faultleſs woman: Her ſoul is ſet on heaven, and
ſcorns the little grandeur of this world: you
can withdraw her from it intirely. Perſuade
her to conſent to the diſſolution of our marriage,
and to retire into a monaſtery—ſhe ſhall endow
one if ſhe will; and ſhe ſhall have the means
of being as liberal to your order as ſhe or you
can wiſh. Thus you will divert the calamities
that are hanging over our heads, and have the
merit of ſaving the principality of <hi>Otranto</hi> from
deſtruction. You are a prudent man, and
though the warmth of my temper betrayed me
into ſome unbecoming expreſſions, I honour
your virtue, and wiſh to be indebted to you
for the repoſe of my life and the preſervation of
my family.</p>
               <p>The will of heaven be done! ſaid the Friar.
I am but its worthleſs inſtrument. It makes
uſe of my tongue, to tell thee, Prince, of thy
unwarrantable deſigns. The injuries of the
virtuous <hi>Hippolita</hi> have mounted to the throne
of pity. By me thou art reprimanded for thy
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:0507001200:78"/>
adulterous intention of repudiating her: By me
thou art warned not to purſue the inceſtuous
deſign on thy contracted daughter. Heaven that
delivered her from thy fury, when the judgments
ſo recently fallen on thy houſe ought to have
inſpired thee with other thoughts, will continue
to watch over her. Even I, a poor and deſpiſed
Friar, am able to protect her from thy violence
—I, ſinner as I am, and uncharitably reviled
by your Highneſs, as an accomplice of I know
not what amours, ſcorn the allurements with
which it has pleaſed thee to tempt mine ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty.
I love my order; I honour devout
ſouls; I reſpect the piety of thy Princeſs—but
I will not betray the confidence ſhe repoſes in
me, nor ſerve even the cauſe of religion by ſoul
and ſinful compliances—but for ſooth! the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare
of the ſtate depends on your Highneſs
having a ſon. Heaven mocks the ſhort-ſighted
views of man. But yeſter-morn, whoſe houſe
was ſo great, ſo flouriſhing as <hi>Manfred</hi>'s?—
where is young <hi>Conrad</hi> now!—my Lord, I
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:0507001200:79"/>
reſpect your tears—but I mean not to check
them—let them ſlow, Prince! they will
weigh more with heaven towards the welfare of
thy ſubjects, than a marriage, which, founded
on luſt or policy, could never proſper. The
ſcepter, which paſſed from the race of <hi>Alfonſo</hi> to
thine, cannot be preſerved by a match which
the church will never allow. If it is the will of
the moſt High that <hi>Manfred</hi>'s name muſt periſh;
reſign yourſelf, my Lord, to its decrees; and
thus deſerve a crown that can never paſs away—
come, my Lord; I like this ſorrow—let us
return to the Princeſs: She is not appriſed of
your cruel intentions; nor did I mean more
than to alarm you. You ſaw with what gentle
patience, with what efforts of love, ſhe heard,
ſhe rejected hearing the extent of your guilt. I
know ſhe longs to fold you in her arms, and
aſſure you of her unalterable affection. Father,
ſaid the Prince, you miſtake my compunction:
true; I honour <hi>Hippolito</hi>'s virtues; I think her
a Saint; and wiſh it were for my ſoul's health
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:0507001200:80"/>
to tie faſter the knot that has united us—but
alas! Father, you know not the bittereſt of my
pangs! it is ſome time that I have had ſcruples on
the legality of our union: <hi>Hippolita</hi> is related to
me in the fourth degree—it is true, we had a
diſpenſation: But I have been informed that ſhe
had alſo been contracted to another. This it is
that ſits heavy at my heart: To this ſtate of
unlawful wedlock I impute the viſitation that
has fallen on me in the death of <hi>Conrad!</hi>—
eaſe my conſcience of this burden: diſſolve
our marriage, and accompliſh the work of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs
which your divine exhortations have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced
in my ſoul.</p>
               <p>How cutting was the anguiſh which the
good man felt, when he perceived this turn
in the wily Prince! He trembled for <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lita,</hi>
whoſe ruin he ſaw was determined; and
he feared if <hi>Manfred</hi> had no hope of recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<hi>Iſabella,</hi> that his impatience for a ſon
would direct him to ſome other object, who
might not be equally proof againſt the temptation
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:0507001200:81"/>
of <hi>Manfred</hi>'s rank. For ſome time the holy
man remained abſorbed in thought. At length,
conceiving ſome hope from delay, he thought
the wiſeſt conduct would be to prevent the
Prince from deſpairing of recovering <hi>Iſabelia.</hi>
Her the Friar knew he could diſpoſe, from
her affection to <hi>Hippolita,</hi> and from the averſion
ſhe had expreſſed to him for <hi>Manfred</hi>'s addreſſes,
to ſecond his views, till the cenſures of the church
could be fulminated againſt a divorce. With
this intention, as if ſtruck with the Prince's
ſcruples, he at length ſaid; my Lord, I have
been pondering on what your Highneſs has
ſaid; and if in truth it is delicacy of conſcience
that is the real motive of your repugnance to
your virtuous Lady, far be it from me to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to harden your heart. The church is
an indulgent mother: unfold your griefs to her:
ſhe alone can adminiſter comfort to your ſoul,
either by ſatisfying your conſcience, or upon
examination of your ſcruples, by ſetting you
at liberty, and indulging you in the lawful
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:0507001200:82"/>
means of continuing your lineage. In the latter
caſe, if the Lady <hi>Iſabella</hi> can be brought to
conſent—<hi>Manfred,</hi> who concluded that he
had either over-reached the good man, or that
his firſt warmth had been but a tribute paid to
appearance, was overjoyed at this ſudden turn,
and repeated the moſt magnificent promiſes, if
he ſhould ſucceed by the Friar's mediation.
The well meaning Prieſt ſuffered him to deceive
himſelf, fully determined to traverſe his views,
inſtead of ſeconding them.</p>
               <p>Since we now underſtand one another, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed
the Prince, I expect, Father, that you
ſatisfy me in one point. Who is the youth
that I found in the vault? He muſt have
been privy to <hi>Iſabella</hi>'s flight: Tell me truly;
is he her lover? or is he an agent for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
paſſion? I have often ſuſpected <hi>Iſabella</hi>'s
Indifference to my ſon: a thouſand circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
croud on my mind that confirm that ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion.
She herſelf was ſo conſcious of it,
that while I diſcourſed her in the gallery, ſhe
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:0507001200:83"/>
outran my ſuſpicions, and endeavoured to juſtify
herſelf from coolneſs to <hi>Conrad.</hi> The Friar,
who knew nothing of the youth, but what he
had learnt occaſionally from the Princeſs,
ignorant what was become of him, and not
ſufficiently reflecting on the impetuoſity of
<hi>Manfred</hi>'s temper, conceived that it might not
be amiſs to ſow the ſeeds of jealouſy in his
mind: they might be turned to ſome uſe here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after,
either by prejudicing the Prince againſt
<hi>Iſabella,</hi> if he perſiſted in that union; or by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting
his attention to a wrong ſcent, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying
his thoughts on a viſionary intrigue,
prevent his engaging in any new purſuit. With
this unhappy policy, he anſwered in a manner
to confirm <hi>Manfied</hi> in the belief of ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection
between <hi>Iſabella</hi> and the youth. The
Prince, whoſe paſſions wanted little fuel to
throw them into a blaze, ſell into a rage at
the idea of what the Friar ſuggeſted. I will
fathom to the bottom of this intrigue; cried he;
and quitting <hi>Jerome</hi> abruptly, with a command
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:0507001200:84"/>
to remain there till his return, he haſtened to
the great hall of the caſtle, and ordered the
peaſant to be brought before him.</p>
               <p>Thou hardened young impoſtor! ſaid the
Prince, as ſoon as he ſaw the youth; what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
of thy boaſted veracity now? it was Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
was it, and the light of the moon,
that diſcovered the lock of the trap-door to thee?
Tell me, audacious boy, who thou art, and
how long thou haſt been acquainted with the
Princeſs—and take care to anſwer with leſs
equivocation than thou didſt laſt night, or tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
ſhall wring the truth from thee. The
young man, perceiving that his ſhare in the
flight of the Princeſs was diſcovered, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding
that any thing he ſhould ſay could no
longer be of ſervice or detriment to her, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied,
I am no impoſtor, my Lord, nor have I
deſerved opprobrious language. I anſwered to
every queſtion your Highneſs put to me laſt
night with the ſame veracity that I ſhall ſpeak
now: And that will not be from fear of your
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:0507001200:85"/>
tortures, but becauſe my ſoul abhors a ſalſhood.
Pleaſe to repeat your queſtions, my Lord; I
am ready to give you all the ſatisfaction in my
power. You know my queſtions, replied the
Prince, and only want time to prepare an eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.
Speak directly; who art thou? and how
long haſt thou been known to the Princeſs? I
am a labourer at the next village; ſaid the pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant;
my name is <hi>Theodore.</hi> The Princeſs found
me in the vault laſt night: Before that hour I
never was in her preſence. I may believe as
much or as little as I pleaſe of this Said <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred</hi>;
but I will hear thy own ſtory, before I
examine into the truth of it. Tell me, what
reaſon did the Princeſs give thee for making her
eſcape? thy life depends on thy anſwer. She told
me, replied <hi>Theodore,</hi> that ſhe was on the brink
of deſtruction, and that if ſhe could not eſcape
from the caſtle, ſhe was in danger in a few
moments of being made miſerable for ever. And
on this ſlight foundation, on a ſilly girl's report,
ſaid <hi>Manfred,</hi> thou didſt hazard my diſpleaſure <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:0507001200:86"/>
I fear no man's diſpleaſure, ſaid <hi>Theodore,</hi> when
a woman in diſtreſs puts herſelf under my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection—
During this examination, <hi>Matilda</hi> was
going to the apartment of <hi>Hippolita.</hi> At the
upper end of the hall, where <hi>Manfred</hi> ſat, was
a boarded gallery with latticed windows, thro'
which <hi>Matilda</hi> and <hi>Bianca</hi> were to paſs. Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her father's voice, and ſeeing the ſervants
aſſembled round him, ſhe ſtopped to learn the
occaſion. The priſoner ſoon drew her atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
The ſteady and compoſed manner in
which he anſwered, and the gallantry of his
laſt reply, which were the firſt words ſhe heard
diſtinctly intereſted her in his favour. His per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
was noble, handſome, and commanding,
even in that ſituation: But his countenance
ſoon engroſſed her whole care. Heaven! <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anca,</hi>
ſaid the Princeſs ſoftly, do I dream? or is
not that youth the exact reſemblance of <hi>Alfonſo</hi>'s
picture in the gallery? She could ſay no more,
for her father's voice grew louder at every word.
This bravado, ſaid he, ſurpaſſes all thy former
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:0507001200:87"/>
inſolence. Thou ſhalt experience the wrath
with which thou dareſt to trifle. Seize him, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
<hi>Manfred,</hi> and bind him—the firſt news
the Princeſs hears of her champion ſhall be,
that he has loſt his head for her ſake. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice
of which thou art guilty towards me,
ſaid <hi>Theodore,</hi> convinces me that I have done a
good deed in delivering the Princeſs from thy
tyranny. May ſhe be happy, whatever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
of me! This is a Lover! cried <hi>Manfred</hi>
in a rage: A peaſant within ſight of death is not
animated by ſuch ſentiments. Tell me, tell me,
raſh boy, who thou art, or the rack ſhall force
thy ſecret from thee. Thou haſt threatened me
with death already, ſaid the youth, for the truth I
have told thee: If that is all the encouragement
I am to expect for ſincerity, I am not tempted
to indulge thy vain curioſity farther. Then
thou wilt not ſpeak! ſaid <hi>Manfred</hi>; I will not
replied he. Bear him away into the court-yard:
ſaid <hi>Manfred</hi>; I will ſee his head this inſtant ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:0507001200:88"/>
from his body—<hi>Matilda</hi> fainted at hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thoſe words. <hi>Bianca</hi> ſhrieked, and cried,
Help! help! the Princeſs is dead! <hi>Manfred</hi>
ſtarted at this ejaculation, and demanded what
was the matter! The young peaſant, who
heard it too, was ſtruck with horror, and aſked
eagerly the ſame queſtion; but <hi>Manfred</hi> ordered
him to be hurried into the court, and kept there
for execution, till he had informed himſelf of
the cauſe of <hi>Bianca</hi>'s ſhrieks. When he learned
the meaning, he treated it as a womaniſh pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nic,
and ordering <hi>Matilda</hi> to be carried to her
apartment, he ruſhed into the court, and call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for one of his guards, bad <hi>Theodore</hi> kneel
down, and prepare to receive the fatal blow.</p>
               <p>The undaunted youth received the bitter ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
with a reſignation that touched every
heart, but <hi>Manfred</hi>'s. He wiſhed earneſtly to
know the meaning of the words he had heard
relating to the Princeſs; but fearing to exaſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
the tyrant more againſt her, he deſiſted.
The only boon he deigned to aſk, was, that he
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:0507001200:89"/>
might be permitted to have a confeſſor, and
make his peace with heaven. <hi>Manfred,</hi> who
hoped by the confeſſor's means to come at the
youth's hiſtory, readily granted his requeſt:
and being convinced that Father <hi>Jerome</hi> was
now in his intereſt, he ordered him to be called
and ſhrieve the priſoner. The holy man, who
had little foreſeen the cataſtrophe that his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudence
occaſioned, fell on his knees to the
Prince, and adjured him in the moſt ſolemn
manner not to ſhed innocent blood. He ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed
himſelf in the bittereſt terms for his indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion,
endeavoured to diſculpate the youth,
and left no method untried to ſoften the tyrant's
rage. <hi>Manfred,</hi> more incenſed than appeaſed
by <hi>Jerome</hi>'s interceſſion, whoſe retractation now
made him ſuſpect he had been impoſed upon by
both, commanded the friar to do his duty, tell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him he would not allow the priſoner many
minutes for confeſſion. Nor do I aſk many, my
Lord: Said the unhappy young man. My ſins,
thank heaven! have not been numerous; nor
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:0507001200:90"/>
exceed what might be expected at my years.
Dry your tears, good father, and let us diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch:
This is a bad world; nor have I had
cauſe to leave it with regret. Oh! wretched
youth! ſaid <hi>Jerome</hi>; how canſt thou bear the
ſight of me with patience? I am thy murderer!
it is I have brought this diſmal hour upon thee!
I forgive thee from my ſoul, ſaid the youth, as
I hope heaven will pardon me. Hear my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,
father; and give me thy bleſſing. How
can I prepare thee for thy paſſage, as I ought?
ſaid <hi>Jerome.</hi> Thou canſt not be ſaved without
pardoning thy foes—and canſt thou forgive
that impious man there! I can; ſaid <hi>Theodore</hi>;
I do—And does not this touch thee! cruel
Prince! ſaid the Friar. I ſent for thee to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
him, ſaid <hi>Manfred</hi> ſternly; not to plead for
him. Thou didſt firſt incenſe me againſt him
—his blood be on thy head! It will! it will!
ſaid the good man, in an agony of ſorrow.
Thou and I muſt never hope to go, where this
bleſſed youth is going! Diſpatch! ſaid <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred:</hi>
                  <pb n="83" facs="tcp:0507001200:91"/>
I am no more to be moved by the whin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of prieſts, than by the ſhrieks of women.
What! ſaid the youth; is it poſſible that my
fate could have occaſioned what I heard! is the
Princeſs then again in thy power? Thou doſt
but remember me of thy wrath; ſaid <hi>Manfred:</hi>
Prepare thee, for this moment is thy laſt. The
youth, who felt his indignation riſe, and who
was touched with the ſorrow which he ſaw he
had infuſed into all the ſpectators, as well as
into the Friar, ſuppreſſed his emotions, and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
off his doublet, and unbuttoning his collar,
knelt down to his prayers. As he ſtooped, his
ſhirt ſlipped down below his ſhoulder, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
the mark of a bloody arrow. Gracious
heaven! cried the holy man ſtarting, what do
I ſee! it is my child! my <hi>Theodore!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The paſſions that enſued, muſt be conceived;
they cannot be painted. The tears of the aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants
were ſuſpended by wonder, rather than
ſtopped by joy. They ſeemed to inquire in
the eyes of their Lord what they ought to feel.
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:0507001200:92"/>
Surpriſe, doubt, tenderneſs, reſpect, ſuceeded
each other in the countenance of the youth.
He received with modeſt ſubmiſſion the effuſion
of the old man's tears and embraces: Yet afraid
of giving a looſe to hope, and ſuſpecting from
what had paſſed the inflexibility of <hi>Manfred</hi>'s
temper, he caſt a glance towards the Prince, as if
to ſay, canſt thou be unmoved at ſuch a ſcene
as this?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Manfred</hi>'s heart was capable of being touched.
He forgot his anger in his aſtoniſhment: Yet
his pride forbad his owning himſelf affected.
He even doubted whether this diſcovery was not
a contrivance of the friar to ſave the youth.
What may this mean? ſaid he: How can he
be thy ſon? is it conſiſtent with thy profeſſion
or reputed ſanctity to avow a peaſant's offspring
for the fruit of thy irregular amours! Oh! God,
ſaid the holy man, doſt thou queſtion his being
mine? could I feel the anguiſh I do, if I were
not his father? Spare him! good Prince, ſpare
him! and revile me as thou pleaſeſt. Spare
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:0507001200:93"/>
him! ſpare him, cried the attendants, for this
good man's ſake! Peace! ſaid <hi>Manfred</hi> ſternly:
I muſt know more, ere I am diſpoſed to pardon.
A Saint's baſtard may be no ſaint himſelf. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious
Lord! ſaid <hi>Theodore</hi>; add not inſult to
cruelty. If I am this venerable man's ſon, tho'
no Prince, as thou art, know, the blood that
flows in my vains—yes, ſaid the friar, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting
him, his blood is noble; nor is he that
abject thing, my Lord, you ſpeak him. He is
my lawful ſon; and <hi>Sicily</hi> can boaſt of few
houſes more ancient than that of <hi>Falconara</hi>—
but alas! my Lord, what is blood! what is
nobility! We are all reptiles, miſerable, ſinful
creatures. It is piety alone that can diſtinguiſh
us from the duſt whence we ſprung, and whither
we muſt return—Truce to your ſermon! ſaid
<hi>Manfred:</hi> You forget, you are no longer Friar
<hi>Jerome,</hi> but the Count of <hi>Falconara.</hi> Let me
know your hiſtory: You will have time to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralize
hereafter, if you ſhould not happen to
obtain the grace of that ſturdy criminal there.
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:0507001200:94"/>
Mother of God! ſaid the Friar, is it poſſible
my Lord can refuſe a father the life of his only,
his long-loſt child! Trample me, my Lord,
ſcorn, afflict me, accept my life for his, but
ſpare my ſon! Thou canſt feel then, ſaid <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred,</hi>
what it is to loſe an only ſon!—a little
hour ago thou didſt preach up reſignation to
me: <hi>My</hi> Houſe, if fate ſo ſpleaſed, muſt periſh
—but the Counts of <hi>Falconara</hi>—alas! my Lord,
ſaid <hi>Jerome,</hi> I confeſs I have offended; but ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate
not an old man's ſufferings! I boaſt not
of my family, nor think of ſuch vanities—it is
nature that pleads for this boy; it is the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
of the dear woman that bore him—is ſhe
<hi>Theodore,</hi> is ſhe dead?—Her ſoul has long been
with the bleſſed: Said <hi>Theodore.</hi> Oh! how?
cried <hi>Jerome,</hi> tell me—No—ſhe is happy! Thou
art all my care now!—moſt dread Lord! will
you—will you grant me my poor boy's life?
Return to thy convent; anſwered <hi>Manfred</hi>;
conduct the Princeſs hither; obey me in what <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

me die a thouſand deaths, rather than ſtain thy
conſcience. What is it the tyrant would exact
of thee? is the Princeſs ſtill ſafe from his power?
protect her, thou venerable old man; and let
all the weight of his wrath fall on me. <hi>Jerome</hi>
endeavoured to check the impetuoſity of the
youth; and ere <hi>Manfred</hi> could reply, the tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pling
of horſes was heard, and a brazen trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet,
which hung without the gate of the caſtle,
was ſuddenly ſounded. At the ſame inſtant the
ſable plumes on the enchanted helmet, which

with your mockery of its ſervants. Submit
yourſelf to the church; and ceaſe to perſecute
her miniſters. Diſmiſs this innocent youth;
and learn to reſpect the holy character I wear:
Heaven will not be trifled with: you ſee—
the trumpet ſounded again. I acknowledge I

<pb n="89" facs="tcp:0507001200:97"/>
do you go to the wicket, and demand who is
at the gate. Do you grant me the life of
<hi>Theodore?</hi> replied the Friar. I do; ſaid <hi>Manfred</hi>;
but inquire who is without!</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jerome</hi> falling on the neck of his ſon, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
a flood of tears, that ſpoke the fullneſs
of his ſoul. You promiſed to go to the gate;
ſaid <hi>Manfred.</hi> I thought replied the Friar, your
Highneſs would excuſe my thanking you firſt in
this tribute of my heart. Go, deareſt Sir, ſaid
<hi>Theodore</hi>; obey the Prince: I do not deſerve
that you ſhould delay his ſatisfaction for me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jerome,</hi> inquiring who was without, was
anſwered a Herald. From whom? ſaid he.
From the Knight of the gigantic ſabre; ſaid
the Herald; and I muſt ſpeak with the uſurper
of <hi>Otranto. Jerome</hi> returned to the Prince, and
did not fail to repeat the meſſage in the very
words it had been uttered. The firſt ſounds
ſtruck <hi>Manfred</hi> with terror; but when he heard
himſelf ſtyled uſurper, his rage rekindled, and all
his courage revived. Uſurper!—inſolent villain!
cried he, who dares to queſtion my title? retire,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:0507001200:98"/>
Father; this is no buſineſs for Monks: I will
meet this preſumptuous man myſelf. Go to
your convent, and prepare the Princeſ's return:
Your Son ſhall be a hoſtage for your fidelity:
His life depends on your obedience. Good
heaven! my Lord, cried <hi>Jerome,</hi> your Highneſs
did but this inſtant freely pardon my child—
have you ſo ſoon forgot the interpoſition of
heaven? Heaven, replied <hi>Manfred,</hi> does not
ſend Heralds to queſtion the title of a lawful
Prince—I doubt whether it even notifies its
will through Friars—but that is your affair,
not mine. At preſent you know my pleaſure;
and it is not a ſaucy Herald, that ſhall ſave
your ſon, if you do not return with the Princeſs.</p>
               <p>It was in vain for the holy man to reply.
<hi>Manfred</hi> commanded him to be conducted to
the poſtern-gate, and ſhut out from the caſtle:
And he ordered ſome of his attendants to carry
<hi>Theodore</hi> to the top of the black tower, and
guard him ſtrictly; ſcarce permitting the Father
and ſon to exchange a haſty embrace at parting.
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:0507001200:99"/>
He then withdrew to the hall, and ſeating him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
in princely ſtate, ordered the Herald to be
admitted to his preſence.</p>
               <p>Well! thou inſolent! ſaid the Prince, what
wouldſt thou with me! I come, replied he, to thee,
<hi>Manfred,</hi> uſurper of the principality of <hi>Otranto,</hi>
from the renowned and invincible Knight, the
Knight of the gigantic ſabre: in the name of
his Lord, <hi>Freaeric</hi> Marquis of <hi>Vicenza,</hi> he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
the Lady <hi>Iſabella,</hi> daughter of that Prince,
whom thou haſt baſely and traiterouſly got into
thy power, by bribing her falſe guardians during
his abſence: and he requires thee to reſign the
principality of <hi>Otranto,</hi> which thou haſt uſurped
from the ſaid Lord <hi>Frederic,</hi> the neareſt of blood
to the laſt rightful Lord <hi>Alfonſo</hi> the good. If
thou doſt not inſtantly comply with theſe juſt
demands, he defies thee to ſingle combat to the
laſt extremity. And ſo ſaying, the Herald caſt
down his warder.</p>
               <p>And where is this braggart, who ſends thee?
ſaid <hi>Manfred.</hi> At the diſtance of a league, ſaid
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:0507001200:100"/>
the Herald: he comes to make good his Lord's
claim againſt thee, as he is a true Knight and
thou an uſurper and raviſher.</p>
               <p>Injurious as this challenge was, <hi>Manfred</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected
that it was not his intereſt to provoke
the Marquis. He knew how well-founded the
claim of <hi>Frederic</hi> was; nor was this the firſt
time he had heard of it. <hi>Frederic</hi>'s anceſtors
had aſſumed the ſtyle of Princes of <hi>Otranto,</hi> from
the death of <hi>Alfonſo</hi> the good without iſſue; but
<hi>Manfred,</hi> his Father, and grandfather, had been
too powerful for the houſe of <hi>Vicenza</hi> to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſs
them. <hi>Frederic,</hi> a martial and amorous
young Prince, had married a beautiful young
Lady, of whom he was enamoured, and who
had died in childbed of <hi>Iſabella.</hi> Her death
affected him ſo much, that he had taken the
croſs and gone to the holy land, where he was
wounded in an engagement againſt the infidels,
made priſoner, and reported to be dead. When
the news reached <hi>Manfred</hi>'s ears, he bribed the
guardians of the Lady <hi>Iſabella</hi> to deliver her up
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:0507001200:101"/>
to him as a bride for his ſon <hi>Conrad,</hi> by which
alliance he had propoſed to unite the claims of
the two houſes. This motive, on <hi>Conrad</hi>'s
death, had cooperated to make him ſo ſuddenly
reſolve on eſpouſing her himſelf; and the ſame
reflection determined him now to endeavour at
obtaining the conſent of <hi>Frederic</hi> to this marriage.
A like policy inſpired him with the thought of
inviting <hi>Frederic</hi>'s champion into his caſtle, leſt
he ſhould be informed of <hi>Iſbella</hi>'s flight, which
he ſtrictly enjoined his domeſtics not to diſcloſe
to any of the Knight's retinue.</p>
               <p>Herald, ſaid <hi>Manfred,</hi> as ſoon as he had di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted
theſe reflections, return to thy maſter,
and tell him, e'er we liquidate our differences
by the ſword, <hi>Manfred</hi> would hold ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
with him. Bid him welcome to my caſtle,
where by my faith, as I am a true Knight, he
ſhall have courteous reception, and full ſecurity
for himſelf and followers. If we cannot adjuſt
our quarrel by amicable means, I ſwear he ſhall
depart in ſafety, and ſhall have full ſatisfaction
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:0507001200:102"/>
according to the laws of arms: So help me God
and his holy Trinity! the Herald made three
obeiſſances and retired.</p>
               <p>During this interview <hi>Jerome</hi>'s mind was agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated
by a thouſand contrary paſſions. He
trembled for the life of his ſon, and his firſt
thought was to perſuade <hi>Iſabella</hi> to return to the
caſtle. Yet he was ſcarce leſs alarmed at the
thought of her union with <hi>Manfred.</hi> He dreaded
<hi>Hippolita</hi>'s unbounded ſubmiſſion to the will of
her Lord; and though he did not doubt but he
could alarm her piety not to conſent to a divorce,
if he could get acceſs to her; yet ſhould <hi>Manfred</hi>
diſcover that the obſtruction came from him,
it might be equally fatal to <hi>Theodore.</hi> He was
impatient to know whence came the Herald,
who with ſo little management had queſtioned
the title of <hi>Manfred:</hi> yet he did not dare abſent
himſelf from the convent, leſt <hi>Iſabella</hi> ſhould
leave it, and her flight be imputed to him. He
returned diſconſolately to the monaſtery, uncertain
on what conduct to reſolve. A Monk, who met
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:0507001200:103"/>
him in the porch and obſerved his melancholy
air, ſaid, alas! brother, is it then true that we
have loſt our excellent Princeſs <hi>Hippolita?</hi> The
holy man ſtarted, and cried, what meaneſt thou,
brother! I come this inſtant from the caſtle, and
left her in perfect health. <hi>Martelli,</hi> replied the
other Friar, paſſed by the convent but a quarter
of an Hour ago on his way from the caſtle, and
reported that her Highneſs was dead. All our
brethren are gone to the chapel to pray for her
happy tranſit to a better life, and willed me to
wait thy arrival. They know thy holy attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to that good Lady, and are anxious for
the affliction it will cauſe in thee—indeed we
have all reaſon to weep; ſhe was a mother to
our Houſe—but this life is but a pilgrimage; we
muſt not murmur—we ſhall all follow her!
may our end be like her's! good brother, thou
dreameſt, ſaid <hi>Jerome:</hi> I tell thee I come from
the caſtle, and left the Princeſs well—where is
the Lady <hi>Iſabella?</hi>—poor Gentlewoman! re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
the Friar; I told her the ſad news, and
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:0507001200:104"/>
offered her ſpiritual comfort; I reminded her of
the tranſitory condition of mortality, and adviſed
her to take the veil: I quoted the example of
the holy Princeſs <hi>Sanchia</hi> of <hi>Arragon</hi>—thy zeal
was laudable, ſaid <hi>Jerome</hi> impatiently; but at
preſent it was unneceſſary: <hi>Hippolita</hi> is well—
at leaſt I truſt in the Lord ſhe is; I heard
nothing to the contrary—yet methinks, the
Prince's earneſtneſs—well, brother, but where
is the Lady <hi>Iſabella?</hi> I know not; ſaid the
Friar: She wept much, and ſaid ſhe would
retire to her chamber. <hi>Jerome</hi> left his comrade
abruptly, and haſted to the Princeſs, but ſhe
was not in her chamber. He inquired of the
domeſtics of the convent, but could learn no
news of her. He ſearched in vain throughout
the monaſtery and the church, and diſpatched
meſſengers round the neighbourhood, to get
intelligence if ſhe had been ſeen; but to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.
nothing could equal the good man's per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity.
He judged that <hi>Iſabella,</hi> ſuſpecting
<hi>Manfred</hi> of having precipitated his wife's death,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:0507001200:105"/>
had taken the alarm, and withdrawn herſelf to
ſome more ſecret place of concealment. This
new flight would probably carry the Prince's
fury to the height. The report of <hi>Hippolita</hi>'s
death, though it ſeemed almoſt incredible, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed
his conſternation; and though <hi>Iſabella</hi>'s
eſcape beſpoke her averſion of <hi>Manfred</hi> for a
huſband, <hi>Jerome</hi> could feel no comfort from it,
while it endangered the life of his ſon. He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
to return to the caſtle, and made ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
of his brethren accompany him to atteſt
his innocence to <hi>Manfred,</hi> and, if neceſſary,
join their interceſſion with his for <hi>Theodore.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Prince, in the mean time, had paſſed
into the court, and ordered the gates of the
caſtle to be flung open for the reception of the
ſtranger Knight and his train. In a few minutes
the cavalcade arrived. Firſt came two harbin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
with wands. Next a herald, followed by
two pages and two trumpets. Then an hundred
foot-guards. Theſe were attended by as many
horſe. After them fifty footmen, cloathed in
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:0507001200:106"/>
ſcarlet and black, the colours of the Knight.
Then a led horſe. Two heralds on each ſide
of a gentleman on horſeback bearing a banner
with the arms of <hi>Vicenza</hi> and <hi>Otranto</hi> quarterly
—a circumſtance that much offended <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred</hi>
—but he ſtifled his reſentment. Two
more pages. The Knight's confeſſor telling his
beads. Fifty more footmen, clad as before.
Two Knights habited in complete armour,
their beavors down, comrades to the principal
Knight. The ſquires of the two Knights, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
their ſhields and devices. The Knight's
own ſquire. An hundred gentlemen bearing an
enormous ſword, and ſeeming to faint under
the weight of it. The Knight himſelf on a
cheſtnut ſteed, in complete armour, his lance
in the reſt, his face entirely concealed by his
vizor, which was ſurmounted by a large plume
of ſcarlet and black feathers. Fifty foot-guards
with drums and trumpets cloſed the proceſſion,
which wheeled off to the right and left to make
room for the principal Knight.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="99" facs="tcp:0507001200:107"/>
As ſoon as he approached the gate, he ſtopped;
and the herald advancing, read again the words
of the challenge. <hi>Manfred</hi>'s eyes were fixed on
the gigantic ſword, and he ſcarce ſeemed to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to the cartel: But his attention was ſoon
diverted by a tempeſt of wind that roſe behind
him. He turned and beheld the plumes of the
enchanted helmet agitated in the ſame extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
manner as before. It required intrepi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity
like <hi>Manfred</hi>'s not to ſink under a concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of circumſtances that ſeemed to announce
his fate. Yet ſcorning in the preſence of ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
to betray the courage he had always mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted,
he ſaid boldly, Sir Knight, whoever
thou art, I bid thee welcome. If thou art of
mortal mould, thy valour ſhall meet its equal:
And, if thou art a true Knight, thou wilt ſcorn
to employ ſorcery to carry thy point. Be theſe
omens from heaven or hell, <hi>Manfred</hi> truſts to
the righteouſneſs of his cauſe and to the aid of
St. <hi>Nicholas,</hi> who has ever protected his houſe.
Alight, Sir Knight, and repoſe thyſelf. To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrow
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:0507001200:108"/>
thou ſhalt have a fair field; and heaven
befriend the juſter ſide!</p>
               <p>The Knight made no reply, but diſmounting,
was conducted by <hi>Manfred</hi> to the great hall of
the caſtle. As they traverſed the court, the
Knight ſtopped to gaze at the miraculous caſque;
and kneeling down, ſeemed to pray inwardly
for ſome minutes. Riſing, he made a ſign to
the Prince to lead on. As ſoon as they entered
the hall, <hi>Manfred</hi> propoſed to the ſtranger to
diſarm, but the Knight ſhook his head in token
of refuſal. Sir Knight, ſaid <hi>Manfred,</hi> this is
not courteous; but by my good faith I will not
croſs thee; nor ſhalt thou have cauſe to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
of the Prince of <hi>Otranto.</hi> No treachery is
deſigned on my part; I hope none is intended
on thine: Here take my gage: [giving him
his ring] your friends and you ſhall enjoy the
laws of hoſpitality. Reſt here, until refreſhments
are brought: I will but give orders for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation
of your train, and return to you.
The three Knights bowed as accepting his cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſy.
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:0507001200:109"/>
                  <hi>Manfred</hi> directed the ſtranger's retinue to
be conducted to an adjacent hoſpital, founded
by the Princeſs <hi>Hippolita</hi> for the reception of
pilgrims. As they made the circuit of the court
to return towards the gate, the gigantic ſword
burſt from the ſupporters, and falling to the
ground oppoſite to the helmet, remained im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable.
<hi>Manfred</hi> almoſt hardened to preter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural
appearances, ſurmounted the ſhock of
this new prodigy; and returning to the hall,
where by this time the feaſt was ready, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited
his ſilent gueſts to take their places. <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred,</hi>
however ill his heart was at eaſe, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to inſpire the company with mirth. He
put ſeveral queſtions to them, but was anſwered
only by ſigns. They raiſed their vizors but
ſufficiently to feed themſelves, and that ſpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly.
Sirs, ſaid the Prince, ye are the firſt
gueſts I ever treated within theſe walls, who
ſcorned to hold any intercourſe with me: Nor
has it oft been cuſtomary, I ween, for Princes to
hazard their ſtate and dignity againſt ſtrangers
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:0507001200:110"/>
and mutes. You ſay you come in the name of
<hi>Frederic</hi> of <hi>Vicenza:</hi> I have ever heard that he
was a gallant and courteous Knight; nor would
he, I am bold to ſay, think it beneath him to
mix in ſocial converſe with a Prince that is his
equal, and not unknown by deeds in arms.—
Still ye are ſilent—well! be it as it may—
by the laws of hoſpitality and chivalry ye are
maſters under this roof: Ye ſhall do your plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
—but come, give me a goblet of wine;
ye will not refuſe to pledge me to the healths
of your fair miſtreſſes. The principal Knight
ſighed and croſſed himſelf, and was riſing from
the board—Sir Knight, ſaid <hi>Manfred,</hi> what I
ſaid was but in ſport: I ſhall conſtrain you in
nothing: Uſe your good liking. Since mirth
is not your mood, let us be ſad. Buſineſs may
hit your fancies better: Let us withdraw; and
hear if what I have to unfold, may be better
reliſhed than the vain efforts I have made for
your paſtime.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="103" facs="tcp:0507001200:111"/>
                  <hi>Manfred</hi> then conducting the three Knights
into an inner chamber, ſhut the door, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viting
them to be ſeated, began thus, addreſſing
himſelf to the chief perſonage.</p>
               <p>You come, Sir Knight, as I underſtand, in
the name of the Marquis of <hi>Vicenza,</hi> to re-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
the Lady <hi>Iſabella</hi> his daughter, who has
been contracted in the face of holy church to
my ſon, by the conſent of her legal guardians;
and to require me to reſign my dominions to
your Lord, who gives himſelf for the neareſt of
blood to Prince <hi>Alfonſo,</hi> whoſe ſoul God reſt! I
ſhall ſpeak to the latter article of your demands
firſt. You muſt know, your Lord knows, that
I enjoy the principality of <hi>Otranto</hi> from my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Don Manuel,</hi> as he received it from his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Don Ricardo. Alfonſo,</hi> their predeceſſor,
dying childeſs in the Holy Land, bequeathed
his eſtates to my grandfather <hi>Don Ricardo,</hi> in
conſideration of his faithful ſervices—the
ſtranger ſhook his head—Sir Knight, ſaid <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred</hi>
warmly, <hi>Ricardo</hi> was a valiant and upright
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:0507001200:112"/>
man; he was a pious man, witneſs his muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent
foundation of the adjoining church and
two convents. He was peculiarly patronized
by St. <hi>Nicholas</hi>—my grandfather was incapable
—I ſay, Sir, <hi>Don Ricardo</hi> was incapable—ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
me, your interruption has diſordered me.
—I venerate the memory of my grandfather—
well! Sirs, he held this eſtate; he held it by
his good ſword and by the favour of St. <hi>Nicholas</hi>
—ſo did my father; and ſo, Sirs, will I, come
what come will—but <hi>Frederic,</hi> your Lord, is
neareſt in blood—I have conſented to put my
title to the iſſue of the ſword—does that imply
a vitious title?—I might have aſked, where is
<hi>Frederic</hi> your Lord? Report ſpeaks him dead in
captivity. You ſay, your actions ſay, he lives
—I queſtion it not—I might, Sirs, I might—but
I do not. Other Princes would bid <hi>Frederic</hi>
take his inheritance by force, if he can: They
would not ſtake their dignity on a ſingle com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat:
They would not ſubmit it to the deciſion
of unknown mutes!—pardon me, Gentlemen,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:0507001200:113"/>
I am too warm: But ſuppoſe yourſelves in my
ſituation: As ye are ſtout Knights, would it
not move your choler to have your own and the
honour of your anceſtors called in queſtion?—
but to the point. Ye require me to deliver up
the Lady <hi>Iſabella</hi>—Sirs, I muſt aſk if ye are
authorized to receive her? The Knight nodded.
Receive her—continued <hi>Manfred</hi>; well! you
are authorized to receive her—but, gentle
Knight, may I aſk if you have full powers?
The Knight nodded. 'Tis well: Said <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred:</hi>
Then hear what I have to offer—ye ſee,
Gentlemen, before you the moſt unhappy of
men! [he began to weep] afford me your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion;
I am intitled to it: Indeed I am.
Know, I have loſt my only hope, my joy,
the ſupport of my houſe—<hi>Conrad</hi> died yeſter
morning. The Knights diſcovered ſigns of ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe.
Yes, Sirs, fate has diſpoſed of my ſon.
<hi>Iſabella</hi> is at liberty—Do you then reſtore her?
cried the chief Knight, breaking ſilence. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford
me your patience: Said <hi>Manfred.</hi> I rejoice
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:0507001200:114"/>
to find, by this teſtimony of your good-will,
that this matter may be adjuſted without blood.
It is no intereſt of mine dicates what little I
have farther to ſay. Ye behold in me a man
diſguſted with the world: The loſs of my ſon
has weaned me from earthly cares. Power and
greatneſs have no longer any charms in my
eyes. I wiſhed to tranſmit the ſcepter I had
received from my anceſtors with honour to my
ſon—but that is over! Life itſelf is ſo indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
to me, that I accepted your defiance with
joy: A good Knight cannot go to the grave
with more ſatisfaction than when falling in his
vocation. Whatever is the will of heaven, I
ſubmit; for alas! Sirs, I am a man of many
ſorrows. <hi>Manfred</hi> is no object of envy—but
no doubt you are acquainted with my ſtory.
The Knight made ſigns of ignorance, and
ſeemed curious to have <hi>Manfred</hi> proceed. Is it
poſſible, Sirs, continued the Prince, that my
ſtory ſhould be a ſecret to you? have you heard
nothing relating to me and the Princeſs <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lita?</hi>
                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:0507001200:115"/>
They ſhook their heads—no! thus then,
Sirs, it is. You think me ambitious: Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
alas! is compoſed of more rugged mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials.
If I were ambitious, I ſhould not for ſo
many years have been a prey to all the hell of
conſcientious ſcruples—but I weary your pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence:
I will be brief. Know then, that I have
long been troubled in mind on my union with
the Princeſs <hi>Hippolita.</hi>—Oh! Sirs, if ye were
acquainted with that excellent woman! if ye
knew that I adore her like a miſtreſs, and
cheriſh her as a friend—but man was not born
for perfect happineſs! ſhe ſhares my ſcruples,
and with her conſent I have brought this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
before the church, for we are related within
the forbidden degrees. I expect every hour the
definitive ſentence that muſt ſeparate us for ever
—I am ſure you feel for me—I ſee you do—
pardon theſe tears! The Knights gazed on each
other, wondering where this would end. <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred</hi>
continued. The death of my ſon betiding
while my ſoul was under this anxiety, I thought
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:0507001200:116"/>
of nothing but reſigning my dominions, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiring
for ever from the ſight of mankind. My
only difficulty was to fix on a ſucceſſor, who
would be tender of my people, and to diſpoſe
of the Lady <hi>Iſabella,</hi> who is dear to me as my
own blood. I was willing to reſtore the line
of <hi>Alfonſo,</hi> even in his moſt diſtant kindred:
And though, pardon me, I am ſatisfied it was
his will that <hi>Ricardo</hi>'s lineage ſhould take place
of his own relations; yet where was I to ſearch
for thoſe relations? I knew of none but <hi>Frederic</hi>
your Lord; he was a captive to the infidels, or
dead; and were he living, and at home, would
he quit the flouriſhing ſtate of <hi>Vicenza</hi> for the
inconſiderable principality of <hi>Otranto?</hi> If he
would not, could I bear the thought of ſeeing a
hard unfeeling Viceroy ſet over my poor faithful
people?—for, Sirs, I love my people, and thank
heaven am beloved by them—but ye will aſk,
whither tends this long diſcourſe? briefly then,
thus, Sirs. Heaven in your arrival ſeems to point
out a remedy for theſe difficulties and my misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes.
The Lady <hi>Iſabella</hi> is at liberty; I ſhall ſoon
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:0507001200:117"/>
be ſo—I would ſubmit to any thing for the good
of my people—were it not the beſt, the only
way to extinguiſh the feuds between our fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
if I was to take the Lady <hi>Iſabella</hi> to wife
—you ſtart—but though <hi>Hippolita</hi>'s virtues will
ever be dear to me, a Prince muſt not conſider
himſelf; he is born for his people.—A ſervant
at that inſtant entering the chamber apprized
<hi>Manfred</hi> that <hi>Jerome</hi> and ſeveral of his brethren
demanded immediate acceſs to him.</p>
               <p>The Prince, provoked at this interruption,
and fearing that the Friar would diſcover to the
ſtrangers that <hi>Iſabella</hi> had taken ſanctuary, was
going to forbid <hi>Jerome</hi>'s entrance. But recollect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that he was certainly arrived to notify the
Princeſs's return, <hi>Manfred</hi> began to excuſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to the Knights for leaving them for a few
moments, but was prevented by the arrival of
the Friars. <hi>Manfred</hi> angrily reprimanded them
for their intruſion, and would have forced them
back from the chamber; but <hi>Jerome</hi> was too
much agitated to be repulſed. He declared aloud
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:0507001200:118"/>
the flight of <hi>Iſabella,</hi> with proteſtations of his
own innocence. <hi>Manfred</hi> diſtracted at the news,
and not leſs at its coming to the knowledge of
the ſtrangers, uttered nothing but incoherent
ſentences, now upbraiding the Friar, now apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gizing
to the Knights, earneſt to know what was
become of <hi>Iſabella,</hi> yet equally afraid of their
knowing, impatient to purſue her, yet dreading
to have them join in the purſuit. He offered
to diſpatch meſſengers in queſt of her,—but
the chief Knight no longer keeping ſilence, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached
<hi>Manfred</hi> in bitter terms for his dark
and ambiguous dealing, and demanded the cauſe
of <hi>Iſabella</hi>'s firſt abſence from the caſtle. <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred,</hi>
caſting a ſtern look at <hi>Jerome,</hi> implying a
command of ſilence, pretended that on <hi>Conrad</hi>'s
death he had placed her in ſanctuary until he
could determine how to diſpoſe of her. <hi>Jerome,</hi>
who trembled for his ſon's life, did not dare con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict
this falſhood, but one of his brethren,
not under the ſame anxiety, declared frankly
that ſhe had fled to their church in the preceding
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:0507001200:119"/>
night. The Prince in vain endeavoured to ſtop
this diſcovery, which overwhelmed him with
ſhame and confuſion. The principal ſtranger,
amazed at the contradictions he heard, and
more than half perſuaded that <hi>Manfred</hi> had ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creted
the Princeſs, notwithſtanding the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
he expreſſed at her flight, ruſhing to the
door, ſaid, thou traitor-Prince! <hi>Iſabella</hi> ſhall be
found. <hi>Manfred</hi> endeavoured to hold him,
but the other Knights aſſiſting their comrade,
he broke from the Prince, and haſtened into
the court, demanding his attendants. <hi>Manfred</hi>
finding it vain to divert him from the purſuit,
offered to accompany him; and ſummoning his
attendants, and taking <hi>Jerome</hi> and ſome of the
Friars to guide them, they iſſued from the caſtle;
<hi>Manfred</hi> privately giving orders, to have the
Knight's company ſecured, while to the Knight
he affected to diſpatch a meſſenger to require
their aſſiſtance.</p>
               <p>The company had no ſooner quitted the caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
than <hi>Matilda,</hi> who felt herſelf deeply in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:0507001200:120"/>
for the young peaſant, ſince ſhe had
ſeen him condemned to death in the hall, and
whoſe thoughts had been taken up with concert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
meaſures to ſave him, was informed by ſome
of the female attendants that <hi>Manfred</hi> had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched
all his men various ways in purſuit of
<hi>Iſabella.</hi> He had in his hurry given this order
in general terms, not meaning to extend it to
the guard he had ſet upon <hi>Theodore,</hi> but forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
it. The domeſtics, officious to obey ſo
peremptory a Prince, and urged by their own
curioſity and love of novelty to join in any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate
chace, had to a man left the caſtle.
<hi>Matilda</hi> diſengaging herſelf from her women,
ſtole up to the black tower, and unbolting the
door, preſented herſelf to the aſtoniſhed <hi>Theodore.</hi>
Young man, ſaid ſhe, though filial duty, and
womanly modeſty condemn the ſtep I am tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
yet holy charity, ſurmounting all other
ties, juſtifies this act. Fly; the doors of thy
priſon are open: My father and his domeſtics
are abſent; but they may ſoon return: Be gone
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:0507001200:121"/>
in ſafety; and may the angels of heaven direct
thy courſe! Thou art ſurely one of thoſe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels!
ſaid the enraptured <hi>Theodore:</hi> None but a
bleſſed ſaint could ſpeak, could act—could
lock like thee!—may I not know the name of
my divine protectreſs! methought thou namedſt
thy father: Is it poſſible! can <hi>Manfred</hi>'s blood
feel holy pity?—lovely lady, thou anſwereſt
not—but how art thou here thyſelf? why
doſt thou neglect thy own ſafety, and waſte a
thought on a wretch like <hi>Theodore?</hi> let us fly
together: The life thou beſtoweſt ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated
to thy defence. Alas! thou miſtakeſt;
ſaid <hi>Matilda</hi> ſighing: I am <hi>Manfred</hi>'s daughter,
but no dangers await me. Amazement! ſaid
<hi>Theodore:</hi> But laſt night I bleſſed myſelf for
yielding thee the ſervice thy gracious compaſſion
ſo charitably returns me now. Still thou art in
an error; ſaid the Princeſs; but this is no time
for explanation. Fly, virtuous youth, while it
is in my power to ſave thee: Should my father
return, thou and I both ſhould indeed have
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:0507001200:122"/>
cauſe to tremble. How! ſaid <hi>Theodore</hi>; think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
thou, charming maid, that I will accept
of life at the hazard of aught calamitous to
thee? better I endured a thouſand deaths,
—I run no riſk, ſaid <hi>Matilda,</hi> but by thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay.
Depart; it cannot be known that I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted
thy flight. Swear by the ſaints above,
ſaid <hi>Theodore,</hi> that thou canſt not be ſuſpected;
elſe here I vow to await whatever can befal me.
Oh! thou art too generous; ſaid <hi>Matilda</hi>; but
reſt aſſured that no ſuſpicion can alight on me.
Give me thy beauteous hand in token that thou
doſt not deceive me, ſaid <hi>Theodore</hi>; and let me
bathe it with the warm tears of gratitude,—
forbear; ſaid the Princeſs; this muſt not be.
Alas! ſaid <hi>Theodore,</hi> I have never known but ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity
until this hour—perhaps ſhall never know
other fortune again: Suffer the chaſte raptures
of holy gratitude: 'Tis my ſoul would print
its effuſions on thy hand. Forbear, and be
gone: Said <hi>Matilda:</hi>—How would <hi>Iſabella</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
of ſeeing thee at my feet? Who is <hi>Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella?</hi>
                  <pb n="115" facs="tcp:0507001200:123"/>
ſaid the young man with ſurprize. Ah
me! I fear, ſaid the Princeſs, I am ſerving a
deceitful one!—haſt thou forgot thy curioſity
this morning? Thy looks, thy actions, all thy
beauteous ſelf ſeems an emanation of divinity,
ſaid <hi>Theodore,</hi> but thy words are dark and myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
—ſpeak, lady; ſpeak to thy ſervant's
comprehenſion.—Thou underſtandeſt but too
well! ſaid <hi>Matilda:</hi> But once more I command
thee to be gone: Thy blood, which, I may
preſerve, will be on my head, if I waſte the
time in vain diſcourſe. I go, lady, ſaid <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore,</hi>
becauſe it is thy will, and becauſe I would
not bring the grey hairs of my father with ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
to the grave. Say but, adored lady, that
I have thy gentle pity.—Stay; ſaid <hi>Matilda</hi>; I
will conduct thee to the ſubterraneous vault
by which <hi>Iſabella</hi> eſcaped; it will lead thee to
the church of St. <hi>Nicholas,</hi> where thou mayſt
take ſanctuary.—What! ſaid <hi>Theodore,</hi> was
it another, and not thy lovely ſelf that I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted
to find the ſubterraneous paſſage? It was;
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:0507001200:124"/>
ſaid <hi>Matilda</hi>; but aſk no more: I tremble to
ſee thee ſtill abide here: Fly to the ſanctuary,—
to ſanctuary! ſaid <hi>Theodore:</hi> No, Princeſs; ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuaries
are for helpleſs damſels, or for crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals.
<hi>Theodore</hi>'s ſoul is free from guilt, nor
will wear the appearance of it. Give me a
ſword, lady, and thy father ſhall learn that
<hi>Theodore</hi> ſcorns an ignominious flight. Raſh
youth! ſaid <hi>Matilda,</hi> thou wouldſt not dare to
lift thy preſumptuous arm againſt the Prince of
<hi>Otranto?</hi> Not againſt thy father; indeed I dare
not: ſaid <hi>Theodore:</hi> Excuſe me, lady; I had
forgotten,—but could I gaze on thee, and
remember thou art ſprung from the tyrant
<hi>Manfred?</hi>—but he is thy father, and from
this moment my injuries are buried in oblivion.
A deep and hollow groan, which ſeemed to
come from above, ſtartled the Princeſs and
<hi>Theodore.</hi> Good heaven! we are overheard!
ſaid the Princeſs. They liſtened; but perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no farther noiſe, they both concluded it
the effect of pent-up vapours: And the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:0507001200:125"/>
preceding <hi>Theodore</hi> ſoftly, carried him to
her father's armory, where equipping him with
a complete ſuit, he was conducted by <hi>Matilda</hi>
to the poſtern-gate. Avoid the town, ſaid
the Princeſs, and all the weſtern ſide of the
caſtle: 'Tis there the ſearch muſt be mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by <hi>Manfred</hi> and the ſtrangers: But hie thee
to the oppoſite quarter. Yonder behind that
foreſt to the eaſt is a chain of rocks, hollowed
into a labyrinth of caverns that reach to the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coaſt.
There thou mayſt lie concealed, till thou
canſt make ſigns to ſome veſſel to put on ſhore
and take thee off. Go! heaven be thy guide!
—and ſometimes in thy prayers remember—
<hi>Matilda! Theodore</hi> flung himſelf at her feet, and
ſeizing her lilly hand, which with ſtruggles ſhe
ſuffered him to kiſs, he vowed on the earlieſt
opportunity to get himſelf knighted, and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vently
intreated her permiſſion to ſwear himſelf
eternally her knight—E'er the Princeſs could
reply, a clap of thunder was ſuddenly heard,
that ſhook the battlements. <hi>Theodore,</hi> regardleſs
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:0507001200:126"/>
of the tempeſt, would have urged his ſuit;
but the Princeſs, diſmayed, retreated haſtily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the caſtle, and commanded the youth to be
gone with an air that would not be diſobeyed.
He ſighed, and retired, but with eyes fixed on
the gate, until <hi>Matilda</hi> cloſing it, put an end to
an interview, in which the hearts of both had
drunk ſo deeply of a paſſion, which both now
taſted for the firſt time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Theodore</hi> went penſively to the convent, to
acquaint his father with his deliverance. There
he learned the abſence of <hi>Jerome,</hi> and the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit
that was making after the lady <hi>Iſabella,</hi> with
ſome particulars of whoſe ſtory he now firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
acquainted. The generous galantry of
his nature prompted him to wiſh to aſſiſt her;
but the Monks could lend him no lights to
gueſs at the route ſhe had taken. He was not
tempted to wander far in ſearch of her, for the
idea of <hi>Matilda</hi> had imprinted itſelf ſo ſtrongly
on his heart, that he could not bear to abſent
himſelf at much diſtance from her abode. The
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:0507001200:127"/>
tenderneſs <hi>Jerome</hi> had expreſſed for him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred
to confirm this reluctance; and he even
perſuaded himſelf that ſilial affection was the
chief cauſe of his hovering between the caſtle
and monaſtery. Until <hi>Jerome</hi> ſhould return
at night; <hi>Theodore</hi> at length determined to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair
to the foreſt that <hi>Matilda</hi> had pointed out
to him. Arriving there, he ſought the gloomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
ſhades, as beſt ſuited to the pleaſing me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy
that reigned in his mind. In this mood
he roved inſenſibly to the caves which had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
ſerved as a retreat to hermits, and were
now reported round the country to be haunted
by evil ſpirits. He recollected to have heard this
tradition; and being of a brave and adventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
diſpoſition, he willingly indulged his cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity
in exploring the ſecret receſſes of this la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byrinth.
He had not penetrated far before
he thought he heard the ſteps of ſome perſon
who ſeemed to retreat before him. <hi>Theodore,</hi>
though firmly grounded in all our holy faith
enjoins to be believed, had no apprehenſion
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:0507001200:128"/>
that good men were abandoned without cauſe to
the malice of the powers of darkneſs. He
thought the place more likely to be infeſted by
robbers than by thoſe infernal agents who are
reported to moleſt and bewilder travellers. He
had long burned with impatience to approve his
valour—drawing his ſabre, he marched ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dately
onwards, ſtill directing his ſteps, as the
imperfect ruſtling ſound before him led the way.
The armour he wore was a like indication to
the perſon who avoided him. <hi>Theodore</hi> now
convinced that he was not miſtaken, redoubled
his pace, and evidently gained on the perſon
that fled, whoſe haſte increaſing, <hi>Theodore</hi> came
up juſt as a woman fell breathleſs before him.
He haſted to raiſe her, but her terror was ſo
great, that he apprehended ſhe would ſaint in
his arms. He uſed every gentle word to diſpel
her alarms, and aſſured her that far from injur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
he would defend her at the peril of his
life. The lady recovering her ſpirits from his
courteous demeanour, and gazing on her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector,

                  <pb n="121" facs="tcp:0507001200:130"/>
ſaid, ſure I have heard that voice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore!
not to my knowledge, replied <hi>Theodore,</hi>
unleſs as I conjecture thou art the lady <hi>Iſabella,</hi>
—merciful heaven! cried ſhe, thou art not
ſent in queſt of me, art thou? and ſaying thoſe
words, ſhe threw herſelf at his feet, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought
him not to deliver her up to <hi>Manfred.</hi>
To <hi>Manfred!</hi> cried <hi>Theodore</hi>—no, lady, I have
once already delivered thee from his tyranny,
and it ſhall fare hard with me now, but I will
place thee out of the reach of his daring. Is
it poſſible, ſaid ſhe, that thou ſhouldſt be the
generous unknown whom I met laſt night in
the vault of the caſtle? ſure thou art not a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,
but my guardian angel: On my knees let
me thank—hold, gentle Princeſs, ſaid <hi>Theodore,</hi>
nor demean thyſelf before a poor and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
young man. If heaven has ſelected me
for thy deliverer, it will accompliſh its work,
and ſtrengthen my arm in thy cauſe—but
come, lady, we are too near the mouth of
the cavern; let us ſeek its inmoſt receſſes: I
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:0507001200:131"/>
can have no tranquillity till I have placed thee
beyond the reach of danger. Alas! what mean
you, Sir? ſaid ſhe. Though all your actions
are noble, though your ſentiments ſpeak the
purity of your ſoul, is it fitting that I ſhould
accompany you alone into theſe perplexed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treats?
ſhould we be found together, what
would a cenſorious world think of my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct?
I reſpect your virtuous delicacy, ſaid
<hi>Theodore</hi>; nor do you harbour a ſuſpicion that
wounds my honour. I meant to conduct you
into the moſt private cavity of theſe rocks,
and then at the hazard of my life to guard
their entrance againſt every living thing. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
lady, continued he drawing a deep ſigh,
beauteous and all perfect as your form is, and
though my wiſhes are not guiltleſs of aſpiring,
know, my ſoul is dedicated to another; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
—a ſudden noiſe prevented <hi>Theodore</hi>
from proceeding. They ſoon diſtinguiſhed theſe
ſounds, <hi>Iſabella!</hi> what ho! <hi>Iſabella!</hi>—the
trembling Princeſs relapſed into her former
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:0507001200:132"/>
agony of fear. <hi>Theodore</hi> endeavoured to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
her, but in vain. He aſſured her he
would die rather than ſuffer her to return un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<hi>Manfred</hi>'s power; and begging her to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
concealed, he went forth to prevent the
perſon in ſearch of her from approaching.</p>
               <p>At the mouth of the cavern he found an
armed Knight, diſcourſing with a peaſant,
who aſſured him he had ſeen a lady enter the
paſſes of the rock. The Knight was prepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to ſeek her, when <hi>Theodore,</hi> placing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
in his way, with his ſword drawn, ſternly
forbad him at his peril to advance. And who
art thou who dareſt to croſs my way? ſaid the
Knight haughtily. One who does not dare
more than he will perform, ſaid <hi>Theodore.</hi> I
ſeek the lady <hi>Iſabella</hi>; ſaid the Knight, and
underſtand ſhe has taken refuge among theſe
rocks. Impede me not, or thou wilt repent
having provoked my reſentment. Thy pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
is as odious, as thy reſentment is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible,
ſaid <hi>Theodore.</hi> Return whence thou
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:0507001200:133"/>
cameſt, or we ſhall ſoon know whoſe reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is moſt terrible. The ſtranger, who was
the principal Knight that had arrived from the
marquis of <hi>Vicenza,</hi> had galloped from <hi>Manfred</hi>
as he was buſied in getting information of the
Princeſs, and giving various orders to prevent
her falling into the power of the three Knights.
Their chief had ſuſpected <hi>Manfred</hi> of being pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
to the Princeſs's abſconding; and this inſult
from a man, who he concluded was ſtationed
by that Prince to ſecrete her, confirming his
ſuſpicions, he made no reply, but diſcharging
a blow with his ſabre at <hi>Theodore,</hi> would ſoon
have removed all obſtruction, if <hi>Theodore,</hi> who
took him for one of <hi>Manfred</hi>'s captains, and
who had no ſooner given the provocation than
prepared to ſupport it, had not received the
ſtroke on his ſhield. The valour that had ſo long
been ſmothered in his breaſt, broke forth at
once; he ruſhed impetuouſly on the Knight,
whoſe pride and wrath were not leſs power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
incentives to hardy deeds. The combat was
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:0507001200:134"/>
furious, but not long: <hi>Theodore</hi> wounded the
Knight in three ſeveral places, and at laſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed
him as he fainted with the loſs of blood.
The peaſant, who had fled at the firſt onſet,
had given the alarm to ſome of <hi>Manfred</hi>'s domeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics,
who by his orders were diſperſed through
the foreſt in purſuit of <hi>Iſabella.</hi> They came up
as the Knight fell, whom they ſoon diſcovered
to be the noble ſtranger. <hi>Theodore,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
his hatred to <hi>Manfred,</hi> could not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
the victory he had gained without emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of pity and generoſity: But he was
more touched, when he learned the quality of
his adverſary, and was informed that he was
no retainer, but an enemy of <hi>Manfred.</hi> He
aſſiſted the ſervants of the latter in diſarming
the Knight, and in endeavouring to ſtaunch the
blood that flowed from his wounds. The
Knight recovering his ſpeech, ſaid in a faint
and ſaltering voice, generous foe, we have both
been in an error: I took thee for an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the tyrant; I perceive thou haſt made
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:0507001200:135"/>
the like miſtake—it is too late for excuſes—I
faint—if <hi>Iſabella</hi> is at hand—call her—I have
important ſecrets to—He is dying! ſaid one
of the attendants; has nobody a cruciſix about
them? <hi>Andrea,</hi> do thou pray over him—fetch
ſome water, ſaid <hi>Theodore,</hi> and pour it down his
throat, while I haſten to the Princeſs—ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this, he flew to <hi>Iſabella,</hi> and in few words
told her modeſtly, that he had been ſo unfortu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nate
by miſtake as to wound a gentleman from
her father's court, who wiſhed e'er he died to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
ſomething of conſequence to her. The
Princeſs, who had been tranſported at hearing
the voice of <hi>Theodore</hi> as he called to her to come
forth, was aſtoniſhed at what ſhe heard. Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
herſelf to be conducted by <hi>Theodore,</hi> the
new proof of whoſe valour recalled her diſperſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſpirits, ſhe came where the bleeding Knight
lay ſpeechleſs on the ground—but her fears re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned,
when ſhe beheld the domeſtics of <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred.</hi>
She would again have fled, if <hi>Theodore</hi>
had not made her obſerve that they were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:0507001200:136"/>
and had not threatened them with inſtant
death, if they ſhould dare to ſeize the Princeſs.
The ſtranger, opening his eyes, and beholding
a woman, ſaid—art thou—pray tell me truly—
art thou <hi>Iſabella</hi> of <hi>Vicenza?</hi> I am; ſaid ſhe:
good heaven reſtore thee!—Then thou—
then thou—ſaid the Knight, ſtruggling for
utterance—ſeeſt—thy father—give me one—
oh! amaſement! horror! what do I hear!
what do I ſee! cried <hi>Iſabella.</hi> My father! you
my father! how came you here, Sir? for hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven's
ſake ſpeak!—oh! run for help, or he
will expire!—'Tis moſt true, ſaid the wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Knight, exerting all his force; I am <hi>Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ric</hi>
thy father—yes, I came to deliver thee—
It will not be—give me a parting kiſs, and
take—Sir, ſaid <hi>Theodore,</hi> do not exhauſt your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf:
ſuffer us to convey you to the caſtle—
to the caſtle! ſaid <hi>Iſabella</hi>; is there no help
nearer than the caſtle? would you expoſe my
father to the tyrant? if he goes thither, I
dare not accompany him—and yet, can I
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:0507001200:137"/>
leave him! my child, ſaid <hi>Frederic,</hi> it matters
not for me whither I am carried: A few mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes
will place me beyond danger—but while
I have eyes to doat on thee, forſake me not,
dear <hi>Iſabella!</hi> This brave Knight—I know not
who he is, will protect thy innocence—Sir,
you will not abandon my child, will you! <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore</hi>
ſhedding tears over his victim, and vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to guard the Princeſs at the expence of
his life, perſuaded <hi>Frederic</hi> to ſuffer himſelf to
be conducted to the caſtle. They placed him
on a horſe belonging to one of the domeſtics,
after binding up his wounds as well as they
were able. <hi>Theodore</hi> marched by his ſide;
and the afflicted <hi>Iſabella,</hi> who could not bear
to quit him, followed mournfully behind.</p>

               <p>THE ſorrowful troop no ſooner arrived at
the caſtle, than they were met by <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lita</hi>
and <hi>Matilda,</hi> whom <hi>Iſabella</hi> had ſent one of
the domeſtics before to advertiſe of their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach.
The Ladies cauſing <hi>Frederic</hi> to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed
into the neareſt chamber, retired, while
the ſurgeons examined his wounds. <hi>Matilda</hi>
bluſhed at ſeeing <hi>Theodore</hi> and <hi>Iſabella</hi> together;
but endeavoured to conceal it by embracing the
latter, and condoling with her on her father's
miſchance. The ſurgeons ſoon came to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
<hi>Hippolita</hi> that none of the Marquis's
wounds were dangerous; and that he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous
of ſeeing his daughter and the Princeſſes.
<hi>Theodore,</hi> under pretence of expreſſing his joy at
being freed from his apprehenſions of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat
being fatal to <hi>Frederic,</hi> could not reſiſt the
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:0507001200:139"/>
impulſe of following <hi>Matilda.</hi> Her eyes were
ſo often caſt down on meeting his, that <hi>Iſabella,</hi>
who regarded <hi>Theodore</hi> as attentively as he gazed
on <hi>Matilda,</hi> ſoon devined who the object was
that he had told her in the cave engaged his
affections. While this mute ſcene paſſed, <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polita</hi>
demanded of <hi>Frederic</hi> the cauſe of his hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
taken that myſterious courſe for reclaiming
his daughter; and threw in various apologies to
excuſe her Lord for the match contracted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
their children. <hi>Frederic.</hi> however in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed
againſt <hi>Manfred,</hi> was not inſenſible to
the courteſy and benevolence of <hi>Hippolita:</hi> But
he was ſtill more ſtruck with the lovely form of
<hi>Matilda.</hi> Wiſhing to detain them by his bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide,
he informed <hi>Hippolita</hi> of his ſtory. He
told her, that, while priſoner to the infidels, he
had dreamed that his daughter, of whom he
had learned no news ſince his captivity, was
detained in a caſtle, where ſhe was in danger of
the moſt dreadful misfortunes: And that if
he obtained his liberty, and repaired to a wood
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:0507001200:140"/>
near <hi>Joppa,</hi> he would learn more. Alarmed at
this dream, and incapable of obeying the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
given by it, his chains became more
grievous than ever. But while his thoughts
were occupied on the means of obtaining his
liberty, he received the agreeable news that the
confederate Princes, who were warring in <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtine,</hi>
had paid his ranſom. He inſtantly ſet
out for the wood that had been marked in his
dream. For three days he and his attendants
had wandered in the foreſt without ſeeing a
human form: But on the evening of the third
they came to a cell, in which they found a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable
hermit in the agonies of death. Apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
rich cordials, they brought the ſaint-like
man to his ſpeech. My ſons, ſaid he, I am
bounden to your charity—but it is in vain—I
am going to my eternal reſt—yet I die with the
ſatisfaction of performing the will of heaven.
When firſt I repaired to this ſolitude, after ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
my country become a prey to unbelievers—
it is alas! above fifty years ſince I was witneſs
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:0507001200:141"/>
to that dreadful ſcene! St. <hi>Nicholas</hi> appeared to
me, and revealed a ſecret, which he bad me
never reveal to mortal man, but on my death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed.
This is that tremendous hour, and ye are
no doubt the choſen warriors to whom I was
ordered to reveal my truſt. As ſoon as ye have
done the laſt offices to this wretched corſe, dig
under the ſeventh tree on the left-hand of this
poor cave, and your pains will—Oh! good
heaven receive my ſoul! With thoſe words the
devout man breathed his laſt. By break of day,
continued <hi>Frederic,</hi> when we had committed
the holy relicks to earth, we dug according to
direction—but what was our aſtoniſhment,
when about the depth of ſix feet we diſcovered
an enormous ſabre—the very weapon yonder
in the court. On the blade, which was then
partly out of the ſcabbard, though ſince cloſed
by our efforts in removing it, were written the
following lines—no; excuſe me, Madam,
added the Marquis, turning to <hi>Hippolita,</hi> if I
forbear to repeat them: I reſpect your ſex and
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:0507001200:142"/>
rank, and would not be guilty of offending your
ear with ſounds injurious to ought that is dear to
you—He pauſed. <hi>Hippolita</hi> trembled. She did
not doubt but <hi>Frederic</hi> was deſtined by heaven
to accompliſh the ſate that ſeemed to threaten
her houſe. Looking with anxious fondneſs at
<hi>Matilda,</hi> a ſilent tear ſtole down her cheek:
But recollecting herſelf, ſhe ſaid; proceed, my
Lord: Heaven does nothing in vain: Mortals
muſt receive its divine beheſts with lowlineſs
and ſubmiſſion. It is our part to deprecate its
wrath, or bow to its decrees. Repeat the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
my Lord; we liſten reſigned. <hi>Frederic</hi>
was grieved that he had proceeded ſo far. The
dignity and patient firmneſs of <hi>Hippolita</hi> pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated
him with reſpect, and the tender ſilent
affection with which the Princeſs and her daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
regarded each other, melted him almoſt to
tears. Yet apprehenſive that his forbearance to
obey, would be more alarming, he repeated in
a faltering and low voice the following lines:
<q>
                     <pb n="134" facs="tcp:0507001200:143"/>
                     <l>Where e'er a caſque that ſuits this ſword is found,</l>
                     <l>With perils is thy daughter compaſs'd round.</l>
                     <l>
                        <hi>Alfonſo</hi>'s blood alone can ſave the maid,</l>
                     <l>And quiet a long reſtleſs Prince's ſhade.</l>
                  </q>
What is there in theſe lines, ſaid <hi>Theodore</hi> impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently,
that affects theſe Princeſſes? why were
they to be ſhocked by a myſterious delicacy,
that has ſo little foundation? Your words are
rude, young man, ſaid the Marquis; and tho'
fortune has favoured you once—my honoured
Lord, ſaid <hi>Iſabella,</hi> who reſented <hi>Theodore</hi>'s
warmth, which ſhe perceived was dictated by
his ſentiments for <hi>Matilda,</hi> diſcompoſe not your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
for the gloſing of a peaſant's ſon: He for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets
the reverence he owes you; but he is not
accuſtomed—<hi>Hippolita,</hi> concerned at the heat
that had ariſen, checked <hi>Theodore</hi> for his bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
but with an air acknowledging his zeal;
and changing the converſation, demanded of
<hi>Frederic</hi> where he had left her Lord? As the
Marquis was going to reply, they heard a noiſe
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:0507001200:144"/>
without, and riſing to inquire the cauſe, <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred,</hi>
                  <hi>Jerome,</hi> and part of the troop, who had
met an imperfect rumour of what had happened,
entered the chamber. <hi>Manfred</hi> advanced haſtily
towards <hi>Frederic</hi>'s bed to condole with him on
his misfortune, and to learn the circumſtances
of the combat, when ſtarting in an agony of
terror and amazement, he cried, Ha! what art
thou? thou dreadful ſpectre! is my hour come?
—my deareſt, gracious Lord, cried <hi>Hippolita,</hi>
claſping him in her arms, what is it you ſee?
why do you fix your eye-balls thus!—What!
cried <hi>Manfred</hi> breathleſs—doſt thou ſee nothing,
<hi>Hippolita?</hi> is this ghaſtly phantom ſent to me
alone—to me, who did not—for mercy's
ſweeteſt ſelf, my Lord, ſaid <hi>Hippolita,</hi> reſume
your ſoul, command your reaſon. There is
none here, but us, your friends—what is not
that <hi>Alfonſo?</hi> cried <hi>Manfred<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>; Doſt thou not ſee
him? can it be my brain's delirium?—This!
my Lord, ſaid <hi>Hippolita</hi>; this is <hi>Theodore,</hi> the
youth who has been ſo unfortunate—<hi>Theodore!</hi>
                  <pb n="136" facs="tcp:0507001200:145"/>
ſaid <hi>Manfred</hi> mournfully, and ſtriking his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head
—<hi>Theodore,</hi> or a phantom, he has unhinged
the ſoul of <hi>Manfred</hi>—but how comes he here?
and how comes he in armour? I believe he went
in ſearch of <hi>Iſabella:</hi> Said <hi>Hippolita.</hi> Of <hi>Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella!</hi>
ſaid <hi>Manfred,</hi> relapſing into rage—yes,
yes, that is not doubtful—but how did he
eſcape from durance in which I left him? was
it <hi>Iſabella,</hi> or this hypocritical old Friar, that
procured his enlargement?—and would a parent
be criminal, my Lord, ſaid <hi>Theodore,</hi> if he me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditated
the deliverance of his child? <hi>Jerome</hi>
amazed to hear himſelf in a manner accuſed by
his ſon, and without foundation, knew not
what to think. He could not comprehend,
how <hi>Theodore</hi> had eſcaped, how he came to be
armed, and to encounter <hi>Frederic.</hi> Still he
would not venture to aſk any queſtions that
might tend to inflame <hi>Manfred</hi>'s wrath againſt
his ſon. <hi>Jerome</hi>'s ſilence convinced <hi>Manfred</hi>
that he had contrived <hi>Theodore</hi>'s releaſe—and is
it thus, thou ungrateful old man, ſaid the Prince
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:0507001200:146"/>
addreſſing himſelf to the Friar, that thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payeſt
mine and <hi>Hippolita</hi>'s bounties? And not
content with traverſing my heart's neareſt wiſhes,
thou armeſt thy baſtard, and bringeſt him into
my own caſtle to inſult me! My Lord, ſaid
<hi>Theodore,</hi> you wrong my father: Nor he nor I
are capable of harbouring a thought againſt
your peace. Is it inſolence thus to ſurrender
myſelf to your Highneſs's pleaſure? added he,
laying his ſword reſpectfully at <hi>Manfred</hi>'s feet.
Behold my boſom; ſtrike, my Lord, if you
ſuſpect that a diſloyal thought is lodged there.
There is not a ſentiment engraven on my heart,
that does not venerate you and yours. The
grace and fervour with which <hi>Theodore</hi> uttered
theſe words, intereſted every perſon preſent
in his favour. Even <hi>Manfred</hi> was touched—
yet ſtill poſſeſſed with his reſemblance to <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fonſo,</hi>
his admiration was daſhed with ſecret hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror.
Riſe; ſaid he; thy life is not my preſent
purpoſe.—But tell me thy hiſtory, and how
thou cameſt connected with this old traitor here.
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:0507001200:147"/>
My Lord, ſaid <hi>Jerome</hi> eagerly—peace? im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtor!
ſaid <hi>Manfred</hi>; I will not have him
prompted. My Lord, ſaid <hi>Theodore,</hi> I want no
aſſiſtance: My ſtory is very brief. I was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
at five years of age to <hi>Algiers</hi> with my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
who had been taken by corſairs from the
coaſt of <hi>Sicily.</hi> She died of grief in leſs than a
twelvemonth—the tears guſhed from <hi>Jerome</hi>'s
eyes, on whoſe countenance a thouſand anxious
paſſions ſtood expreſſed. Before ſhe died, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
<hi>Theodore,</hi> ſhe bound a writing about my
arm under my garments, which told me I was
the ſon of the Count <hi>Falconara</hi>—it is moſt true,
ſaid <hi>Jerome</hi>; I am that wretched father—again
I enjoin thee ſilence: ſaid <hi>Manfred:</hi> Proceed.
I remained in ſlavery, ſaid <hi>Theodore,</hi> until within
theſe two years, when attending on my maſter
in his cruizes, I was delivered by a Chriſtian
veſſel, which over-powered the pirate; and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering
myſelf to the captian, he generouſly
put me on ſhore in <hi>Sicily</hi>—but alas! inſtead
of finding a father, I learned that his eſtate,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:0507001200:148"/>
which was ſituated on the coaſt, had, during
his abſence, been laid waſte by the Rover, who
had carried my mother and me into captivity:
That his caſtle had been burnt to the ground,
and that my father on his return had ſold what
remained, and was retired into religion in the
kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> but where no man could
inform me. Deſtitute and friendleſs, hopleſs
almoſt of attaining the tranſport of a parent's
embrace, I took the firſt opportunity of ſetting
ſail for <hi>Naples,</hi> from whence, within theſe ſix
days, I wandered into this province, ſtill ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting
myſelf by the labour of my hands; nor
until yeſter-morn did I believe that heaven had
reſerved any lot for me but peace of mind and
contented poverty. This, my Lord, is <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore</hi>'s
ſtory. I am bleſſed beyond my hope in
finding a father; I am unfortunate beyond my
deſert in having incurred your Highneſs's diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure.
He ceaſed. A murmur of appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation
gently aroſe from the audience. This is
not all; ſaid <hi>Frederic:</hi> I am bound in honour
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:0507001200:149"/>
to add what he ſuppreſſes. Though he is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt,
I muſt be generous—he is one of the
braveſt youths on Chriſtian ground. He is
warm too; and from the ſhort knowledge I
have of him, I will pledge myſelf for his vera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city:
If what he reports of himſelf were not
true, he would not utter it—and for me, youth,
I honour a frankneſs which becomes thy birth.
But now, and thou didſt offend me: Yet the
noble blood which flows in thy vains, may well
be allowed to boil out, when it has ſo recently
traced itſelf to its ſource. Come, my Lord
[turning to <hi>Manfred]</hi> if I can pardon him,
ſurely you may: It is not the youth's fault, if
you took him for a ſpectre. This bitter taunt
galled the ſoul of <hi>Manfred.</hi> If beings from an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
world, replied he haughtily, have power
to impreſs my mind with awe, it is more than
living man can do; nor could a ſtripling's arm
—my Lord, interrupted <hi>Hippolita,</hi> your gueſt
has occaſion for repoſe: Shall we not leave him
to his reſt? Saying this, and taking <hi>Manfred</hi> by
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:0507001200:150"/>
the hand, ſhe took leave of <hi>Frederic,</hi> and led
the company forth. The Prince, not ſorry to
quit a converſation, which recalled to mind the
diſcovery he had made of his moſt ſecret ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
ſuffered himſelf to be conducted to his
own apartment, after permitting <hi>Theodore,</hi> tho'
under engagement to return to the caſtle on the
morrow [a condition the young man gladly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted]
to retire with his father to the convent.
<hi>Matilda</hi> and <hi>Iſabella</hi> were too much occupied
with their own reflections, and too little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
with each other, to wiſh for farther con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
that night. They ſeparated each to her
chamber, with more expreſſions of ceremony
and fewer of affection, than had paſſed between
them ſince their childhood.</p>
               <p>If they parted with ſmall cordiality, they did
but meet with greater impatience, as ſoon as the
ſun was riſen. Their minds were in a ſituation
that excluded ſleep, and each recollected a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
queſtions which ſhe wiſhed ſhe had put to
the other overnight. <hi>Matilda</hi> reflected that <hi>Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella</hi>
                  <pb n="142" facs="tcp:0507001200:151"/>
had been twice delivered by <hi>Theodore</hi> in very
critical ſituations, which ſhe could not believe
accidental. His eyes, it was true, had been fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on her in <hi>Frederic</hi>'s chamber; but that might
have been to diſguiſe his paſſion for <hi>Iſabella</hi> from
the fathers of both. It were better to clear
this up—She wiſhed to know the truth, leſt
ſhe ſhould wrong her friend by entertaining a
paſſion for <hi>Iſabella</hi>'s lover. Thus jealouſy prompt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and at the ſame time borrowed an excuſe
from friendſhip to juſtify its curioſity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iſabella,</hi> not leſs reſtleſs, had better founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for her ſuſpicions. Both <hi>Theodore</hi>'s tongue
and eyes had told her his heart was engaged—
it was true—yet perhaps <hi>Matilda</hi> might not cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpond
to his paſſion—ſhe had ever appeared
inſenſible to love: All her thoughts were ſet
on heaven—why did I diſſuade her? ſaid <hi>Iſabella</hi>
to herſelf: I am puniſhed for my generoſity—
but when did they meet? where?—it cannot
be: I have deceived myſelf—perhaps laſt night
was the firſt time they ever beheld each other
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:0507001200:152"/>
—it muſt be ſome other object that has prepoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed
his affections—if it is, I am not ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy,
as I thought; if it is not my friend
<hi>Matilda</hi>—how! can I ſtoop to wiſh for the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of a man, who rudely and unneceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
acquainted me with his indifference? and
that at the very moment in which common
courteſy demanded at leaſt expreſſions of civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.
I will go to my dear <hi>Matilda,</hi> who will
confirm me in this becoming pride—man is
falſe—I will adviſe with her on taking the veil:
She will rejoice to find me in this diſpoſition;
and I will acquaint her that I no longer oppoſe
her inclination for the cloyſter. In this frame
of mind, and determined to open her heart en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
to <hi>Matilda,</hi> ſhe went to that Princeſs's
chamber, whom ſhe found already dreſled, and
leaning penſively on her arm. This attitude, ſo
correſpondent to what ſhe felt herſelf, revived
<hi>Iſabella</hi>'s ſuſpicions, and deſtroyed the confidence
ſhe had purpoſed to place in her friend. They
bluſhed at meeting, and were too much no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:0507001200:153"/>
to diſguiſe their ſenſations with addreſs.
After ſome unmeaning queſtions and replies,
<hi>Matilda</hi> demanded of <hi>Iſabella</hi> the cauſe of her
flight? the latter, who had almoſt forgotten
<hi>Manfred</hi>'s paſſion, ſo entirely was ſhe occupied
by her own, concluding that <hi>Matilda</hi> referred to
her laſt eſcape from the convent, which had oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned
the events of the preceding evening,
replied, <hi>Martelli</hi> brought word to the convent
that your mother was dead—oh! ſaid <hi>Matilda</hi>
interrupting her, <hi>Bianca</hi> has explained that miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
to me: on ſeeing me faint, ſhe cried out,
the Princeſs is dead! and <hi>Martelli</hi> who had come
for the uſual dole to the caſtle—and what made
you faint? ſaid <hi>Iſabella,</hi> indifferent to the reſt.
<hi>Matilda</hi> bluſhed, and ſtammered—my father—
he was ſitting in judgment on a criminal—
what criminal? ſaid <hi>Iſabella</hi> eagerly—a young
man; ſaid <hi>Matilda</hi>—I believe—I think it was that
young man that—what, <hi>Theodore?</hi> ſaid <hi>Iſabella.</hi>
Yes; anſwered ſhe; I never ſaw him before;
I do not know how he had offended my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:0507001200:154"/>
—but as he has been of ſervice to you, I
am glad my Lord has pardoned him—ſerved
me? replied <hi>Iſabella</hi>; do you term it ſerving me,
to wound my father, and almoſt occaſion his
death! Though it is but ſince yeſterday that I
am bleſſed with knowing a parent, I hope <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilda</hi>
does not think I am ſuch a ſtranger to
filial tenderneſs as not to reſent the boldneſs of
that audacious youth, and that it is impoſſible
for me ever to feel any affection for one who
dared to lift his arm againſt the author of
my being. No, <hi>Matilda,</hi> my heart abhors him;
and if you ſtill retain the friendſhip for me that
you have vowed from your infancy, you will
deteſt a man who has been on the point of
making me miſerable for ever. <hi>Matilda</hi> held
down her head, and replied; I hope my dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
<hi>Iſabella</hi> does not doubt her <hi>Matilda</hi>'s friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip:
I never beheld that youth until yeſterday;
he is almoſt a ſtranger to me: But as the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons
have pronounced your father out of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
you ought not to harbour uncharitable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:0507001200:155"/>
againſt one, who I am perſuaded did
not know the Marquis was related to you.
You plead his cauſe very pathetically, ſaid <hi>Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella,</hi>
conſidering he is ſo much a ſtranger to you!
I am miſtaken, or he returns your charity. What
mean you? ſaid <hi>Matilda.</hi> Nothing: Said <hi>Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella,</hi>
repenting that ſhe had given <hi>Matilda</hi> a hint
of <hi>Theodore</hi>'s inclination for her. Then chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the diſcourſe, ſhe aſked <hi>Matilda</hi> what occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned
<hi>Manfred</hi> to take <hi>Theodore</hi> for a ſpectre?
Bleſs me, ſaid <hi>Matilda,</hi> did not you obſerve
his extreme reſemblance to the portrait of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fonſo</hi>
in the gallery? I took notice of it to <hi>Bianca</hi>
even before I ſaw him in armour; but with the
helmet on, he is the very image of that picture.
I do not much obſerve pictures; ſaid <hi>Iſabella:</hi>
Much leſs have I examined this young man ſo
attentively as you ſeem to have done—ah!
<hi>Matilda,</hi> your heart is in danger—but let me
warn you as a friend—he has owned to me that
he is in love; it cannot be with you, for yeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terday
was the firſt time you ever met—was
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:0507001200:156"/>
it not? certainly: replied <hi>Matilda</hi>; but why
does my deareſt <hi>Iſabella</hi> conclude from any thing
I have ſaid, that—ſhe pauſed—then continuing;
he ſaw you firſt, and I am far from having the
vanity to thing that my little portion of charms
could engage a heart devoted to you—may you
be happy, <hi>Iſabella,</hi> whatever is the fate of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilda!</hi>
My lovely friend, ſaid <hi>Iſabella,</hi> whoſe
heart was too honeſt to reſiſt a kind expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
it is you that <hi>Theodore</hi> admires; I ſaw it;
I am perſuaded of it; nor ſhall a thought of my
own happineſs ſuffer me to interfere with yours.
This frankneſs drew tears from the gentle <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilda</hi>;
and jealouſy that for a moment had raiſed
a coolneſs between theſe amiable maidens, ſoon
gave way to the natural ſincerity and candour
of their ſouls. Each confeſſed to the other the
impreſſion that <hi>Theodore</hi> had made on her; and
this confidence was followed by a ſtruggle of
generoſity, each inſiſting on yielding her claim
to her friend. At length, the dignity of <hi>Iſabel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la</hi>'s
virtue reminding her of the preference which
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:0507001200:157"/>
                  <hi>Theodore</hi> had almoſt declared for her rival, made
her determine to conquer her paſſion, and cede
the beloved object to her friend.</p>
               <p>During this conteſt of amity, <hi>Hippolita</hi> enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
her daughter's chamber. Madam, ſaid ſhe
to <hi>Iſabella,</hi> you have ſo much tenderneſs for
<hi>Matilda,</hi> and intereſt yourſelf ſo kindly in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
affects our wretched houſe, that I can have
no ſecrets with my child, which are not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
for you to hear. The Princeſſes were all
attention and anxiety. Know then, Madam,
continued <hi>Hippolita,</hi> and you, my deareſt <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilda,</hi>
that being convinced by all the events of
theſe two laſt ominous days, that heaven pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes
the ſceptre of <hi>Otranto</hi> ſhuld paſs from
<hi>Manfred</hi>'s hands into thoſe of the Marquis <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deric,</hi>
I have been perhaps inſpired with the
thought of averting our total deſtruction by the
union of our rival houſes. With this view I
have been propoſing to <hi>Manfred</hi> my Lord to ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
this dear, dear child to <hi>Frederic</hi> your father
—me to lord <hi>Frederic!</hi> cried <hi>Matilda</hi>—good hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens!
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:0507001200:158"/>
my gracious mother—and have you nam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it to my father? I have: Said <hi>Hippolita:</hi>
He liſtened benignly to my propoſal, and is
gone to break it to the Marquis. Ah! wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Princeſs! cried <hi>Iſabella</hi>; what haſt thou done!
what ruin has thy inadvertent goodneſs been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
for thyſelf, for me, and for <hi>Matilda!</hi>
Ruin from me to you and to my child! ſaid
<hi>Hippolita</hi>; what can this mean? Alas! ſaid
<hi>Iſabella,</hi> the purity of your own heart prevents
your ſeeing the depravity of others. <hi>Manfred,</hi>
your Lord, that impious man—hold; ſaid
<hi>Hippolita,</hi> you muſt not in my preſence, young
lady, mention <hi>Manfred</hi> with diſreſpect: He is
my lord and huſband, and—will not long be ſo,
ſaid <hi>Iſabella,</hi> if his wicked purpoſes can be carried
into execution. This language amazes me;
ſaid <hi>Hippolita.</hi> Your feeling, <hi>Iſabella,</hi> is warm;
but until this hour I never knew it betray you
into intemperance. What deed of <hi>Manfred</hi> au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorizes
you to treat him as a murderer, an
aſſaſſin? Thou virtuous, and too credulous Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs!
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:0507001200:159"/>
replied <hi>Iſabella</hi>; it is not thy life he aims
at—it is to ſeparate himſelf from thee! to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce
thee! to—to divorce me! to divorce
my mother! cried <hi>Hippolita</hi> and <hi>Matilda</hi> at once
—yes; ſaid <hi>Iſabella</hi>; and to compleat his crime,
he meditates—I cannot ſpeak it! What can
ſurpaſs what thou haſt already uttered? ſaid
<hi>Matilda. Hippolita</hi> was ſilent. Grief choaked
her ſpeech; and the recollection of <hi>Manfred</hi>'s
late ambiguous diſcourſes confirmed what ſhe
heard. Excellent, dear Lady! Madam! Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther!
cried <hi>Iſabella,</hi> flinging herſelf at <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polita</hi>'s
feet in a tranſport of paſſion; truſt me,
believe me, I will die a thouſand deaths ſooner
than conſent to injure you, than yield to ſo odious
—oh!—This is too much! cried <hi>Hippolita:</hi>
What crimes does one crime ſuggeſt! riſe, dear
<hi>Iſabella</hi>; I do not doubt your virtue. Oh! <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilda,</hi>
this ſtroke is too heavy for thee! weep
not, my child; and not a murmur, I charge
thee. Remember, he is <hi>thy</hi> father ſtill!—but
you are my mother too; ſaid <hi>Matilda</hi> ſervently;
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:0507001200:160"/>
and <hi>you</hi> are virtuous, <hi>you</hi> are guiltleſs!—Oh!
muſt not I, muſt not I complain? You muſt
not: Said <hi>Hippolita</hi>—come, all will yet be well.
<hi>Manfred,</hi> in the agony for the loſs of thy bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
knew not what he ſaid: perhaps <hi>Iſabella</hi>
miſunderſtood him: His heart is good—and,
my child, thou knoweſt not all! There is a
deſtiny hangs over us; the hand of Providence
is ſtretched out—Oh! could I but ſave thee
from the wreck!—yes, continued ſhe in a
firmer tone; perhaps the ſacrifice of myſelf may
atone for all—I will go and offer myſelf to this
divorce—it boots not what becomes of me. I
will withdraw into the neighbouring monaſtery,
and waſte the remainder of life in prayers and
tears for my child and—the Prince! Thou
art as much too good for this world, ſaid <hi>Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella,</hi>
as <hi>Manfred</hi> is execrable—but think not,
Lady, that thy weakneſs ſhall determine for
me. I ſwear, hear me all ye angels—ſtop, I
adjure thee; cried <hi>Hippolita:</hi> Remember thou
doſt not depend on thyſelf; thou haſt a father
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:0507001200:161"/>
—my father is too pious, too noble, interrupted
<hi>Iſabella,</hi> to command an impious deed. But
ſhould he command it; can a father enjoin a
curſed act? I was contracted to the ſon? can
I wed the father?—no, Madam, no; force
ſhould not drag me to <hi>Manfred</hi>'s hated bed. I
loath him, I abhor him: Divine and human
laws forbid—and my friend, my deareſt <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilda!</hi>
would I wound her tender ſoul by injuring
her adored mother? my own mother—I never
have known another—Oh! ſhe is the mother of
both! cried <hi>Matilda:</hi> Can we, can we, <hi>Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella,</hi>
adore her too much? My lovely children,
ſaid the touched <hi>Hippolita,</hi> your tenderneſs over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powers
me—but I muſt not give way to it. It
is not ours to make election for ourſelves: Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
our fathers, and our huſbands muſt decide
for us. Have patience until you hear what
<hi>Manfred</hi> and <hi>Frederic</hi> have determined. If the
Marquis accepts <hi>Matilda</hi>'s hand, I know ſhe
will readily obey. Heaven may interpoſe and
prevent the reſt. What means my child? con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:0507001200:162"/>
ſhe, ſeeing <hi>Matilda</hi> fall at her feet with a
flood of ſpeechleſs tears—but no; anſwer
me not, my daughter: I muſt not hear a word
againſt the pleaſure of thy father. Oh! doubt
not my obedience, my dreadful obedience to him
and to you! ſaid <hi>Matilda.</hi> But can I, moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected
of women, can I experience all this ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs,
this world of goodneſs, and conceal a
thought from the beſt of mothers? What art
thou going to utter? ſaid <hi>Iſabella</hi> trembling.
Recollect thyſelf, <hi>Matilda.</hi> No, <hi>Iſabella,</hi> ſaid
the Princeſs, I ſhould not deſerve this incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
parent, if the inmoſt receſſes of my ſoul
harboured a thought without her permiſſion—
nay, I have offended her; I have ſuffered a
paſſion to enter my heart without her avowal—
but here I diſclaim it; here I vow to heaven
and her—My child! my child! ſaid <hi>Hippolita,</hi>
what words are theſe! what new calamities has
fate in ſtore for us! Thou, a paſſion! Thou,
in this hour of deſtruction—Oh! I ſee all my
guilt! ſaid <hi>Matilda.</hi> I abhor myſelf, if I coſt
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:0507001200:163"/>
my mother a pang. She is the deareſt thing I
have on earth—oh! I will never, never behold
him more! <hi>Iſabella,</hi> ſaid <hi>Hippolita,</hi> thou art con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious
to this unhappy ſecret, whatever it is.
Speak—what! cried <hi>Matilda,</hi> have I ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited
my mother's love, that ſhe will not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
me even to ſpeak my own guilt? oh! wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
wretched <hi>Matilda!</hi> Thou art too cruel;
ſaid <hi>Iſabella</hi> to <hi>Hippolita:</hi> Canſt thou behold this
anguiſh of a virtuous mind, and not commiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
it? Not pity my child! ſaid <hi>Hippolita,</hi>
catching <hi>Matilda</hi> in her arms—Oh! I know
ſhe is good, ſhe is all virtue, all tenderneſs,
and duty. I do forgive thee, my excellent, my
only hope! The Princeſſes then revealed to
<hi>Hippolita</hi> their mutual inclination for <hi>Theodore,</hi>
and the purpoſe of <hi>Iſabella</hi> to reſign him to <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilda.
Hippolita</hi> blamed their imprudence, and
ſhewed them the improbability that either father
would conſent to beſtow his heireſs on ſo poor
a man, though nobly born. Some comfort it
gave her to find their paſſion of ſo recent a date,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:0507001200:164"/>
and that <hi>Theodore</hi> had had but little cauſe to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
it in either. She ſtrictly enjoined them to
avoid all correſpondence with him. This <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilda</hi>
ſervently promiſed: But <hi>Iſabella,</hi> who flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
herſelf that ſhe meant no more than to
promote his union with her friend, could not
determine to avoid him; and made no reply. I
will go to the convent, ſaid <hi>Hippolita,</hi> and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
new maſſes to be ſaid for a deliverance
from theſe calamities.—Oh! my mother, ſaid
<hi>Matilda,</hi> you mean to quit us: You mean to
take ſanctuary, and to give my father an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
of purſuing his fatal intention. Alas!
on my knees I ſupplicate you to forbear—
will you leave me a prey to <hi>Frederic?</hi> I will
follow you to the convent—Be at peace, my
child: ſaid <hi>Hippolita:</hi> I will return inſtantly.
I will never abandon thee, until I know it is the
will of heaven, and for thy benefit. Do not
deceive me: ſaid <hi>Matilda.</hi> I will not marry
<hi>Frederic</hi> until thou commandeſt it—Alas! What
will become of me? Why that exclamation?
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:0507001200:165"/>
ſaid <hi>Hippolita.</hi> I have promiſed thee to return
—ah! my mother, replied <hi>Matilda,</hi> ſtay
and ſave me from myſelf. A frown from
thee can do more than all my father's ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.
I have given away my heart, and you
alone can make me recal it. No more: Said
<hi>Hippolita:</hi> thou muſt not relapſe, <hi>Metilda.</hi> I
can quit <hi>Theodore,</hi> ſaid ſhe, but muſt I wed
another? let me attend thee to the altar, and
ſhut myſelf from the world for ever. Thy fate
depends on thy father; ſaid <hi>Hippolita:</hi> I have
ill beſtowed my tenderneſs, if it has taught thee
to revere aught beyond him. Adieu! my child:
I go to pray for thee.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hippolita</hi>'s real purpoſe was to demand of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome,</hi>
whether in conſcience ſhe might not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
to the divorce. She had oft urged <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred</hi>
to reſign the principality, which the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy
of her conſcience rendered an hourly bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
to her. Theſe ſcruples concurred to make
the ſeparation from her huſband appear leſs
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:0507001200:166"/>
dreadful to her, than it would have ſeemed
in any other ſituation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jerome,</hi> at quitting the caſtle overnight, had
queſtioned <hi>Theodore</hi> ſeverely why he had accuſed
him to <hi>Manfred</hi> of being privy to his eſcape.
<hi>Theodore</hi> owned it had been with deſign to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
<hi>Manfred</hi>'s ſuſpicion from alighting on <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilda</hi>;
and added, the holineſs of <hi>Jerome</hi>'s life
and character ſecured him from the tyrant's
wrath. <hi>Jerome</hi> was heartily grieved to diſcover
his ſon's inclination for that Princeſs; and leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him to his reſt; promiſed in the morning
to acquaint him with important reaſons for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering
his paſſion. <hi>Theodore,</hi> like <hi>Iſabella,</hi> was
too recently acquainted with parental authority
to ſubmit to its deciſions againſt the impulſe of
his heart. He had little curioſity to learn the
Friar's reaſons, and leſs diſpoſition to obey
them. The lovely <hi>Matilda</hi> had made ſtronger
impreſſions on him than filial affection. All
night he pleaſed himſelf with viſions of love;
and it was not till late after the morning-office,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:0507001200:167"/>
that he recollected the Friar's commands to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
him at <hi>Alfonſo</hi>'s tomb.</p>
               <p>Young man, ſaid <hi>Jerome,</hi> when he ſaw him,
this tardineſs does not pleaſe me. Have a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
commands already ſo little weight? <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore</hi>
made awkward excuſes, and attributed his
delay to having overſlept himſelf. And on
whom were thy dreams employed? ſaid the
Friar ſternly. His ſon bluſhed. Come, come,
reſumed the Friar, inconſiderate youth, this
muſt not be: Eradicate this guilty paſſion from
thy breaſt—guilty paſſion! cried <hi>Theodore:</hi> Can
guilt dwell with innocent beauty and virtuous
modeſty? It is ſinful, replied the Friar, to che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh
thoſe whom heaven has doomed to deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
A tyrant's race muſt be ſwept from the
earth to the third and fourth generation. Will
heaven viſit the innocent for the crimes of the
guilty? ſaid <hi>Theodore.</hi> The fair <hi>Matilda</hi> has
virtues enough—to undo thee: Interrupted <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome.</hi>
Haſt thou ſo ſoon forgotten that twice
the ſavage <hi>Manfred</hi> has pronounced thy ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence?
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:0507001200:168" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Nor have I forgotten, Sir, ſaid <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore,</hi>
that the charity of his daughter delivered
me from his power. I can forget injuries, but
never benefits. The injuries thou haſt received
from <hi>Manfred</hi>'s race, ſaid the Friar, are beyond
what thou canſt conceive.—Reply not, but view
this holy image! Beneath this marble monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
reſt the aſhes of the good <hi>Alfonſo</hi>; a
Prince adorned with every virtue: The father
of his people! the delight of mankind! Kneel,
head ſtrong boy, and liſt, while a father un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folds
a ſtate of horror, that will expel every
ſentiment from thy ſoul, but ſenſations of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
vengeance—<hi>Alfonſo!</hi> much-injured Prince!
let thy unſatisfied ſhade ſit awful on the troubled
air, while theſe trembling lips—ha! who comes
there?—The moſt wretched of women! ſaid
<hi>Hippolita,</hi> entering the choir. Good Father,
art thou at leiſure?—but why this kneeling
youth? what means the horror imprinted on
each countenance? why at this venerable tomb
—alas! haſt thou ſeen aught? We were pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:0507001200:169"/>
forth our oriſons to heaven, replied the
Friar with ſome confuſion, to put an end to the
woes of this deplorable province. Join with us,
Lady! thy ſpotleſs ſoul may obtain an exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from the judgments which the portents of
theſe days but too ſpeakingly denounce againſt
thy houſe. I pray ſervently to heaven to divert
them: ſaid the pious Princeſs. Thou knoweſt
it has been the occupation of my life to wreſt a
bleſſing for my Lord and my harmleſs children—
One alas! is taken from me! would heaven but
hear me for my poor <hi>Matilda!</hi> Father! inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede
for her!—Every heart will bleſs her: Cried
<hi>Theodore</hi> with rapture—Be dumb, raſh youth!
ſaid <hi>Jerome.</hi> And thou fond Princeſs contend
not with the Powers above! The Lord giveth,
and the Lord taketh away: Bleſs his holy
name, and ſubmit to his decrees. I do moſt
devoutly: Said <hi>Hippolita:</hi> But will he not ſpare
my only comfort? muſt <hi>Matilda</hi> periſh too?—
ah! Father, I came—but diſmiſs thy ſon. No
ear but thine muſt hear what I have to utter.
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:0507001200:170"/>
May heaven grant thy every wiſh, moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Princeſs! ſaid <hi>Theodore</hi> retiring. <hi>Jerome</hi>
frowned.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hippolita</hi> then acquainted the Friar with the
propoſal ſhe had ſuggeſted to <hi>Manfred,</hi> his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation
of it, and the tender of <hi>Matilda</hi> that
he was gone to make to <hi>Frederic. Jerome</hi> could
not conceal his diſlike of the motion, which he
covered under pretence of the improbability that
<hi>Frederic,</hi> the neareſt of blood to <hi>Alfonſo,</hi> and
who was come to claim his ſucceſſion, would
yield to an alliance with the uſurper of his right.
But nothing could equal the perplexity of the
Friar, when <hi>Hippolita</hi> confeſſed her readineſs
not to oppoſe the ſeparation, and demanded his
opinion on the legality of her acquieſcence.
The Friar catched eagerly at her requeſt of his
advice, and without explaining his averſion to
the propoſed marriage of <hi>Manfred</hi> and <hi>Iſabella,</hi>
he painted to <hi>Hippolita</hi> in the moſt alarming
colours the ſinfulneſs of her conſent, denounced
judgments againſt her if ſhe complied, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:0507001200:171"/>
her in the ſevereſt terms to treat any
ſuch propoſition with every mark of indignation
and refuſal.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Manfred,</hi> in the mean time, had broken his
purpoſe to <hi>Frederic,</hi> and propoſed the double
marriage. That weak Prince, who had been
ſtruck with the charms of <hi>Matilda,</hi> liſtened but
too eagerly to the offer. He forgot his enmity
to <hi>Manfred,</hi> whom he ſaw but little hope of
diſpoſſeſſing by force; and flattering himſelf that
no iſſue might ſucceed from the union of his
daughter with the Tyrant, he looked upon his
own ſucceſſion to the principality as facilitated
by wedding <hi>Matilda.</hi> He made faint oppoſition
to the propoſal; affecting, for form only, not
to acquieſce unleſs <hi>Hippolita</hi> ſhould conſent to
the divorce. <hi>Manfred</hi> took that upon himſelf.
Tranſported with his ſucceſs, and impatient to
ſee himſelf in a ſituation to expect ſons, he
haſtened to his wife's apartment, determined to
extort her compliance. He learned with indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
that ſhe was abſent at the convent. His
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:0507001200:172"/>
guilt ſuggeſted to him that ſhe had proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
been informed by <hi>Iſabella</hi> of his purpoſe.
He doubted whether her retirement to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
did not import an intention of remaining
there, until ſhe could raiſe obſtacles to their
divorce; and the ſuſpicions he had already en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained
of <hi>Jerome,</hi> made him apprehend that
the Friar would not only traverſe his views, but
might have inſpired <hi>Hippolita</hi> with the reſolution
of taking ſanctuary. Impatient to unravel this
clue, and to defeat its ſucceſs, <hi>Manfred</hi> haſtened
to the convent, and arrived there, as the Friar
was earneſtly exhorting the Princeſs never to
yield to the divorce.</p>
               <p>Madam, ſaid <hi>Manfred,</hi> what buſineſs drew
you hither? why did you not await my return
from the Marquis? I came to implore a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
on your councils: Replied <hi>Hippolita.</hi> My
councils do not need a Friar's intervention:
Said <hi>Manfred</hi>—and of all men living is that
hoary traitor the only one whom you delight to
confer with? Proſane Prince! ſaid <hi>Jerome</hi>; is
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:0507001200:173"/>
it at the altar that thou chuſeſt to inſult the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
of the altar?—but, <hi>Manfred,</hi> thy impious
ſchemes are known. Heaven and this virtuous
Lady know them—nay, frown not, Prince.
The church deſpiſes thy menaces. Her thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
will be heard above thy wrath. Dare to
proceed in thy curſt purpoſe of a divorce, until
her ſentence be known, and here I lance her
Anathema at thy head. Audacious rebel! ſaid
<hi>Manfred,</hi> endeavouring to conceal the awe with
which the Friar's words inſpired him; Doſt
thou preſume to threaten th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> lawful Prince?
Thou art no lawful Prince; ſaid <hi>Jerome</hi>; thou
art no Prince—go, diſcuſs thy claim with <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deric</hi>;
and when that is done—it is done:
Replied <hi>Manfred: Frederic</hi> accepts <hi>Matilda</hi>'s
hand, and is content to wave his claim, unleſs
I have no male iſſue—as he ſpoke thoſe words,
three drops of blood fell from the noſe of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fonſo</hi>'s
ſtatue. <hi>Manfred</hi> turned pale, and the
Princeſs ſunk on her knees. Behold! ſaid the
Friar; mark this miraculous indication that the
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:0507001200:174"/>
blood of <hi>Alfonſo</hi> will never mix with that of
<hi>Manfred!</hi> My gracious Lord, ſaid <hi>Hippolita,</hi>
let us ſubmit ourſelves to heaven. Think not
thy ever obedient wiſe rebels againſt thy autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.
I have no will but that of my Lord and
the church. To that revere<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

apply. It does not depend on us to burſt the
bonds that unite us. If the church ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
the diſſolution of our marriage, be it ſo
—I have but few years, and thoſe of ſorrow to
paſs. Where can they be worn away ſo well
as at the foot of this altar, in prayers for thine
and <hi>Matilda</hi>'s ſafety?—but thou ſhalt not remain
here until then: Said <hi>Manfred.</hi> Repair with me
to the caſtle, and there I will adviſe on the
proper meaſures for a divorce;—but this med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dling
Friar comes not thither: My hoſpitable
roof ſhall never more harbour a traitor—and
for thy Reverence's offspring, continued he, I
baniſh him from my dominions. He, I ween,
is no ſacred perſonage, nor under the protection
of the church. Whoever weds <hi>Iſabella,</hi> it ſhall
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:0507001200:175"/>
not be Father <hi>Falconara</hi>'s ſtarted-up ſon. They
ſtart up, ſaid the Friar, who are ſuddenly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
in the ſeat of lawful Princes; but they
wither away like the graſs, and their place
knows them no more. <hi>Manfred</hi> caſting a look
of ſcorn at the Friar, led <hi>Hippolita</hi> forth; but
at the door of the church, whiſpered one of his
attendants to remain concealed about the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent,
and bring him inſtant notice, if any one
from the caſtle ſhould repair thither.</p>

               <p>EVERY reflection which <hi>Manfred</hi> made on

Prince even ſuſpected that the Friar depended
on ſome ſecret ſupport from <hi>Frederic,</hi> whoſe ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:0507001200:176"/>
coinciding with the novel appearance of
<hi>Theodore</hi> ſeemed to beſpeak a correſpondence.
Still more was he troubled with the reſemblance
of <hi>Theodore</hi> to <hi>Alfonſo</hi>'s portrait. The latter he
knew had unqueſtionably died without iſſue.
<hi>Frederic</hi> had conſented to beſtow <hi>Iſabella</hi> on him.
Theſe contradictions agitated his mind with
numberleſs pangs. He ſaw but two methods of
extricating himſelf from his difficulties. The
one was to reſign his dominions to the Marquis
—Pride, ambition, and his reliance on an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
prophecies, which had pointed out a poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility
of his preſerving them to his poſterity,
combated that thought. The other was to
preſs his marriage with <hi>Iſabella.</hi> After long ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minating
on theſe anxious thoughts, as he
marched ſilently with <hi>Hippolita</hi> to the caſtle, he
at laſt diſcourſed with that Princeſs on the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of his diſquiet, and uſed every inſinuating
and plauſible argument to extract her conſent
to, even her promiſe of promoting the divorce.
<hi>Hippolita</hi> needed little perſuaſion to bend her to
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:0507001200:177"/>
his pleaſure. She endeavoured to win him over
to the meaſure of reſigning his dominions; but
finding her exhortations fruitleſs, ſhe aſſured
him, that as far as her conſcience would allow,
ſhe would raiſe no oppoſition to a ſeparation,
though without better founded ſcruples than
what he yet alledged, ſhe would not engage to
be active in demanding it.</p>
               <p>This compliance, though inadequate, was
ſufficient to raiſe <hi>Manfred</hi>'s hopes. He truſted
that his power and wealth would eaſily advance
his ſuit at the court of <hi>Rome,</hi> whither he reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to engage <hi>Frederic</hi> to take a journey on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.
That Prince had diſcovered ſo much paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
for <hi>Matilda,</hi> that <hi>Manfred</hi> hoped to obtain
all he wiſhed by holding out or withdrawing his
daughter's charms, according as the Marquis
ſhould appear more or leſs diſpoſed to co-operate
in his views. Even the abſence of <hi>Frederic</hi>
would be a material point gained, until he could
take farther meaſures for his ſecurity.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="169" facs="tcp:0507001200:178"/>
Diſmiſſing <hi>Hippolita</hi> to her apartment, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired
to that of the Marquis; but croſſing the
great hall through which he was to paſs, he
met <hi>Bianca.</hi> That damſel he knew was in the
confidence of both the young Ladies. It imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
occurred to him to ſift her on the ſubject
of <hi>Iſabella</hi> and <hi>Theodore.</hi> Calling her aſide into
the receſs of the oriel window of the hall, and
ſoothing her with many fair words and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes,
he demanded of her whether ſhe knew
ought of the ſtate of <hi>Iſabella</hi>'s affections. I!
my Lord! no, my Lord—yes, my Lord—
poor Lady! ſhe is wonderfully alarmed about
her father's wounds; but I tell her he will do
well, don't your Highneſs think ſo? I do not
aſk you, replied <hi>Manfred,</hi> what ſhe thinks about
her father: But you are in her ſecrets: Come,
be a good girl and tell me; is there any young
man—ha!—you underſtand me—Lord bleſs
me! underſtand your Highneſs, no, not I: I
told her a few vulnerary herbs and repoſe—I
am not talking, replied the Prince impatiently,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:0507001200:179"/>
about her father: I know he will do well—
Bleſs me, I rejoice to hear your Highneſs ſay
ſo; for though I thought it not right to let my
young Lady deſpond, methought his Greatneſs
had a wan look, and a ſomething—I remember
when young <hi>Ferdinand</hi> was wounded by the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netian</hi>
—Thou anſwereſt from the point, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted
<hi>Manfred</hi>; but here, take this jewel,
perhaps that may fix thy attention—nay, no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verences;
my favour ſhall not ſtop here—
come, tell me truly; how ſtands <hi>Iſabella</hi>'s heart.
Well! your Highneſs has ſuch a way! ſaid
<hi>Bianca</hi>—to be ſure—but can your Highneſs
keep a ſecret? if it ſhould ever come out of
your lips—it ſhall not, it ſhall not: Cried
<hi>Manfred</hi>—nay, but ſwear, your Highneſs—by
my halidame, if it ſhould ever be known that
I ſaid it—why, truth is truth, I do not think
my Lady <hi>Iſabella</hi> ever much affectioned my
young Lord your Son—yet he was a ſweet
youth as one ſhould ſee—I am ſure, if I had
been a Princeſs—but bleſs me! I muſt attend
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:0507001200:180"/>
my Lady <hi>Matilda</hi>; ſhe will marvel what is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
of me—ſtay; cried <hi>Manfred,</hi> thou haſt
not ſatisfied my queſtion. Haſt thou ever car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
any meſſage, any letter—I! good gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious!
cried <hi>Bianca</hi>; I carry a letter? I would
not to be a Queen. I hope your Highneſs
thinks, though I am poor, I am honeſt—did
your Highneſs never hear what Count <hi>Marſigli</hi>
offered me, when he came a wooing to my
Lady <hi>Matilda?</hi> I have not leiſure, ſaid <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred,</hi>
to liſten to thy tales. I do not queſtion
thy honeſty: But it is thy duty to conceal no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
from me. How long has <hi>Iſabella</hi> been
acquainted with <hi>Theodore?</hi> Nay, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can eſcape your Highneſs! ſaid <hi>Bianca</hi>—
not that I know any thing of the matter—<hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore,</hi>
to be ſure, is a proper young man, and,
as my Lady <hi>Matilda</hi> ſays, the very image of
good <hi>Alfonſo:</hi> Has not your Highneſs remarked
it? yes, yes,—no—thou tortureſt me: Said
<hi>Manfred:</hi> Where did they meet? when?—
who! My Lady <hi>Matilda?</hi> ſaid <hi>Bianca.</hi> No,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:0507001200:181"/>
no, not <hi>Matilda: Iſabella</hi>; when did <hi>Iſabella</hi>
firſt become acquainted with this <hi>Theodore? Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
Mary!</hi> ſaid <hi>Bianca,</hi> how ſhould I know?
Thou doſt know; ſaid <hi>Manfred</hi>; and I muſt
know; I will—Lord! your Highneſs is not
jealous of young <hi>Theodore!</hi> ſaid <hi>Bianca</hi>—jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous!
no, no: Why ſhould I be jealous?—
perhaps I mean to unite them—if I were ſure
<hi>Iſabella</hi> would have no repugnance—repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance!
no, I'll warrant her; ſaid <hi>Bianca</hi>; he
is as comely a youth as ever trod on Chriſtian
ground: We are all in love with him, there is
not a ſoul in the caſtle, but would be rejoiced
to have him for our Prince—I mean, when
it ſhall pleaſe heaven to call your Highneſs to
itſelf—indeed! ſaid <hi>Manfred</hi>; has it gone ſo
far! oh! this curſed Friar!—but I muſt not
loſe time—go, <hi>Bianca,</hi> attend <hi>Iſabella</hi>; but I
charge thee, not a word of what has paſſed.
Find out how ſhe is affected towards <hi>Theodore:</hi>
bring me good news, and that ring has a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion.
Wait at the foot of the winding ſtair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſe:
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:0507001200:182"/>
I am going to viſit the Marquis, and will
talk farther with thee at my return.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Manfred,</hi> after ſome general converſation,
deſired <hi>Frederic</hi> to diſmiſs the two Knights his
companions, having to talk with him on urgent
affairs. As ſoon as they were alone, he began
in artful guiſe to ſound the Marquis on the
ſubject of <hi>Matilda</hi>; and finding him diſpoſed to
his wiſh, he let drop hints on the difficulties
that would attend the celebration of their mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
unleſs—at that inſtant <hi>Bianca</hi> burſt into
the room with a wildneſs in her look and geſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
that ſpoke the utmoſt terror. Oh! my
Lord, my Lord! cried ſhe; we are all undone!
it is come again! it is come again! What is
come again? cried <hi>Manfred</hi> amazed—oh! the
hand! the Giant! the hand!—ſupport me! I
am terrified out of my ſenſes: Cried <hi>Bianca,</hi> I
will not ſleep in the caſtle to-night; where ſhall
I go? my things may come after me to-mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
—would I had been content to wed <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſco!</hi>
this comes of ambition! What has ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:0507001200:183"/>
thee thus, young woman? ſaid the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis:
Thou art ſafe here; be not alarmed.
Oh! your Greatneſs is wonderful good, ſaid
<hi>Bianca,</hi> but I dare not—no, pray, let me go—
I had rather leave every thing behind me, than
ſtay another hour under this roof. Go to, thou
haſt loſt thy ſenſes: Said <hi>Manfred.</hi> Interrupt
us not; we were communing on important
matters—my Lord, this wench is ſubject to fits—come with me, <hi>Bianca</hi>—oh! the Saints!
no, ſaid <hi>Bianca</hi>—for certain it comes to warn
your Highneſs; why ſhould it appear to me
elſe? I ſay my hours morning and evening—
oh! if your Highneſs had believed <hi>Diego!</hi> 'Tis
the ſame hand that he ſaw the foot to in the
gallery-chamber—Father <hi>Jerome</hi> has often told
us the prophecy would be out one of theſe days
—<hi>Bianca,</hi> ſaid he, mark my words—thou
raveſt; ſaid <hi>Manfred</hi> in a rage; be gone, and
keep theſe fooleries to frighten thy companions
—what! my Lord, cried <hi>Bianca,</hi> do you think
I have ſeen nothing? go to the foot of the
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:0507001200:184"/>
great ſtairs yourſelf—as I live I ſaw it. Saw
what? tell us, fair maid, what thou haſt ſeen:
Said <hi>Frederic.</hi> Can your Highneſs liſten, ſaid
<hi>Manfred,</hi> to the delirium of a ſilly wench, who
has heard ſtories of apparitions until ſhe believes
them? This is more than fancy, ſaid the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis;
her terror is too natural and too ſtrongly
impreſſed to be the work of imagination. Tell
us, fair maiden, what it is has moved thee thus.
Yes, my Lord, thank your Greatneſs; ſaid
<hi>Bianca</hi>—I believe I look very pale; I ſhall be
better when I have recovered myſelf—I was
going to my Lady <hi>Iſabella</hi>'s chamber by his
Highneſs's order—we do want the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances;
interrupted <hi>Manfred:</hi> Since his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
will have it ſo, proceed; but be brief.
Lord! your Highneſs thwarts one ſo! replied
<hi>Bianca</hi>—I fear my hair—I am ſure I never in
my life—well! as I was telling your Greatneſs,
I was going by his Highneſs's order to my Lady
<hi>Iſabella</hi>'s chamber: She lies in the watchet-coloured
chamber, on the right-hand, one pair
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:0507001200:185"/>
of stairs. So when I came to the great ſtairs—
I was looking on his Highneſs's preſent here
—grant me patience! ſaid <hi>Manfred,</hi> will this
wench never come to the point? what imports
it to the Marquis, that I gave thee a bawble for
thy faithful attendance on my daughter? we
want to know what thou ſaweſt. I was going
to tell your Highneſs, ſaid <hi>Bianca</hi>; if you would
permit me.—So as I was rubbing the ring—I
am ſure I had not gone up three ſteps, but I
heard the rattling of armour; for all the world
ſuch a clatter, as <hi>Diego</hi> ſays he heard when the
Giant turned him about in the gallery-chamber
—what does ſhe mean, my Lord! ſaid the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis;
is your caſtle haunted by giants and gob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lins?
Lord! what, has not your Greatneſs
heard the ſtory of the Giant in the gallery-chamber?
cried <hi>Bianca.</hi> I marvel his Highneſs
has not told you—may hap you do not know
there is a prophecy—This trifling is intolerable;
interrupted <hi>Manfred.</hi> Let us diſmiſs this ſilly
wench, my Lord? we have more important
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:0507001200:186"/>
affairs to diſcuſs. By your favour, ſaid <hi>Frederic,</hi>
theſe are no trifles: The enormous ſabre I was
directed to in the wood, you caſque, its fellow
—are theſe viſions of this poor maiden's brain?
—ſo <hi>Jaquez</hi> thinks, may it pleaſe your Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:
Said <hi>Bianca.</hi> He ſays this moon will not
be out without our ſeeing ſome ſtrange revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution.
For my part I ſhould not be ſurprized
if it was to happen to-morrow; for, as I was
ſaying, when I heard the clattering of armour,
I was all in a cold ſweat—I looked up, and, if
your Greatneſs will believe me, I ſaw upon the
uppermoſt baniſter of the great ſtairs a hand in
armour as big, as big—I thought I ſhould have
ſwooned—I never ſtopped until I came hither
—would I were well out of this caſtle! My
Lady <hi>Matilda</hi> told me but yeſter-morning that
her Highneſs <hi>Hippolita</hi> knows ſomething—Thou
art an inſolent! cried <hi>Manfred</hi>—Lord Marquis, it
much miſgives me that this ſcene is concerted
to affront me. Are my own domeſtics ſuborned
to ſpread tales injurious to my honour? Purſue
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:0507001200:187"/>
your claim by manly daring; or let us bury our
feuds, as was propoſed, by the intermarriage
of our children: But, truſt me, it ill becomes
a Prince of your bearing to practice on merce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
wenches—I ſcorn your imputation; ſaid
<hi>Frederic:</hi> until this hour I never ſet eyes on this
damſel: I have given her no jewel!—my Lord,
my Lord, your conſcience, your guilt accuſes
you, and would throw the ſuſpicion on me—
but keep your daughter, and think no more of
<hi>Iſabella:</hi> The judgments already fallen on your
houſe forbid my matching into it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Manfred</hi> alarmed at the reſolute tone in which
<hi>Frederic</hi> delivered theſe words, endeavoured to
pacify him. Diſmiſſing <hi>Bianca,</hi> he made ſuch
ſubmiſſions to the Marquis, and threw in ſuch
artful encomiums on <hi>Matilda,</hi> that <hi>Frederic</hi>
was once more ſtaggered. However, as his
paſſion was of ſo recent a date, it could not
at once ſurmount the ſcruples he had conceived.
He had gathered enough from <hi>Bianca</hi>'s diſcourſe
to perſuade him that heaven declared itſelf againſt
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:0507001200:188"/>
                  <hi>Manfred.</hi> The propoſed marriages too removed
his claim to a diſtance; and the principality of
<hi>Otranto</hi> was a ſtronger temptation, than the
contingent reverſion of it with <hi>Matilda.</hi> Still
he would not abſolutely recede from his engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
but purpoſing to gain time, he demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of <hi>Manfred,</hi> if it was true in fact that <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polita</hi>
conſented to the divorce. The Prince,
tranſported to find no other obſtacle, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending
on his influence over his wife, aſſured
the Marquis it was ſo, and that he might ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy
himſelf of the truth from her own mouth.</p>
               <p>As they were thus diſcourſing, word was
brought that the banquet was prepared. <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred</hi>
conducted <hi>Frederic</hi> to the great hall, where
they were received by <hi>Hippolita</hi> and the young
Princeſſes. <hi>Manfred</hi> placed the Marquis next to
<hi>Matilda,</hi> and ſeated himſelf between his wife
and <hi>Iſabella. Hippolita</hi> comported herſelf with an
eaſy gravity; but the young Ladies were ſilent
and melancholy. <hi>Manfred,</hi> who was determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to purſue his point with the Marquis in the
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:0507001200:189"/>
remainder of the evening, puſhed on the feaſt
until it waxed late; affecting unreſtrained gaiety,
and plying <hi>Frederic</hi> with repeated goblets of
wine. The latter, more upon his guard than
<hi>Manfred</hi> wiſhed, declined his frequent chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenges,
on pretence of his late loſs of blood;
while the Prince, to raiſe his own diſordered
ſpirits, and to counterfeit unconcern, indulged
himſelf in plentiful draughts, though not to the
intoxication of his ſenſes.</p>
               <p>The evening being far advanced, the banquet
concluded. <hi>Manfred</hi> would have withdrawn
with <hi>Frederic</hi>; but the latter pleading weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and want of repoſe, retired to his cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
galantly telling the Prince, that his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſhould amuſe his Highneſs until himſelf
could attend him. <hi>Manfred</hi> accepted the party,
and to the no ſmall grief of <hi>Iſabella</hi> accompanied
her to her apartment. <hi>Matilda</hi> waited on her
mother to enjoy the freſhneſs of the evening
on the ramparts of the caſtle.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="181" facs="tcp:0507001200:190"/>
Soon as the company were diſperſed their
ſeveral ways, <hi>Frederic,</hi> quitting his chamber,
enquired if <hi>Hippolita</hi> was alone, and was told
by one of her attendants, who had not noticed
her going forth, that at that hour ſhe gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
withdrew to her oratory, where he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
would find her. The Marquis during
the repaſt had beheld <hi>Matilda</hi> with increaſe of
paſſion. He now wiſhed to find <hi>Hippolita</hi> in
the diſpoſition her Lord had promiſed. The
portents that had alarmed him, were forgotten
in his deſires. Stealing ſoftly and unobſerved
to the apartment of <hi>Hippolita,</hi> he entered it with
a reſolution to encourage her acquieſcence to
the divorce, having perceived that <hi>Manfred</hi> was
reſolved to make the poſſeſſion of <hi>Iſabella</hi> an
unalterable condition, before he would grant
<hi>Matilda</hi> to his wiſhes.</p>
               <p>The Marquis was not ſurprized at the ſilence
that reigned in the Princeſs's apartment. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding
her, as he had been advertized, in
her oratory, he paſſed on. The door was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jar;
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:0507001200:191"/>
the evening gloomy and overcaſt. Puſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
open the door gently, he ſaw a perſon
kneeling before the altar. As he approached
nearer, it ſeemed not a woman, but one in a
long woollen weed, whoſe back was towards
him. The perſon ſeemed abſorbed in prayer.
The Marquis was about to return, when the
figure riſing, ſtood ſome moments fixed in
meditation, without regarding him. The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis,
expecting the holy perſon to come forth,
and meaning to excuſe his uncivil interruption,
ſaid, reverend Father, I ſought the Lady <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polita</hi>
—<hi>Hippolita!</hi> replied a hollow voice?
cameſt thou to this caſtle to ſeek <hi>Hippolita?</hi>—
and then the figure, turning ſlowly round, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
to <hi>Frederic</hi> the fleſhleſs jaws and empty
ſockets of a ſkeleton, wrapt in a hermit's cowl.
Angels of grace, protect me! cried <hi>Frederic</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coiling.
Deſerve their protection! ſaid the
Spectre. <hi>Frederic</hi> falling on his knees, adjured the
Phantom to take pity on him. Doſt thou not
remember me? ſaid the apparition. Remember
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:0507001200:192"/>
the wood of <hi>Joppa!</hi> Art thou that holy Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit?
cried <hi>Frederic</hi> trembling—can I do
ought for thy eternal peace?—Waſt thou
delivered from bondage, ſaid the ſpectre, to
purſue carnal delights? Haſt thou forgotten the
buried ſabre, and the beheſt of Heaven en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graven
on it?—I have not, I have not;
ſaid <hi>Frederic</hi>—but ſay, bleſt ſpirit, what is
thy errand to me? what remains to be done?
To forget <hi>Matilda!</hi> ſaid the apparition—and
vaniſhed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Frederic</hi>'s blood froze in his veins. For ſome
minutes he remained motionleſs. Then falling
proſtrate on his face before the altar, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought
the interceſſion of every ſaint for pardon.
A flood of tears ſucceeded to this tranſport; and
the image of the beauteous <hi>Matilda</hi> ruſhing in
ſpite of him on his thoughts, he lay on the
ground in a conflict of penitence and paſſion.
E'er he could recover from this agony of his
ſpirits, the Princeſs <hi>Hippolita</hi> with a taper in
her hand entered the oratory alone. Seeing a
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:0507001200:193"/>
man without motion on the floor, ſhe gave a
ſhriek, concluding him dead. Her fright brought
<hi>Frederic</hi> to himſelf. Riſing ſuddenly, his face
bedewed with tears, he would have ruſhed from
her preſence; but <hi>Hippolita</hi> ſtopping him, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured
him in the moſt plaintive accents to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
the cauſe of his diſorder, and by what
ſtrange chance ſhe had found him there in that
poſture. Ah! virtuous Princeſs! ſaid the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis,
penetrated with grief—and ſtopped. For
the love of Heaven, my Lord, ſaid <hi>Hippolita,</hi>
diſcloſe the cauſe of this tranſport! what mean
theſe doleful ſounds, this alarming exclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
on my name? What woes has heaven ſtill
in ſtore for the wretched <hi>Hippolita?</hi>—yet
ſilent!—by every pitying angel, I adjure thee,
noble Prince, continued ſhe falling at his feet,
to diſcloſe the purport of what lies at thy heart—
I ſee thou feeleſt for me; thou feeleſt the ſharp
pangs that thou inflicteſt—ſpeak for pity!—
does ought thou knoweſt concern my child?—
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:0507001200:194"/>
I cannot ſpeak; cried <hi>Frederic,</hi> burſting from
her—Oh! <hi>Matilda!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Quitting the Princeſs thus abruptly, he
haſtened to his own apartment. At the door of
it he was accoſted by <hi>Manfred,</hi> who fluſhed by
wine and love had come to ſeek him, and to
propoſe to waſte ſome hours of the night in muſic
and revelling. <hi>Frederic,</hi> offended at an invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
ſo diſſonant from the mood of his ſoul,
puſhed him rudely aſide, and entering his cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
flung the door intemperately againſt <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred,</hi>
and bolted it inwards. The haughty
Prince, enraged at this unaccountable beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
withdrew in a frame of mind capable
of the moſt fatal exceſſes. As he croſſed the
court, he was met by the domeſtic whom he
had planted at the convent as a ſpy on <hi>Jerome</hi>
and <hi>Theodore.</hi> This man, almoſt breathleſs with
the haſte he had made, informed his Lord, that
<hi>Theodore</hi> and ſome lady from the caſtle were at
that inſtant in private conference at the tomb of
<hi>Alfonſo</hi> in St. <hi>Nicholas</hi>'s church. He had dogged
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:0507001200:195"/>
                  <hi>Theodore</hi> thither, but the gloomineſs of the night
had prevented his diſcovering who the woman
was.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Manfred,</hi> whoſe ſpirits were inflamed, and
whom <hi>Iſabella</hi> had driven from her on his urg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his paſſion with too little reſerve, did not
doubt but the inquietude ſhe had expreſſed, had
been occaſioned by her impatience to meet <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore.</hi>
Provoked by this conjecture, and enrag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at her father, he haſtened ſecretly to the
great church. Gliding ſoftly between the iſles,
and guided by an imperfect gleam of moon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhine
that ſhone ſaintly through the illuminat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
windows, he ſtole towards the tomb of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fonſo,</hi>
to which he was directed by indiſtinct
whiſpers of the perſons he ſought. The firſt
ſounds he could diſtinguiſh were—Does it
alas! depend on me? <hi>Manfred</hi> will never per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
our union—No, this ſhall prevent it!
cried the tyrant, drawing his dagger, and
plunging it over her ſhoulder into the boſom of
the perſon that ſpoke—ah! me, I am ſlain!

cried <hi>Matilda</hi> ſinking; good heaven, receive my
ſoul! Savage, inhuman monſter! what haſt
thou done! cried <hi>Theodore,</hi> ruſhing on him, and
wrenching his dagger from him—Stop, ſtop
thy impious hand! cried <hi>Matilda</hi>; it is my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther!
<hi>Manfred</hi> waking as from a trance, beat
his breaſt, twiſted his hands in his locks, and
endeavoured to recover his dagger from <hi>Theodore</hi>
to diſpatch himſelf. <hi>Theodore</hi> ſcarce leſs diſtracted,
and only maſtering the tranſports of his grief to
aſſiſt <hi>Matilda,</hi> had now by his cries drawn ſome
of the monks to his aid. While part of them
endeavoured in concert with the afflicted <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore</hi>
to ſtop the blood of the dying Princeſs,
the reſt prevented <hi>Manfred</hi> from laying violent
hands on himſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Matilda</hi> reſigning herſelf patiently to her fate,
acknowledged with looks of grateful love the
zeal of <hi>Theodore.</hi> Yet oft as her faintneſs would
permit her ſpeech its way, ſhe begged the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtants
to comfort her father. <hi>Jerome</hi> by this
time had learnt the fatal news, and reached the
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:0507001200:198"/>
church. His looks ſeemed to reproach <hi>Theodore:</hi>
but turning to <hi>Manfred,</hi> he ſaid, now, tyrant!
behold the completion of woe fulfilled on thy im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious
and devoted head! The blood of <hi>Alfonſo</hi>
cried to heaven for vengeance; and heaven has
permitted its altar to be polluted by aſſaſſination,
that thou mighteſt ſhed thy own blood at the foot
of that Prince's ſepulchre!—Cruel man! cried
<hi>Matilda,</hi> to aggravate the woes of a parent!
may heaven bleſs my father, and forgive him
as I do! My Lord, my gracious Sire, doſt thou
forgive thy child? indeed I came not hither to
meet <hi>Theodore:</hi> I found him praying at this tomb,
whither my mother ſent me to intercede for thee,
for her—deareſt father, bleſs your child, and
ſay you forgive her—forgive thee! murderous
monſter! cried <hi>Manfred</hi>—can aſſaſſins forgive?
I took thee for <hi>Iſabella</hi>; but heaven directed my
bloody hand to the heart of my child!—oh!
<hi>Matilda</hi>—I cannot utter it—canſt thou forgive
the blindneſs of my rage! I can, I do! and
may heaven confirm it! ſaid <hi>Matilda</hi>—but
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:0507001200:199"/>
while I have life to aſk it—Oh! my mother!
what will ſhe feel!—will you comfort her, my
Lord? will you not put her away? indeed ſhe
loves you—oh! I am faint! bear me to the
caſtle—can I live to have her cloſe my eyes?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Theodore</hi> and the monks beſought her earneſtly
to ſuffer herſelf to be born into the convent;
but her inſtances were ſo preſſing to be carried to
the caſtle; that placing her on a litter, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed
her thither as ſhe requeſted. <hi>Theodore</hi> ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting
her head with his arm, and hanging
over her in an agony of deſpairing love, ſtill en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
to inſpire her with hopes of life. <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi>
on the other ſide comforted her with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes
of heaven, and holding a crucifix before
her, which ſhe bathed with innocent tears, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
her for her paſſage to immortality. <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred</hi>
plunged in the deepeſt affliction, followed
the litter in deſpair.</p>
               <p>E'er they reached the caſtle, <hi>Hippolita,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
of the dreadful cataſtrophe, had flown to
meet her murdered child: but when ſhe ſaw
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:0507001200:200"/>
the afflicted proceſſion, the mightineſs of her
grief deprived her of her ſenſes, and ſhe fell life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
to the earth in a ſwoon. <hi>Iſabella</hi> and <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deric,</hi>
who attended her, were overwhelmed in
almoſt equal ſorrow. <hi>Matilda</hi> alone ſeemed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible
to her own ſituation: every thought was
loſt in tenderneſs for her mother. Ordering the
litter to ſtop, as ſoon as <hi>Hippolita</hi> was brought
to herſelf, ſhe aſked for her father. He ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached,
unable to ſpeak. <hi>Matilda</hi> ſeizing his
hand and her mother's, locked them in her own,
and then claſped them to her heart. <hi>Manfred</hi>
could not ſupport this act of pathetic piety. He
daſhed himſelf on the ground, and curſed the
day he was born. <hi>Iſabella,</hi> apprehenſive that
theſe ſtruggles of paſſion were more than <hi>Matilda</hi>
could ſupport, took upon herſelf to order <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred</hi>
to be borne to his apartment, while ſhe
cauſed <hi>Matilda</hi> to be conveyed to the neareſt
chamber. <hi>Hippolita,</hi> ſcarce more alive than her
daughter, was regardleſs of every thing but her:
but when the tender <hi>Iſabella</hi>'s care would have
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:0507001200:201"/>
likewiſe removed her, while the ſurgeons exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
<hi>Matilda</hi>'s wound, ſhe cried, remove me!
never! never! I lived but in her, and will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
with her. <hi>Matilda</hi> raiſed her eyes at her
mother's voice, but cloſed them again without
ſpeaking. Her ſinking pulſe and the damp cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of her hand ſoon diſpelled all hopes of reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very.
<hi>Theodore</hi> followed the ſurgeons into the
outer chamber, and heard them pronounce the
fatal ſentence with a tranſport equal to frenzy—
Since ſhe cannot live mine, cried he, at leaſt ſhe
ſhall be mine in death!—Father! <hi>Jerome!</hi> will
you not join our hands? cried he to the Friar,
who with the Marquis had accompanied the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons.
What means thy diſtracted raſhneſs?
ſaid <hi>Jerome</hi>; is this an hour for marriage! It is,
it is, cried <hi>Theodore,</hi> alas! there is no other!
Young man, thou art too unadviſed: ſaid <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deric:</hi>
doſt thou think we are to liſten to thy
fond tranſports in this hour of fate? what pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions
haſt thou to the Princeſs? Thoſe of a
Prince; ſaid <hi>Theodore</hi>; of the ſovereign of <hi>Otranto.</hi>
                  <pb n="192" facs="tcp:0507001200:202"/>
This reverend man, my father, has informed me
who I am. Thou raveſt: ſaid the Marquis:
there is no prince of <hi>Otranto</hi> but myſelf, now
<hi>Manfred</hi> by murder, by ſacrilegious murder, has
forfeited all pretenſions. My Lord, ſaid <hi>Jerome,</hi>
aſſuming an air of command, he tells you true.
It was not my purpoſe the ſecret ſhould have
been divulged ſo ſoon; but fate preſſes onward
to its work. What his hot headed paſſion has
revealed, my tongue confirms. Know, Prince,
that when <hi>Alfonſo</hi> ſet ſail for the Holy Land—
is this a ſeaſon for explanations? cried <hi>Theodore.</hi>
Father, come and unite me to the Princeſs; ſhe
ſhall be mine—in every other thing I will duti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
obey you. My life! my adored <hi>Matilda!</hi>
continued <hi>Theodore,</hi> ruſhing back into the inner
chamber, will you not be mine? will you not
bleſs your—<hi>Iſabella</hi> made ſigns to him to be
ſilent, apprehending the Princeſs was near her
end. What is ſhe dead? cried <hi>Theodore</hi>; is it
poſſible? The violence of his exclamations
brought <hi>Matilda</hi> to herſelf. Lifting up her eyes,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:0507001200:203"/>
ſhe looked round for her mother—Life of my
ſoul! I am here: cried <hi>Hippolita</hi>; think not I
will quit thee! Oh! you are too good; ſaid
<hi>Matilda</hi>—but weep not for me, my mother! I
am going where ſorrow never dwells—<hi>Iſabella,</hi>
thou haſt loved me; wot thou not ſupply my
fondneſs to this dear, dear woman?—indeed I
am faint! Oh! my child! my child! ſaid <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lita</hi>
in a flood of tears, can I not withhold thee a
moment!—It will not be; ſaid <hi>Matilda</hi>—com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
me to heaven—where is my father? for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give
him, deareſt mother—forgive him my
death; it was an error—Oh! I had forgotten—
deareſt mother, I vowed never to ſee <hi>Theodore</hi>
more—perhaps that has drawn down this cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity—
but it was not intentional—can you
pardon me?—Oh! wound not my agonizing
ſoul! ſaid <hi>Hippolita</hi>; thou never couldſt offend
me—alas I ſhe faints! help! help!—I would
ſay ſomething more, ſaid <hi>Matilda</hi> ſtruggling, but
it wonnot be—<hi>Iſabella</hi>—<hi>Theodore</hi>—for my
ſake—Oh!—ſhe expired. <hi>Iſabella</hi> and her wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:0507001200:204"/>
tore <hi>Hippolita</hi> from the corſe; but <hi>Theodore</hi>
threatened deſtruction to all who attempted to
remove him from it. He printed a thouſand kiſſes
on her clay-cold hands, and uttered every expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
that deſpairing love could dictate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iſabella,</hi> in the mean time, was accompany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the afflicted <hi>Hippolita</hi> to her apartment; but,
in the middle of the court, they were met by
<hi>Manfred,</hi> who, diſtracted with his own thoughts,
and anxious once more to behold his daughter,
was advancing to the chamber where ſhe lay.
As the moon was now at its height, he read in
the countenances of this unhappy company the
event he dreaded. What! is ſhe dead! cried
he in wild confuſion—a clap of thunder at
that inſtant ſhook the caſtle to its foundations;
the earth rocked, and the clank of more than
mortal armour was heard behind. <hi>Frederic</hi> and
<hi>Jerome</hi> thought the laſt day was at hand. The
latter, forcing <hi>Theodore</hi> along with them, ruſhed
into the court. The moment <hi>Theodore</hi> appeared,
the walls of the caſtle behind <hi>Manfred</hi> were
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:0507001200:205"/>
thrown down with a mighty force, and the
form of <hi>Alfonſo,</hi> dilated to an immenſe magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
appeared in the center of the ruins. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
in <hi>Theodore</hi> the true heir of <hi>Alfonſo!</hi> ſaid
the viſion: And having pronounced thoſe words,
accompanied by a clap of thunder, it aſcended
ſolemnly towards heaven, where the clouds
parting aſunder, the form of St. <hi>Nicholas</hi> was
ſeen, and receiving <hi>Alfonſo</hi>'s ſhade, they were
ſoon wrapt from mortal eyes in a blaze of glory.</p>
               <p>The beholders fell proſtrate on their faces,
acknowledging the divine will. The firſt that
broke ſilence was <hi>Hippolita.</hi> My Lord, ſaid ſhe
to the deſponding <hi>Manfred,</hi> behold the vanity
of human greatneſs! <hi>Conrad</hi> is gone! <hi>Matilda</hi>
is no more! in <hi>Theodore</hi> we view the true Prince
of <hi>Otranto.</hi> By what miracle he is ſo, I know
not—ſuffice it to us, our doom is pronounced!
ſhall we not, can we but dedicate the few de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable
hours we have to live, in deprecating
the farther wrath of heaven? heaven ejects us
—whither can we fly, but to yon holy cells
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:0507001200:206"/>
that yet offer us a retreat?—Thou guiltleſs
but unhappy woman! unhappy by my crimes!
replied <hi>Manfred,</hi> my heart at laſt is open to thy
devout admonitions. Oh! could—but it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be—ye are loſt in wonder—let me at laſt
do juſtice on myſelf! To heap ſhame on my
own head is all the ſatisfaction I have left to
offer to offended heaven. My ſtory has drawn
down theſe judgments: Let my confeſſion atone
—but ah! what can atone for uſurpation and
a murdered child! a child murdered in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated
place!—Liſt, Sirs, and may this
bloody record be a warning to future tyrants!</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Alfonſo,</hi> ye all know, died in the holy land
—ye would interrupt me; ye would ſay he
came not fairly to his end—it is moſt true—
why elſe this bitter cup which <hi>Manfred</hi> muſt
drink to the dregs? <hi>Ricardo,</hi> my grandfather,
was his chamberlain—I would draw a veil over
my anceſtor's crimes—but it is in vain! <hi>Alfonſo</hi>
died by poiſon. A fictitious will declared <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cardo</hi>
his heir. His crimes purſued him—yet he
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:0507001200:207"/>
loſt no <hi>Conrad,</hi> no <hi>Matilda!</hi> I pay the price of
uſurpation for all! A ſtorm overtook him.
Haunted by his guilt, he vowed to St. <hi>Nicholas</hi>
to found a church and two convents, if he lived
to reach <hi>Otranto.</hi> The ſacrifice was accepted:
the ſaint appeared to him in a dream, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
that <hi>Ricardo</hi>'s poſterity ſhould reign in
<hi>Otranto,</hi> until the rightful owner ſhould be
grown too large to inhabit the caſtle, and as
long as iſſue-male from <hi>Ricardo</hi>'s loins ſhould
remain to enjoy it—Alas! alas! nor male
nor female, except myſelf, remains of all his
wretched race!—I have done—the woes of
theſe three days ſpeak the reſt. How this young
man can be <hi>Alfonſo</hi>'s heir, I know not—yet I
do not doubt it. His are theſe dominions; I
reſign them—yet I knew not <hi>Alfonſo</hi> had an
heir—I queſtion not the will of heaven—po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty
and prayer muſt fill up the woeful ſpace,
until <hi>Manfred</hi> ſhall be ſummoned to <hi>Ricardo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What remains, is my part to declare, ſaid
<hi>Jerome.</hi> When <hi>Alfonſo</hi> ſet ſail for the holy land,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:0507001200:208"/>
he was driven by a ſtorm to the coaſt of <hi>Sicily.</hi>
The other veſſel, which bore <hi>Ricardo</hi> and his
train, as your <hi>Lordſhip</hi> muſt have heard, was
ſeparated from him. It is moſt true, ſaid <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred</hi>;
and the title you give me is more than
an outcaſt can claim—well! be it ſo—proceed.
<hi>Jerome</hi> bluſhed, and continued. For three
months Lord <hi>Alfonſo</hi> was wind bound in <hi>Sicily.</hi>
There he became enamoured of a fair virgin
named <hi>Victoria.</hi> He was too pious to tempt her
to forbidden pleaſures. They were married.
Yet deeming this amour incongruous with the
holy vow of arms by which he was bound, he
determined to conceal their nuptials, until his
return from the Cruſado, when he purpoſed to
ſeek and acknowledge her for his lawful wife.
He left her pregnant. During his abſence ſhe
was delivered of a daughter: But ſcarce had ſhe
felt a mother's pangs, ere ſhe heard the fatal
rumour of her Lord's death, and the ſucceſſion
of <hi>Ricardo.</hi> What could a friendleſs, helpleſs
woman do? would her teſtimony avail?—yet,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:0507001200:209"/>
my Lord, I have an authentic writing—It
needs not; ſaid <hi>Manfred</hi>; the horrors of theſe
days, the viſion we have but now ſeen, all cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roborate
thy evidence beyond a thouſand parch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
<hi>Matilda</hi>'s death and my expulſion—
Be compoſed, my Lord, ſaid <hi>Hippolita</hi>; this
holy man did not mean to recal your griefs,
<hi>Jerome</hi> proceeded.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not dwell on what is needleſs. The
daughter of which <hi>Victoria</hi> was delivered, was
at her maturity beſtowed in marriage on me.
<hi>Victoria</hi> died; and the ſecret remained locked in
my breaſt. <hi>Theodore</hi>'s narrative has told the reſt.</p>
               <p>The Friar ceaſed. The diſconſolate com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
retired to the remaining part of the caſtle.
In the morning <hi>Manfred</hi> ſigned his abdication
of the principality, with the approbation of
<hi>Hippolita,</hi> and each took on them the habit of
religion in the neighbouring convents. <hi>Frederic</hi>
offered his daughter to the new Prince, which
<hi>Hippolita</hi>'s tenderneſs for <hi>Iſabella</hi> concurred to
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:0507001200:210"/>
promote: But <hi>Theodore</hi>'s grief was too freſh to
admit the thought of another love; and it was
not until after frequent diſcourſes with <hi>Iſabella</hi> of
his dear <hi>Matilda,</hi> that he was perſuaded he could
know no happineſs but in the ſociety of one
with whom he could for ever indulge the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy
that had taken poſſeſſion of his ſoul.</p>
