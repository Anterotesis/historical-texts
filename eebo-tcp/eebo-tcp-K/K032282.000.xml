            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The CLAIMS of the People of ENGLAND.</head>
            <p>IN the beginning of the preſent century, (anno 1701, 12 W. III.) a ſenſible and loyal Writer drew up a ſmall Tract of political information, which he intitled — <q>THE CLAIMS OF THE PEOPLE OF ENGLAND <hi>eſſayed in a Letter from the Country.</hi>
               </q> But, before the Tract was printed, the Author had the ſatisfaction to hear, that the <hi>Claims,</hi> he had aſſerted, were in many reſpects eſtabliſhed by a new Act of the Parliament then ſitting; which ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable attention to the People's <hi>Rights</hi> he moſt gratefully acknowledged in a Poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript to his Letter.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Act of Settlement,</hi> by virtue of which the preſent Royal Family ſucceeded to the Crown of theſe Realms, was the Statute, which then ſo happily (in the opinion of that Writer) <q>ſecured THE CLAIMS OF THE PEOPLE OF ENGLAND.</q>
            </p>
            <p>It is intitled, <q>
                  <hi>An Act for the farther Limitation of the Crown, and better ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing the Rights and Liberties of the Subject;</hi>
               </q> — and accordingly contains
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:1173400800:3"/>eight very excellent Articles of <hi>Limitation,</hi> agreeable to <q>
                  <hi>the Claims of the People of England;</hi>
               </q> which, it ſeems, were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted, <q>
                  <hi>with the unanimous Concurrence of both Houſes of Parliament,</hi>
               </q> for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs purpoſe of <q>
                  <hi>ſecuring our Religion, Laws, and Liberties.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>One of theſe Articles ordained—"That" <q>—<hi>all matters and things relating to the well governing of this</hi> Kingdom, <hi>which are properly cognizable in the Privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil by the Laws and Cuſtoms of this Realm, ſhall be tranſacted there, and all Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions taken thereupon ſhall be ſigned by ſuch of the Privy Council as ſhall adviſe and conſent to the ſame.</hi>
               </q>
               <note n="‖" place="bottom">This excellent proviſion would effectually prevent any <hi>ſecret Council,</hi> or Faction, from becoming <hi>efficient without Reſponſibility.</hi>
               </note>
            </p>
            <p>And by another of theſe Articles it was ordained — <q>
                  <hi>That no perſon, who has an Office, or Place of profit, under the King, or receives a Penſion from the Crown, ſhall be capable of ſerving as a Member of the Houſe of Commons.</hi>
               </q>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">It might perhaps have been objected at that time, as well as at preſent, that ſuch a <hi>total excluſion of Place<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> would withdraw from Parliament the Council and Aſſiſtance of many worthy Men <hi>in Office,</hi> (or that ought to be <hi>in Office,</hi>) whoſe parliamentary Abilities are the moſt diſtinguiſhed and eminent in the Kingdom. Yet there is and obvious anſwer to this objection, viz. That it is very eaſy for a free Parliament (if in their wiſdom they ſhall think it proper) to permit the <hi>great Officers of State,</hi> or even <hi>their Secretaries or firſt Clerks</hi> to have ſeats in Parliament, and, as Members, not only to declare their opinions, but alſo, for the better information of the Houſe, even to <hi>debate</hi> and <hi>reply</hi> upon all queſtions relating to public affairs; which might be allowed without any dangerous effect, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided they are duly reſtrained from the ſingle privilege of VOTING. The Nation by this means may have ample be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit in the exerciſe of their great and ſhining abilities, without riſque of <hi>undue influence,</hi> which cannot juſtly be attributed to mere <hi>argument,</hi> as that has no other weight or effect than what is fairly due to its merit; and any unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable <hi>length of ſpeech,</hi> whenever it is uſed with an appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent intention to procraſtinate and obſtruct the intention of the Majority, may be duly reſtrained at the pleaſure of the Houſe. But otherwiſe, (i. e. without ſome due reſtriction, and, more eſpecially, <hi>without an abſolute excluſion from the power of voting,</hi>) a TREASURY BENCH, or any other BENCH OF PLACEMEN, in the Houſe of Commons, is a <hi>manifeſt</hi> ABOMINATION, utterly repugnant to all juſt Ideas of a <hi>free uninfluenced Parliament,</hi> and conſequently is highly derogatory to the honour of that Houſe!</note>

            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:1173400800:4"/>But, as the Parliament was at that time inveſted with the dangerous unconſtitutio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal power of a <hi>triennial</hi> duration without <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>election,</hi> it was impoſſible that the <hi>Elected</hi> (who thereby acquired a temporary indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of the <hi>Electors,</hi> and, of courſe, too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them, a <hi>ſeparate intereſt</hi> of their own) could long continue <hi>real</hi> Repreſentatives of the <hi>People's Claims;</hi> and, conſequently, theſe two moſt excellent proviſions againſt <hi>undue influence</hi> were unhappily repealed, a very
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:1173400800:5"/>few years afterwards, in the 4th year of Queen Anne (c. 8.) Which amply proves, that the moſt ſalutary proviſions for <q>
                  <hi>the Claims of the people</hi>
               </q> cannot be ſecurely eſtabliſhed under <hi>triennial</hi> or <hi>ſeptennial</hi> Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments; and, of courſe, that the antient uſage of <hi>ſeſſional</hi> ELECTIONS is a <hi>Claim,</hi> of all others the moſt eſſentially neceſſary for our welfare.</p>
            <p>Since the fatal repeal above mentioned, the prevalence of <hi>undue influence</hi> hath ſo rapidly and enormouſly increaſed, that the ever-loyal Citizens of London thought it their duty, in the year 1770, to bear teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony againſt it; and accordingly they aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in a public declaration to the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that <hi>"the"</hi> (then) <q>
                  <hi>Houſe of Commons did</hi> NOT <hi>repreſent the people.</hi>

               <note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <q>Repreſentatives of the People are eſſential to the making of Laws, and there is a Time when it is morally demonſtrable that Men ceaſe to be Repreſentatives. That Time is now arrived. THE PRESENT HOUSE OF COMMONS DO NOT REPRESENT THE PEOPLE.</q> —Addreſs of the Mayor, Aldermen, &amp;c. of the City of London, 1770.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Subſequent Facts have demonſtrated the abſolute neceſſity we are now under to <hi>claim</hi> and promote an <hi>unequivocal</hi> abolition of all <hi>undue Influence</hi> in Parliament.</p>
            <p>Meaſures, the moſt <hi>unrighteous,</hi> as well as the moſt <hi>ruinous</hi> that could have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:1173400800:6"/>have been adopted and carried on under a pretended ſanction of <hi>parliamentary Authority,</hi>

                  <p>The Repreſentatives are choſen by a <hi>very ſmall Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the People, and even that <hi>ſmall Proportion</hi> of People is ſo monſtrouſly <hi>unequal</hi> in their <hi>power of delegation,</hi> that the ſmall Number of 5723 Borough Voters elect 254 Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives, which is very near <hi>half</hi> the Number of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives that are due to ſix Millions of People, and <hi>more than half,</hi> or a <hi>Majority,</hi> of the Numbers that are ever known to attend at any one Time. The INJUSTICE of ſuch an <hi>enormous Diſproportion</hi> in the Repreſentation of the whole People cannot be parallelled by any other groſs Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity, except THE INIQUITY of rendering that <hi>diſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionate Repreſentation</hi> ſtill more contemptible and nuga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory by SEPTENNIAL or (what were nearly as pernicious) TRIENNIAL, inſtead of the ancient conſtitutional Uſage of SESSIONAL, ELECTIONS.</p>
               </note> which have involved both King and People (whoſe true intereſts are inſeparable) in the moſt alarming difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: and the oſtenſible Agents in the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief have obſtinately perſevered to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt extenſion of <hi>ability,</hi> until public Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaſters, and a happy preventive incapacity of their own, (their Heads and Funds being equally exhauſted of council and reſource,) have compelled them to make a temporary retreat; though the nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:1173400800:7"/>Corps of Placemen, Penſioners, Contractors, &amp;c. occaſionally procured them a ſhameful Majority almoſt to the laſt!</p>
            <p>Hence it is evident that the <hi>Corruption of Parliament</hi> is the real ſource of all our national calamities and grievances, which cannot therefore be relieved by a <hi>mere change of Miniſtry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Minority</hi> in Parliament hath once before, in the memory of moſt men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the <hi>Majority;</hi> and the worthy Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers of bad meaſures were indulged with a temporary adminiſtration of public Affairs, until the ſecret <hi>efficient Cabinet</hi> could reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver from the ſurpriſe and diſmay of their former defeat in Parliament, and, by a renewed exertion of their <hi>undue influence,</hi> were able to ſhackle the new Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the rueful alternative, either to abandon their newly-acquired dignities, or elſe to adopt ſuch meaſures as muſt effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually deprive them of the people's confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; after which they were contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſly compelled (one by one, or as it might beſt ſuit the purpoſes of the reigning ſyſtem of <hi>undue influence</hi>) to yield up their places for the emolument of the more pliant creatures of the ſecret faction.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:1173400800:8"/>It would be madneſs for <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſuch galling experience, to neglect their juſt and indiſpenſible <hi>Claim</hi> to ſome imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate and effectual precaution againſt ſimilar <hi>deluſions.</hi> To truſt another new Adminiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration, without inſiſting at the ſame time on a conſtitutional <hi>limitation of power,</hi> by a <hi>free uninfluenced Repreſentation of the Commons,</hi> may be dangerous to our very exiſtence as an independent Kingdom!</p>
            <p>The reduced circumſtances of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion cannot admit the riſque of another ſuch credulous experiment!</p>
            <p>It is therefore become abſolutely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, for the ſecurity both of King and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, (which includes the <hi>true intereſt</hi> of all parties,) that the juſt <hi>"Claims of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple"</hi> be ſatisfied in an immediate Reſtora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the antient <hi>legal</hi> and <hi>reſponſible</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, by a <hi>Revival</hi> of the two repealed Articles of the Act of Settlement, above recited, and by a <hi>Revival</hi> alſo of that moſt excellent Statute for SESSIONAL PARLIA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MENTS, paſſed in the 4th of K.
