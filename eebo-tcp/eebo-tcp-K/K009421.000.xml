            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

We have felt, in the peruſal, the author's
power to harrow up the ſoul, or, in turn, to
expand it by the warmeſt, the moſt benevolent
and ſocial feelings: in many of theſe reſpects
our "Young Lady" does not yield to female

from incidents and ſituations that our greateſt

            <p>Subſcribers are entitled to much greater Advantages
than will be found in any other public Library
in England, and particularly thoſe who reſide in
the Country: for, beſides having Recourſe to his
very large Collection of Italian, French, and
Engliſh Books, the Subſcribers at Two Guineas
per Year have every new Pamphlet, as well as
new Book as ſoon as publiſhed; the Number of
Books allowed, are twelve in Town, and twenty

quarto, octavo, and duodecimo, bought for them,
that may not be in the Catalogue:—To thoſe at
One Guinea, the Number is ſix in town and ten in
the Country:—To thoſe at Sixteen Shillings per
Year, or Five Shillings per Quarter, two Books
at a Time, and to depoſit the Value.</p>
            <p>WHEREAS Subſcribers to Circulating Libraries
frequently complain of not having the Books
they want; to obviate this, the Proprietor enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
to purchaſe a ſufficient quantity of Books,
and to conſult the Convenience and Pleaſure of
the Subſcribers in every Reſpect: but as a quick

THE
CASTLES
OF
ATHLIN AND DUNBAYNE.</head>
         <div n="1" type="chapter">
            <p>On the north eaſt coaſt of Scotland,
in the moſt romantic part of the
Highlands, ſtood the caſtle of Athlin;
an edifice built on the ſummit of a
rock whoſe baſe was in the ſea. This
pile was venerable from its antiquity,
and from its gothic ſtructure; but more
venerable from the virtues which it
encloſed. It was the reſidence of the
ſtill beautiful widow, and the children,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0149803000:16"/>
of the noble Earl of Athlin, who was
ſlain by the hand of Malcolm, a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
chief, proud, oppreſſive, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengeful;
and ſtill reſiding in all the
pomp of feudal greatneſs, within a few
miles of the caſtle of Athlin. Encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
on the domain of Athlin, was
the occaſion of the animoſity which
ſubſiſted between the chiefs. Frequent
broils had happened between their
clans, in which that of Athlin had
generally been victorious. Malcolm,
whoſe pride was touched by the defeat
of his people; whoſe ambition was
curbed by the authority, and whoſe
greatneſs was rivalled by the power of
the Earl, conceived for him, that deadly
hatred which oppoſition to its favourite
paſſions naturally excites in a mind
like his, haughty and unaccuſtomed to
controul; and he meditated his deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
He planned his purpoſe with
all that addreſs which ſo eminently
marked his character, and in a battle
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0149803000:17"/>
which was attended by the chiefs of
each party in perſon, he contrived by
a curious fineſſe, to entrap the Earl,
accompanied by a ſmall detachment, in
his wiles, and there ſlew him. A gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
route of his clan enſued, which
was followed by a dreadful ſlaughter;
and a few only eſcaped to tell the horrid
cataſtrophe to Matilda. Matilda, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed
by the news, and deprived of
thoſe numbers which would make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
ſucceſsful, forbore to ſacrifice
the lives of her few remaining people
to a feeble attempt at retaliation, and
ſhe was conſtrained to endure in ſilence
her ſorrows and her injuries.</p>
            <p>Inconſolable for his death, Matilda
had withdrawn from the public eye,
into this ancient ſeat of feudal govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and there, in the boſom of her
people and her family, had devoted
herſelf to the education of her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.
One ſon and one daughter were
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0149803000:18"/>
all that ſurvived to her care, and their
growing virtues promiſed to repay all
her tenderneſs. Oſbert was in his nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
year: nature had given him a
mind ardent and ſuſceptible, to which
education had added refinement and
expanſion. The viſions of genius were
bright in his imagination, and his heart,
unchilled by the touch of diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
glowed with all the warmth of
benevolence.</p>
            <p>When firſt we enter on the theatre of
the world, and begin to notice the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
that ſurround us, young imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
heightens every ſcene, and the
warm heart expands to all around it.
The happy benevolence of our feelings
prompts us to believe that every body
is good, and excites our wonder why
every body is not happy. We are fired
with indig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ation at the recital of an act
of injuſtice, and at the unfeeling vices
of which we are told. At a tale of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0149803000:19"/>
diſtreſs our tears flow a full tribute
to pity. At a deed of virtue our heart
unfolds, our ſoul aſpires, we bleſs the
action, and feel ourſelves the doer.
As we advance in life, imagination is
compelled to relinquiſh a part of her
ſweet delirium; we are led reluctantly
to truth through the paths of expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience;
and the objects of our fond
attention are viewed with a ſeverer eye.
Here an altered ſcene appears;—frowns
where late were ſmiles; deep ſhades
where ſate was ſunſhine: mean paſſions,
or diſguſting apathy ſtain the features of
the principal figures. We turn indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
from a proſpect ſo miſerable, and
court again the ſweet illuſions of our
early days, but ah! they are fled for
ever! Conſtrained, therefore, to behold
objects in their more genuine forms,
their deformity is by degrees leſs pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to us. The fine touch of moral
ſuſceptibility, by frequent irritation,
becomes callous, and too frequently
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0149803000:20"/>
we mingle with the world, till we are
added to the number of its votaries.</p>
            <p>Mary, who was juſt ſeventeen, had
the accompliſhments of riper years,
with the touching ſimplicity of youth.
The graces of her perſon were inferior
only to thoſe of her mind, which illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
her countenance with inimitable
expreſſion.</p>
            <p>Twelve years had now elapſed ſince
the death of the Earl, and time had
blunted the keen edge of ſorrow. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilda's
grief had declined into a gentle,
and not unpleaſing melancholy, which
gave a ſoft and intereſting ſhade to the
natural dignity of her character. Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
her attention had been ſolely
directed towards rearing thoſe virtues
which nature had planted with ſo libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
a hand in her children, and which
under the genial influence of her eye,
had flouriſhed and expanded into beauty
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0149803000:21"/>
and ſtrength. A new hope, and new
ſolicitudes, now aroſe in her breaſt:
theſe dear children were arrived at an
age, dangerous from its tender ſuſcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibility,
and from the influence which
imagination has at that time over the
paſſions. Impreſſions would ſoon be
formed which would ſtamp their deſtiny
for life. The anxious mother lived
but in her children, and ſhe had yet
another cauſe of apprehenſion.</p>
            <p>When Oſbert learned the ſtory of his
father's death, his young heart glowed
to avenge the deed. The late Earl,
who had governed with the real dignity
of power, was adored by his clan; they
were eager to revenge his injuries;
but oppreſſed by the generous com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion
of the Counterſ, their murmurs
ſunk into ſilence: yet they fondly che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed
the hope that their young Lord
would one day lead them on to conqueſt
and revenge. The time was now come
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0149803000:22"/>
when they looked to ſee this hope, the
ſolace of many a cruel moment, realized.
The tender fears of a mother would not
ſuffer Matilda to riſque the chief of her
laſt remaining comforts. She forbade
Oſbert to engage. He ſubmitted in
silence, and endeavoured by application
to his favourite ſtudies, to ſtifle the
emotions which rouſed him to arms.
He excelled in the various accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of his rank, but chiefly in the
martial exerciſes, for they were conge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial
to the nobility of his ſoul, and he
had a ſecret pleaſure in believing, that
they would one time aſſiſt him to do
juſtice to the memory of his dead father.
His warm imagination directed him to
poetry, and he followed where ſhe led.
He loved to wander among the roman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic
ſcenes of the Highlands, where the
wild variety of nature inſpired him with
all the enthuſiaſm of his favourite art.
He delighted in the terrible and in the
grand, more than in the ſofter landſcape;
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0149803000:23"/>
and wrapt in the bright viſions of
fancy, would often loſe himſelf in
awful ſolitudes.</p>
            <p>It was in one of theſe rambles, that
having ſtrayed for ſome miles over hills
covered with heath, from whence the
eye was preſented with only the bold
outlines of uncultivated nature, rocks
piled on rocks, cataracts and vaſt moors
unmarked by the foot of traveller, he
loſt the path which he had himſelf
made; he looked in vain for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
which had directed him, and his
heart, for the firſt time, felt the repulſe
of fear. No veſtige of a human being
was to be ſeen, and the dreadful ſilence
of the place was interrupted only by the
roar of diſtant torrents, and by the
ſcreams of the birds which flew over his
head. He ſhouted, and his voice was
anſwered only by deep echos from the
mountains. He remained for ſome time
in a ſilent dread not wholly unpleaſing,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0149803000:24"/>
but which was ſoon heightened to a
degree of terror not to be endured; and
he turned his ſteps backward, forlorn,
and almoſt without hope. His memory
gave him back no image of the paſt;
and having wandered ſome time, he
came to a narrow paſs, which he entered,
overcome with fatigue and fruitleſs
ſearch: he had not advanced far, when
an abrupt opening in the rock ſuddenly
preſented him with a view of the moſt
beautifully romantic ſpot he had ever
ſeen. It was a valley almoſt ſurrounded
by a barrier of wild rocks, whoſe baſe
was ſhaded with thick woods of pine
and fir. A torrent which tumbled from
the heights, and was ſeen through the
woods, ruſhed with amazing impetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity
into a fine lake which flowed
through the vale, and was loſt in the
deep receſſes of the mountains. Herds
of cattle grazed in the bottom, and
the delighted eyes of Oſbert were once
more bleſſed with the ſight of human
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0149803000:25"/>
dwellings. Far on the margin of the
ſtream were ſcattered a few neat cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages.
His heart was ſo gladdened at
the proſpect, that he forgot he had yet
the way to find which led to this Ely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian
vale. He was juſt awakened to this
diſtreſſing reality, when his attention
was once more engaged by the manly
figure of a young Highland peaſant,
who advanced towards him with an air
of benevolence, and, having learned his
diſtreſs, offered to contact him to his
cottage. Oſbert accepted the invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and they wound down the hill,
through an obſcure and intricate path,
together. They arrived at one of the
cottages which the Earl had obſerved
from the height; they entered, and the
peaſant preſented his gueſt to a venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
old Highlander, his father. Refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
were ſpread on the table by
a pretty young girl, and Oſbert after
having partook of them and reſted
awhile, departed, accompanied by Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leyn,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0149803000:26"/>
the young peaſant, who had offered
to be his guide. The length of the
walk was beguiled by converſation.
Oſbert was intereſted by diſcovering in
his companion a dignity of thought, and
a courſe of ſentiment ſimilar to his
own. On their way, they paſſed at
ſome diſtance the caſtle of Dunbayne.
This object gave to Oſbert a bitter
reflection, and drew from him a deep
ſigh. Alleyn made obſervations on the
bad policy of oppreſſion in a chief,
and produced as an inſtance the Baron
Malcolm. Theſe lands, ſaid he, are
his, and they are ſcarcely ſufficient
to ſupport his wretched people, who,
ſinking under ſevere exactions, ſuffer
to lie uncultivated, tracts which would
otherwiſe yield riches to their Lord.
His clan, oppreſſed by their burdens,
threaten to riſe and do juſtice to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
by force of arms. The Baron,
in haughty confidence, laughs at their
defiance, and is inſenſible to his dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger;
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0149803000:27"/>
for ſhould an inſurrection hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen,
there are other clans who would
eagerly join in his deſtruction, and
puniſh with the ſame weapon the tyrant
and the murderer. Surpriſed at the
bold independence of theſe words, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
with uncommon energy, the
heart of Oſbert beat quick, and "O
God! my father!" burſt from his lips.
Alleyn ſtood aghaſt! uncertain of the
effect which his ſpeech had produced;
in an inſtant the whole truth flaſhed into
his mind: He beheld the ſon of the
Lord whom he had been taught to love,
and whoſe ſad ſtory had been impreſſed
upon his heart in the early days of child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood;
he ſunk at his feet, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced
his knees with a romantic ardor.
The young Earl raiſed him from the
ground, and the following words relieved
him from his aſtoniſhment, and
filled his eyes with tears of mingled joy
and ſorrow. "There are other clans
as ready as your own to avenge the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0149803000:28"/>
wrongs of the noble Earl of Athlin;
the Fitz-Henrys were ever friends to
virtue." The countenance of the youth,
while he ſpoke, was overſpread with
the glow of conſcious dignity, and his
eyes were animated with the pride of
virtue. The breaſt of Oſbert kindled
with the noble purpoſe, but the image
of his weeping mother croſſed his mind,
and checked the ardor of the impulſe.
"A time may come, my friend," ſaid
he, "when your generous zeal will be
accepted with the warmth of gratitude
it deſerves. Particular circumſtances
will not ſuffer me, at preſent, to ſay
more." The warm attachment of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leyn
to his father ſunk deep in his
heart.</p>
            <p>It was evening ere they reached the
caſtle, and Alleyn remained the Earl's
gueſt for that night.</p>

            <head>CHAPTER II.</head>
            <p>THE following day was appointed
for the celebration of an annual
feſtival given by the Earl to his people,
and he would not ſuffer Alleyn to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part.
The hall was ſpread with tables;
and dance and merriment reſounded
through the caſtle. It was uſual on
that day for the clan to aſſemble in
arms, on account of an attempt, the
memory of which it was meant to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuate,
made, two centuries before, by
an hoſtile clan to ſurprize them in their
feſtivity.</p>
            <p>In the morning were performed the
martial exerciſes, in which emulation
was excited by the honorary rewards
beſtowed on excellence. The Counteſs
and her lovely daughter, beheld from
the ramparts of the caſtle, the feats
performed on the plains below. Their
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0149803000:30"/>
attention was engaged, and their cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity
excited by the appearance of a
ſtranger, who managed the lance and
the bow with ſuch exquiſite dexterity,
as to bear off each prize of chivalry. It
was Alleyn. He received the palm of
victory, as was uſual, from the hands
of the Earl; and the modeſt dignity
with which he accepted it, charmed
the beholders.</p>
            <p>The Earl honoured the feaſt with his
preſence, at the concluſion of which,
each gueſt aroſe, and ſeizing his goblet
with his left hand, and with his right
ſtriking his ſword, drank to the memory
of their departed Lord. The hall
echoed with the general voice. Oſbert
felt it ſtrike upon his heart the alarum
of war. The people then joined hands,
and drank to the honour of the ſon
of their late maſter. Oſbert underſtood
the ſignal, and overcome with
emotion, every conſideration yielded to
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0149803000:31"/>
that of avenging his father. He aroſe,
and harangued the clan with all the fire
of youth and of indignant virtue. As he
ſpoke, the countenance of his people
flaſhed with impatient joy; a deep mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur
of applauſe ran through the aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly;
and when he was ſilent, each man,
croſſing his ſword with that of his
neighbour, ſwore by that ſacred pledge
of union, never to quit the cauſe in
which they now engaged, till the life
of their enemy had paid the debt of
juſtice and of revenge.</p>
            <p>In the evening, the wives and daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of the peaſantry came to the caſtle,
and joined in the feſtivity. It was uſual
for the Counteſs and her ladies to
obſerve from a gallery of the hall, the
various performances of dance and ſong;
and it had been a cuſtom of old for the
daughter of the caſtle to grace the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
by performing a Scotch dance
with the victor of the morning. This
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0149803000:32"/>
victor now was Alleyn, who beheld
the lovely Mary led by the Earl into
the hall, and preſented to him as his
partner in the dance. She received his
homage with a ſweet grace. She was
dreſſed in the habit of a Highland laſs,
and her fine auburn treſſes, which waved
in her neck, were ornamented only with
a wreath of roſes. She moved in the
dance with the light ſteps of the Graces.
Profound ſilence reigned through the
hall during the performance, and a ſoft
murmur of applauſe aroſe on its conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.
The admiration of the ſpectators
was divided between Mary and the vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious
ſtranger. She retired to the
gallery, and the night concluded in
joy to all but the Earl, and to Alleyn;
but very different was the ſource and
the complexion of their inquietude.
The mind of Oſbert revolved the chief
occurrences of the day, and his ſoul
burned with impatience to accompliſh
the purpoſes of filial piety; yet he
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0149803000:33"/>
dreaded the effect which the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of his deſigns might have on the
tender heart of Matilda: on the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
however, he reſolved to acquaint
her with them, and in a few days to
riſe and proſecute his cauſe with arms.</p>
            <p>Alleyn, whoſe boſom till now, had
felt only for others' pains, began to be
conſcious of his own. His mind uneaſy
and reſtleſs, gave him only the image
of the high-born Mary; he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to exclude her idea, but with
an effort ſo faint, that it would ſtill
intrude! Pleaſed, yet ſad, he would
not acknowledge even to himſelf, that
he loved; ſo ingenious are we to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal
every appearance of evil from our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.
He aroſe with the dawn, and
departed from the caſtle full of grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
and ſecret love, to prepare his
friends for the approaching war.</p>
            <p>The Earl awoke from broken ſlum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0149803000:34"/>
and ſummoned all his fortitude to
encounter the tender oppoſition of his
mother. He entered her apartment
with faultering ſteps, and his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
betrayed the emotions of his ſoul.
Matilda was ſoon informed of what
her heart had foreboded, and overcome
with dreadful ſenſation, ſunk lifeleſs
in her chair. Oſbert flew to her
aſſiſtance, and Mary and the attendants
ſoon recovered her to ſenſe and wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs.</p>
            <p>The mind of Oſbert was torn by
the moſt cruel conſtict: filial duty, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
revenge commanded him to go;
filial love, regret, and pity, entreated
him to ſtay. Mary fell at his feet, and
claſping his knees with all the wild
energy of woe, beſought him to relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh
his fatal purpoſe, and ſave his
laſt ſurviving parent. Her tears, her
ſighs, and the ſoft ſimplicity of her
air, ſpoke a yet ſtronger language than
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0149803000:35"/>
her tongue: but the ſilent grief of the
Counteſs was ſtill more touching, and
in his endeavours to ſooth her, he was
on the point of yielding his reſolution,
when the figure of his dying father
aroſe to his imagination, and ſtamped
his purpoſe irrevocably. The anxiety of
a fond mother, preſented Matilda with
the image of her ſon bleeding and
ghaſtly; and the death of her Lord was
revived in her memory with all the
agonizing grief that ſad event had im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
upon her heart, the harſher
characters of which, the lenient hand
of time had almoſt obliterated. So
lovely is Pity in all her attitudes, that
fondneſs prompts us to believe ſhe can
never tranſgreſs; but the changes into a
vice, when ſhe overcomes the purpoſes
of ſtronger virtue. Sterner principles
now nerved the breaſt of Oſbert againſt
her influence, and impelled him on to
deeds of arms. He ſummoned a few of
the moſt able and truſty of the clan, and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0149803000:36"/>
held a council of war; in which it
was reſolved that Malcolm ſhould be
attacked with all the force they could
aſſemble, and with all the ſpeed which
the importance of the preparation would
allow. To prevent ſuſpicion and alarm
to the Baron, it was agreed it ſhould be
given out, that theſe preparations were
intended for aſſiſtance to a Chief of a
diſtant part. That, when they ſet out
on the expedition, they ſhould purſue,
for ſome time, a contrary way, but
under favour of the night ſhould ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
change their route, and turn upon
the caſtle of Dunbayne.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, Alleyn was ſtre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous
in exciting his friends to the
cauſe, and ſo ſucceſsful in the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking,
as to have collected, in a few
days, a number of no inconſiderable
conſequence. To the warm enthuſiaſm
of virtue, was now added a new motive
of exertion. It was no longer ſimply
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0149803000:37"/>
an attachment to the cauſe of juſtice,
which rouſed him to action; the pride
of diſtinguiſhing himſelf in the eyes
of his miſtreſs, and of deſerving her
eſteem by his zealous ſervices, gave
combined force to the firſt impulſe
of benevolence. The ſweet thought of
deſerving her thanks, operated ſecretly
on his ſoul, for he was yet ignorant
of its influence there. In this ſtate he
again appeared at the caſtle, and told the
Earl, that himſelf and his friends were
ready to follow him whenever the ſignal
ſhould be given. His offer was accepted
with the warmth of kindneſs it claimed,
and he was deſired to hold himſelf in
readineſs for the onſet.</p>
            <p>In a few days the preparations were
completed, Alleyn and his friends were
ſummoned, the clan aſſembled in arms,
and with the young Earl at their head,
departed on their expedition. The
parting between Oſbert and his family
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0149803000:38"/>
may be eaſily conceived; nor could
all the pride of expected conqueſt ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
a ſigh which eſcaped from Alleyn
when his eyes bade adieu to Mary,
who, with the Counteſs, ſtood on the
terrace of the caſtle, purſuing with
aching ſight the march of her beloved
brother, till diſtance veiled him from
her view; ſhe then turned into the caſtle
weeping, and foreboding future cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity.
She endeavoured, however, to
to aſſume an appearance of tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
that ſhe might deceive the fears of
Matilda, and ſooth her ſorrow. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilda,
whoſe mind was ſtrong as her
heart was tender, ſince ſhe could not
prevent this hazardous undertaking,
ſummoned all her fortitude to reſiſt
the impreſſions of fruitleſs grief, and
to ſearch for the good which the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
might preſent. Her efforts were
not vain; ſhe found it in the proſpect
which the enterprize afforded of honour
to the memory of her murdered Lord,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0149803000:39"/>
and of retribution on the head of
the murderer.</p>
            <p>It was evening when the Earl de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
from the caſtle; he purſued a
contrary route till night favoured his
deſigns, when he wheeled towards the
caſtle of Dunbayne. The extreme
darkneſs of the night aſſiſted their plan,
which was to ſcale the walls, ſurprize
the centinels, burſt their way into the
inner courts ſword in hand, and force
the murderer from his retreat. They
had trod for many miles the dreary
wilds, unaſſiſted by the leaſt gleam
of light, when ſuddenly their ears were
ſtruck with the diſmal note of a watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell,
which chimed the hour of the
night. Every heart beat to the ſound.
They knew they were near the abode
of the Baron. They halted to conſult
concerning their proceedings, when it
was agreed, that the Earl with Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leyn
and a chofen few, ſhould proceed
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0149803000:40"/>
to reconnoitre the caſtle, while the reſt
ſhould remain at a ſmall diſtance await<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the ſignal of approach. The Earl
and his party purſued their march with
ſilent ſteps; they perceived a faint light
which they gueſſed to proceed from
the watch-tower of the caſtle, and
they were now almoſt under its walls.
They pauſed awhile in ſilence to give
breath to expectation, and to listen if
any thing was ſtirring. All was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved
in the gloom of night, and
the ſilence of death prevailed. They
had now time to examine, as well as
the darkneſs would permit, the ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the caſtle, and the height of
the walls; and to prepare for the aſſault.
The edifice was built with gothic mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence
upon a high and dangerous
rock. Its lofty towers ſtill frowned in
proud ſublimity, and the immenſity of
the pile stood a record of the ancient
conſequence of its poſſeſſors. The rock
was ſurrounded by a ditch, broad, but
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0149803000:41"/>
not deep, over which were two draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridges,
one on the north ſide, the
other on the eaſt; they were both
up, but they ſeparated in the center,
one half of the bridge remaining on
the ſide of the plains. The bridge on
the north led to the grand gateway of
the caſtle; that on the eaſt to a ſmall
watch-tower: theſe were all the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trances.
The rock was almoſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular
with the walls, which were
ſtrong and lofty. After ſurveying the
ſituation, they pitched upon a ſpot where
the rock appeared moſt acceſſible, and
which was contiguous to the principal
gate, and gave ſignal to the clan. They
approached in ſilence, and gently
throwing down the bundles of fag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got,
which they had brought for the
purpoſe, into the ditch, made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
a bridge over which they paſſed
in ſafety, and prepared to aſcend the
heights. It had been reſolved that a
party, of which Alleyn was one, ſhould
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0149803000:42"/>
ſcale the walls, ſurprize the centinels,
and open the gates to the reſt of the
clan, which with the Earl, were to
remain without. Alleyn was the firſt
who fixed his ladder and mounted;
he was inſtantly followed by the reſt of
his party, and with much difficulty,
and ſome hazard, they gained the ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts
in ſafety. They traverſed a part
of the platform without hearing the
ſound of a voice or a ſtep; profound
ſleep ſeemed to bury all. A number
of the party approached ſome centinels
who were aſleep on their poſt; them
they ſeized; while Alleyn, with a few
others, flew to open the neareſt gate,
and to let down the drawbridge. This
they accompliſhed; but in the mean
time the ſignal of ſurprize was given,
and inſtantly the alarm bell rang out,
and the castle reſounded with the clang
of arms. All was tumult and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.
The Earl with part of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0149803000:43"/>
entered the gate; the reſt were fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing,
when ſuddenly the portcullis
was dropped, the bridge drawn up, and
the Earl and his people found them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
ſurrounded by an armed multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
which poured in torrents from
every receſs of the caſtle. Surprized,
but not daunted, the Earl ruſhed for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
ſword in hand, and fought with
a deſperate valour. The ſoul of Alleyn
ſeemed to acquire new vigour from the
conflict; he fought like a man panting
for honour and certain of victory;
wherever he ruſhed, conqueſt flew before
him. He, with the Earl, forced his
way into the inner courts in ſearch of
the Baron, and hoped to have ſatisfied
a juſt revenge, and to have concluded
the conflict with the death of the
murderer; but the moment in which
they entered the courts, the gates were
cloſed upon them; they were environed
by a band of guards; and after a ſhort
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0149803000:44"/>
reſiſtance, in which Alleyn received a
ſlight wound, they were ſeized as pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners
of war. The ſlaughter without
was great and dreadful: the people of
the Baron inſpired with fury, were
inſatiate for death; many were killed
in the courts, and on the platform;
many, in attempting to eſcape, were
thrown from the ramparts; and many
were deſtroyed by the ſudden raiſing of
the bridge. A ſmall part, only, of
the brave and adventurous band who
had engaged in the cauſe of juſtice, and
who were driven back from the walls,
ſurvived to carry the dreadful tidings to
the Counteſs. The fate of the Earl
remained unknown. The conſternation
among the friends of the ſlain is not
to be deſcribed, and it was heightened
by the unaccountable manner in which
the victory had been obtained; for it was
well known that Malcolm had never,
but when war made it neceſſary, more
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0149803000:45"/>
ſoldiers in his garriſon than feudal
pomp demanded; yet on this occaſion,
a number of armed men ruſhed from
the receſſes of his caſtle, ſufficient to
overpower the force of a whole clan.
But they knew not the ſecret means of
intelligence which the Baron poſſeſſed;
the jealouſy of conſcience had armed
him with apprehenſion for his ſafety;
and for ſome years he had planted ſpies
near the caſtle of Athlin, to obſerve all
that paſſed within it, and to give him
immediate intelligence of every warlike
preparation. A tranſaction ſo ſtriking,
and ſo public as that which had oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred
on the day of the feſtival, when
the whole people ſwore to avenge the
murder of their Chief, it was not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
would eſcape the vigilant eye of
his mercenaries: the incident had been
communicated to him with all the
aggravations of fear and wonder, and
had given him the ſignal for defence.
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0149803000:46"/>
The accounts ſent him of the military
preparations which were forming, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
him that this defence would
soon be called for; and, laughing at the
idle tales which were told him of diſtant
wars, he haſtened to ſtore his garriſon
with arms and with men, and held him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
in readineſs to receive the aſſailants.
The Baron had conducted his plans with
all that power of contrivance which the
ſecrecy of the buſineſs demanded; and
it was his deſign to ſuffer the enemy to
mount his walls, and to put them to
the ſword, when the purpoſe of this
deep-laid ſtratagem had been nearly
defeated by the drowſineſs of the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinels
who were poſted to give ſignal of
their approach.</p>
            <p>The fortitude of Matilda fainted
under the preſſure of ſo heavy a cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity;
ſhe was attacked with a violent
illness, which had nearly terminated
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0149803000:47"/>
her ſorrows and her life; and had ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
unavailing all the tender cares of
her daughter. Theſe tender cares, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
were not ineffectual; ſhe revived,
and they aſſiſted to ſupport her in the
ſevere hours of affliction, which the
unknown fate of the Earl occasioned.
Mary, who felt all the horrors of the
late event, was ill qualified for the
poſt of a comforter; but her generous
heart, ſuſceptible of the deep ſufferings
of Matilda, almoſt forgot its own diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs
in the remembrance of her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's.
Yet the idea of her brother,
ſurrounded with the horrors of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment
and death, would often
obtrude itſelf on her imagination,
with an emphaſis which almoſt over-came
her reaſon. She had alſo a ſtrong
degree of pity for the fate of the
brave young Highlander who had
aſſiſted, with a diſintereſtedneſs ſo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
in the cauſe of her houſe; ſhe
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0149803000:48"/>
wiſhed to learn his further deſtiny,
and her heart often melted in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion
at the picture which her fancy
drew of his ſufferings.</p>

            <head>CHAPTER III.</head>
            <p>The Earl, after being loaded with
fetters, was conducted to the chief
priſon of the caſtle, and left alone
to the bitter reflections of defeat and
uncertain deſtiny; but misfortune,
though it might ſhake, could not over-come
his firmneſs; and hope had not
yet entirely forſaken him. It is the
peculiar attribute of great minds, to
bear up with increaſing force againſt
the ſhock of misfortune; with them
the nerves of reſiſtance ſtrengthen with
attack; and they may be ſaid to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due
adverſity with her own weapons.</p>
            <p>Reflection, at length, afforded him
time to examine his priſon: it was a
ſquare room, which formed the ſummit
of a tower built on the eaſt ſide of the
caſtle, round which the bleak winds
howled mournfully; the inſide of the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0149803000:50"/>
apartment was old and falling to decay:
a ſmall mattraſs, which lay in one cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of the room, a broken matted chair,
and a tottering table, compoſed its fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture;
two ſmall and ſtrongly grated
windows, which admitted a ſufficient
degree of light and air, afforded him
on one ſide a view into an inner court,
and on the other a dreary proſpect of
the wild and barren Highlands.</p>
            <p>Alleyn was conveyed through dark
and winding paſſages to a diſtant part
of the caſtle, where at length a ſmall
door, barred with iron, opened, and
diſcloſed to him an abode, whence light
and hope were equally excluded. He
ſhuddered as he entered, and the door
was cloſed upon him.</p>
            <p>The mind of the Baron, in the mean
time, was agitated with all the direful
paſſions of hate, revenge, and exulting
pride. He racked imagination for the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0149803000:51"/>
invention of tortures equal to the force
of his feelings; and he at length diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verod
that the ſufferings of ſuſpenſe are
ſuperior to thoſe of the moſt terrible
evils, when once aſcertained, of which
the contemplation gradually affords to
ſtrong minds the means of endurance.
He determined, therefore, that the Earl
ſhould remain confined in the tower,
ignorant of his future deſtiny; and in
the mean while ſhould be allowed food
only ſufficient to keep him ſenſible of
his wretchedneſs.</p>
            <p>Oſbert was immerſed in thought,
when he heard the door of his priſon
unbarred, and the Baron Malcolm ſtood
before him. The heart of Oſbert
ſwelled high with indignation, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance
flaſhed in his eyes. "I am come,"
ſaid the inſulting victor, "to welcome
the Earl of Athlin to my caſtle; and to
ſhew that I can receive my friends with
the hoſpitality they deſerve; but I am
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0149803000:52"/>
yet undetermined what kind of feſtival
I ſhall beſtow on his arrival."</p>
            <p>"Weak tyrant," returned Oſbert,
his countenance impreſſed with the firm
dignity of virtue, "to inſult the van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed,
is congenial to die cruel mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the murderer; nor do I expect,
that the man who ſlew the father, will
ſpare the ſon; but know, that ſon is
nerved againſt your wrath, and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
all that your fears or your cruelty
can impoſe."</p>
            <p>"Raſh youth," replied the Baron,
"your words are air; they fade from
ſenſe, and ſoon your boaſted ſtrength
ſhall ſink beneath my power. I go to
meditate your deſtiny." With theſe
words he quitted the priſon, enraged at
the unbending virtue of the Earl.</p>
            <p>The ſight of the Baron, rouſed in the
ſoul of Oſbert, all thoſe oppoſite emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0149803000:53"/>
of furious indignation and tender
pity, which the glowing image of his
ſather could excite, and produced a
moment of perfect miſery. The dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
energy of theſe ſenſations exaſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
his brain almoſt to madneſs; the
cool fortitude in which he had ſo lately
gloried, diſappeared; and he was on the
point of reſigning his virtue and his
life, by means of a ſhort dagger, which
he wore concealed under his veſt, when
the ſoft notes of a lute ſurpriſed his
attention. It was accompanied by a
voice ſo enchantingly tender and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodious,
that its ſounds fell on the heart
of Oſbert, in balmy comfort: it ſeemed
ſent by Heaven to arreſt his fate:—the
ſtorm of paſſion was huſhed within
him, and he diſſolved in kind tears of
pity and contrition. The mournful
tenderneſs of the air, declared the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
from whom it came to be a ſufferer;
and Oſbert ſuſpected it to proceed from
a priſoner like himſelf. The muſic
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0149803000:54"/>
ceaſed. Abſorbed in wonder, he went to
the grates in queſt of the ſweet muſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian,
but no one was to be ſeen; and
he was uncertain whether the ſounds
aroſe from within or from without the
caſtle. Of the guard, who brought
him his ſmall allowance of food, he
enquired concerning what he had heard;
but from him he could not obtain the
information he ſought, and he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained
to remain in a ſtate of ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the caſtle of Ath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin,
and its neighbourhood was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed
with diſtreſs. The news of the
Earl's impriſonment at length reached
the ears of the Counteſs, and hope once
more illumined her mind. She imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
ſent offers of immenſe ranſom
to the Baron, for the reſtoration of her
ſon, and the other priſoners; but the
ferocity of his nature diſdained an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complete
triumph. Revenge ſubdued
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0149803000:55"/>
his avarice; and the offers were rejected
with the ſpurn of contempt. An addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
motive, however, operated in his
mind, and confirmed his purpoſe. The
beauty of Mary had been often reporte
to him in terms which excited his curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity;
and an accidental view he once
obtained of her, raiſed a paſſion in his
ſoul, which the turbulence of his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
would not ſuffer to be extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed.
Various were the ſchemes he
had projected to obtain her, none of
which had ever been executed; the
poſſeſion of the Earl, was a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
the moſt favourable to his wiſhes;
and he reſolved to obtain Mary, as the
future ranſom of her brother. He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed,
for the preſent, his purpoſe,
that the tortures of anxiety and deſpair
might operate on the mind of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tess,
to grant him an eaſy conſent to the
exchange, and to reſign the victim the
wife of her enemy.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:0149803000:56"/>
The ſmall remains of the clan, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubdued
by misfortune, were eager to
aſſemble; and, hazardous as was the
enterprize, to attempt the reſcue of
their Chief. The hope which this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking
afforded, once more revived
the Counteſs; but alas! a new ſource
of ſorrow was now opened for her: the
health of Mary viſibly declined; ſhe
was ſilent and penſive; her tender
frame was but too ſuſceptible of the
ſufferings of her mind; and theſe ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
were heightened by concealment.
She was ordered amuſement and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
exerciſe, as the beſt reſtoratives of
peace and health. One day, as ſhe was
ſeeking on horſeback theſe loſt trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,
ſhe was tempted by the fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the evening to prolong her
ride beyond its uſual limits; the ſun
was declining when ſhe entered a wood,
whoſe awful glooms ſo well accorded
with the penſive tone of her mind. The
ſoft ſerenity of evening, and the ſtill
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0149803000:57"/>
ſolemity of the ſcene, conſpired to lull
her mind into a pleaſing forgetfulneſs of
its troubles; from which ſhe was, ere
long, awakened, by the approaching
ſound of horſes' feet. The thickneſs of
the ſoliage limited her view; but look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
onward, ſhe thought ſhe perceived
through the trees, a glittering of arms;
ſhe turned her palfrey, and ſought the
entrance of the wood. The clattering
of hoofs advanced in the breeze; her
heart miſgave her, and ſhe quickened
her pace. Her fears were ſoon juſtified;
ſhe looked back, and beheld three
horſemen, armed and diſguiſed, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing
with the ſpeed of purſuit.
Almoſt fainting, ſhe flew on the wings
of terror; all her efforts were vain; the
villains came up; one ſeized her horſe,
the others fell upon her two attendants:
a ſtout ſcuffle enſued, but the ſtrength of
her ſervants ſoon yielded to the weapons
of their adverſaries; they were brought to the
ground, dragged into the wood, and
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0149803000:58"/>
there left bound to the trees. In the
mean time, Mary, who had fainted in the
arms of the villain who ſeized her, was
borne away through the intricate mazes
of the woods; and her terrors may be
eaſily imagined, when ſhe revived, and
found herſelf in the hands of unknown
men. Her dreadful ſcreams, her tears,
her ſupplications, were ineffectual; the
wretches were deaf alike to pity and to
enquiry; they preſerved an inſlexible
ſilence, and ſhe ſaw herſelf conveying
towards the mouth of a horrible cavern,
when deſpair ſeized her mind, and ſhe
loſt all ſigns of exiſtence: in this ſtate
ſhe remained ſome time; but it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
to deſcribe her ſituation, when
ſhe uncloſed her eyes, and beheld Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leyn,
who was watching with the moſt
trembling anxiety her return to life,
and whoſe eyes, on ſeeing her revive,
ſwam in joy and tenderneſs. Wonder,
fearful joy, and the various ſhades of
mingled emotions, paſſed in quick ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0149803000:59"/>
over her countenance; her ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize
was increaſed, when ſhe obſerved
her own ſervants ſtanding by, and could
diſcover no one but friends. She
ſcarcely dared to truſt her ſenſes, but
the voice of Alleyn, tremulous with
tenderneſs, diſſolved in a moment the
illuſions of fear, and confirmed her in
the ſurpriſing reality. When ſhe was
ſufficiently recovered, they quitted this
ſcene of gloom; they travelled on in a
ſlow pace, and the ſhades of night were
fallen long before they reached the
caſtle; there diſtreſs and confuſion ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared.
The Counteſs, alarmed with
the moſt dreadful apprehenſions, had
diſpatched her ſervants various ways in
ſearch of her child, and her tranſports
on again beholding her in ſafety, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
her obſerving immediately that
it was Alleyn who accompanied her.
Joy, however, ſoon yielded to its equal
wonder, when ſhe perceived him, and
in the tumult of contending emotions,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0149803000:60"/>
ſhe ſcarce knew which firſt to interro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate.
When ſhe had been told the
eſcape of her daughter, and by whom
effected, ſhe prepared to hear with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient
ſolicitude, news of her beloved
ſon, and the means by which the brave
young Highlander had eluded the vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance
of the Baron. Of the Earl, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leyn
could only inform the Counteſs,
that he was taken priſoner with himſelf,
within the walls of the fortreſs, as they
fought ſide by ſide; that he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted,
unwounded, to a tower, ſituated
on the eaſt angle of the caſtle, where he
was ſtill confined. Himſelf had been
impriſoned in a diſtant part of the pile,
and had been able to collect no other
particulars of the Earl's ſituation, than
thoſe he had related. Of himſelf, he
gave a brief relation of the following
circumſtances:</p>
            <p>After having lain ſome weeks in the
horrible dungeon allotted him, his
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0149803000:61"/>
mind involved in the gloom of deſpair,
and filled with the momentary expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of death, deſperation furniſhed him
with invention, and he concerted the
following plan of eſcape:—He had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,
that the guard who brought
him his allowance of food, on quitting
the dungeon, conſtantly ſounded his
ſpear againſt: the pavement near the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance.
This circumſtance excited his
ſurprize and curioſity. A ray of hope
beamed through the gloom of his dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon.
He examined the ſpot, as well
as the obſcurity of the place would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit;
it was paved with flag ſtones like
the other parts of the cell, and the
paving was every where equally firm.
He, however, became certain, that ſome
means of eſcape was concealed beneath
that part, for the guard was conſtant in
examining it by ſtriking that ſpot, and
treading more firmly on it; and this he
endeavoured to do without being ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved.
One day, immediately after
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0149803000:62"/>
the departure of the guard, Alleyn ſet
himſelf to unfaſten the pavement; this,
with much patience and induſtry, he
effected, by means of a ſmall knife which
had eſcaped the ſearch of the ſoldiers.
He found the earth beneath hard, and
without any ſymtoms of being lately
diſturbed; but after digging a few feet,
he arrived at a trap door; he trembled
with eagerneſs. It was now almoſt night,
and he was overcome with wearineſs;
he doubted whether he ſhould be able
to penetrate through the door, and
what other obſtructions were behind it,
before the next day. He therefore,
threw the earth again into the hole, and
endeavoured to cloſe the pavement;
with much difficulty, he trod the earth
into the opening, but the pavement he
was unable exactly to replace. It was
too dark to examine the ſtones; and he
found, that even if he ſhould be able to
make them fit, the pavement could not
be made firm. His mind and body
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0149803000:63"/>
were now overcome, and he threw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
on the ground in an agony of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair.
It was midnight, when the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
of his ſtrength and ſpirits produced
another effort. He tore the earth up
with haſty violence, cut round the lock
of the trap door, and railing it, unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to heſitate or conſider, ſprung
through the aperture. The vault was
of conſiderable depth, and he was
thrown down by the violence of the
fall: an hollow echo, which ſeemed to
murmur at a diſtance, convinced him
that the place was of conſiderable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.
He had no light to direct him,
and was therefore, obliged to walk with
his arms extended, in ſilent and fearful
examination. After having wandered
through the void a conſiderable time, he
came to a wall, along which he groped
with anxious care; it conducted him
onward for a length of way; it turned;
he followed, and his hand touched the
cold iron work of a barred window.
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0149803000:64"/>
He felt the gentle undulation of the air
upon his face; and to him who had been
ſo long confined among the damp va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours
of a dungeon, this was a moment
of luxury. The air gave him ſtrength;
and the means of eſcape, which now
ſeemed preſented to him, renewed his
courage. He ſet his foot againſt the
wall, and graſping a bar with his hand,
found it gradually yield to his ſtrength,
and by ſucceſſive efforts, he entirely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placed
it. He attempted another, but
it was more firmly fixed, and every
effort to looſen it was ineffectual; he
found that it was faſtened in a large
ſtone of the wall, and that to remove
this ſtone, was his only means of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placing
the bar; he ſet himſelf, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
again to work with his knife, and
with much patience, looſened the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar
ſufficiently to effect his purpoſe.
After ſome hours, for the darkneſs made
his labour tedious, and ſometimes inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual,
he had removed ſeveral of the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0149803000:65"/>
bars, and had made an opening almoſt
ſufficient to permit his eſcape, when the
dawn of light appeared; he now diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered,
with inexpreſſible anguiſh, that
the grate opened into an inner court of
the caſtle, and even while he heſitated,
he could perceive ſoldiers deſcending
ſlowly into the court, from the narrow
ſtaircaſes which led to their apartments.
His heart ſickened at the ſight. He
reſted againſt the wall in a pauſe of
deſpair, and was on the point of ſpring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into the court, to make a deſperate
effort at eſcape, or die in the attempt,
when he perceived by the increaſing
light which fell acroſs the vault, a maſſy
door in the oppoſite wall; he ran to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
it, and endeavoured to open it; it
was faſtened by a lock and ſeveral bolts.
He ſtruck againſt it with his foot, and
the hollow ſound which was returned,
convinced him that there were vaults
beyond; and by the direction of theſe
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0149803000:66"/>
vaults, he was certain that they muſt
extend to the outer walls of the caſtle;
if he could gain theſe vaults, and pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate
beyond them in the darkneſs of
the enſuing night, it would be eaſy to
leap the wall, and croſs the ditch; but
it was impoſſible to cut away the lock,
before the return of his guard, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly
viſited the cell ſoon after the
dawn of day. After ſome conſideration,
therefore, he determined to ſecrete him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
in a dark part of the vault, and
there await the entrance of the guard,
who on obſerving the deranged bars of
the grate, would conclude, that he had
eſcaped through the aperture. He had
ſcarcely placed himſelf according to his
plan, when he heard the door of the
dungeon unbolted; this was inſtantly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
by a loud voice, which ſounded
down the opening, and "Alleyn" was
ſhouted in a tone of fright and conſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.
After repeating the call, a man
jumped into the vault. Alleyn, though
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0149803000:67"/>
himſelf concealed in darkneſs, could
perceive, by the faint light which fell
upon the ſpot, a ſoldier with a drawn
ſword in his hand. He approached the
grate with execrations, examined it,
and proceeded to the door; it was faſt;
he returned to the grate, and then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
along the walls, tracing them
with the point of his ſword. He at
length approached the ſpot where Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leyn
was concealed, who felt the ſword
ſtrike upon his arm, and inſtantly graſp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the hand which held it, the weapon
fell to the ground. A ſhort ſcuffle en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued;
Alleyn threw down his adverſary,
and ſtanding over him, ſeized the ſword,
and preſented it to his breaſt; the ſoldier
called for mercy. Alleyn, always unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to take the life of another, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
that if the ſoldier was ſlain, his
comrades would certainly follow to the
vault, returned him his ſword. "Take
your life," ſaid he, "your death can
avail me nothing;—take it, and if you
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0149803000:68"/>
can, go tell Malcolm, that an innocent
man has endeavoured to eſcape deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion."
The guard, ſtruck with his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct,
aroſe from the ground in ſilence,
he received his ſword, and followed Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leyn
to the trap door. They returned
into the dungeon, where Alleyn was
once more left alone. The ſoldier, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determined
how to act, went to find his
comrades; on the way he met Malcolm,
who, ever reſtleſs and vigilant, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
walked the ramparts at an early
hour. He enquired if all was well.
The ſoldier, fearful of diſcovery, and
unaccuſtomed to diſſemble, heſitated at
the queſtion; and the ſtern air aſſumed
by Malcolm, compelled him to relate
what had happened. The Baron, with
much harſhneſs, reprobated his neglect,
and immediately followed him to the
dungeon, where he loaded Alleyn with
inſult. He examined the cell, deſcended
into the vault, and returning to the
dungeon, ſtood by, while a chain, which
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0149803000:69"/>
had been fetched from a diſtant part of
the caſtle, was fixed into the wall;—to
this Alleyn was faſtened. "We will
not long confine you thus," ſaid Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colm,
as he quitted the cell, "a ſew
days ſhall reſtore you to the liberty you
are ſo fond of; but as a conqueror
ought to have ſpectators of his triumph,
you muſt wait till a number is collected
ſufficient to witneſs the death of ſo great
an hero." "I diſdain your inſults,"
returned Alleyn, "and am equally able
to ſupport misfortune, and to deſpiſe a
tyrant." Malcolm retired, enraged at
the boldneſs of his priſoner, and utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
menaces on the careleſſneſs of the
guard, who vainly endeavoured to juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify
himſelf. "His ſafety be upon
your head," ſaid the Baron. The ſoldier
was ſhocked, and turned away in ſullen
ſilence. Dread of his priſoners eftect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
an eſcape, now ſeized his mind;
the words of Malcolm filled him with
reſentment, while gratitude towards
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0149803000:70"/>
Alleyn, for the life he had ſpared, ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
with theſe ſentiments, and he he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitated
whether he ſhould obey the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,
or deliver Alleyn, and fly his op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſor.
At noon, he carried him his
cuſtomary food; Alleyn was not ſo loſt
in miſery, but that he obſerved the
gloom which hung upon his features;
his heart foreboded impending evil:
the ſoldier bore on his tongue the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of death. He told Alleyn, that
the Baron had appointed the following
day for his execution; and his people
were ordered to attend. Death, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
long contemplated, muſt he dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
when it arrives; this was no more
than what Alleyn had expected, and on
what he had brought his mind to gaze
without terror; but his fortitude now
ſunk before its immediate preſence, and
every nerve of his frame thrilled with
agony. "Be comforted," ſaid the ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier,
in a tone of pity, "I, too, am no
ſtranger to miſery; and if you are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0149803000:71"/>
to riſque the danger of double
torture, I will attempt to releaſe both
you and myſelf from the hands of a
tyrant." At theſe words, Alleyn ſtarted
from the ground in a tranſport of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful
wonder: "Tell me not of
torture," cried he, "all tortures are
equal if death is the end, and from
death 1 may now eſcape; lead me but
beyond theſe walls, and the ſmall poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions
I have, ſhall be your's for ever."
"I want them not," replied the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
ſoldier, "it is enough for me, that
I ſave a fellow-creature from deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion."
Theſe words overpowered the
heart of Alleyn, and tears of gratitude
ſwelled in his eyes. Edric told him, that
the door he had ſeen in the vault below,
opened into a chain of vaults, which
ſtretched beyond the wall of the caſtle,
and communicated with a ſubterraneous
way, anciently formed as a retreat from
the fortreſs, and which terminated in
the cavern of a foreſt at ſome diſtance.
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0149803000:72"/>
If this door could be opened, their
eſcape was almoſt certain. They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted
on the meaſures neceſſary to be
taken. The ſoldier gave Alleyn a
knife larger than the one he had, and
directed him to cut round the lock,
which was all that with-held their paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage.
Edric's office of centinel, was
propitious to their ſcheme, and it was
agreed that at midnight they ſhould
deſcend the vaults. Edric, after hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
unfaſtened the chain, left the cell,
and Alleyn ſet himſelf again to remove
the pavement, which had been already
re-placed by order of the Baron. The
near proſpect of deliverance now glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened
his ſpirits; his knife was better
formed for his purpoſe; and he worked
with alacrity and eaſe. He arrived at
the trap door, and once more leaped into
the vault. He applied himſelf to the
lock of the door, which was extremely
thick, and it was with difficulty he ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
them; with trembling hands he
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0149803000:73"/>
the bolts, the door uncloſed, and diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
to him the vaults. It was even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
when he finiſhed his work: He
was but juſt returned to the dungeon,
and had thrown himſelf on the ground
to reſt, when the ſound of a diſtant ſtep-caught
his ear; he liſtened to its ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
with trembling eagerneſs. At
length the door was unbolted; Alleyn
breathleſs with expectation, ſtarted up,
and beheld not his ſoldier, but another;
the opening was again diſcovered, and
all was now over. The ſoldier brought
a pitcher of water, and caſting round
the place a look, of ſullen ſcrutiny, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
in ſilence. The ſtretch of human
endurance was now exceeded, and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leyn
ſunk dawn in a ſtate of torpidity.
On recovering, he found himſelf again
enveloped in the horrors of darkneſs,
ſilence, and deſpair. Yet amid all his
ſufferings, he diſdained to doubt the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity
of his ſoldier: we naturally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coil
from painful ſenſations, and it is
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0149803000:74"/>
one of the moſt exquiſite tortures of a
noble mind, to doubt the ſincerity of
thoſe in whom it has confided. Alleyn
concluded, that the converſation of the
morning had been overheard, and that
this guard had been ſent to examine the
cell, and to watch his movements. He
believed that Edric was now, by his
own generoſity, involved in deſtruction;
and in the energy of this thought, he
forgot for a moment his own ſituation.</p>
            <p>Midnight came, but Edric did not
appear; his doubts were now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
into certainty, and he reſigned
himſelf to the horrid tranquillity of
mute deſpair. He heard from a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
the clock of the caſtle ſtrike one;
it ſeemed to ſound the knell of death;
it rouſed his benumbed ſenſes, and he
roſe from the ground in an agony of
acuteſt recollection. Suddenly he heard
the ſteps of two perſons advancing
down the avenue; he ſtarted, and liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened.
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0149803000:75"/>
Malcolm and murder, aroſe to
his mind; he doubted not that the
ſoldier had reported what he had ſeen in
the evening, and that the perſons whom
he now heard, were coming to execute
the final orders of the Baron. They
now drew near the dungeon, when ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
he remembered the door in the
vault. His ſenſes had been ſo ſtunned
by the appearance of the ſtranger, and
his mind ſo occupied with a feeling of
deſpair, as to exclude every idea of
eſcape; and in the energy of his ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
he had forgot this laſt reſource; it
now flaſhed like lightning upon his
mind; he ſprung to the trap door, and
his feet had ſcarcely touched the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
of the vault, when he heard the
bolts of the dungeon undraw; he had
juſt reached the entrance of the inner
vault, when a voice founded from above;
he pauſed, and knew it to be Edric's;
apprehenſion ſo entirely poſſeſſed his
mind, that he heſitated whether he
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0149803000:76"/>
ſhould diſcover himſelf, but a moment
of recollection diſſipated every ignoble
ſuſpicion of Edric's fidelity, and he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
the call. Immediately Edric
deſcended, followed by the ſoldier
whoſe former appearance had filled Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leyn
with deſpair, and whom Edric
now introduced as his faithful friend
and comrade, who like himſelf, was
weary of the oppreſſion of Malcolm,
and who had reſolved to fly with them,
and eſcape his rigour. This was a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of happineſs too great for thought!
Alleyn, in the confuſion of his joy,
and in his impatience to ſeize the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of deliverance, ſcarcely heard the
words of Edric. Edric having returned
to faſten the door of the dungeon, to
delay purſuit, and given Alleyn a ſword
which he had brought for him, led the
way through the vaults. The profound
ſilence of the place, was interrupted
only by the echoes of their footſteps,
which running through the dreary
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:0149803000:77"/>
chaſms in confuſed whiſperings, filled
their imaginations with terror. In tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing
theſe gloomy and deſolate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes,
they often pauſed to liſten, and
often did their fears give them the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
ſounds of purſuit. On quitting
the vaults, they entered an avenue,
winding, and of conſiderable length,
from whence branched ſeveral paſſages
into the rock; it was cloſed by a low
and narrow door, which opened upon a
flight of ſteps, that led to the ſubterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous
way under the ditch of the caſtle.
Edric knew the intricacies of the place:
they entered, and cloſing the door, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to deſcend, when the lamp which
Edric carried in his hand was blown
out by the current of the wind, and
they were left in total darkneſs. Their
feelings may be more eaſily imagined
than expreſſed; they had, however, no
way but to proceed, and grope with
cautious ſteps the dark abyſs. Having
continued to deſcend for ſome time,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0149803000:78"/>
their feet reached the bottom, and they
found themſelves once more on even
ground; but Edric knew they had yet
another flight to encounter, before they
could gain the ſubterraneous paſſage
under the foſſé, and for which it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
their utmoſt caution to ſearch.
They were proceeding with flow and
wary ſteps, when the foot of Alleyn
ſtumbled upon ſomething which clat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
like broken armour, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
to throw it from him, he felt
the weight reſiſt his effort: he ſtooped
to diſcover what it was, and found in
his graſp the cold hand of a dead per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.
Every nerve thrilled with horror
at the touch, and he ſtarted back in an
agony of terror. They remained for
ſome time in ſilent diſmay, unable to
return, yet fearful to proceed, when a
faint light which ſeemed to iſſue from
the bottom of the laſt: deſcent, gleamed
upon the walls, and diſcovered to them
the ſecond ſtaircaſe, and at their feet
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0149803000:79"/>
the pale and disfigured corpſe of a man
in armour, while at a diſtance they
could diſtinguiſh the figures of men.
At this ſight their hearts died within
them, and they gave themſelves up for
loſt. They doubted not but the men
whom they ſaw were the murderers;
that they belonged to the Baron; and
were in ſearch of ſome fugitives from
the caſtle. Their only chance of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealment
was to remain where they
were; but the light appeared to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance,
and the faces of the men to turn
towards them. Winged with terror,
they ſought the firſt aſcent, and flying
up the ſteps, reached the door, which
they endeavoured to open, that they
might hide themſelves from purſuit
among the intricacies of the rock; their
efforts, however, were vain, for the
door was faſtened by a ſpring lock, and
the key was on the other ſide; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
to give breath to their fears, they
ventured to look back, and found them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0149803000:80"/>
again in total darkneſs; they
pauſed upon the ſteps, and liſtening, all
was ſilent. They reſted here a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
time; no footſteps ſtartled
them; no ray of light darted through
the gloom; everything ſeemed huſhed
in the ſilence of death: they reſolved
once more to venture forward; they
gained again the bottom of the firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent,
and ſhuddering as they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached
the ſpot where they knew the
corpſe was laid, they groped to avoid
its horrid touch, when ſuddenly the
light again appeared, and in the ſame
place wnere they had firſt ſeen it. They
ſtood petrified with deſpair. The light,
however, moved ſlowly onward, and
diſappeared in the windings of the ave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue.
After remaining a long time in
ſilent ſuſpenſe, and finding no further
obſtacle, they ventured to proceed. The
light had diſcovered to them their ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,
and the ſtaircaſe, and they now
moved with greater certainty. They
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:0149803000:81"/>
reached the bottom in ſafety, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any fearful interruption; they liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened,
and again the ſilence of the
place was undiſturbed. Edric knew
they were now under the foſſé, their
way was plain before them, and their
hopes were renewed in the belief, that
the light and the people they had ſeen,
had taken a different direction, Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ric
knowing there were various paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages
branching from the main avenue
which led to different openings in the
rock. They now ſtepped on with ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crity,
the proſpect of deliverance was
near, for Edric judged they were now not
far from the cavern; an abrupt
turning in the paſſage confirmed at
once this ſuppoſition, and extinguiſhed
the hope which had attended it; for the
light of a lamp burſt ſuddenly upon
them, and exhibited to their ſickening
eyes, the figures of four men in an atti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of menace, with their ſwords
pointed ready to receive them. Alleyn
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0149803000:82"/>
drew his ſword and advanced, "We will
die hardly," cried he. At the ſound
of his voice, the weapons inſtantly
dropped from the hands of his adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
and they advanced to meet hin in
a tranſport of joy. Alleyn recognized
with aſtoniſhment, in the faces of the
three ſtrangers, his faithful friends and
followers; and Edric in that of the
fourth, a fellow ſoldier. The ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
had aſſembled them all in the
ſame ſpot. They quitted the cave to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether;
and Alleyn in the joyful expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
of unexpected deliverance, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
never more to admit deſpair.
They concluded, that the body which
they had paſſed in the avenue, was that
of ſome perſon who had periſhed either
by hunger or by the ſword in thoſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terranean
labyrinths.</p>
            <p>They marched in company till they
came within a few miles of the caſtle of
Athlin, when Alleyn made known his
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0149803000:83"/>
deſign of collecting his friends, and
joining the clan in an attempt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe
the Earl; Edric, and the other
ſoldier, having ſolemnly inliſted in the
cauſe, they parted; Alleyn and Edric
purſuing the road to the caſtle, and the
others ſtriking off to a different part of
the country. Alleyn and Edric had not
proceeded far, when the groans of the
wounded ſervants of Matilda drew them
to the wood, in which the preceding
dreadful ſcene had been acted. The
ſurprize of Alleyn was extreme, when
he diſcovered the ſervants of the Earl
in this ſituation; but ſurprize ſoon
yielded to a more poignant ſenſation,
when he heard that Mary had been car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
off by armed men. He ſcarcely
waited to releaſe the ſervants, but ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
one of their horſes which was graz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
near, inſtantly mounted, ordering
the reſt to follow, and took the way
which had been pointed as the courſe of
the raviſhers. Fortunately it was the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:0149803000:84"/>
right direction; and Alleyn and the
ſoldier came up with them as they were
haſtening to the mouth of that cavern,
whoſe frightful aſpect had chilled the
heart of Mary with a temporary death.
Their endeavours to fly were vain; they
were overtaken at the entrance; a ſharp
conflict enſued, in which one of the
ruffians was wounded and ſled; his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rades
ſeeing the ſervants of the Earl ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching,
relinquiſhed their prize, and
eſcaped through the receſſes of the cave.
The eyes of Alleyn were now fixed in
horror on the lifeleſs form of Mary,
who had remained inſenſible during the
whole of the affray; he was exerting
every effort for her recovery, when ſhe
uncloſed her eyes, and joy once move
illumined his ſoul.</p>
            <p>During the recital of theſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
which Alleyn delivered with a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt
brevity, the mind of Mary had ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
a variety of emotions ſympathetic
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:0149803000:85"/>
to all the viciſſitudes of his ſituation.
She endeavoured to conceal from herſelf
the particular intereſt ſhe felt in his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures,
but ſo unequal were her ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
to the ſtrength of her emotions,
that when Alleyn related the ſcene of
Dunbayne cavern, her cheek grew pale,
and ſhe relapſed into a fainting fit.
This circumſtance alarmed the penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Counteſs; but the known
weakneſs of her daughter's frame ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
a probable cauſe of the diſorder,
and repreſſed her firſt apprehenſion. It
gave to Alleyn a mixed delight of hope
and fear, ſuch as he had never known
before; for the firſt time he dared to
acknowledge to his own heart that he
loved, and that heart for the firſt time
thrilled with the hope of being loved again.</p>
            <p>He received from the Counteſs, the
warm over-flowings of a heart grateful
for the preſervation of its child, and
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:0149803000:86"/>
from Mary a bluſh which ſpoke more
than her tongue could utter. But the
minds of all were involved in the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
perplexity concerning the rank
and the identity of the author of the
plan, nor could they diſcover any clue
which would lead them through this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate
maze of wonder, to the villain
who had fabricated ſo diabolical a
ſcheme. Their ſuſpicions, at length,
reſted upon the Baron Malcolm, and
this ſuppoſition was confirmed by the
appearance of the horſemen, who evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
acted only as the agents of ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
power. Their conjectures were
indeed juſt. Malcolm was the author
of the ſcheme. It had been planned,
and he had given orders to his people to
execute it long before the Earl fell into
his hands. They had, however, found
no opportunity of accompliſhing the
deſign when the caſtle was ſurprized,
and in the conſequent tumult of his
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:0149803000:87"/>
mind, the Baron had forgot to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
his orders.</p>
            <p>Alleyn expreſſed his deſign of col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting
the ſmall remnant of his friends,
and uniting with the clan in attempting
the reſcue of the Earl. "Noble youth,"
exclaimed the Counteſs, unable longer
to repreſs her admiration, "how can I
ever repay your generous ſervices! Am
I then to receive both my children at
your hands? Go—my clan are now col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting
for a ſecond attempt upon the
walls of Dunbayne,—go! lead them to
conqueſt, and reſtore to me my ſon."
The languid eyes of Mary re-kindled
at theſe words, ſhe glowed with the
hope of claſping once more to her bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom
her long loſt brother; but the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſions
of hope were ſoon chaced by the
chilly touch of fear, for it was Alleyn
who was to lead the enterprize, and it
was Alleyn who might fall in the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt.
Theſe contrary emotions un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veiled
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:0149803000:88"/>
to her at once the ſtate of her
affections, and ſhe ſaw in the eye of
fancy, the long train of inquietudes and
ſorrows which were likely to enſue.
She ſought to obliterate from her mind
every remembrance of the paſt, and of
the fatal knowledge which was now
diſcloſed to her, but ſhe ſought in vain,
for the monitor in her breaſt conſtantly
preſented to her mind the image of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leyn,
adorned with thoſe brave and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
virtues which had ſo eminently diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed
his conduct; the inſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cance
of the peaſant was loſt in the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of the character, and every effort
at forgetfulneſs was baffled.</p>
            <p>Alleyn paſſed that night at the caſtle,
and the next morning, after taking leave
of the Counteſs and her daughter, to
whom his eyes bade a reſpectful and
mournful adieu, he departed with Edric,
for his father's cottage, impatient to
acquaint the good old man with his
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:0149803000:89"/>
ſafety, and to rouſe to arms his ſlum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bering
friends. The breath of love
had now raiſed into flame thoſe
ſparks of ambition which had ſo long
been kindling in his breaſt; he was
not only eager to avenge the cauſe of
injured virtue, and to reſcue from mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery
and death, the ſon of the Chief
whom he had been ever taught to reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
but he panted to avenge the
inſult offered to his miſtreſs, and to
atchieve ſome deed of valour worthy
her admiration and her thanks.</p>
            <p>Alleyn found his father at break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt,
with his niece at his ſide; his
face was darkened with ſorrow, and
he did not perceive Alleyn when he
entered. The joy of the old man
almoſt overcame him, when he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
his ſon in ſafety, for he was the
ſolace of his declining years; and Edric
was welcomed with the heartineſs of
an old friend.</p>

            <p>MEANWHILE the Earl remained
a ſolitary priſoner in the tower;
uncertain fate was yet ſuſpended over
him; he had, however, a magnanimity
in his nature which baffled much of the
cruel effort of the Baron. He had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
his mind by habitual contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for the worſt, and although that
worſt was death, he could now look to
it even with ſerenity. Thoſe violent
tranſports which had aſſailed him on
ſight of the Baron, were, ſince he was
no longer ſubject to his preſence, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
within their proper limits; yet
he anxiouſly avoided dwelling on the
memory of his father, left thoſe dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
ſenſations ſhould threaten him with
returning torture. Whenever he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
himſelf to think of the ſufferings
of the Counteſs and his ſiſter, his heart
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:0149803000:91"/>
melted with a ſorrow that almoſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerved
him; much he wiſhed to know
how they ſupported this trial, and much
he wiſhed that he could convey to them
intelligence of his ſtate. He endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to abſtract his mind from his
ſituation, and ſought to make himſelf
artificial comforts even from the barren
objects around him; his chief amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was in obſerving the manners and
cuſtoms of the birds of prey which
lodged themſelves in the battlements of
his tower, and the rapacity of their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
furniſhed him with too juſt a paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel
to the habits of men.</p>
            <p>As he was one day ſtanding at the
grate which looked upon the caſtle,
obſerving the progreſs of theſe birds,
his ear caught the ſound of that ſweet
lute whoſe notes had once ſaved him
from destruction; it was accompanied
by the ſame melodious voice he had
formerly heard, and which now ſung
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:0149803000:92"/>
with impaſſioned tenderneſs the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
air:</p>
            <lg>
               <l>When firſt the vernal morn of life,</l>
               <l>Beam'd on ray infant eye,</l>

            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Hope's bright illuſions touch'd my ſoul,</l>
               <l>My young ideas led;</l>
               <l>And Fancy's vivid tints combin'd,</l>

            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>My guileleſs heart expanded wide,</l>
               <l>With filial fondneſs fraught;</l>
               <l>Paternal love that heart ſupplied</l>
               <l>With all its fondneſs ſought.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But O! the cruel, quick reverſe!</l>
               <l>Fate all I lov'd involv'd;</l>
               <l>Pale Grief Hope's trembling rays diſpers'd,</l>
               <l>And Fancy's dreams diſſolv'd.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>Loſt in ſurprize, Oſbert ſtood for
ſome time looking down upon an inner
court, whence the ſounds ſeemed to
ariſe; after a few minutes he obſerved
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:0149803000:93"/>
a young lady enter from that ſide on
which the tower aroſe, on her arm reſted
an elder one, in whoſe face might be
traced the lines of decaying beauty, but
it was viſible from the melancholy
which clouded her features, that the
finger of affliction had there anticipated
the ravages of time. She was dreſſed
in the habit of a widow, and the black
veil which ſhaded her forehead, and
gave a fine expreſſion to her counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
devolved upon the ground in a
length of train, and heightened the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
majeſty of her figure; ſhe moved
with ſlow ſteps, and was ſupported by
the young lady whoſe veil half diſcloſed
a countenance where beauty was touched
with ſorrow and inimitable expreſſion;
the elegance of her form, and the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of her air, proclaimed her to be of
diſtinguiſhed rank. On her arm was
hung that lute, whoſe melody had juſt
charmed the attention of the Earl, who
was now fixed in wonder at what he
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:0149803000:94"/>
beheld, that was equalled only by his
admiration. They retired through a
gate on the oppoſite ſide of the court,
and were ſeen no more. Oſbert fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
them with his eyes, which for
ſome time remained fixed upon the
door through which they had diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared,
almoſt inſenſible of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture.
When he returned to himſelf,
he diſcovered, as if for the firſt time,
that he was in ſolitude. He conjectured
that theſe ſtrangers were confined by
the oppreſſive power of the Baron, and
his eyes were ſuffuſed with tears of pity.
When he conſidered that ſo much beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and dignity were the unreſiſting vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tims
of a tyrant, his heart ſwelled high
with indignation, his priſon became in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable
to him, and he longed to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
at once the champion of virtue,
and the deliverer of oppreſſed innocence.
The character of Malcolm aroſe to his
mind black with accumulated guilt,
and aggravated the deteſtation with
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:0149803000:95"/>
which he had ever contemplated it:
the hateful idea nerved his ſoul with a
confidence of revenge. Of the guard,
who entered, he enquired concerning
the ſtrangers, but could obtain no poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
anſwer; he came to impart other
news; to prepare the Earl for death;
for the morrow was appointed for his
execution. He received the intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
with the firm hardihood of indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
virtue, diſdaining to ſolicit, and
diſdaining to repine; and his mind yet
graſped the idea of revenge. He drove
from his thoughts with precipitation,
the tender idea of his mother and ſiſter;
remembrances which would ſubdue his
fortitude, without effecting any benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
purpoſe. He was told of the eſcape
of Alleyn; this intelligence gave him
inexpreſſible pleaſure, and he knew this
faithful youth would undertake to
avenge his death.</p>
            <p>When the news of Alleyn's flight
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:0149803000:96"/>
had reached the Baron, his ſoul was
ſtung with rage, and he called for the
guards of the dungeon; they were no
where to be found; and after a long
ſearch it was known that they were ſled
with their priſoner: the flight of the
other captives was alſo diſcovered. This
circumſtance exaſperated the paſſion of
Malcolm to the utmoſt, and he gave
orders that the life of the remaining
centinel ſhould be forfeited for the
treachery of his comrades, and his own
negligence; when recollecting the Earl,
whom in the heat of his reſentment he
had forgot, his heart exulted in the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
he afforded of complete re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge;
and in the fullneſs of joy with
which he pronounced his ſentence, he
retracted the condemnation of the trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
guard. The moment after he had
diſpatched the meſſenger with his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve
to the Earl, his heart faultered
from its purpoſe. Such is the alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
violence of evil paſſions, that they
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:0149803000:97"/>
never ſuffer their ſubjects to act with
conſiſtency, but torn by conflicting
energies, the gratification of one pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſity
is deſtruction to the enjoyment
of another; and the moment in which
they imagine happineſs in their graſp,
is to them the moment of diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Thus it was with the Baron;
his ſoul ſeemed to attain its full enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in the contemplation of revenge,
till the idea of Mary inflamed his heart
with an oppoſite paſſion; his wiſhes had
caught new ardor from diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
for he had heard that Mary had
been once in the power of his emiſſaries;
and perhaps the pain which recoils,
upon the mind from every fruitleſs effort
of wickedneſs, ſerved to encreaſe the
energies of his deſires. He ſpurned
the thought of relinquiſhing the purſuit,
yet there appeared to he no method of
obtaining its object but by ſacrificing
his favourite paſſion; for he had little
doubt of obtaining Mary, when it ſhould
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:0149803000:98"/>
be known that he reſolved not to grant
the life of the Earl upon any other ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom.
The balance of theſe paſſions
hung in his mind in ſuch nice equili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brium,
that it was for ſome time uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
which would preponderate; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,
at length, yielded to love; but
he reſolved to preſerve the torture of
expected death, by keeping the Earl
ignorant of his reprieve till the laſt
moment.</p>
            <p>The Earl awaited death with the ſame
ſtern fortitude with which he received
its ſentence, and was led from the tower
to the platform of the caſtle, ſilent and
unmoved. He beheld the preparations
for his execution, the inſtruments of
death, the guards arranged in files, with
an eye undaunted. The glare of exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals
had no longer power over his ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination.
He beheld every object with
indifference, but that on which his eye
now reſted; it was on the murderer,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:0149803000:99"/>
who exhibited himſelf in all the pride
of exulting conqueſt: he ſtarted at the
ſight, and his ſoul ſhrunk back upon
itſelf. Diſdaining, however, to appear
diſconcerted, he endeavoured to reſume
his dignity, when the remembrance of
his mother, overwhelmed with ſorrow,
ruſhed upon his mind, and quite un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manned
him; the tears ſtarted in his
eyes, and he ſunk ſenſeleſs on the
ground.</p>
            <p>On recovering, he found himſelf in
his priſon, and he was informed that the
Baron had granted him a reſpite. Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colm
miſtaking the cauſe of diſorder in
the Earl, thought he had ſtretched his
ſufferings to their utmoſt limits; he
therefore had ordered him to be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed
to the tower.</p>
            <p>A ſcene ſo ſtriking and ſo public as
that which had juſt been performed at
the caſtle of Dunbayne, was a ſubject of
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:0149803000:100"/>
diſcourſe to the whole country; it was
ſoon reported to the Counteſs with a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
of additional circumſtances, among
which it was affirmed that the Earl had
been really executed. Overwhelmed
with this intelligence, Matilda relapſed
into her former diſorder. Sickneſs had
rendered Mary leſs able to ſupport the
ſhock, and to apply that comfort to the
afflictions of her mother, which had
once been ſo ſucceſsfully adminiſtered.
The phyſician pronounced the malady
of the Counteſs to be ſeated in the
mind, and beyond the reach of human
ſkill, when one day a letter was brought
to her, the ſuperſcription of which
was written in the hand of Oſbert; ſhe
knew the characters, and burſting the
ſeal, read that her ſon was yet alive,
and did not deſpair of throwing himſelf
once more at her feet. He requeſted
that the remains of his clan might im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
attempt his releaſe. He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
in what part of the caſtle his
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:0149803000:101"/>
priſon was ſituated, and thought that by
the aſſiſtance of long ſcaling ladders and
ropes, contrived in the manner he
directed, he might be able to effect his
eſcape through the grate. This letter
was a reviving cordial to the Counteſs
and to Mary.</p>
            <p>Alleyn was indefatigable in collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
followers for the enterprize he had
engaged in. On receiving intelligence
of the ſafety of the Earl, he viſited the
clan, and was ſtrenuous in exhorting
them to immediate action. They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
little incitement to a cauſe in
which every heart was ſo much inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted,
and for which every hand was
already buſied in preparation. Theſe
preparations were at length completed;
Alleyn, at the head of his party, joined
the aſſembled clan. The Counteſs for
a ſecond time beheld from the ramparts
the departure of her people upon the
ſame hazardous enterprize; the preſent
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:0149803000:102"/>
ſcene revived in her mind a ſad remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of the paſt; the ſame tender
fears, and the ſame prayers for ſucceſs
ſhe now gave to their departure; and
when they faded in diſtance from her
fight, ſhe returned into the caſtle diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
in tears. The heart of Mary
was torn by a complex ſorrow, and
incapable of longer concealing from
herſelf the intereſt ſhe took in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture
of Alleyn, her agitation became
more apparent. The Counteſs in vain
endeavoured to compoſe her mind.
Mary, affected by her tender concern,
and prompted by the natural ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs
of her diſpoſition, longed to
make her the confidant of her weakneſs,
if weakneſs that can be termed which
ariſes from gratitude, and from the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration
of great and generous qualities;
but delicacy and timidity arreſted the
half formed ſentence, and cloſed her
lips in ſilence. Her health gradually
declined under the ſecret agitation of
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:0149803000:103"/>
her mind; her phyſician knew her diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order
to originate in ſuppreſſed ſorrow,
and adviſed, as the beſt cordial, a confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential
friend. Matilda now perceived
the cauſe of her grief; her former
paſſing obſervations recurred to her me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,
and juſtified her diſcernment.
She ſtrove by every ſoothing effort to win
her to her confidence. Mary, oppreſſed
by the idea of ungenerous concealment,
reſolved at length to unveil her heart
to a mother ſo tender of her happineſs.
She told her all her ſentiments. The
Counteſs ſuffered a diſtreſs almoſt equal
to that of her daughter; her affectionate
heart ſwelled with equal wiſhes for her
happineſs; ſhe admired with warmeſt
gratitude the noble and aſpiring vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
of the young Highlander; but the
proud nobility of her ſoul repelled with
quick vivacity every idea of union
with a youth of ſuch ignoble birth: ſhe
regarded the preſent attachment as the
paſſing impreſſion of youthful fancy,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:0149803000:104"/>
and believed that gentle reaſoning, aided
by time and endeavour, would conquer
the enthuſiaſm of love. Mary liſtened
with attention to the reaſonings of the
Counteſs; her judgment acknowledged
their juſtneſs, while her heart regretted
their force. She reſolved, however, to
overcome an attachment which would
produce ſo much diſtreſs to her family
and to herſelf. Notwithſtanding her
endeavours to exclude Alleyn from her
thoughts, the generous and heroic qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
of his mind burſt upon her me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
in all their ſplendor; ſhe could
not but be conſcious that he loved her;
ſhe ſaw the ſtruggles of his ſoul, and
the delicacy of his paſſion, which made
him ever retire in the moſt profound
and reſpectful ſilence from its object.
She ſolicited her mother to aſſiſt in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling
the deſtructive image from her
mind. The Counteſs exerted every ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
to amuſe her-to forgetfulneſs; every
hour except thoſe which were given to
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:0149803000:105"/>
exerciſes neceſſary for her health, was
devoted to the cultivation of her mind,
and the improvement of her various
accompliſhments. Theſe endeavours
were not unſucceſsful; the Counteſs
with joy obſerved the returning health
and tranquillity of her daughter; and
Mary almoſt believed ſhe had taught
herſelf to forget. Theſe engagements
ſerved alſo to beguile the tedious mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
which muſt intervene, ere news
could arrive from Alleyn concerning
the probable ſucceſs of the enterprize.</p>
            <p>Miſery yet dwelt in the caſtle of
Dunbayne; for there the virtues were
captive, while the vices reigned deſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic.
The mind of the Baron, ardent
and reſtleſs, knew no peace: torn by
conflicting paſſions, he was himſelf the
victim of their power.</p>
            <p>The Earl knew that his life hung up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the caprice of a tyrant; his mind
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:0149803000:106"/>
was nerved for the worſt; yet the letter
which the compaſſion of one of his
guards, at the riſque of his life, had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken
to convey to the Counteſs,
afforded him a faint hope that his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
might yet effect his eſcape. In this
expectation, he ſpent hour after hour
at his grate, wiſhing with trembling
anxiety to behold his clan advancing
over the diſtant hills. Theſe hills be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
at length, in a ſituation ſo barren
of real comforts, a ſource of ideal plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
to him. He was always at the grate,
and often in the fine evenings of ſummer,
ſaw the ladies, whoſe appearance had ſo
ſtrongly excited his admiration and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
walk on a terrace below the tower.
One very fine evening, under the pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
impreſſions of hope for himſelf, and
compaſſion for them, his ſufferings for
a time loſt their acuteneſs. He longed
to awaken their ſympathy, and make
known to them that they had a fellow-priſoner.
The parting ſun trembled
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:0149803000:107"/>
on the tops of the mountains, and a
ſofter ſhade fell upon the diſtant land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape.
The ſweet tranquillity of even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
threw an air of tender melancholy
over his mind; his ſorrows for a while
were huſhed; and under the enthuſiaſm
of the hour, he compoſed the following
ſonnet, which, having committed it to
paper, he the next evening dropped up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the terrace.</p>

            <p>ONE morning early, the Earl diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
a martial band emerging
from the verge of the horizon; his
heart welcomed his hopes, which were
ſoon confirmed into certainty. It was
his faithful people, led on by Alleyn.
It was their deſign to ſurround and attack
the caſtle; and though their numbers
gave them but little hopes of conqueſt,
they yet believed that in the tumult
of the engagement they might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
the deliverance of the Earl. With
this view they advanced to the walls.
The centinels had deſcried them at diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance;
the alarm was given; the trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets
ſounded, and the walls of the caſtle
were filled with men. The Baron was
preſent, and directed the preparations.
The ſecret purpoſe of his ſoul was fixed.
The clan ſurrounded the foſſé, into
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:0149803000:110"/>
which they threw bundles of faggots,
and gave the ſignal of attack. Scaling
ladders were thrown up to the window
of the tower. The Earl, invigorated
with hope and joy, had by the force of
his arm, almoſt wrenched from its faſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tening,
one of the iron bars of the grate;
his foot was lifted to the ſtanchion,
ready to aid him in eſcaping through
the opening, when he was ſeized by the
guards of the Baron, and conveyed pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitately
from the priſon. He was led,
indignant and deſperate, to the lofty
ramparts of the caſtle, from whence he
beheld Alleyn and his clan, whoſe eager
eyes were once more bleſſed with the
ſight of their Chief;—they were bleſſed
but for a moment; they beheld their
Lord in chains, ſurrounded with guards,
and with the inſtruments of death. Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated,
however, with a laſt hope, they
renewed the attack with redoubled fury,
when the trumpets of the Baron ſounded
a parley, and they ſuſpended their arms.
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:0149803000:111"/>
The Baron appeared on the ramparts;
Alleyn advanced to hear him. "The
moment of attack," cried the Baron,
"is the moment of death to your Chief.
If you wiſh to preſerve his life, deſiſt
from the aſſault,' and depart in peace;
and bear this meſſage to the Counteſs,
your miſtreſs:—the Baron Malcolm
will accept no other ranſom for the life
and the liberty of the Earl, than her
beauteous daughter, whom he now ſues
to become his wife. If ſhe accedes to
theſe terms, the Earl is inſtantly libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
—if ſhe refuſes,—he dies." The
emotions of the Earl, and of Alleyn, on
hearing theſe words, were inexpreſſible.
The Earl ſpurned with haughty virtue,
the baſe conceſſion. "Give me death,"
cried he with loud impatience; "the
houſe of Athlin ſhall not be diſhonoured
by alliance with a murderer: renew the
attack my brave people; ſince you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
ſave the life, revenge the death of
your Chief; he dies contented, ſince his
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:0149803000:112"/>
death preſerves his family from diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour."
The guards inſtantly ſurrounded
the Earl.</p>
            <p>Alleyn, whoſe heart, torn by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
emotions, was yet true to the
impulſe of honour, on obſerving this,
inſtantly threw down his arms, refuſing
to obey the commands of the Earl; a
hoſtage for whoſe life he demanded,
while he haſtened to the caſtle of Athlin
with the conditions of the Baron. The
clan, following the example of Alleyn,
reſted on their arms, while a few pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
to depart with him on the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſy.
In vain were the remonſtrances
and the commands of the Earl, his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
loved him too well to obey them,
and his heart was filled with anguiſh
when he ſaw Alleyn depart from the
walls.</p>
            <p>The ſituation of Alleyn was highly
pitiable; all the firm virtues of his ſoul
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:0149803000:113"/>
were called upon to ſupport it. He was
commiſſioned on an embaſſy, the alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
conditions of which, would bring
deſtruction on the woman he adored, or
death to the friend whom he loved.</p>
            <p>When the arrival of Alleyn was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
to the Counteſs, impatient joy
thrilled in her boſom; for ſhe had no
doubt that he brought offers of accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation;
and no ranſom was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
to her imagination, which ſhe
would not willingly give for the resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of her ſon. At the ſound of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leyn's
voice, thoſe tumults which had
began to ſubſide in the heart of Mary,
were again revived, and ſhe awoke to
the mournful certainty of hopeleſs en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour.
Yet ſhe could not repreſs a
ſtrong emotion of joy on again behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him. The ſoft bluſh of her cheek
ſhewed the colours of her mind, while
in endeavouring to ſhade her feelings
ſhe impelled them into ſtronger light.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="100" facs="tcp:0149803000:114"/>
The agitations of Alleyn almoſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
his ſtrength, when he entered the
preſence of the Counteſs; and his vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage,
on which was impreſſed deep diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs,
and the paleneſs of fear, betrayed
the inward workings of his ſoul. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilda
was inſtantly ſeized with appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion
for the ſafety of her ſon, and
in a tremulous voice, enquired his
fate. Alleyn told her he was well, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
with tender caution to acquaint
her with the buſineſs of his embaſſy,
and with the ſcene to which he had
lately been witneſs. The ſentence of
the Baron fell like the ſtroke of death
upon the heart of Mary, who fainted at
the words. Alleyn flew to ſupport her.
In endeavouring to revive her daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
the Counteſs was diverted for a
time from the anguiſh which this intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
muſt naturally impart. It was
long ere Mary returned to life, and ſhe
returned only to a ſenſe of wretched<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
The critical ſituation of Matilda
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:0149803000:115"/>
can ſcarcely be felt in its full extent.
Torn by the conflict of oppoſite inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts,
her brain was the ſeat of tumult,
and wild diſmay. Which ever way ſhe
looked, deſtruction cloſed the view. The
murderer of the huſband, now ſought
to murder the happineſs of the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
On the ſentence of the mother,
hung the final fate of the ſon. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting
theſe terms, ſhe would give him
inſtant death; in accepting them, her
conduct would be repugnant to the
feelings of indignant virtue, and to the
tender injured memory of her mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
Lord. She would deſtroy for
ever the peace of her daughter, and the
honour of her houſe. To effect his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance
by force of arms was uttterly
impracticable, ſince the Baron had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared,
that "the moment of attack
ſhould be the moment of death to the
Earl." Honour, humanity, parental
tenderneſs, bade her ſave her ſon; yet
by a ſtrange contrariety of intereſts, the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:0149803000:116"/>
ſame virtues pleaded with a voice equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
powerful, for the reverſe of the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence.
Hitherto hope had ſtill illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
her mind with a diſtant ray; ſhe
now found herſelf ſuddenly involved in
the darkneſs of deſpair, whoſe glooms
were interrupted only by the gleams of
horror which aroſe from the altar, on
which was to be ſacrificed one of her
beloved children. Her mind ſhrunk
from the idea of uniting her daughter
to the murderer of her father. The
ferocious character of Malcolm was
alone ſufficient to blight for ever the
happineſs of the woman whoſe fate
ſhould be connected with his. To give
to the murderer the child of the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
was a thought too horrid to reſt
upon. The Counteſs rejected with
force the Baron's offer of exchange,
when the bleeding figure of her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
ſon, pale and convulſed in death,
ſtarted on her imagination, and ſtretched
her brain almoſt to frenzy.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="103" facs="tcp:0149803000:117"/>
Meanwhile Mary ſuffered a conflict
equally dreadful. Nature had beſtowed
on her a heart ſuſceptible of all the fine
emotions of delicate paſſion; a heart
which vibrated in uniſon with the
ſweeteſt feelings of humanity; a mind,
quick in perceiving the niceſt lines of
moral rectitude, and ſtrenuous in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring
to act up to its perceptions.
Theſe giſts were unneceſſary to make
her ſenſible of the wretchedneſs of her
preſent ſituation; of which a common
mind would have felt the miſery; they
ſerved, however, to ſharpen the points
of affliction, to encreaſe their force, and
to diſcloſe in ſtronger light, the various
horrors of her ſituation. Fraternal love
and pity called loudly upon her to reſign
herſelf into the power of the man, whom
from the earlieſt dawn of perception,
ſhe had contemplated with trembling
averſion and horror. The memory of
her murdered parent, every feeling dear
to virtue, the tremulous, but forceful
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:0149803000:118"/>
voice of love awakened her heart, and
each oppoſed with wild impetuoſity,
every other ſentiment. Her ſoul ſhrunk
back with terror from the idea of union
with the Baron. Could ſhe bear to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
in marriage, that hand which was
ſtained with the blood of her father?—The
polluted touch would freeze her
heart in horror!—Could ſhe bear to paſs
her life with the man, who had for ever
blaſted the ſmiling days of him who
gave her being?—With the man who
would ſtand before her eyes a perpetual
monument of miſery to herſelf, and of
diſhonour to her family? whoſe chilling
aſpect would repel every amiable and
generous affection, and ſtrike them back
upon her heart only to wound it? To
cheriſh the love of the noble virtues,
would be to cheriſh the remembrance of
her dead father, and of her living lover.
How wretched mud be her ſituation,
when to obliterate from her memory
the image of virtue, could alone afford
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:0149803000:119"/>
her a chance of obtaining a horrid tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity;
virtue, which is ſo dear to the
human heart, that when her form for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſakes
us, we purſue her ſhadow. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
in ſearch of comfort ſhe directed
her aching ſight, Miſery's haggard
countenance obtruded on her view.
Here ſhe beheld herſelf entombed in the
arms of the murderer;—there, the ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacle
of her beloved brother, encircled
with chains, and awaiting the ſtroke of
death, aroſe to her imagination; the
ſcene was too affecting; fancy gave her
the horrors of reality. The reflection,
that through her, he ſuffered, that
ſhe yet might ſave him from deſtruction,
broke with irreſiſtible force upon her
mind, and inſtantly bore, away every op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
feeling. She reſolved, that ſince
ſhe muſt be wretched, ſhe would be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
wretched; ſince miſery demanded
one ſacrifice, ſhe would devote herſelf
the victim.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="106" facs="tcp:0149803000:120"/>
With theſe thoughts, ſhe entered the
apartment of the Counteſs, whoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence
was neceſſary to ratify her
reſolves, and, having declared them,
awaited in trembling expectation her
deciſion. Matilda had ſuffered a diſtrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of mind, which the nature of no
former trial had occaſioned her. On
the unfortunate death of a huſband ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
beloved, ſhe had ſuffered all the
ſorrow which tenderneſs, and all the
ſhock which the manner of his death
could inſpire. The event, however,
ſhocking as it was, did not hang upon
circumſtances over which ſhe had an
influence; it was decided by an higher
power;—it was decided, and never could
be recalled; ſhe had there no dreadful
choice of horrors, no evil ratified by her
own voice, to taint with deadly recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections
her declining days. This
choice, though forced upon her by the
power of a tyrant, ſhe would ſtill conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
as in part her own, and the thought
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:0149803000:121"/>
that ſhe was compelled to doom to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
one of her children, harrowed
up her foul almoſt to frenzy.</p>
            <p>Her mind at length exhauſted with
exceſs of feeling, was now fallen into a
ſtate of cold and ſilent deſpair; ſhe be
came inſenſible to the objects around her,
almoſt to the ſenſe of her own ſufferings,
and the voice, and the propoſal of her
daughter, ſcarcely awakened her powers
of perception. "He ſhall live," ſaid
Mary, in a voice broken and tender;
"he ſhall live, I am ready to become
the ſacrifice." Tears prevented her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding.
At the word "live," the
Counteſs raiſed her eyes, and threw
round her a look of wildneſs, which ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tling
on the features of Mary, ſoftened
into an expreſſion of ineffable tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
ſhe waved her head, and turned to
the window. A few tears bedewed her
cheek; they fell like the drops of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
upon the withered plant, reviving
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:0149803000:122"/>
and expanding its dying foliage; they
were the firſt her eyes had known ſince
the fatal news had reached her. Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
herſelf a little, ſhe ſent for Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leyn,
who was ſtill in the caſtle. She
wiſhed to conſult with him whether
there was not yet a poſſibility of effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the eſcape of the Earl. In afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of whatever degree, where death
has not already fixed the events in cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty,
the mind ſhoots almoſt beyond
the ſphere of poſſibility in ſearch of
hope, and ſeldom relinquiſhes the fond
illuſion, till the ſtroke of reality diſſolves
the enchantment. Thus it was with
Matilda; after the grief produced by
the firſt ſtroke of this diſaſter was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
abated, ſhe was inclined to think
that her ſituation might not prove ſo
deſperate as ſhe imagined; and her
heart was warmed by a remote hope,
that there might yet be deviſed ſome
method of procuring the eſcape of the
Earl. Alleyn came; he came in the
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:0149803000:123"/>
trembling expectation of receiving the
deciſion of the Counteſs, and in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
of offering to engage in any en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize,
however hazardous, for the
enlargement of the Earl. He repelled
with inſtant force, every idea of Mary's
becoming the wife of Malcolm; the
thought was too full of agony to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured,
and he threw the ſenſation from
his heart as a poiſon which would deſtroy
the pulſe of life. To preſerve Mary
from a miſery ſo exquiſite, and to ſave
the life of the Earl, he was willing to
encounter any hazard; to meet death
itſelf as an evil which appeared. leſs
dreadful than either of the former. He
came prepared with this reſolution, and
it ſerved to ſupport that fortitude which
affliction had diſturbed, though it could
not ſubdue. When he came again to
the Counteſs, his diſtreſs was heightened
by the ſcene before him; he beheld her
leaning on a ſofa, pale and ſilent; her
unconſcious eyes were fixed on an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:0149803000:124"/>
window; her countenance was
touched with a wildneſs expreſſive of
the diſorder of her mind, and ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
for ſome time inſenſible of his
approach. Such is the fluctuation of a
mind overcome by diſtreſs, that if for a
moment a ray of hope chears its dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
it vaniſhes at the touch of recollec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Mary was ſtanding near the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs,
whoſe hand ſhe held to her boſom.
Her preſent ſorrow had heightened the
natural penſiveneſs of her countenance,
and ſhaded her features with an intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
langour, more enchanting than the
vivacity of blooming health; her eyes
ſought to avoid Alleyn, as an object
dangerous to the reſolution ſhe had
formed. Matilda remained abſorbed in
thought. Mary wiſhed to repeat the
purpoſe of her ſoul, but her voice trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,
and the half formed ſentence died
away on her lips. Alleyn enquired the
commands of the Counteſs. "I am
ready," ſaid Mary, at length, in a low
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:0149803000:125"/>
and tremulous voice, "to give myſelf
the victim to the Baron's revenge.—I
will ſave my brother." At theſe words,
the heart of Alleyn grew cold. Mary,
overcome by the effort which they had
occaſioned her, ſcarcely finiſhed the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence;
her nerves ſhook, a miſt fell
over her eye, and ſhe ſunk on the ſofa
by which ſhe ſtood. Alleyn hung over
the couch in ſilent agony, watching her
return to life. By the aſſiſtance of thoſe
about her, ſhe ſoon revived. Alleyn, in
the joy which he felt at her recovery,
forgot for a moment his ſituation, and
preſſed with ardor her hand to his
boſom. Mary, whoſe ſenſes were yet
ſcarcely recollected, yielded unconſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
to the ſoftneſs of her heart, and
betrayed its ſituation by a ſmile ſo ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
as to thrill the breaſt of Alleyn with
the ſweet certainty of being loved. Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
his paſſion had been chilled by
the deſpair which the vaſt ſuperiority
of her birth occaſioned, and by the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:0149803000:126"/>
which forbad him to imagine that
he had merit ſufficient to arreſt the eye
of the accompliſhed Mary. Perhaps,
too, the diffidence natural to genuine
love, might contribute to deceive him.
It was not till this moment, that he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced
that certainty which awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in his heart, a ſenſe of delight hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
unknown to him. For a moment he
forgot the diſtreſſes of the caſtle, and his
own ſituation; every idea faded from
his mind, but the one he had ſo lately
acquired; and in that moment he
ſeemed to taſte perfect felicity. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collection,
however, with all its train
of black dependencies ſoon returned,
and plunged him in a miſery as poig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
as the joy from which he was now precipitated.</p>
            <p>The Counteſs was now ſufficiently
compoſed to enter on the ſubject neareſt
her heart. Alleyn caught with eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
her mention of attempting the
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:0149803000:127"/>
deliverance of the Earl, for the poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of accompliſhing which, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
himſelf willing to encounter any
danger: he ſeconded ſo warmly the
deſign, and ſpoke with ſuch flattering
probability of ſucceſs, that the ſpirits
of Matilda began once more to revive;
yet ſhe trembled to encourage hopes
which hung on ſuch perilous uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty.
It was agreed, that Alleyn
ſhould conſult with the moſt able and
truſty of the clan, whom age or infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
had detained from battle, on the
means moſt likely to enſure. ſucceſs,
and then proceed immediately on the
expedition: having firſt delivered to
the Baron a meſſage from the Counteſs,
requiring time for deliberation upon a
choice ſo important, and importing that
an anſwer ſhould be returned at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piration
of a fortnight.</p>
            <p>Alleyn accordingly aſſembled thoſe
whom he judged moſt worthy of the
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:0149803000:128"/>
council: various ſchemes were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed,
none of which appeared likely to
ſucceed; when it was recollected that
the Earl might poſſibly have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
from the tower to ſome new
place of confinement, which it would
be neceſſary firſt to diſcover, that the
plan might be adapted to the ſituation.
It was therefore concluded to ſuſpend
further conſultation till Alleyn had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
the requiſite information; and
that in the mean time he ſhould deliver
to Malcolm, the meſſage of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs:
for theſe purpoſes Alleyn imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
ſet out for the caſtle.</p>

            <head>CHAPTER VI.</head>
            <p>THE caſtle of Dunbayne was ſtill
the ſcene of triumph, and of
wretchedneſs. Malcolm, exulting in
his ſcheme, already beheld Mary at his
feet, and the Earl retiring in an anguiſh
more poignant than that of death. He
was ſurprized that his invention had
not before ſupplied him with this means
of torture: for the firſt time he wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comed
love, as the inſtrument of his
revenge; and the charms of Mary were
heightened to his imagination by the
ardent colours of this paſſion. He was
confirmed in his reſolves, never to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquiſh
the Earl, but on the conditions
he had offered; and thus for ever would
he preſerve the houſe of Athlin a monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his triumph.</p>
            <p>Oſbert, for greater ſecurity, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed
from the tower into a more cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trical
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:0149803000:130"/>
part of the caſtle, to an apartment
ſpacious but gloomy, whoſe gothic win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows
partly excluding light, threw a
ſolemnity around, which chilled the
heart alrnoſt to horror. He heeded not
this; his heart was occupied with hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
of its own. He was now involved
in a miſery more intricate, and more
dreadful, than his imagination had yet
painted. To die, was to him, who had
ſo long contemplated the near approach
of death, a familiar and tranſient evil;
but to ſee, even in idea, his family in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved
in infamy, and in union; with the
murderer, was the ſtroke which pierced
his heart to its center. He feared that
the cruel tenderneſs of the mother,
would tempt Matilda to accept the
offers of the Baron; and he ſcarcely
doubted, that the noble Mary would
reſign herſelf the price of his life. He
would have written to the Counteſs to
have forbidden her acceptance of the
terms, and to have declared his fixed
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:0149803000:131"/>
reſolution to die, but that he had no
means of conveying to her a letter; the
ſoldier who had ſo generouſly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
the conveyance of his former one,
having ſoon after diſappeared from his
ſtation. The manly fortitude which
had ſupported him through his former
trials, did not deſert him in this hour
of darkneſs; habituated ſo long to ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
with oppoſing feelings, he had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
the art of managing them; his
mind attained a confidence in its pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
reſiſtance ſerved only to increaſe
its ſtrength, and to confirm the magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity
of its nature.</p>
            <p>Alleyn had now joined the clan, and
was ardent in purſuit of the neceſſary
intelligence. He learned that the Earl
had been removed from the tower, but
in what part of the caſtle he was now
confined he could not diſcover; on this
point all was vague conjecture. That
he was alive, was only judged from the
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:0149803000:132"/>
policy of the Baron, whoſe ardent paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
for Mary, was now well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood.
Alleyn employed every ſtrata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem
his invention could ſuggeſt, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
the priſon of the Earl, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſucceſs: at length, compelled to
deliver to Malcolm the meſſage of the
Counteſs, he demanded, as a prelimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary,
that the Earl ſhould be ſhewn to
his people from the ramparts, that they
might be certain he was ſtill alive. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leyn
hoped that his appearance would
lead to a diſcovery of the place of his
impriſonment, purpoſing to obſerve nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly
the way by which he ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire.</p>
            <p>The Earl appeared in ſafety on the
ramparts, amid the ſhouts and acclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of his people; the Baron, frown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
defiance, was ſeen at his ſide. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leyn
advanced to the walls, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
the meſſage of Matilda. Oſbert
ſtarted at its purpoſe; he foreſaw that
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:0149803000:133"/>
deliberation portended compliance:—ſtung
with the thought, he ſwore aloud
he never would ſurvive the infamy of
the conceſſion; and addreſſing himſelf
to Alleyn, commanded him inſtantly to
return to the Counteſs, and bid her
ſpurn the baſe compliance, as ſhe feared
to ſacrifice both the children to the
murderer of the father. At theſe words,
a ſmile of haughty triumph marked the
features of the Baron, and he turned
from Oſbert in ſilent exultation. The
Earl was led off by the guards. Alleyn
endeavoured in vain to mark the way
they took; the lofty walls ſoon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed
them from his view.</p>
            <p>Alleyn now experienced how ſtrenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
a vigorous mind protects its fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite
hope; wayward circumſtances
may ſhock, diſappointment may check
it; but it riſes ſuperior to oppoſition,
and traverſes the ſphere of poſſibility to
accompliſh its purpoſe. Alleyn did not
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:0149803000:134"/>
yet deſpair, but he was perplexed in
what manner to proceed.</p>
            <p>In his way from the ramparts, Oſbert
was ſurprized by the appearance of two
ladies at a window near which he
paſſed: the agitation of his mind did
not prevent his recognizing them as the
ſame he had obſerved from the grates of
the tower, with ſuch lively admiration,
and who had excited in his mind ſo
much of pity and of curioſity. In the
midſt of his diſtreſs, his thoughts had
often dwelt on the ſweet graces of the
younger, and had ſighed to obtain the
ſtory of her ſorrows; for the melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly
which hung upon her features
proclaimed her to be unfortunate. They
now ſtood obſerving Oſbert as he paſſed,
and their eyes expreſſed the pity which
his ſituation inſpired. He gazed ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly
and mournfully upon them, and
when he entered his priſon, again en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
concerning them, but the ſame
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:0149803000:135"/>
inflexible ſilence was preſerved on the
ſubject.</p>
            <p>As the Earl ſat one day muſing in
his priſon, his eyes involuntarily fixed
upon a pannel in the oppoſite wainſcot;
—he obſerved that it was differently
formed from the reſt, and that its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
was ſomewhat greater; a hope
ſtarted into his mind, and he quitted his
ſeat to examine it. He perceived that
it was ſurrounded by a ſmall crack, and
on puſhing it with his hands it ſhook
under them. Certain that it was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more than a pannel, he exerted
all his ſtrength againſt it, but without
producing any new effect. Having
tried various means to move it without
ſucceſs, he gave up the experiment, and
returned to his ſeat melancholy and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed.
Several days paſſed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any further notice being taken of
the wainſcot; unwilling, however, to
relinquiſh a laſt hope he returned to
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:0149803000:136"/>
the examination, when in endeavouring
to remove the pannel, his foot acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally
hit againſt one corner, and it
ſuddenly flew open. It had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived
that a ſpring which was concealed
within, and which faſtened the partition,
ſhould receive its impulſe from the
preſſure of a certain part of the pannel,
which was now touched by the foot of
the Earl. His joy on the diſcovery
cannot be expreſſed. An apartment
wide and forlorn, like that which formed
his priſon, now lay before him; the
windows, which were high and arched,
were decorated with painted glaſs; the
floor was paved with marble; and it
ſeemed to be the deſerted remains of a
place of worſhip. Oſbert traverſed,
with heſitating ſteps, its dreary length,
towards a pair of folding doors, large
and of oak, which cloſed the apartment:
theſe he opened; a gallery gloomy and
vaſt, appeared beyond; the windows,
which were in the ſame ſtyle of Gothic
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:0149803000:137"/>
architecture with the former, were
ſhaded by thick ivy that almoſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
the light. Oſbert ſtood at the
entrance, uncertain whether to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed;
he liſtened, but heard no foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtep
in his priſon, and determined to go
on. The gallery terminated on the left
in a large winding flair-caſe, old and
apparently neglected, which led to a
hall below; on the right was a door,
low, and rather obſcure. Oſbert, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive
of diſcovery, paſſed the ſtair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſe,
and opened the door, when a ſuite
of noble apartments, magnificently fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed,
was diſcloſed to his wondering
eyes. He proceeded onward without
perceiving any perſon, but having
paſſed the ſecond room, heard the faint
ſobs of a perſon weeping; he flood for
a moment, undetermined whether to
proceed, but an irreſiſtible curioſity im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
him forward, and he entered an
apartment, in which were ſeated the
beautiful ſtrangers, whoſe appearance
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:0149803000:138"/>
had ſo much intereſted his feelings.
The elder of the ladies was diſſolved in
tears, and a caſket and ſome papers lay
open on a table beſide her. The younger
was ſo intent upon a drawing, which ſhe
ſeemed to be finiſhing, as not to obſerve
the entrance of the Earl. The elder
lady on perceiving him, aroſe in ſome
confuſion, and the ſurprize in her eyes
ſeemed to demand an explanation of ſo
unaccountable a viſit. The Earl ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized
at what he beheld, ſtepped back
with an intention of retiring; but recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting
that the intruſion demanded an
apology, he returned. The grace with
which he excuſed himſelf, confirmed
the impreſſion which his figure had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
made on the mind of Laura,
which was the name of the younger
lady; who on looking up, diſcovered a
countenance in which dignity and ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
were happily blended. She ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
to be about twenty, her perſon
was of the middle ſtature, extremely
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:0149803000:139"/>
delicate, and very elegantly formed.
The bloom of her youth was ſhaded by
a ſoft and penſive melancholy, which
communicated an expreſſion to her fine
blue eyes, extremely intereſting. Her
features were partly concealed by the
beautiful luxuriance of her auburn hair,
which curling round her face, deſcended
in treſſes on her boſom; every feminine
grace played around her; and the ſimple
dignity of her air declared the purity and
the nobility of her mind. On perceiving
the Earl, a faint bluſh animated her
cheek, and ſhe involuntarily quitted the
drawing upon which ſhe had been
engaged.</p>
            <p>If the former imperfect view he had
caught of Laura had given an impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to the heart of Oſbert, it now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
a ſtronger character from the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
afforded him of contemplat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her beauty. He concluded that
the Baron, attracted by her charms, had
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:0149803000:140"/>
entrapped her into his power, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
her in the caſtle an unwilling
priſoner. In this conjecture he was
confirmed by the mournful caſt of her
countenance, and by the myſtery which
appeared to ſurround her. Fired by
this idea, he melted in compaſſion for
her ſufferings; which compaſſion was
tinctured and encreaſed by the paſſion
which now glowed in his heart. At
that moment he forgot the danger of his
preſent ſituation; he forgot even that
he was a priſoner; and awake only to
the wiſh of alleviating her ſorrows, he
rejected cold and uſeleſs delicacy, and
reſolved, if poſſible, to learn the cauſe
of her misfortunes. Addreſſing himſelf
to the Baroneſs, "if Madam," ſaid he,
"I could by any means ſoften the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction
which I cannot affect not to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
and which has ſo warmly inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted
my feelings, I ſhould regard this
as one of the moſt happy moments of
my life; a life marked, alas! too ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:0149803000:141"/>
with miſery! but miſery has not been
uſeleſs, ſince it has taught me ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy."
The Baroneſs was no ſtranger to
the character and the misfortunes of the
Earl. Herſelf the victim of oppreſſion,
ſhe knew how to commiſerate the ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of others. She had ever felt a tender
compaſſion for the diſtreſſes of Oſbert,
and did not now with-hold ſincere ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
of ſympathy, and of gratitude,
for the intereſt which he felt in her ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.
She expreſſed her ſurprize at
ſeeing him thus at liberty; but obſerving
the chains which encircled his hands,
ſhe ſhuddered, and gueſſed a part of the
truth. He explained to her the diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
of the pannel, by which ciircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
he had found his way into that
apartment. The idea of aiding him to
eſcape, ruſhed upon the mind of the
Baroneſs, but was repreſſed by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
of her own confined ſituation;
and ſhe was compelled with mournful
reluctance; to reſign that thought which
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:0149803000:142"/>
reverence for the character of the late
Earl, and compaſſion for the misfortunes
of the preſent, had inſpired. She la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
her inability to aſſiſt him, and
informed him that herſelf and her
daughter were alike priſoners with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;
that the walls of the caſtle were
the limits of their liberty; and that they
had ſuffered the preſſure of tyranny for
fifteen years. The Earl expreſſed the
indignation which he felt at this reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,
and ſolicited the Baroneſs to conſide
in his integrity; and, if the relation
would not be too painful to her, to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
him ſo far as to acquaint him by
what cruel means ſhe fell into the power
of Malcolm. The Baroneſs, apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
for his ſafety, reminded him of the
riſk of diſcovery by a longer abſence
from his priſon; and, thanking him
again for the intereſt he took in her ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings,
aſſured him of her warmeſt
wiſhes for his deliverance, and that if
an opportunity ever offered, ſhe would
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:0149803000:143"/>
acquaint him with the ſad particulars or
her ſtory. The eyes of Oſbert made
known that gratitude which it was diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
for his tongue to utter. Tremu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly
he ſolicited the conſolation of
ſometimes re-viſiting the apartments of
the Baroneſs; a permiſſion which would
give him ſome intervals of comfort
amid the many hours of torment to
which he was condemned. The Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneſs,
in compaſſion to his ſufferings,
granted the requeſt. The Earl de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted,
gazing on Laura with eyes of
mournful tenderneſs; yet he was pleaſed
with what had paſſed, and retired to his
priſon in one of thoſe peaceful inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals
which are known even to the
wretched. He found all quiet, and
cloſing the pannel in ſafety, ſat down to
conſider the paſt, and anticipate the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
He was flattered with hopes, that
the diſcovery of the pannel might aid
him to eſcape; the glooms of deſpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
which had lately enveloped his
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:0149803000:144"/>
mind, gradually diſappeared, and joy
once more illumined his proſpects; but
it was the ſunſhine of an April morn,
deceitful and momentary. He recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
that the caſtle was beſet with
guards, whoſe vigilance was inſured by
the ſeverity of the Baron; he remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered
that the ſtrangers, who had took
ſo kind an intereſt in his fate, were pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners
like himſelf; and that he had no
generous ſoldier to teach him the ſecret
windings of the caſtle, and to accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
him in flight. His imagination
was haunted by the image of Laura;
vainly he ſtrove to diſguiſe from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
the truth; his heart conſtantly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied
the ſophiſtry of his reaſonings. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warily
he had drank the draught of
love, and he was compelled to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
the fatal indiſcretion. He could
not, however, reſolve to throw from his
heart the delicious poiſon; he could
not reſolve to ſee her no more. The
painful apprehenſion for his ſafety,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:0149803000:145"/>
which his forbearing to renew the viſit
he had ſo earneſtly ſolicited, would oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
the Baroneſs; the apparent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpect
it would convey; the ardent
curioſity with which he longed to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the hiſtory of her misfortunes; the
lively intereſt he felt in learning the
ſituation of Laura, with reſpect to the
Baron; and the hope,—the wild hope,
with which he deluded his reaſon, that
he might be able to aſſiſt them, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
him to repeat the viſit. Under
theſe illuſions, the motive which princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally
impelled him to the interview
was concealed.</p>
            <p>In the mean time Alleyn had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
to the caſtle of Athlin with the
reſolutions of the Earl; whoſe reſolves
ſerved only to aggravate the diſtreſs of
its fair inhabitants. Alleyn, however,
unwilling to cruſh a laſt hope, tenderly
concealed from them the circumſtance
of the Earl's removal from the tower;
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:0149803000:146"/>
ſilently and almoſt hopeleſsly meditating
to diſcover his priſon; and admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtered
that comfort to the Counteſs and
to Mary, which his own expectation
would not ſuffer him to participate. He
retired in haſte to the veterans whom
he had before aſſembled, and acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them with the removal of the Earl;
which circumſtance muſt for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
ſuſpend their conſultations. He
left them, therefore, and inſtantly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
to the clan: there to proſecute
his enquiries. Every poſſible exertion
was made to obtain the neceſſary intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence,
but without ſucceſs. The
moment in which the Baron would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
the anſwer of the Counteſs, was
now faſt approaching, and every heart
ſunk in deſpair, when one night the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinels
of the camp were alarmed by the
approach of men, who hailed them in
unknown voices; fearful of ſurprize,
they ſurrounded the ſtrangers, and led
them to Alleyn; to whom they related,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:0149803000:147"/>
that they fled from the capricious tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of Malcolm, and ſought refuge in
the camp of his enemy; whoſe misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes
they bewailed, and in whoſe cauſe
they enliſted. Rejoiced at the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
yet doubtful of its truth, Alleyn
interrogated the ſoldiers concerning the
priſon of the Earl. From them he
learned, that Oſbert was confined in a
part of the caſtle extremely difficult of
acceſs; and that any plan of eſcape
muſt be utterly impracticable without
the aſſiſtance of one well acquainted
with the various intricacies of the pile.
An opportunity of ſucceſs was now pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented,
with which the moſt ſanguine
hopes of Alleyn had never flattered
him. He received from the ſoldiers
ſtrong aſſurances of aſſiſtance; from
them, likewiſe, he learned, that diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
reigned among the people of the
Baron; who, impatient of the yoke of
tyranny, only waited a favourable op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
to throw it off, and reſume
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:0149803000:148"/>
the rights of nature. That the vigilant
ſuſpicions of Malcolm excited him to
puniſh with the harſheſt ſeverity every
appearance of inattention; that being
condemned to ſuffer a very heavy pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
for a ſlight offence, they had
eluded the impending miſery, and the
future oppreſſion of their Chief, by
deſertion.</p>
            <p>Alleyn immediately convened a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
before whom the ſoldiers were
brought; they repeated their former
aſſertions; and one of the fugitives
added, that he had a brother, whoſe
place of guard over the perſon of the
Earl on that night, had made it difficult
to elude obſervation, and had prevented
his eſcaping with them; that on the
night of the morrow he ſtood guard at
the gate of the leſſer draw-bridge, where
the centinels were few; that he was
himſelf willing to riſque the danger of
converſing with him; and had litttle
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:0149803000:149"/>
doubt of gaining him to aſſiſt in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance
of the Earl. At theſe words,
the heart of Alleyn throbbed with joy.
He promiſed large rewards to the brave
ſoldier and to his brother, if they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook
the enterprize. His companion
was well acquainted with the ſubter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raneous
paſſages of the rock, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
himſelf deſirous of being uſeful.
The hopes of Alleyn every inſtant grew
ſtronger; and he vainly wiſhed at that
moment to communicate to the Earl's
unhappy family, the joy which dilated
his heart.</p>
            <p>The eve of the following day was
fixed upon to commence their deſigns;
when James ſhould endeavour to gain
his brother to their purpoſe. Having
adjuſted theſe matters, they retired to
reſt for the remainder of the night; but
ſleep had fled the eyes of Alleyn; anx<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious
expectation filled his mind; and
he ſaw in the waking viſions of fancy,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:0149803000:150"/>
the meeting of the Earl with his family;
he anticipated the thanks he ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
from the lovely Mary; and he
ſighed at the recollection, that thanks
were all for which he could ever dare to
hope.</p>
            <p>At length the dawn appeared, and
waked the clan to hopes and proſpects
far different from thoſe of the preceding
morn. The hours hung heavily on the
expectation of Alleyn, whoſe mind was
filled with ſolicitude for the event of the
meeting between the brothers. Night
at length came to his wiſhes. The
darkneſs was interrupted only by the
faint light of the moon moving through
the watry and broken clouds, which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veloped
the horizon. Tumultuous guſts
of wind broke at intervals the ſilence of
the hour. Alleyn watched the move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the caſtle; he obſerved the
lights gradually diſappear. The bell
from the watch-tower chimed one; all
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:0149803000:151"/>
was ſtill within the walls; and James
ventured forth to the draw-bridge. The
draw-bridge divided in the center, and
the half next the plains was down; he
mounted it, and in a low yet firm voice,
called on Edmund. No anſwer was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned;
and he began to fear that his
brother had already quitted the caſtle.
He remained ſome time in ſilent ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe
before he repeated the call, when
he heard the gate of the draw-bridge
gently unbarred, and Edmund appeared.
He was ſurprized to ſee James, and
bade him inſtantly fly the danger that
ſurrounded him. The Baron, incenſed
at the frequent deſertion of his ſoldiers,
had ſent out people in purſuit, and had
promiſed conſiderable rewards for the
apprehenſion of the fugitives. James,
undaunted by what he heard, kept his
ground, reſolved to urge his purpoſe to
the point. Happily, the centinels who
ſtood guard with Edmund, overcome
with the effect of a potion he had admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtered
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:0149803000:152"/>
to favour his eſcape, were ſunk
in ſleep, and the ſoldiers conducted their
diſcourſe in a low voice, without inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.</p>
            <p>Edmund was unwilling to defer his
flight, and poſſeſſed not reſolution ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to encounter the hazard of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize,
till the proffered reward con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoled
his ſelf-denial, and rouſed his
ſlumbering courage. He was well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with the ſubterraneous avenues
of the caſtle; the only remaining diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
was that of deceiving the vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance
of his fellow-centinels, whoſe
watchfulneſs made it impoſſible for the
Earl to quit his priſon unperceived.
The ſoldiers who were to mount guard
with him on the following night, were
ſtationed in a diſtant part of the caſtle,
till the hour of their removal to the
door of the priſon; it was, therefore,
difficult to adminiſter to them that
draught which had ſteeped in forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:0149803000:153"/>
the ſenſes of his preſent aſſociates.
To confide to their integrity, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to win them to his purpoſe, was
certainly to give his life into their hands,
and probably to aggravate the diſaſtrous
fate of the Earl. This ſcheme was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet
too thick with dangers to be ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarded,
and their invention could fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
them with none more promiſing.
It was, however, agreed, that on the
following night, Edmund ſhould ſeize
the moment of opportunity to impart to
the Earl the deſigns of his friends, and
to conſult on the means of accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them. Thus concluding, James
returned in ſafety to the tent of Alleyn,
where the moſt conſiderable of the clan
were aſſembled, there awaiting with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient
ſolicitude, his arrival. The
hopes of Alleyn were ſomewhat chilled
by the report of the ſoldier; from the
vigilance which beſet the doors of the
priſon, eſcape from thence appeared im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicable.
He was condemned, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:0149803000:154"/>
to linger in ſuſpenſe till the third
night from the preſent, when the return
of Edmund to his ſtation at the bridge
would enable him again to commune
with his brother. But Alleyn was unſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picious
of a circumſtance which would
utterly have defeated his hopes, and
whoſe conſequence threatened deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to all their ſchemes. A centinel
on duty upon that part of the rampart
which ſurmounted the draw-bridge, had
been alarmed by hearing the gate unbar,
and approaching the wall, had perceived
a man ſtanding on the half of the bridge
which was dropped, and in converſe
with ſome perſon on the caſtle walls.
He drew as near as the wall would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit,
and endeavoured to liſten to their
diſcourſe. The gloom of night pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
his recognizing the perſon on the
bridge; but he could clearly diſtinguiſh
the voice of Edmund, in that of the
man to whom he addreſſd himſelf.
Excited by new wonder, he gave all his
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:0149803000:155"/>
attention to diſcover the ſubject of their
converſation. The diſtance occaſioned
between the brothers by the ſuſpended
half of the bridge, obliged them to ſpeak
in a ſomewhat higher tone than they
would otherwiſe have done; and the
centinel gathered ſufficient from their
diſcourſe, to learn that they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certing
the reſcue of the Earl; that the
night of Edmund's watch at the priſon,
was to be the night of enterprize; and
that ſome friends of the Earl were to
await him in the environs of the caſtle.
All this he carefully treaſured up, and
the next morning communicated it to
his comrades.</p>
            <p>On the following evening the Earl,
yielding to the impulſe of his heart,
once more uncloſed his partition, and
ſought the apartments of the Baroneſs.
She received him with expreſſions of
ſatisfaction; while the artleſs pleaſure
which lighted up the countenance of
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:0149803000:156"/>
Laura, awakened the pulſe of rapture in
that heart which had long throbbed only
to miſery. The Earl reminded the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneſs
of her former promiſe, which the
deſire of exciting ſympathy in thoſe we
eſteem, and the melancholy pleaſure
which the heart finds in lingering in the
ſcenes of former happineſs, had induced
her to give. She endeavoured to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
her ſpirits, which were agitated by
the remembrance of paſt ſufferings, and
gave him a relation of the following
circumſtances.</p>

            <head>CHAPTER VII.</head>
            <p>LOUISA, Baroneſs Malcolm, was
the deſcendant of an ancient and
honourable houſe in Switzerland. Her
father, the Marquis de St. Claire, inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited
all thoſe brave qualities and that
ſtern virtue which had ſo eminently diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed
his anceſtors. Early in life
he loſt a wife whom he tenderly loved,
and he ſeemed to derive his ſole conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
from the education of the dear
children ſhe had left behind. His ſon,
whom he had brought up to the arms
himſelf ſo honourably bore, fell before
he reached his nineteenth year, in the
ſervice of his country; an elder daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
died in infancy; Louiſa was his ſole
ſurviving child. His chateau was ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
in one of thoſe delightful vallies of
the Swiſs cantons, in which the beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and the ſublime are ſo happily uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
where the magnificent features of
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:0149803000:158"/>
the ſcenery are contraſted, and their ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
heightened by the blooming luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riance
of woods and paſturage, by the
gentle windings of the ſtream, and the
peaceful aſpect of the cottage. The
Marquis was now retired from the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
for grey age had overtaken him.
His reſidence was the reſort of foreign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of diſtinction, who attracted by the
united talents of the ſoldier and the
philoſopher, under his roof partook of
the hoſpitality ſo characteriſtic of his
country. Among the viſitors of this
deſcription, was the late Baron Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colm,
brother to the preſent Chief, who
then travelled through Switzerland.
The beauty of Louiſa, embelliſhed by
the elegance of a mind highly culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated,
touched his heart, and he ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited
her hand in marriage. The manly
ſenſe of the Baron, and the excellencies
of his diſpoſition, had not paſſed unob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,
or unapproved by the Marquis;
while the graces of his perſon, and of
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:0149803000:159"/>
his mind, had anticipated for him in the
heart of Louiſa, a pre-eminence over
every other ſuitor. The Marquis had
but one objection to the marriage; this
was likewiſe the objection of Louiſa:
neither the one nor the other could en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
the idea of the diſtance which was
to ſeparate them. Louiſa was to the
Marquis the laſt prop of his declining
years; the Marquis was to Louiſa the
father and the friend to whom her heart
had hitherto been ſolely devoted, and
from whom it could not now be torn
but with an anguiſh equal to its attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
This remained an inſurmount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
obſtacle, till it was removed by the
tenderneſs of the Baron, who entreated
the Marquis to quit Switzerland, and
reſide with his daughter in Scotland.
The attachment of the Marquis to his
natal land, and the pride of hereditary
dominion, was too powe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>••••</desc>

               </gap> ſuffer him
to acquieſce in the propoſal without
much ſtruggle of contending feelings.
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:0149803000:160"/>
The deſire of ſecuring the happineſs of
his child by a union with a character ſo
excellent as the Baron's, and of ſeeing
her ſettled before death ſhould deprive
her of the protection of a father, at
length ſubdued every other conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and he reſigned the hand of his
daughter to the Baron Malcolm. The
Marquis adjuſted his affairs, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning
his eſtates to the care of truſty
agents, bade a laſt adieu to his beloved
country;—that country, which during
ſixty years, had been the principal
ſcene of his happineſs, and of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grets.
The courſe of years had not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>literated
from his heart the early affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of his youth; he took a ſad fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well
of that grave which encloſed the
reliques of his wife, from which it was
not his leaſt effort to depart, and whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he ordered that his remains ſhould
be conveyed. Louiſa quitted Switzer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
with a concern ſcarcely leſs acute
than that of her father; the poignancy
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:0149803000:161"/>
of which, however, was greatly ſoftened
by the tender aſſiduities of her Lord,
whoſe affectionate attentions hourly
heightened her eſteem, and encreaſed
her love.</p>
            <p>They arrived at Scotland without any
accident, where the Baron welcomed
Louiſa as the miſtreſs of his domains.
The Marquis de St. Claire had apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in the cattle, where the evening
of his days declined in peaceful hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs.
Before his death he had the
pleaſure of ſeeing his race renewed in
the children of the Baroneſs, in a ſon
who was called by the name of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis,
and in a daughter who now ſhares
with her mother the ſorrows of confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
On the death of the Marquis it
was neceſſary for the Baron to viſit
Switzerland, in order to take poſſeſſion
of his eſtates, and to adjuſt ſome affairs
which a long abſence had deranged. He
attended the remains of the Marquis to
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:0149803000:162"/>
their laſt abode. The Baroneſs, deſirous
of once more beholding her native coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
and anxious to pay a laſt reſpect to
the memory of her father, entruſted her
children to the care of a faithful old ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,
whom ſhe had brought with her
from the Vallois, and who had been the
nurſe of her early childhood, and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
the Baron to the continent.
Having depoſited the remains of the
Marquis according to his wiſh in the
tomb of his wife, and arranged their
affairs, they returned to Scotland, where
the firſt intelligence they received on
their arrival at the caſtle, was the death
of their ſon, and of the old nurſe his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendant.
The ſervant had died ſoon
after their departure; the child only a
fortnight before their return. This diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtrous
event affected equally the Baron
and his lady, who never ceaſed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
herſelf for having entruſted her
ſon to the care of ſervants. Time, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
ſubdued the poignancy of this
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:0149803000:163"/>
affliction, but came fraught with another
yet more acute; this was the death of
the Baron, who in the pride of youth,
conſtituting the felicity of his family,
and of his people, was killed by a fall
from his horſe, which he received in
hunting. He left the Baroneſs and an
only daughter to bewail with unceaſing
ſorrow his loſs.</p>
            <p>The paternal eſtates devolved of
courſe to his only brother, the preſent
Baron, whoſe character formed a mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and ſtriking contraſt to that of the
deceaſed Lord. All his perſonal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty,
which was conſiderable, with the
eſtates in Switzerland, he bequeathed to
his beloved wife and daughter. The
new Baron, immediately on the demiſe
of his brother, took poſſeſſion of the
caſtle, but allowed the Baroneſs, with a
part of her ſuit, to remain its inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
till the expiration of the year. The
Baroneſs abſorbed in grief, ſtill loved to
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:0149803000:164"/>
recall in the ſcenes of her late felicity,
the image of her Lord, and to linger in
his former haunts. This motive, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with the neceſſity of preparation for
a journey to Switzerland, induced her to
accept the offer of the Baron.</p>
            <p>The memory of his brother had
quickly faded from the mind of Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colm,
whoſe attention appeared to be
wholly occupied by ſchemes of ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice
and ambition. His arrogance;
and boundleſs love of power, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broiled
him with the neighbouring
Chiefs, and engaged him in continual
hoſtility. He ſeldom viſited the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneſs;
when he did, his manner was
cold, and even haughty. The Baroneſs,
ſhocked to receive ſuch treatment from
the brother of her deceaſed Lord, and
reduced to feel herſelf an unwelcome
gueſt in that caſtle which ſhe had been
accuſtomed to conſider as her own, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
to ſet off for the continent im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:0149803000:165"/>
and ſeek in the ſolitudes of
her native mountains, an aſylum from
the frown of inſulting power. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traſt
of character between the brothers
drew many a ſigh of bitter recollection
from her heart, and added weight to the
ſorrows which already oppreſſed it. She
gave orders, therefore, to her domeſtics,
to prepare for immediate departure;
but was ſoon after told that the Baron
had forbad them to obey the command.
Aſtoniſhed at this circumſtance, ſhe had
not time to demand an explanation, ere
a meſſage from Malcolm required a few
moments private converſation. The
meſſenger was followed almoſt inſtantly
by the Baron, who entered the apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
with hurried ſteps, his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
overſpread with the dark purpoſes
of his ſoul. "I come, Madam," ſaid
he, in a voice ſtern and determined,
"to inform you, that you quit not this
caſtle. The eſtates which you call yours,
are mine; and think not that I ſhall
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:0149803000:166"/>
neglect to proſecute my claim. The
frequent and ill-timed generoſities of
my brother, have diminiſhed the value
of thoſe lands which are mine by inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance;
and I have, therefore, an indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſable
right to re-pay myſelf from
thoſe eſtates which he acquired with
you. In point of juſtice, he poſſeſſed
not the right of deviſing theſe eſtates,
and I ſhall not ſuffer myſelf to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
by the evaſions of the law; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign,
therefore, the will, which remains
only a record of unjuſt withes, and inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual
claims. When the receipts from
your eſtates have ſatisfied my demands,
they ſhall again be yours. The apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
you now inhabit ſhall remain your
own; but beyond the wall of this caſtle
you ſhall not paſs; for I ſhall not, by
ſuffering your departure, afford you an
opportunity of conteſting thoſe rights
which I can enforce without oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="153" facs="tcp:0149803000:167"/>
Overcome with aſtoniſhment and
dread, the Baroneſs was for ſome time
deprived of all power of reply. At
length, rouſed by the ſpirit of indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
"I am too well informed, my
Lord," ſaid ſhe, "of my juſt claims to
the lands in queſtion; and know alſo
too well the value of that integrity
which is now no more, to credit your
bold aſſertions; they ſerve only to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veil
to me the darkneſs of a character,
cruel and rapacious; whoſe boundleſs
avarice trampling on the barriers of juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
and humanity, ſeizes on the right
of the defenceleſs widow, and on the
portion of the unreſiſting orphan. This,
my Lord, you are permitted to do;
they have no means of reſiſtance; but
think not to impoſe on me by a ſophiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
aſſertion of right, or to gloſs the vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lainy
of your conduct with the colours
of juſtice; the artifice is beneath the
deſperate force of your character, and is
not ſufficiently ſpecious to deceive the
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:0149803000:168"/>
diſcernment of virtue. From being
your priſoner I have no means of eſcap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
but never, my Lord, will I reſign
into your hands that will which is the
efficient bond of my rights, and the laſt
ſad record of the affection of my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
Lord." Grief cloſed her lips.
The Baron denouncing vengeance on
her reſiſtance, his features inflamed with
rage, quitted the apartment. The Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneſs
was left to lament with deepning
anguiſh, the ſtroke which had deprived
her of a beloved huſband; and reflection
gave her the wretchedneſs of her ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
in yet more lively colours. She
was now a ſtranger in a foreign land,
deprived by him of whom ſhe had a
right to demand protection, of all her
poſſeſſions; a priſoner in his caſtle,
without one friend to vindicate her
cauſe, and far remote from any means
of appeal to the laws of the country.
She wept over the youthful Laura, and
while the preſſed her with mournful
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:0149803000:169"/>
fondneſs to her boſom, ſhe was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
in her reſolve never to relinquish
that will, by which alone the rights of
her injured child could ever be aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</p>
            <p>The Baron, bold in iniquity, obtained
by forged powers, the revenues of the
foreign eſtates; and by this means, ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually
kept the Baroneſs in his power,
and deprived her of her laſt reſource.
Secure in the poſſeſſion of the eſtates,
and of the Baroneſs, he no longer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded
the will as an object of import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance;
and as ſhe did not attempt any
means of eſcape, or the recovery of her
rights, he ſuffered her to remain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſturbed,
and in quiet poſſeſſion of the
will.</p>
            <p>The Baroneſs now paſſed her days in
unvaried ſorrow, except in thoſe inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals
when ſhe forced her mind from its
melancholy ſubject, and devoted herſelf
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:0149803000:170"/>
to the education of her daughter. The
artleſs efforts of Laura, to aſſuage the
ſorrows of her mother, only fixed them
in her heart in deeper impreſſion, ſince
they gave to her mind in ſtronger tints,
the cruelty and oppreſſion to which her
tender years were condemned. The
progreſs which ſhe made in muſic and
drawing, and in the lighter ſubjects of
literature, while it pleaſed the Baroneſs,
who was her ſole inſtructreſs, brought
with it the bitter apprehenſion, that
theſe accompliſhments would probably
be buried in the obſcurity of a priſon;
ſtill however, they were not uſeleſs,
ſince they ſerved at preſent to cheat af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction
of many a weary moment, and
would in future delude the melancholy
hours of ſolitude. Laura was particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
fond of the lute, which ſhe touched
with exquiſite ſenſibility, and whoſe ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
notes were ſo ſweetly in uniſon with
the chords of ſorrow, and with thoſe
plaintive tones with which ſhe loved to
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:0149803000:171"/>
accompany it. While ſhe ſung, the
Baroneſs would ſit abſorbed in recollec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
the tears faſt falling from her eyes,
and ſhe might be ſaid to taſte in thoſe
moments the luxury of woe.</p>
            <p>Malcolm, ſtung with a ſenſe of guilt,
avoided the preſence of his injured cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
and ſought an aſylum from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
in the buſy ſcenes of war.</p>
            <p>Eighteen years had now elapſed ſince
the death of the Baron, and the confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Louiſa. Time had blunted the
point of affliction, though it ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
its venom; but ſhe ſeldom dared
to hope for that which for eighteen years
had been with-held. She derived her
only conſolation from the improvement
and the tender ſympathy of her daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
who endeavoured by every ſoothing
attention to alleviate the ſorrows of her
parent.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="158" facs="tcp:0149803000:172"/>
It was at this period that the Baroneſs
communicated to the Earl the ſtory of
her calamities.</p>
            <p>The Earl liſtened with deep attention
to the recital. His ſoul burned with
indignation againſt the Baron, while
his heart gave to the ſufferings of the
fair mourners, all that ſympathy could
aſk. Yet he was relieved from a very
painful ſenſation, when he learned that
the beauty of Laura had not influenced
the conduct of the Baron. Her op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
ſituation ſtruck upon his heart
the fineſt touch of pity; and the paſſion
which her beauty and her ſimplicity
had inſpired, was ſtrengthened and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liorated
by her misfortunes. The fate
of his father, and the idea of his own
injuries, ruſhed upon his mind; and,
combining with the ſufferings of the
victims now before him, rouſed in his
ſoul a ſtorm of indignation, little inferior
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:0149803000:173"/>
to that he had ſuffered in his firſt inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view
with the Baron. Every conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
ſunk before the impulſe of a juſt
revenge; his mind, occupied with the
hateful image of the murderer alone,
was hardened againſt danger, and in
the firſt energies of his reſentment he
would have ruſhed to the apartment
of Malcolm, and ſtriking the ſword of
juſtice in his heart, have delivered the
earth from a monſter, and have reſigned
himſelf the willing ſacrifice of the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
"Shall the monſter live?" cried
he, riſing from his ſeat. His ſtep was
hurried, and his countenance was
ſtamped with a ſtern virtue. The Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneſs
was alarmed, and following him
to the door of her apartment, which
he had half opened, conjured him to
pauſe for a moment on the dangers
that ſurrounded him. The voice of
reaſon in the accents of the Baroneſs,
interrupted the hurried tumult of his
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:0149803000:174"/>
ſoul; the illuſions of paſſion diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared;
he recollected that he was ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
of the apartment of the Baron,
and that he had no weapon to aſſiſt his
purpoſe; and he found himſelf as a
traveller on enchanted ground, when
the wand of the magician ſuddenly
diſſolves the airy ſcene, and leaves him
environed with the horrors of ſolitude
and of darkneſs.</p>
            <p>The Earl returned to his ſeat hopeleſs
and dejected, and loſt to every thing but
to the bitterneſs of diſappointment. He
forgot where he was, and the lateneſs of
the hour, till reminded by the Baroneſs
of the dangers of a longer ſtay, when he
mournfully bad her good night; and
advancing to Laura with timid reſpect,
preſſed her hand tenderly to his lips, and
retired to his priſon.</p>

            <head>CHAPTER VIII.</head>
            <p>HE had now opened the partition,
and was entering the room, when
by the faint gleam which the fire threw
acroſs the apartment, he perceived indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctly
the figure of a man, and in the
ſame inſtant heard the ſound of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching
armour. Surprize and horror
thrilled through every nerve; he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
fixed to the ſpot, and for ſome
moments heſitated whether to retire. A
fearful ſilence enſued; the perſon whom
he thought he had ſeen, diſappeared in
the darkneſs of the room; the noiſe of
armour was heard no more; and he
began to think that the figure he had
ſeen, and the ſound he had heard, were
the phantoms of a ſick imagination,
which the agitation of his ſpirits, the
ſolemnity of the hour, and the wide de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation
of the place had conjured up.
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:0149803000:176"/>
The low ſounds of an unknown voice
now ſtarted upon his ear; it ſeemed to
be almoſt cloſe beſide him; he ſprung
onward, and his hand graſped the ſteely
coldneſs of armour, while the arm it
encloſed ſtruggled to get free. "Speak!
what wretch art thou?" cried Oſbert,
when a ſudden blaze of light from the
fire diſcovered to him a ſoldier of the
Baron. His agitation for ſome time
prevented his obſerving that there was
more of alarm than of deſign expreſſed
in the countenance of the man; but the
apprehenſion of the Earl was quickly
loſt in aſtoniſhment, when he beheld
the guard at his feet. It was Edmund
who had entered the priſon under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of carrying fuel to the fire, but
ſecretly for the purpoſe of conferring
with Oſbert. When the Earl under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
he came from Alleyn, his boſom
glowed with gratitude towards the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
youth, whoſe ſteady and active
zeal had never relaxed ſince the hour in
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:0149803000:177"/>
which he firſt engaged in his cauſe.
The tranſport of his heart may be eaſily
imagined, when he learned the ſchemes
that were planning for his deliverance.
The circumſtance which had nearly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated
the warm hopes of his friends,
was by him diſregarded, ſince the
knowledge of the ſecret door opened to
him, with the aſſiſtance of a guide
through the intricacies of the caſtle, a
certain means of eſcape. Edmund was
well acquainted with all theſe. The
Earl told him of the diſcovery of
the falſe pannel; bade him return
to Alleyn with the joyful intelligence,
and on his next night of watch
prepare to aid him in eſcape. Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund
knew well the apartments which
Oſbert deſcribed, and the great ſtair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſe
which led into a part of the caſtle
that had long been totally forſaken, and
from whence it was eaſy to paſs unob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
into the vaults which communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:0149803000:178"/>
with the ſubterraneous paſſages in
the rock.</p>
            <p>Alleyn heard the report of James with
a warm and generous joy, which impelled
him to haſten immediately to the caſtle of
Athlin, and diſpel the ſorrows that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited
there; but the conſideration
that his ſudden abſence from the camp
might create ſuſpicion, and invite dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery,
checked the impulſe; and he
yielded with reluctance to the neceſſity
which condemned the Counteſs and
Mary to the horrors of a lengthened
ſuſpenſe.</p>
            <p>The Counteſs, meanwhile, whoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns,
ſtrengthened by the ſteady deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
of Mary, were unſhaken by the
meſſage of the Earl, which ſhe conſidered
as only the effect of a momentary im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe,
watched the gradual departure of
thoſe days which led to that which enve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loped
the fate of her children, with ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:0149803000:179"/>
and fainting hope. She received no
news from the camp; no words of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
from Alleyn; and ſhe ſaw the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
which had nouriſhed her exiſtence
ſlowly ſinking in deſpair. Mary ſought
to administer that comfort to the afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of her mother, which her own
equally demanded; ſhe ſtrove by the
fortitude with which ſhe endeavoured to
reſign herſelf, to ſoften the aſperity of
the ſufferings which threatened the
Counteſs; and ſhe contemplated the
approaching ſtorm with the determined
coolneſs of a mind aſpiring to virtue as
the chief good. But ſhe ſedulouſly
ſought to exclude Alleyn from her
mind; his diſintereſted and noble con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
excited emotions dangerous to her
fortitude, and which rendered yet more
poignant the tortures of the approaching
ſacrifice.</p>
            <p>Anxious to inform the Baroneſs of
his approaching deliverance, to aſſure
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:0149803000:180"/>
her of his beſt ſervices, to bid adieu to
Laura, and to ſeize the laſt opportunity
he might ever poſſeſs of diſcloſing to her
his admiration and his love, die Earl re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſited
the apartments of the Baroneſs.
She felt a lively pleaſure on the proſpect
of his eſcape; and Laura, in the joy
which animated her on hearing this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence,
forgot the ſorrows of her own
ſituation; forgot that of which her heart
ſoon reminded her—that Oſbert was
leaving the place of her confinement,
and that she ſhould probably ſee him no
more. This thought caſt a ſudden
ſhade over her features, and from the
enlivening expreſſion of joy, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed
their wonted melancholy. Oſbert
marked the momentary change, and his
heart ſpoke to him the occaſion. "My
cup of joy is dashed with bitterneſs,"
said he, "for amid the happineſs of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching
deliverance, I quit not my
priſon without ſome pangs of keen re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret;—pangs
which it were probably
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:0149803000:181"/>
uſeleſs to make known, yet which my
feelings will not ſuffer me at this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to conceal. Within theſe walls,
from whence I fly with eagerneſs, I
leave a heart fraught with the moſt ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
paſſion;—a heart, which while it
beats with life, muſt ever unite the
image of Laura with the fondneſs of
love. Could I hope that ſhe were not
inſenſible to my attachment I ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
in peace, and would defy the obſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
which bid me deſpair. Were I
even certain that ſhe would repel my
love with cold indifference, I would
yet if ſhe accept my ſervices, effect her
reſcue or give my life the forfeiture."
Laura was ſilent; ſhe wiſhed to ſpeak
her gratitude, yet feared to tell her love;
but the ſoft timidity of her eye, and the
tender glow of her cheek, revealed the
ſecret that trembled on her lips. The
Baroneſs obſerved her confuſion, and
thanking the Earl for the noble ſervice
he offered, declined accepting it; ſhe
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:0149803000:182"/>
beſought him to involve no further the
peace of his family and of himſelf, by
attempting an enterprize ſo crowded
with dangers, and which might proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
coſt him his life. The arguments
of the Baroneſs fell forceleſs when op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to the feelings of the Earl; ſo
warmly he urged his ſuit, and dwelt ſo
forcibly on his approaching departure,
that the Baroneſs ceaſed to oppoſe, and
the ſilence of Laura yielded acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſcence.
After a tender farewell, with
many earneſt wiſhes for his ſafety, the
Earl quitted the apartment elated with
hope. But the Baron had been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
of his projected eſcape, and had
ſtudied the means of counteracting it.
The centinel had communicated his
diſcovery to ſome of his comrades, who
without virtue or courage ſufficient to
quit the ſervice of the Baron, were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous
of obtaining his favour, and failed
not to ſeize on an opportunity ſo flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
as the preſent, to accomplish
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:0149803000:183"/>
their purpoſe. They communicated to
their Chief the intelligence they had
received.</p>
            <p>Malcolm, careful to conceal his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the ſcheme, from a deſign to
entrap thoſe of the clan who were to
meet the Earl, had ſuffered Edmund to
return to his ſtation at the priſon, where
he had placed the informers as ſecret
guards, and had taken ſuch other pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cautions
as were neceſſary to intercept
their flight, ſhould they elude the vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance
of the ſoldiers, and likewiſe to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
thoſe of his people who ſhould be
drawn toward the caſtle in expectation of
their Chief. Having done this, he
prided himſelf in ſecurity, and in the
certainty of exulting over his enemies,
thus entangled in their own ſtratagem.</p>
            <p>After many weary moments of impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
to Alleyn, and of expectation to
the Earl, the night at length arrived on
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:0149803000:184"/>
which hung the event of all their hopes.
It was agreed that Alleyn, with a choſen
few, ſhould await the arrival of the
Earl in the cavern where terminated
the ſubterraneous avenue. Alleyn parted
from James with extreme agitation, and
returned to his tent to compoſe his
mind.</p>
            <p>It was now the dead of night; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
ſleep reigned through the caſtle
of Dunbayne, when Edmund gently
unbolted the priſon door, and hailed the
Earl. He ſprung forward, and inſtantly
uncloſed the pannel, which they faſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened
after them to prevent diſcovery,
and paſſing with fearful ſteps the cold
and ſilent apartments, deſcended the
great ſtair-caſe into the hall, whoſe
wide and dark deſolation was rendered
viſible only by the dim light of the
taper which Edmund carried in his
hand, and whoſe vaulted ceiling re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>echoed
their ſteps. After various wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:0149803000:185"/>
they deſcended into the vaults; in
paſſing their dreary length they often
pauſed in fearful ſilence, liſtening to the
hollow blaſts which burſt ſuddenly
through the paſſages, and which ſeemed
to bear in the ſound the footſteps of
purſuit. At length they reached the
extremity of the vaults, where Edmund
ſearched for a trap-door which lay al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
concealed in the dirt and darkneſs;
after ſome time they found, and with
difficulty raiſed it, for it was long ſince
it had been opened; and it was beſides
heavy with iron work. They entered,
and letting the door fall after them,
deſcended a narrow ſlight of ſteps
which conducted them to a winding
paſſage cloſed by a door that opened in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the main avenue whence Alleyn had
before made his eſcape. Having gained
this, they ſtepped on with confidence,
for they were now not far from the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern
where Alleyn and his companions
were awaiting their arrival. The heart
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:0149803000:186"/>
of Alleyn now ſwelled with joy, for he
perceived a gleam of diſtant light break
upon the walls of the avenue, and at the
ſame time thought he heard the faint
ſound of approaching footſteps. Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient
to throw himſelf at the feet of
the Earl, he entered the avenue. The
light grew ſtronger upon the walls; but
a point of rock whoſe projection cauſed
a winding in the paſſage, concealed from
his view the perſon his eyes ſo eagerly
ſought. The ſound of ſteps was now
faſt approaching, and Alleyn gaining
the rock, ſuddenly turned upon three
ſoldiers of the Baron. They inſtantly
ſeized him their priſoner. Aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for a while overcome every other
ſenſation; but as they led him along, the
horrid reverſe of the moment ſtruck
upon his heart with all its conſequences,
and he had no doubt that the Earl had
been ſeized and carried back to his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.
As he marched along abſorbed in
this reflection, a light appeared at
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:0149803000:187"/>
ſome diſtance, from a door that opened
upon the avenue, and diſcovered the
figures of two men, who on perceiving
the party, retreated with precipitation,
and cloſed the door after them. Alleyn
knew the Earl in the perſon of one of
them. Two of the ſoldiers quitting
Alleyn, purſued the fugitives, and
quickly diſappeared through a door.
Alleyn finding himſelf alone with the
guard, ſeized the moment of opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
and made a deſperate effort to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
his ſword. He ſucceeded; and in
the ſuddenneſs of the attack, obtained
alſo the weapon of his adverſary, who,
unarmed, fell at his feet, and called for
mercy. Alleyn gave him his life. The
ſoldier, grateful for the gift, and fearful
of the Baron's vengeance, deſired to fly
with him, and enliſt in his ſervice.
They quitted the ſubterraneous way to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.
On entering the cavern, Alleyn
found it vacated by his friends, who on
hearing the claſh of armour, and the
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:0149803000:188"/>
loud and menacing voices of the ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
underſtood his fate, and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive
of numbers, had fled to avoid a
ſimilar diſaſter. Alleyn returned to his
tent, ſhocked with diſappointment, and
loſt in deſpair. Every effort which he
had made for the deliverance of the
Earl, had proved unſucceſsful; and this
ſcheme, on which was ſuſpended his
laſt hope, had been defeated at the very
moment in which he exulted in its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletion.
He threw himſelf on the
ground, and loſt in bitter thought, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
not the curtain of his tent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw,
till recalled by a ſudden noiſe, he
looked up, and beheld the Earl. Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
fixed him to the ſpot, and for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
he involuntarily acknowledged the
traditionary viſions of his nation. The
well-known voice of Oſbert, however,
awakened him to truth, and the ardor
with which he embraced his knees,
immediately convinced him that he
claſped reality.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="175" facs="tcp:0149803000:189"/>
The ſoldiers, in the eagerneſs of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit,
had miſtaken the door by which
Oſbert had retired, and had entered one
below it, which after engaging them in
a fruitleſs ſearch through various intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
paſſages, had conducted them to a
remote part of the caſtle, from whence
after much perplexity and loſs of time,
they were at length extricated. The
Earl, who had retreated on ſight of the
ſoldiers, had fled in the mean time to
regain the trap-door; but the united
ſtrength of himſelf and of Edmund was
in vain exerted to open it. Compelled
to encounter the approaching evil, the
Earl took the ſword of his companion,
reſolving to meet the approach of his
adverſaries, and to effect his deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
or yield his life and his misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes
to the attempt. With this deſign
he advanced deliberately along the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage,
and arriving at the door, ſtopped
to diſcover the motions of his purſuers:
all was profoundly ſilent. After re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:0149803000:190"/>
ſome time in this ſituation, he
opened the door, and examining the
avenue with a firm yet anxious eye as
far as the light of his taper threw its
beams, diſcovered no human being.
He proceeded with cautious firmneſs
towards the cavern, every inſtant ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting
the ſoldiers to ſtart ſuddenly
upon him from ſome dark receſs.—With
aſtoniſhment he reached the cave
without interruption; and unable to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
for his unexpected deliverance,
haſtened with Edmund to join his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
people.</p>
            <p>The ſoldiers who watched the priſon,
being ignorant of any other way by
which the Earl could eſcape, than the
door which they guarded, had ſuffered
Edmund to enter the apartment without
fear. It was ſome time before they
diſcovered their error; ſurprized at the
length of his ſtay, they opened the door
of the priſon, which to their utter aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:0149803000:191"/>
they found empty. The
grates were examined; they remained
as uſual; every corner was explored;
but the falſe pannel remained unknown;
and having finiſhed their examination
without diſcovering any viſible means
by which the Earl had quitted the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
they were ſeized with terror, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding
it to be the work of a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural
power, and immediately alarmed
the caſtle. The Baron, rouſed by the
tumult, was informed of the fact, and
dubious of the integrity of his guards,
aſcended to the apartment; which hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himſelf examined without diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any means of eſcape, he no longer
heſitated to pronounce the centinels ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to the Earl's enlargement. The
unfeigned terror which they exhibited
was miſtaken for artifice, and their
ſuppoſed treachery was admitted and
puniſhed in the ſame moment. They
were thrown into the dungeon of the
caſtle. Soldiers were immediately diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched
in purſuit, but the time
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:0149803000:192"/>
which had elapſed ere the guards had
entered the priſon, had given the Earl
an opportunity of eſcape. When the
certainty of this was communicated to
the Baron, every paſſion whoſe ſingle
force is miſery, united in his breaſt to
torture him; and his brain exaſperated
almoſt to madneſs, gave him only dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
images of revenge.</p>
            <p>The Baroneſs and Laura awakened by
the tumult, had been filled with appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion
for the Earl, till they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
of the cauſe of the general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion;
and hope and dubious joy were
ere long confirmed into certainty, for
they were told of the fruitleſs ſearch of
the purſuers.</p>
            <p>It was now the laſt day of the term
in which the Counteſs had ſtipulated to
return her anſwer; ſhe had yet heard
nothing from Alleyn; for Alleyn had
been buſied in ſchemes, of the event of
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:0149803000:193"/>
which he could ſend no account, for
their ſucceſs had been yet undetermined.
Every hope of the Earl's deliverance was
now expired, and in the anguiſh of her
heart, the Counteſs prepared to give that
anſwer which would ſend the devoted
Mary to the arms of the murderer.</p>
            <p>Mary, who aſſumed a fortitude not her
own, ſtrove to abate the rigor of her
mother's ſufferings, but vainly ſtrove;
they were of a nature which defied con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation.
She wrote the fatal agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but delayed till the laſt moment
delivering it into the hands of the meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger.
It was neceſſary, however, that
the Baron ſhould receive it on the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
morn, leſt the impatience of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
ſhould urge him to ſeize on the
life of the Earl as the forfeiture of delay.
She ſent, therefore, for the meſſenger,
who was a veteran of the clan, and with
extreme agitation delivered to him her
anſwer; grief interrupted her voice; ſhe
was unable to ſpeak to him; and he was
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:0149803000:194"/>
awaiting her orders, when the door of
the apartment was thrown open, and
the Earl, followed by Alleyn, threw
himſelf at her feet. A faint ſcream was
uttered by the Counteſs, and ſhe ſunk,
in her chair. Mary not daring to truſt
herſelf with the delightful viſion, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to reſtrain the tide of joy which
hurried to her heart, and threatened to
overwhelm her.</p>
            <p>The caſtle of Athlin refounded with
tumultuous joy on this happy event;
the courts were filled with thoſe of the
clan who had been diſabled from attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the field, and whom the report of
the Earl's return, which had circulated
with aſtoniſhing rapidity, had brought
thither. The hall re-echoed with voices;
and the people could ſcarcely be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained
from ruſhing into the preſence
of their Chief, to congratulate him on

When the firſt tranſports of the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
were ſubſided, the Earl preſented
Alleyn to his family as his friend and
deliverer; whoſe ſteady attachment he
could never forget, and whoſe zealous
ſervices he could never repay. The
cheek of Mary glowed with pleaſure and
gratitude at this tribute to the worth
of Alleyn; and the ſmiling approation of
her eyes rewarded him for his noble
deeds. The Counteſs received him
as the deliverer of both her children,
and related to Oſbert the adventure
in the wood. The Earl embraced
Alleyn, who received the united ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgements
of the family with
unaffected modeſty. Oſbert heſitated
not to pronounce the Baron the author
of the plot; his heart ſwelled to avenge
the repeated injuries of his family, and
he ſecretly reſolved to challenge his
enemy to ſingle combat. To renew the
ſiege he conſidered as a vain project;
and this challenge, though a very ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dequate
mode of revenge, was the only
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:0149803000:196"/>
honourable one that remained for him.
He forbore to mention his deſign to the
Counteſs, well knowing that her tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
would oppoſe the meaſure, and
throw difficulties in his way which
would embaraſs, without preventing
his purpoſe. He mentioned the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes
of the Baroneſs, and the love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs
of her daughter, and excited the
eſteem and the commiſſeration of his
hearers.</p>
            <p>The clamours of the people to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
their Lord, now aroſe to the
apartment of the Counteſs, and he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended
into the hall, accompanied by
Alleyn, to gratify their zeal. An uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
ſhout of joy reſounded through
the walls on his appearance. A noble
pleaſure glowed on the countenance
of the Earl at ſight of his faithful peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
and in the delight of that moment
his heart bore teſtimony to the ſuperior
advantages of an equitable government.
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:0149803000:197"/>
The Earl impatient to teſtify his grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
introduced Alleyn to the clan as
his friend and deliverer, and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
preſented his father with a lot of
land, where he might end his days in
peace and plenty. Old Alleyn thanked
the Earl for his offered kindneſs, but
declined accepting it; alledging, that
he was attached to his old cottage, and
that he had already ſufficient for the
comforts of his age.</p>
            <p>On the following morning a meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
was privately diſpatched to the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,
with the challenge of the Earl.
The challenge was couched in terms of
haughty indignation, and expreſſed that
nothing but the failure of all other
means could have urged him to the
condeſcenſion of meeting the aſſaſſin of
his father, on terms of equal combat.</p>
            <p>Happineſs was once more reſtored to
Athlin. The Counteſs, in the unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:0149803000:198"/>
preſervation of her children,
ſeemed to be alive only to joy. The
Earl was now for a time ſecure in the
boſom of his family, and though his
impatience to avenge the injuries of
thoſe moſt dear to him, and to ſnatch
from the hand of oppreſſion, the fair
ſufferers at Dunbayne, would not allow
him to be tranquil, yet he aſſumed a
gaiety unknown to his heart, and the
days were ſpent in feſtivals and joy.</p>

            <head>CHAPTER IX.</head>
            <p>IT was at this period, that one ſtormy
evening, the Counteſs was ſitting
with her family in a room, the windows
of which looked upon the ſea. The
winds burſt in ſudden ſqualls over the
deep, and daſhed the foaming waves
againſt the rocks with inconceivable
fury. The ſpray, notwithstanding the
high ſituation of the caſtle, flew up with
violence againſt the windows. The
Earl went out upon the terrace beneath
to contemplate the ſtorm. The moon
ſhone faintly by intervals, through bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
clouds upon the waters, illumining
the white foam which burſt around, and
enlightening the ſcene ſufficiently to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
it viſible. The ſurges broke on the
diſtant ſhores in deep reſounding mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murs,
and the ſolemn pauſes between
the ſtormy guſts filled the mind with
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:0149803000:200"/>
enthuſiaſtic awe. As the Earl ſtood
wrapt in the ſublimity of the ſcene, the
moon ſuddenly emerging from a heavy
cloud, ſhewed him at ſome diſtance, a
veſſel driven by the fury of the blaſt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the coaſt. He preſently heard
the ſignals of diſtreſs; and ſoon after
ſhrieks of terror, and a confuſed uproar
of voices were borne on the wind. He
haſtened from the terrace to order his
people to go out with boats to the aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of the crew, for he doubted not
that the veſſel was wrecked; but the ſea
ran ſo high as to make the adventure
impracticable. The ſound of voices
ceaſed, and he concluded the wretched
mariners were loſt, when the ſcreams of
diſtreſs again ſtruck his ear, and again
were loſt in the tumult of the ſtorm; in
a moment after the veſſel ſtruck upon
the rock beneath the caſtle; an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal
ſhriek enſued. The Earl, with his
people, haſtened to the aſſiſtance of the
crew; the fury of the guſt was now
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:0149803000:201"/>
abated, and the Earl jumping into a
boat with Alleyn and ſome others, rowed
to the ſhip, where they reſcued a part
of the drowning people. They were
conducted to the caſtle, and every com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
was liberally adminiſtered to them.
Among thoſe whom the Earl had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
into his boat, was a ſtranger,
whoſe dignified aſpect and manners be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoke
him to be of rank; he had ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
people belonging to him, but they
were foreigners, and ignorant of the
language of the country. He thanked
his deliverer with a noble frankneſs that
charmed him. In the hall they were
met by the Counteſs and her daughter,
who received the ſtranger with the warm
welcome which compaſſion for his ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
had inſpired. He was conducted
to the ſupper room, where the magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
of the board exhibited only the
uſual hoſpitality of his hoſt. The ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
ſpoke Engliſh fluently, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played
in his converſation a manly and
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:0149803000:202"/>
vigorous mind, acquainted with the
ſciences, and with life; and the caſt of
his obſervations ſeemed to characterize
the benevolence of his heart. The
Earl was ſo much pleaſed with his gueſt,
that he preſſed him to remain at his
caſtle till another veſſel could be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured;
his gueſt equally pleaſed with
the Earl, and a ſtranger to the country,
accepted the invitation.</p>
            <p>New diſtreſs now broke upon the
peace of Athlin; ſeveral days had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired,
and the meſſenger who had been
ſent to Malcolm, did not appear. It
was almoſt evident that the Baron, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed
and enraged at the eſcape of
his priſoner, and eager for a ſacrifice,
had ſeized this man as the ſubject of a
paltry revenge. The Earl, however,
reſolved to wait a few days, and watch
the event.</p>
            <p>The ſtruggles of latent tenderneſs
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:0149803000:203"/>
and aſſumed indifference, baniſhed tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity
from the boſom of Mary, and
pierced it with many ſorrows. The
friendship and honours beſtowed by the
Earl on Alleyn, who now reſided ſolely
at the caſtle, touched her heart with a
ſweet pride; but alas! theſe diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
ſerved only to confirm her admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of that worth which had already
attached her affections, and afforded
him opportunities of exhibiting in
brighter colours the various excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of a heart noble and expanſive, and
of a mind whoſe native elegance melio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
and adorned the bold vigour of its
flights. The langour of melancholy,
notwithſtanding the efforts of Mary,
would at intervals ſteal from beneath the
diſguiſe of cheerfulneſs, and diffuſe over
her beautiful features an expreſſion ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
interesting. The ſtranger was
not inſenſible to its charms, and it
ſerved to heighten the admiration with
which he had firſt beheld her into ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:0149803000:204"/>
more tender and more powerful.
The modeſt dignity with which ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
her ſentiments, which breathed
the pureſt delicacy and benevolence,
touched his heart, and he felt an intereſt
concerning her which he had never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
experienced.</p>
            <p>Alleyn, whoſe heart amid the anxieties
and tumults of the paſt ſcenes, had ſtill
ſighed to the image of Mary;—that
image which fancy had pictured in all
the charms of the original, and whoſe
glowing tints were yet softened and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
more intereſting by the ſhade of
melancholy with which abſence and
a hopeleſs paſſion had ſurrounded
them, found amid the leiſure of peace,
and the frequent opportunities which
were afforded him of beholding the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of his attachment, his ſighs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>double,
and the glooms of ſorrow thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en.
In the preſence of Mary, a ſoft
ſadneſs clouded his brow; he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:0149803000:205"/>
to aſſume a cheerfulneſs foreign
to his heart; but endeavoured in vain.
Mary perceived the change in his
manners; and the obſervation did not
contribute to enliven her own. The
Earl, too, obſerved that Alleyn had
loſt much of his wonted ſpirits, and
bantered him on the change, but thought
not of his ſiſter.</p>
            <p>Alleyn wiſhed to quit a place ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive
to his peace as the caſtle of
Athlin; he formed repeated reſolutions
of withdrawing himſelf from thoſe walls
which held him in a ſort of faſcination,
and rendered ineffectual every half-formed
wiſh, and every weak endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.
When he could no longer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
Mary, he would frequently retire
to the terrace, which was overlooked by
the windows of her apartment, and
ſpend half the night in traverſing with
ſilent mournful ſteps, that ſpot which
afforded him the melancholy pleaſure
of being near the object of his love.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="192" facs="tcp:0149803000:206"/>
Matilda wiſhed to queſtion Alleyn
concerning ſome circumſtances of the
late events, and for this purpoſe or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
him one day to attend her in her
cloſet. As he paſſed the outer apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Counteſs, he perceived
ſomething lying near the door through
which ſhe had before gone, and examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it, diſcovered a bracelet, to which
was attached a miniature of Mary. His
heart beat quick at the ſight; the
temptation was too powerful to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted;
he concealed it in his boſom, and
paſſed on. On quitting the cloſet, he
ſought with breathleſs impatience, a ſpot
where he might contemplate at leiſure
that precious portrait which chance had
ſo kindly thrown in his way. He drew
it trembling from his boſom, and beheld
again that countenance whoſe ſweet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
had touched his heart with all
the delightful agonies of love. As he
preſſed it with impaſſioned tenderneſs
to his lips, the tear of rapture trembled
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:0149803000:207"/>
in his eye, and the romantic ardor of the
moment was ſcarcely heightened by the
actual preſence of the beloved object,
whoſe light ſtep now ſtole upon his ear,
and half turning, he beheld not the
picture, but the reality!—Surprized!—Confuſed!—The
picture fell from
his hand. Mary, who had accidentally
ſtrolled to that ſpot, on obſerving the
agitation of Alleyn, was retiring, when
he, in whoſe heart had been awakened
every tender ſenſation, loſing in the
temptation of the moment the fear of
diſdain, and forgetting the reſolution
which he had formed of eternal ſilence,
threw himſelf at her feet, and preſſed
her hand to his trembling lips. His
tongue would have told her that he
loved, but his emotion, and the repul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
look of Mary, prevented him. She
inſtantly diſengaged herſelf with an air
of offended dignity, and caſting on him
a look of mingled anger and concern,
withdrew in ſilence. Alleyn remained
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:0149803000:208"/>
fixed to the ſpot; his eyes purſuing her
retiring ſteps, inſenſible to every feeling
but love and deſpair. So abſorbed was
he in the tranſition of the moment, that
he almoſt doubted whether a viſionary
illuſion had not croſſed his ſight to blaſt
his only remaining comfort—the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciouſneſs
of deſerving, and of poſſeſſing
the eſteem of her he loved. He left
the place with anguiſh in his heart,
and in the perturbation of his mind for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got
the picture.</p>
            <p>Mary had obſerved her mother's
bracelet fall from his hand, and was no
longer in perplexity concerning her mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niature;
but in the confuſion which his
behaviour occ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſioned her, ſhe forgot to
demand it of him. The Counteſs had
miſſed it almoſt immediately after his
departure from the cloſet, and had
caused a ſearch to be made, which
proving fruitleſs, her ſuſpicions wavered
upon him. The Earl, who ſoon after
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:0149803000:209"/>
paſſed the ſpot whence Alleyn had juſt
departed, found the miniature. It was
not long ere Alleyn recollected the
treaſure he had dropped, and returned
in ſearch of it. Inſtead of the picture,
he found the Earl: a conſcious bluſh
croſſed his cheek; the confuſion of his
countenance informed Oſbert of a part
of the truth; who, anxious to know by
what means he had obtained it, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
him the picture, and demanded
if he knew it. The ſoul of Alleyn
knew not to diſſemble; he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
that he had found, and concealed
it; prompted by that paſſion, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
of which, no other circumſtance
than the preſent could have wrung from
his heart. The Earl liſtened to him
with a mixture of concern and pity;
but hereditary pride chilled the warm
feelings of friendſhip and of gratitude,
and extinguiſhed the faint ſpark of hope
which the diſcovery had kindled in the
boſom of Alleyn. "Fear not, my
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:0149803000:210"/>
Lord," ſaid he, "the degradation of
your houſe from one who would ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
his life in its defence; never more
ſhall the paſſion which glows in my
heart eſcape from my lips. I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
from the ſpot where I have buried
my tranquillity." "No," replied the
Earl, "you ſhall remain here; I can
confide in your honour. O! that the
only reward which is adequate to your
worth and to your ſervices, ſhould be
impoſſible for me to beſtow." His
voice faultered, and he turned away to
conceal his emotion, with a ſuffering
little inferior to that of Alleyn.</p>
            <p>The diſcovery which Mary had made,
did not contribute to reſtore peace to
her mind. Every circumſtance con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired
to aſſure her of that ardent paſſion
which filled the boſom of him whom all
her endeavours could not teach her to
forget; and this conviction ſerved only
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:0149803000:211"/>
to heighten her malady, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
her wretchedneſs.</p>
            <p>The intereſt which the ſtranger diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered,
and the attention he paid to
Mary, had not paſſed unobſerved by
Alleyn. Love pointed to him the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
which was riſing in his heart, and
whiſpered that the vows of his rival
would be propitious. The words of
Oſbert confirmed him in the torturing
apprehenſion; for though his humble
birth had never ſuffered him to hope,
yet he thought he diſcovered in the
ſpeech of the Earl, ſomething more
than mere hereditary pride.</p>
            <p>The ſtranger had contemplated the
lovely form of Mary with increaſing
admiration ſince the firſt hour he
beheld her; this admiration was now
confirmed into love;—and he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
to acquaint the Earl with his
birth, and with his paſſion. For this
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:0149803000:212"/>
purpoſe, he one morning drew him
aſide to the terrace of the caſtle, where
they could converſe without interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and pointing to the ocean, over
which he had ſo lately been borne,
thanked the Earl, who had thus ſoftened
the horrors of ſhipwreck, and the deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of a foreign land, by the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of his hoſpitality. He informed
him that he was a native of Switzer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
where he poſſeſſed considerable
eſtates, from which he bore the title of
Count de Santmorin; that enquiry of
much moment to his intereſts had
brought him to Scotland, to a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
port of which he was bound,
when the diſaſter from which he had
been ſo happily reſcued, arreſted the
progreſs of his deſigns. He then related
to the Earl, that his voyage was under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
upon a report of the death of ſome
relations, at whoſe demiſe conſiderable
eſtates in Switzerland became his inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance.
That the income of theſe eſtates
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:0149803000:213"/>
had been hitherto received upon the
authority of powers, which, if the report
was true, were become invalid.</p>
            <p>The Earl liſtened to this narrative in
ſilent aſtoniſhment, and enquired with
much emotion, the name of the Count's
relations. "The Baroneſs Malcolm,"
returned he. The Earl claſped his hands
in extaſy. The Count, ſurprized at his
agitation, began to fear that the Earl
was diſagreeably interested in the welfare
of his adverſaries, and regretted that he
had diſcloſed the affair, till he obſerved
the pleaſure which was diffuſed through
his features. Oſbert explained the cauſe
of his emotion, by relating his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the Baroneſs; in the progreſs
of whoſe ſtory, the character of Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colm
was ſufficiently elucidated. He
diſcovered the cauſe of his hatred to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Baron, and the hiſtory of his
impriſonment; and alſo confided to his
honour the ſecret of his challenge.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="200" facs="tcp:0149803000:214"/>
The indignation of the Count was
ſtrongly excited; he was, however,
prevailed on by Oſbert to forego any
immediate effort of revenge, awaiting
for a while the movements of Malcolm.</p>
            <p>The Count was ſo abſorbed in won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and in new ſenſations, that he had
almoſt forgot the chief object of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terview.
Recollecting himſelf, he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
his paſſion, and requeſted per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
of the Earl to throw himſelf at
the feet of Mary. The Earl liſtened to
the declaration with a mixture of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
and concern; the remembrance of
Alleyn ſaddened his mind; but the wiſh
of an equal connection, made him wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
the offers of the Count, whoſe alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
he told him, would do honour to
the firſt nobility of his nation. If he
ſound the ſentiments of his ſiſter in
ſympathy with his own on this point,
he would welcome him to his family
with the affection of a brother; but he
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:0149803000:215"/>
wiſhed to diſcover the ſituation of her
heart, ere his noble friend diſcloſed to
her his prepoſſeſſion.</p>
            <p>The Earl, on his return to the caſtle,
enquired for Mary, whom he found in
the apartment of her mother. He
opened to them the hiſtory of the Count;
his relationſhip with the Baroneſs Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colm,
with the object of his expedition;
and cloſed the narrative with diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the attachment of his friend to
Mary, and his offers of alliance with his
family. Mary grew pale at this decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration;
there was a pang in her heart
which would not ſuffer her to ſpeak;
ſhe threw her eyes on the ground, and
burſt into tears. The Earl took her
hand tenderly in his; "my beloved
ſiſter," ſaid he, "knows me too well to
doubt my affection, or to ſuppoſe I can
wiſh to influence her upon a ſubject ſo
material to her future happineſs, and
where her heart ought to be the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:0149803000:216"/>
directreſs. Do me the juſtice to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
that I make known to you the
offers of the Count as a friend, not as a
director. He is a man, who from the
ſhort period of our acquaintance, I have
judged to be deſerving of particular
eſteem. His mind appears to be noble;
his heart expanſive; his rank is equal
with your own; and he loves you with
an attachment warm and ſincere. But
with all theſe advantages, I would not
have my ſiſter give herſelf to the man
who does not meet an intereſt in her
heart to plead his cauſe."</p>
            <p>The gentle ſoul of Mary ſwelled with
gratitude towards her brother; ſhe
would have thanked him for the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs
of theſe ſentiments, but a variety
of emotions were ſtruggling at her
heart, and ſtopped her utterance; tears,
and a ſmile ſoftly clouded with ſorrow,
were all ſhe could give him in reply.
He could not but perceive that ſome ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:0149803000:217"/>
cauſe of grief preyed upon her
mind, and he ſolicited to know, and to
remove it. "My dear brother will
believe the gratitude which his kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs—."
She would have finiſhed
the ſentence, but the words died away
upon her lips, and ſhe threw herſelf on
the boſom of her mother, concealing her
diſtreſs, and wept in ſilence. The
Counteſs too well underſtood the grief
of her daughter; ſhe had witneſſed the
ſecret ſtruggles of her heart, which all
her endeavours were not able to eraſe,
and which rendered the offers of the
Count diſguſting, and dreadful to her
imagination. Matilda knew how to
feel for her ſufferings, but the affection
of the mother extended her views be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the preſent temporary evil, to the
future welfare of her child; and in the
long perſpective of ſucceeding years, ſhe
beheld her united to the Count, whoſe
character diffuſed happineſs, and the
mild dignity of virtue to all around him;
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:0149803000:218"/>
ſhe received the thanks of Mary for her
gentle guidance to the good ſhe poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed;
the artleſs looks of the little
ones around her, ſmiled their thanks;
and the luxury of that ſcene recalled the
memory of times for ever paſſed, and
mingled with the tear of rapture, the
ſigh of fond regret. The ſureſt method
of eraſing that affection which threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened
ſerious evil to the peace of her
child if ſuffered to continue, and to
ſecure her permanent felicity, was to
unite her to the Count; whoſe amiable
diſpoſitions would ſoon win her affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and obliterate from her heart every
improper remembrance of Alleyn. She
determined, therefore, to employ argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and gentle perſuaſion, to guide
her to her purpoſe. She knew the mind
of Mary to be delicate and candid;
eaſy of conviction, and firm to purſue
what her judgment approved; and ſhe
did not deſpair of ſucceeding.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="205" facs="tcp:0149803000:219"/>
The Earl ſtill preſſed to know the
cauſe of that emotion which afflicted
her. "I am unworthy of your ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citude,"
ſaid Mary, "I cannot teach
my heart to ſubmit." "To ſubmit!—Can
you ſuppoſe your friends can
wiſh your heart to ſubmit on a point ſo
material to its happineſs, to ought that
is repugnant to its feelings? If the
offers of the Count are diſpleaſing to
you, tell me ſo; and I will return him his
anſwer. Believe that my firſt wiſh is to
ſee you happy." "Generous Oſbert!
How can I repay the goodneſs of ſuch
a brother! I would accept in gratitude
the hand of the Count, did not my feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
aſſure me I ſhould be miſerable.
I admire his character, and eſteem his
goodneſs; but alas!—why ſhould I
conceal it from you?—My heart is
another's—is another's, whoſe noble
deeds have won its involuntary regards;
one who is yet unconſcious of my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction,
and who ſhall for ever remain
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:0149803000:220"/>
in ignorance of it." The idea of Alleyn
flaſhed into the mind of the Earl, and
he no longer doubted to whom her
heart was engaged. "My own ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,"
ſaid he, "ſufficiently inform
me of the object of your admiration.
You do well to remember the dignity
of your ſex and of your rank; though I
muſt lament with you, that worth like
Alleyn's is not impowered by fortune to
take its ſtandard with nobility." At
Alleyn's name, the bluſhes of Mary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
Oſbert in his diſcovery. "My
child," ſaid the Counteſs, "will not
reſign her tranquillity to a vain and
ignoble attachment. She may eſteem
merit wherever it is found, but ſhe will
remember the duty which ſhe owes to
her family and to herſelf, in contracting
an alliance which is to ſupport or dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
the ancient conſequence of her
houſe. The offers of a man endowed
with ſo much apparent excellence as
the Count, and whoſe birth is equal to
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:0149803000:221"/>
your own, affords a proſpect too pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing
of felicity, to be haſtily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected.
We will hereafter converſe
more largely on this ſubject." "Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſhall you have reaſon to bluſh
for your daughter," ſaid Mary, with
a modeſt pride; "but pardon me,
Madam, if I entreat that we no more
renew a ſubject ſo painful to my fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,
and which cannot be productive
of good;—for never will I give my
hand where my heart does not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company
it." This was not a time
to preſs the topic; the Counteſs for
the preſent deſiſted, and the Earl left
the apartment with an heart divided be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
pity and diſappointment. Hope,
however, whiſpered to his wiſhes, that
Mary might in time be induced to admit
the addreſſes of the Count, and he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
not wholly to deſtroy his hopes.</p>

            <head>CHAPTER X.</head>
            <p>THE Count was walking on the
ramparts of the caſtle, involved
in thought, when Oſbert approached;
whoſe lingering ſtep and diſappointed
air, ſpoke to his heart the rejection of
his ſuit. He told the Count that Mary
did not at preſent feel for him thoſe
ſentiments of affection which would
juſtify her in accepting his propoſals.
This information, though it ſhocked
the hopes of the Count, did not entirely
deſtroy them; for he yet believed that
time and aſſiduity might befriend his
wiſhes. While theſe Noblemen were
leaning on the walls of the caſtle, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
in earneſt converſation, they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
on a diſtant hill a cloud emerging
from the verge of the horizon, whoſe
duſky hue glittered with ſudden light;
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:0149803000:223"/>
in an inſtant they deſcried the glance of
arms, and a troop of armed men poured
in long ſucceſſion over the hill, and
hurried down its ſide to the plains be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.
The Earl thought he recognized
the clan of the Baron. It was the Baron
himſelf who now advanced at the head
of his people, in ſearch of that revenge
which had been hitherto denied him;
and who, determined on conqueſt, had
brought with him an hoſt which he
thought more than ſufficient to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm
the caſtle of his enemy.</p>
            <p>The meſſenger who had been ſent
with the challenge, had been detained a
priſoner by Malcolm; who, in the mean
time, had haſtened his preparations to
ſurprize the caſtle of Athlin. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
of his ſervant had awakened
the ſuſpicions of the Earl, and he had
taken precautions to guard againſt the
deſigns of his enemy. He had ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned
his clan to hold themſelves in
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:0149803000:224"/>
readineſs for a ſudden attack, and had
prepared his caſtle for the worſt emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency.
He now ſent a meſſenger to
the clan with ſuch orders as he judged
expedient, arranged his plans within the
walls, and took his ſtation on the ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts
to obſerve the movements of his
enemy. The Count, clad in arms, ſtood
by his ſide. Alleyn was poſted with a
party within the great gate of the
caſtle.</p>
            <p>The Baron advanced with his people,
and quickly ſurrounded the walls. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
all was ſilent; the caſtle ſeemed to
repoſe in ſecurity; and the Baron, certain
of victory, congratulated himſelf on the
ſucceſſ of the enterprize, when obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Earl, whoſe perſon was concealed
in armour, he called to him to ſurrender
himſelf and his Chief to the arms of
Malcolm. The Earl anſwered the ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
with an arrow from his bow,
which, miſſing the Baron, pierced one of
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:0149803000:225"/>
his attendants. The archers who had been
planted behind the walls, now diſcovered
themſelves, and diſcharged a ſhower of
arrows; at the ſame time every part of
the caſtle appeared thronged with the
ſoldiers of the Earl, who hurled on the
heads of the aſtonished beſiegers, launces
and other miſſil weapons with unceaſing
rapidity. The alarum bell now rung
out the ſignal to that part of the clan
without the walls, and they immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
poured upon the enemy, who,
confounded by this unexpected attack,
had ſcarcely time to defend themſelves.
The clang of arms reſounded through
the air, with the ſhouts of the victors
and the groans of the dying. The fear
of the Baron, which had principally
operated on the minds of his people,
was now overcome by ſurprize, and the
fear of death; and on the firſt repulſe,
they deſerted from the ranks in great
numbers, and fled to the diſtant hills.
In vain the Baron endeavoured to rally
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:0149803000:226"/>
his ſoldiers, and keep them to the
charge; they yielded to a ſtronger im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe
than the menaces of their Chief,
who was now left with leſs than half his
numbers at the foot of the walls. The
Baron, to whom cowardice was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known,
diſdaining to retreat, continued
the attack. At length the gates of the
caſtle were thrown open, and a party
iſſued upon the aſſailants, headed by the
Earl and the Count, who divided in
queſt of Malcolm. The Count ſought
in vain, and the ſearch of Oſbert was
equally fruitleſs; their adverſary was
no where to be found. Oſbert, appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive
of his gaining admittance to the
caſtle by ſtratagem, was returning in
haſte to the gates, when he received the
ſtroke of a ſword upon his ſhoulder;
his armour had broke the force of the
blow, and the wound it had given was
ſlight. He turned his ſword, and facing
his enemy, diſcovered a ſoldier of Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colm's,
who attacked him with a deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:0149803000:227"/>
courage. The encounter was fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
and long; dexterity and equal
valour ſeemed to animate both the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batants.
Alleyn, who obſerved from
his poſt the danger of the Earl, flew in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
to his aſſiſtance; but the criſis
of the ſcene was paſt ere he arrived;
the weapon of Oſbert had pierced the
ſide of his adverſary, and he fell to the
ground. The Earl diſarmed him, and
holding over him his ſword, bade him
aſk his life. "I have no life to aſk,"
ſaid Malcolm, whoſe fainting voice the
Earl now diſcovered, "if I had, 'tis
death only I would accept from you.
O! curſed!—." He would have
finiſhed the ſentence, but his wound
flowed apace, and he fainted with loſs
of blood. The Earl threw down his
ſword, and calling a party of his people,
he committed to them the care of the
Baron, and ordered them to proceed and
ſeize the caſtle of Dunbayne. Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
their Chief was mortally
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:0149803000:228"/>
wounded, the remains of Malcolm's
army had fled from the walls. The peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of the Earl proceeded without inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,
and took poſſeſſion of the caſtle without oppoſition.</p>
            <p>The wounds of the Baron were
examined when he reached Dunbayne,
and a dubious ſentence of the event
was pronounced. His countenance
marked the powerful workings of
his mind, which ſeemed labouring
with an unknown evil; he threw his
eyes eagerly round the apartment, as if
in ſearch of ſome object which was not
preſent. After ſeveral attempts to ſpeak,
"Flatter me not," ſaid he, "with hopes
of life; it is flitting faſt away; but
while I have breath to ſpeak, let me ſee
the Baroneſs." She came, and hanging
over his couch in ſilent horror, received
his words. "I have injured you,
Madam, I fear beyond reparation. In
theſe laſt few moments let me endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to relieve my conſcience by diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:0149803000:229"/>
to you my guilt and my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe."
The Baroneſs ſtarted, ſearful
of the coming ſentence. "You had a
ſon." "What of my ſon?" "You
had a ſon whom my boundleſs ambition
doomed to exile from his parents and
his heritage, and who I cauſed you to
believe had died in your abſence."
"Where is my child?" exclaimed the
Baroneſs. "I know not," reſumed
Malcolm, "I committed him to the
care of a man and woman who then
lived on a remote part of my lands, but
a few years after they diſappeared, and
I have never heard of them ſince. The
boy paſſed for a foundling whom I had
ſaved from periſhing. One ſervant only
I entruſted with the ſecret; the reſt
were impoſed upon. Thus far I tell
you, Madam, to prompt you to enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and to aſſuage the agonies of a bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
conſcience. I have other deeds
—." The Baroneſs could hear no
more; she was carried inſenſible ſrom
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:0149803000:230"/>
the apartment. Laura, ſhocked at her
condition, was informed of its cauſe,
and filial tenderneſs watched over her
with unwearied attention.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the Earl, on quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Malcolm, had returned immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to the caſtle, and was the firſt meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of that event which would probably
avenge the memory of his father, and
terminate the diſtreſſes of his family.
The ſight of Oſbert, and the news he
brought, revived the Counteſs and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
who had retired during the aſſault
into an inner apartment of the caſtle for
greater ſecurity, and who had ſuffered
during that period all the terrors which
their ſituation could inſpire. They
were ſoon after joined by the Count and
by Alleyn, whoſe conduct did not paſs
unnoticed by the Earl. The cheek of
Mary glowed at the relation of this
New inſtance of his worth; and it
was Alleyn's ſweet reward to obſerve
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:0149803000:231"/>
her emotion. There was a ſentiment
in the heart of Oſbert which ſtruggled
againſt the pride of birth; he wiſhed to
reward the ſervices and the noble ſpirit
of the youth, with the virtues of Mary;
but the authority of early prejudice
ſilenced the grateful impulſe, and ſwept
from his heart the characters of truth.</p>
            <p>The Earl, accompanied by the Count,
now haſtened to the caſtle of Dunbayne,
to cheer the Baroneſs and her daughter
with their preſence. As they approached
the caſtle, the ſtillneſs and deſolation of
the ſcene beſpoke the ſituation of its
lord; his people were entirely diſperſed,
a few only of his centinels wandered
before the eaſtern gate; who, having
made no oppoſition, were ſuffered by
the Earl's people to remain. Few of
the Baron's people were to be ſeen;
thoſe few were unarmed, and appeared
the effigies of fallen greatneſs. As the
Earl croſſed the platform, the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of the paſt crowded upon his
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:0149803000:232"/>
mind. The agonies which he had there
ſuffered,—the image of death which
glared upon his ſight, aggravated by
the bitter and ignominious circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
which attended his fate; the
figure of Malcolm, mighty in injuſtice,
and cruel in power; whoſe counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
ſmiling horribly in triumphant
revenge, ſent to his heart the ſtroke of
anguiſh;—each circumſtance of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
aroſe to his imagination in the
glowing colours of truth; he ſhuddered
as he paſſed; and the contraſt of the
preſent ſcene touched his heart with the
moſt affecting ſentiments. He ſaw the
innate and active power of juſtice, which
pervades all the circumſtances even of
this lifelike vital principle, and ſhines
through the obſcurity of human acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to the virtuous, the pure ray of
Heaven;—to the guilty, the deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
glare of lightning.</p>
            <p>On enquiring for the Baroneſs, they
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:0149803000:233"/>
were told ſhe was in the apartment of
Malcolm, whoſe moment of diſſolution
was now approaching. The name of
the Count was delivered to the Baroneſs,
and overheard by the Baron, who deſired
to ſee him. Louiſa went out to receive
her noble relation with all the joy
which a meeting ſo deſirable and ſo un-looked
for, could inſpire. On ſeeing
Oſbert, her tears flowed faſt; and ſhe
thanked him for his generous care, in a
manner that declared a deep ſenſe of his
ſervices. Leaving him, ſhe conducted
the Count to Malcolm, who lay on his
couch ſurrounded with the ſtillneſs and
horrors of death. He raiſed his languid
head, and diſcovered a countenance wild
and terrific, whoſe ghaſtly aſpect was
overſpread with the paleneſs of death.
The beauteous Laura, overcome by the
ſcene, hung like a drooping lilly over
his couch, dropping faſt her tears.
"My lord," ſaid Malcolm, in a low
tone, "you ſee before you a wretch,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:0149803000:234"/>
anxious to relieve the agony of a guilty
mind. My vices have deſtroyed the
peace of this lady,—have robbed her of
a ſon—but ſhe will diſcloſe to you the
ſecret guilt, which I have now no time
to tell. I have for ſome years received,
as you now well know, the income of
thoſe foreign lands which are her due;
as a ſmall reparation for the injuries ſhe
has ſuſtained, I bequeath to her all the
poſſeſſions which I lawfully inherit, and
reſign her into your protection. To
aſk oblivion of the paſt of you, Madam,
and of you, my Lord, is what I dare not
do; yet it would be ſome conſolation
to my departing ſpirit, to be aſſured of
your forgiveneſs." The Baroneſs was
too much affected to reply but by a look
of aſſent; the Count aſſured him of
forgiveneſs, and beſought him to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
his mind for his approaching fate.
"Compoſure, my Lord, is not for me;
my life has been marked with vice, and
my death with the bitterneſs of fruitleſs
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:0149803000:235"/>
remorſe. I have underſtood virtue, but
I have loved vice. I do not now lament
that I am puniſhed, but that I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
puniſhment." The Baron ſunk
on his couch, and in a few moments af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
expired in a ſtrong ſigh. Thus ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated
the life of a man, whoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
might have reached the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs
of virtue, but whoſe actions diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played
the features of vice.</p>
            <p>From this melancholy ſcene, the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneſs,
with the Count and Laura, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired
to her apartment, where the Earl
awaited their return with anxious ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citude.
The ſternneſs of juſtice for a
moment relaxed when he heard of Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colm's
death; his heart would have
ſighed with compaſſion, had not the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
of his father croſſed his
mind, and checked the impulſe. "I
can now, Madam," ſaid he, addreſſing
the Baroneſs, "reſtore you a part of
thoſe poſſeſſions which were once your
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:0149803000:236"/>
Lord's, and which ought to have been
the inheritance of your ſon; this caſtle
from henceforth is your's; I reſign it to
its lawful owner." The Baroneſs was
overcome with the remembrance of his
ſervices, and could ſcarcely thank him
but with her tears. The ſervant whom
the Baron had mentioned as the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
of his iniquities, was ſent for, and
interrogated concerning the infant he
had charge of. From him, however,
little comfort was received; for he could
only tell, that he had conveyed the
child, by the orders of his maſter, to a
cottage on the furtheſt borders of his
eſtates, where he had delivered it to the
care of a woman, who there lived with
her huſband. Theſe people received at
the ſame time, a ſum of money for its
ſupport, with a promiſe of future ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies.
That for ſome years he had been
punctual in the payment of the ſums
entruſted to him by the Baron, but at
length he yielded to the temptation of
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:0149803000:237"/>
with-holding them for his own uſe; and
on enquiring for the people ſome years
after, he found they were gone from the
place. The conditions of the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneſs's
pardon to the man, depended
on his endeavours to repair the injury
he had promoted, by a ſtrict ſearch for
the people to whom he had committed
her child. She now conſulted with her
friends on the beſt means to be purſued
in this buſineſs, and immediately ſent off
meſſengers to different parts of the
country to gather information.</p>
            <p>The Baroneſs was now releaſed from
oppreſſion and impriſonment; ſhe was
re-inſtated in her ancient poſſeſſions, to
which were added all the hereditary
lands of Malcolm, together with his
perſonal fortune: ſhe was ſurrounded
by thoſe whom ſhe moſt loved, and in
the midſt of a people who loved her;
yet the conſequence of the Baron's
guilt had left in her heart one drop of
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:0149803000:238"/>
gall which embittered each ſource of
happineſs, and made her life melancholy
and painful.</p>
            <p>The Count was now her viſitor; ſhe
was much conſoled by his preſence;
and Laura's hours were often enlivened
by the converſation of the Earl, to whom
her heart was tenderly attached, and
whoſe frequent viſits to the caſtle, were
devoted to love and her.</p>
            <p>The felicity of Matilda now appeared
as perfect and as permanent as is conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
with the nature of ſublunary beings.
Juſtice was done to the memory of her
Lord, and her beloved ſon was ſpared to
bleſs the evening of her days. The father
of Laura had ever been friendly to the
houſe of Athlin, and her delicacy felt
no repugnance to the union which
Oſbert ſolicited. But her happineſs,
whatever it might appear, was incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete;
ſhe ſaw the ſettled melancholy of
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:0149803000:239"/>
Mary, for love ſtill corroded her heart,
and notwithſtanding her efforts, ſhaded
her aſpect. The Counteſs wiſhed to
produce thoſe nuptials with the Count,
which ſhe thought would re-eſtabliſh
the peace of her child, and inſure her
future felicity. She omitted no oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
of preſſing his ſuit, which ſhe
managed with a delicacy that rendered
it leſs painful to Mary; whoſe words,
however, were few in reply, and who
could ſeldom bear the ſubject to be long
continued. Her ſettled averſion to the
addreſſes of the Count, at length baffled
the expectations of Matilda, and ſhewed
her the fallacy of her efforts. She
thought it improper to ſuffer the Count
any longer to nouriſh in his heart a vain
hope; and ſhe reluctantly commiſſioned
the Earl to undeceive him on this
point.</p>
            <p>With the Baroneſs, month after
month ſtill elapſed in fruitleſs ſearch of
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:0149803000:240"/>
her ſon; the people with whom he had
been placed were no where to be found,
and no track was diſcovered which
might lead to the truth. The diſtreſs
of the Baroneſs can only be imagined;
ſhe reſigned herſelf in calm deſpair to
mourn in ſilence, the eaſy confidence
which had entruſted her child to the care
of thoſe who had betrayed him. Though
happineſs was denied her, ſhe was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
to with-hold it from thoſe whom
it awaited; and at length yielded to
the entreaties of the Earl, and became
his advocate with Laura, for the nup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials
which were to unite their fate.</p>
            <p>The Earl introduced the Counteſs
and Mary to the caſtle of Dunbayne.
Similarity of ſentiment and diſpoſition
united Matilda and the Baroneſs in a
laſting friendſhip. Mary and Laura
were not leſs pleaſed with each other.
The dejection of the Count at ſight of
Mary, declared the ardor of his paſſion,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:0149803000:241"/>
and would have awakened in her breaſt
ſomething more than compaſſion, had
not her heart been pre-occupied. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leyn,
who could think of Mary only,
wandered through the caſtle of Athlin a
ſolitary being, who fondly haunts the
ſpot where his happineſs lies buried.
His prudence formed reſolutions which
his paſſion as quickly broke; and cheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by love, though followed by deſpair,
he delayed his departure from day to
day, and the illuſion of yeſterday conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
to be the illuſion of the morrow.
The Earl, attached to his virtues, and
grateful for his ſervices, would have
beſtowed on him every honour but that
alone which could give him happineſs,
and which his pride would have ſuffered
him to accept. Yet the honours which
he refuſed—he refuſed with a grace ſo
modeſt, as to conciliate kindneſs rather
than wound generoſity.</p>
            <p>In a gallery on the North ſide of the
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:0149803000:242"/>
caſtle, which was filled with pictures of
the family, hung a portrait of Mary.
She was drawn in the dreſs which ſhe
wore on the day of the feſtival, when
ſhe was led by the Earl into the hall,
and preſented as the partner of Alleyn.
The likeneſs was ſtriking, and expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
of all the winning grace of the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal.
As often as Alleyn could ſteal
from obſervation, he retired to this gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery
to contemplate the portrait of her
who was ever preſent to his imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
here he could breathe that ſigh
which her preſence reſtrained, and ſhed
thoſe tears which her preſence forbade
to flow. As he ſtood one day in this
place, wrapt in melancholy muſing, his
ear was ſtruck with the notes of sweet
muſic; they ſeemed to iſſue from the
bottom of the gallery. The inſtrument
was touched with an exquiſite expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and in a voice whoſe tones floated
on the air in ſoft undulations; he diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed
the following words, which he
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:0149803000:243"/>
remembered to be an ode compoſed
by the Earl, and preſented to Mary,
who had ſet it to muſic the day before.</p>

            <p>Entranced in the ſweet ſounds, he
had proceeded ſome ſteps down the
gallery, when the muſic ceaſed. He
ſtopped. After a ſhort pauſe it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned,
and as he advanced he diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed
theſe words, ſung in a low voice
mournfully ſweet:
<q>
                  <l>In ſolitude I mourn thy reign,</l>
                  <l>Ah! youth belov'd—but lov'd in vain!</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="231" facs="tcp:0149803000:245"/>
The voice was broken, and loſt in
ſobs; the chords of the lute were wildly
ſtruck: and in a few moments ſilence
enſued. He ſtepped on towards the
ſpot whence the ſounds had proceeded,
and through a door which was left open,
he diſcovered Mary hanging over her
lute diſſolved in tears. He ſtood for
ſome moments abſorbed in mute admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
and unobſerved by Mary, who
was loſt in her tears, till a ſigh which
eſcaped him, recalled her to reality; ſhe
raiſed her eyes, and beheld the object
of her ſecret ſorrows. She aroſe in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion;
the bluſh on her cheek betrayed
her heart; ſhe was retiring in haſte from
Alleyn, who remained at the entrance
of the room the ſtatue of deſpair, when
ſhe was intercepted by the Earl, who
entered by the door ſhe was opening;
her eyes were red with weeping; he
glanced on her a look of ſurprize and
diſpleaſure, and paſſed on to the gallery
followed by Alleyn, who was now awak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:0149803000:246"/>
from his trance. "From you,
Alleyn," ſaid the Earl, in a tone of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure,
"I expected other conduct;
on your word I relied, and your word
has deceived me." "Hear me,
my Lord," returned the youth, "your
confidence I have never abuſed; hear
me." "I have now no time for parley,"
replied Oſbert, "my moments are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious;
ſome future hour of leiſure may
ſuffice." So ſaying, he walked away
with an abrupt haughtineſs, which
touched the ſoul of Alleyn, who diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
to purſue him with further ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation.
He was now completely
wretched. The ſame accident which
had unveiled to him the heart of Mary,
and the full extent of that happineſs
which fate with-held, confirmed him in
deſpair. The ſame accident had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
the delicacy of her he loved to a
cruel ſhock, and had ſubjected his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to ſuſpicion; and to a ſevere re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke
from him, by whom it was his
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:0149803000:247"/>
pride to be reſpected, and for whoſe
ſafety he had ſuffered impriſonment, and
encountered death.</p>
            <p>Mary had quitted the cloſet diſtreſſed
and perplexed. She perceived the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
of the Earl, and it ſhocked her.
She wiſhed to undeceive him, but he
was gone to the caſtle of Dunbayne, to
pay one of thoſe viſits which were ſoon
to conclude in the nuptials, and whence
he did not return till evening. The
ſcene which he had witneſſed in the
morning, involved him in a tumult of
diſtreſs. He conſidered the mutual paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
which filled the boſom of his ſiſter
and Alleyn; he had ſurprized them in a
ſolitary apartment; he had obſerved
the tender and melancholy air of Alleyn,
and the tears and confuſion of Mary;
and he at firſt did not heſitate to believe
that the interview had been appointed. In
the heat of his diſpleaſure he had reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the explanation of Alleyn with a
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:0149803000:248"/>
haughty reſentment, which the late ſcene
alone could have excited, and which the
deluſion it had occaſioned alone could
excuſe. Cooler conſideration, however,
brought to his mind the delicacy and the
amiable pride of Mary, and the integrity
of Alleyn; and he accuſed himſelf of a
too haſty deciſion. The zealous ſervices
of Alleyn came to his heart; he repented
that he had treated him ſo rigorouſly;
and on his return enquired for him, that
he might hear an explanation, and that
he might ſoften the aſperity of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
behaviour.</p>

            <p>ALLEYN was no where to be
found. The Earl went himſelf in
queſt of him, but without ſucceſs. As
he returned from the terrace, chagrined
and diſappointed, he obſerved two per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
croſs the platform at ſome diſtance
before him; and he could perceive by
the dim moon-light which fell upon the
ſpot, that they were not of the caſtle.
He called to them; no anſwer was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned;
but at the ſound of his voice
they quickened their pace, and almoſt
inſtantly diſappeared in the darkneſs of
the ramparts. Surprized at this phoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomenon,
the Earl followed with haſty
ſteps, and endeavoured to purſue the
way they had taken. He walked on
ſilently, but there was no ſound to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:0149803000:250"/>
his ſteps. When he came to the
extremity of the rampart, which formed
the North angle of the caſtle, he ſtopped
to examine the ſpot, and to liſten if any
thing was ſtirring. No perſon was to be
ſeen, and all was huſhed. After he had
ſtood ſome time ſurveying the rampart,
he heard the low reſtrained voice of a
perſon unknown, but the diſtance pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
his diſtinguiſhing the ſubject of
the converſation. The voice ſeemed to
approach the place where he ſtood. He
drew his ſword, and watched in ſilence
their motions. They continued to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance,
till ſuddenly ſtopping, they
turned, and took a long ſurvey of the
fabric. Their diſcourſe was conducted
in a low tone; but the Earl could diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
by the vehemence of their geſture,
and the caution of their ſteps, that they
were upon ſome deſign dangerous to the
peace of the caſtle. Having finiſhed
their examination, they turned again to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the place where the Earl ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained;
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:0149803000:251"/>
the ſhade of a high turret con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed
him from their view, and they
continued to approach till they arrived
within a ſhort ſpace of him, when they
turned through a ruined arch-way of
the caſtle, and were loſt in the dark re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes
of the pile. Aſtoniſhed at what he
had ſeen, Oſbert haſtened to the caſtle,
whence he diſpatched ſome of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in ſearch of the unknown fugitives;
he accompanied ſome of his domeſtics
to the ſpot where they had laſt diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared.
They entered the arch-way,
which led to a decayed part of the caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle;
they followed over broken pave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
the remains of a paſſage, which was
cloſed by a low obſcure door almoſt
concealed from ſight by the thick ivy
which overſhadowed it. On opening
this door, they deſcended a flight of
ſteps which led under the pile, ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
narrow and broken as to make
the deſcent both difficult and dangerous.
The powerful damps of long pent-up
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:0149803000:252"/>
vapours extinguiſhed their light, and
the Earl and his attendants were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
to remain in utter darkneſs
while one of them went round to the
habitable part of the caſtle to relume
the lamp. While they awaited in ſilence
the return of light, a ſhort breathing
was diſtinctly heard at intervals, near the
place where they ſtood. The ſervants
ſhook with fear, and the Earl was not
wholly unmoved. They remained en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
ſilent, liſtening its return, when a
ſound of footſteps ſlowly ſtealing
through the vault, ſtartled them. The
Earl demanded who paſſed;—he was
anſwered only by the deep echoes of his
voice. They claſhed their ſwords and
had advanced, when the ſteps haſtily
retired before them. The Earl ruſhed
forward, purſuing the ſound, till over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
the perſon who fled, he ſeized
him; a ſhort ſcuffle enſued; the ſtrength
of Oſbert was too powerful for his anta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goniſt,
who was nearly overcome, when
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:0149803000:253"/>
the point of a ſword from an unknown
hand pierced his ſide, he relinquiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his graſp, and fell to the ground.
His domeſtics, whom the activity of
their maſter had outran, now came up;
but the aſſaſſins, whoever they were,
had accomplished their eſcape, for the
ſound of their ſteps was quickly loſt in
the diſtance of the vaults. They endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to raiſe the Earl, who lay ſpeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
on the ground; but they knew not
how to convey him from that place of
horror, for they were yet in total dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and unacquainted with the place.
In this ſituation, every moment of delay
appeared an age. Some of them tried
to grope their way to the entrance, but
their efforts were defeated by the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and the ruinous ſituation of the
place. The light at length appeared,
and diſcovered the Earl inſenſible, and
weltering in his blood. He was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed
into the caſtle, where the horror
of the Counteſs on ſeeing him borne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:0149803000:254"/>
the hall, may be eaſily imagined.
By the help of proper applications he
was reſtored to life; his wound was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined,
and found to be dangerous; and
he was carried to bed in a ſtate which
gave very faint hopes of recovery. The
aſtoniſhment of the Counteſs on hearing
the adventure, was equalled only by her
diſtreſs. All her conjectures concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the deſigns and the identity of the
aſſaſſin, were vague and uncertain. She
knew not on whom to fix the ſtigma;
nor could diſcover any means by which
to penetrate this myſterious affair. The
people who had remained in the vaults
to purſue the ſearch, now returned to
Matilda. Every receſs of the caſtle, and
every part of the ramparts had been
explored, yet no one could be found;
and the myſtery of the proceeding was
heightened by the manner in which the
men had effected their eſcape.</p>
            <p>Mary watched over her brother in
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:0149803000:255"/>
ſilent anguiſh, yet ſhe ſtrove to conceal
her diſtreſs, that ſhe might encourage
the Counteſs to hope. The Counteſs
endeavoured to reſign herſelf to the
event with a kind of deſperate fortitude.
There is a certain point of miſery, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
which the mind becomes callous,
and acquires a ſort of artificial calm.
Exceſs of miſery may be ſaid to blaſt
the vital powers of feeling, and by a
natural conſequence conſumes its own
principle. Thus it was with Matilda:
a long ſucceſſion of trials had reduced
her to a ſtate of horrid tranquillity,
which followed the firſt ſhock of the
preſent event. It was not ſo with Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra;
young in misfortune, and gay in
hope, ſhe ſaw happineſs fade from her
graſp with a warmth of feeling un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touched
by the chill of diſappointment.
When the news of the Earl's ſituation
reached her, ſhe was overcome with
affliction, and pined in ſilent anguiſh.
The Count haſtened to Oſbert, but grief
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:0149803000:256"/>
fat heavy at his heart, and he had no
power to offer to others the comfort
which he wanted himſelf.</p>
            <p>A fever, which was the conſequence
of his wounds, added to the danger of
the Earl, and to the deſpair of his fam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily.
During this period, Alleyn had
not been ſeen at the caſtle; and his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
at this time, raiſed in Mary a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
of diſtreſſing apprehenſions. Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert
enquired for him, and wiſhed to ſee
him. The ſervant who had been ſent
to his father's cottage, brought word
that it was ſome days ſince he had been
there, and that nobody knew whither he
was gone. The ſurprize was univerſal,
but the effect it produced was various
and oppoſite. A collection of ſtrange and
concomitant circumſtances, now forced
a ſuſpicion on the mind of the Counteſs,
which her heart, and her remembrance
of the former conduct of Alleyn, at
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:0149803000:257"/>
once condemned. She had heard of
what paſſed between the Earl and him in
the gallery; his immediate abſence; the
event which followed, and his ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
flight, formed a chain of evidence
which compelled her with the utmoſt
reluctance, to believe him concerned in
the affair which had once more involved
her houſe in miſery. Mary had too
much confidence in her knowledge of
his character, to admit a ſuſpicion of
this nature. She rejected with inſtant
diſdain, the idea of uniting Alleyn with
diſhonour; and that he ſhould be guilty
of an action ſo baſe as the preſent, ſoared
beyond all the bounds of poſſibility.
Yet ſhe felt a ſtrange ſolicitude concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him, and apprehenſions for his ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
tormented her inceſſantly. The an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
in which he had quitted the apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
her brother's injurious treatment,
and his conſequent abſence, all conſpired
to make her fear that deſpair had driven
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:0149803000:258"/>
him to commit ſome act of violence on
himſelf.</p>
            <p>The Earl, in the delirium of the
fever, raved continually of Laura and
of Alleyn; they were the ſole ſubjects of
his ramblings. Seizing one day the
hand of Mary, who fat mournfully by
his bed-ſide, and looking for ſome time
penſively in her face, "weep not, my
Laura," ſaid he, "Malcolm, nor all the
powers on earth ſhall tear you from
me; his walls—his guards—what
are they? I'll wreſt you from his hold
or periſh. I have a friend whoſe valour
will do much for us;—a friend—O!
name him not; theſe are ſtrange times;
beware of truſting. I could have given
him my very life—but not—I will
not name him." Then ſtarting to the
other ſide of the bed, and looking
earneſtly towards the door with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
of ſorrow not to be deſcribed,
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:0149803000:259"/>
"not all the miſeries which my worſt
enemy has heaped upon me; not all the
horrors of impriſonment and death, have
ever touched my ſoul with a ſting ſo
ſharp as thy unfaithfulneſs." Mary
was ſo much ſhocked by this ſcene, that
ſhe left the room, and retired to her own
apartment to indulge the agony of grief
it occaſioned.</p>
            <p>The ſituation of the Earl grew daily
more alarming; and the fever, which had
not yet reached its criſis, kept the hopes
and fears of his family ſuſpended. In one
of his lucid intervals, addreſſing himſelf
to the Counteſs in the moſt pathetic
manner, he requeſted, that as death
might probably ſoon ſeparate him for
ever from her he moſt loved, he might
ſee Laura once again before he died. She
came, and weeping over him, a ſcene of
anguiſh enſued too poignant for deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
He gave her his laſt vows; ſhe
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:0149803000:260"/>
took of him a laſt look; and with a
breaking heart tearing herſelf away, was
carried to Dunbayne in a ſtate of danger
little inferior to his.</p>
            <p>The agitation he had ſuffered during
this interview, cauſed a return of phren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zy
more violent than any fit he had yet
ſuffered; exhauſted by it, he at length
ſunk into a ſleep, which continued with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
interruption for near four and twenty
hours. During this time his repoſe
was quiet and profound, and afforded
the Counteſs and Mary, who watched
over him alternately, the conſolations
of hope. When he awoke he was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
ſenſible, and in a very altered
ſtate from that he had been in a few
hours before. The criſis of the diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
was now paſt, and from that time it
rapidly declined till he was reſtored to
perfect health.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="247" facs="tcp:0149803000:261"/>
The joy of Laura, whoſe health gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually
returned with returning peace,
and that of his family, was ſuch as the
merits of the Earl deſerved. This joy,
however, ſuffered a ſhort interruption
from the Count of Santmorin, who, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
one morning, the apartment of
the Baroneſs, with letters in his hand,
came to acquaint her that he had juſt
received news of the death of a diſtant
relation, who had bequeathed him ſome
eſtates of value, to which it was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
he ſhould immediately lay claim;
and that he was, therefore, obliged, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
reluctantly, to ſet off for Switzer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
without delay. Though the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneſs
rejoiced with all his friends, at
his good fortune, ſhe regretted with
them, the neceſſity of his abrupt depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
He took leave of them, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
of Mary, for whom his paſſion
was ſtill the ſame, with much emotion;
and it was ſome time ere the ſpace he
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:0149803000:262"/>
had left in their ſociety was filled up,
and ere they reſumed their wonted
cheerfulneſs.</p>
            <p>Preparations were now making for
the approaching nuptials, and the day
of their celebration was at length fixed.
The ceremony was to be performed
in a chapel belonging to the caſtle of
Dunbayne, by the chaplain of the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneſs.
Mary only was to attend as
bride-maid; and the Counteſs alſo,
with the Baroneſs, was to be preſent.
The abſence of the Count was uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally
regretted; for from his hand,
the Earl was to have received his bride.
The office was now to be ſupplied by
a neighbouring Laird, whom the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
of the Baroneſs had long eſteemed.
At the earneſt requeſt of Laura, Mary
conſented to ſpend the night preceding
the day of marriage, at the caſtle of
Dunbayne. The day ſo long and ſo
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:0149803000:263"/>
anxiouſly expected by the Earl, at
length arrived. The morning was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
fine, and the joy which glowed
in his heart gave additional ſplendor
to the ſcene around him. He ſet off,
accompanied by the Counteſs, for the
caſtle of Dunbayne. He anticipated
the joy with which he ſhould ſoon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trace
the way he then travelled, with
Laura by his ſide, whom death alone
could then ſeparate from him. On
their arrival they were received by
the Baroneſs, who enquired for Mary;
and the Counteſs and Oſbert were
thrown into the utmoſt conſternation,
when they learned that ſhe had not been
ſeen at the caſtle. The nuptials were
again deferred; the caſtle was a ſcene
of univerſal confuſion. The Earl re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
home inſtantly to diſpatch his
people in ſearch of Mary. On en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry,
he learned that the ſervants
who had attended her, had not been
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:0149803000:264"/>
heard of ſince their departure with
their lady. Still more alarmed by
this intelligence, he rode himſelf in
purſuit, yet not knowing which courſe
to take. Several days were employed
in a fruitleſs ſearch; no footſtep of her
flight could be traced.</p>

            <head>CHAPTER XII.</head>
            <p>MARY, in the mean time, ſuffered
all the terror which her ſituation
could excite. On her way to Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bayne,
ſhe had been overtaken by a
party of armed men, who ſeized her bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle,
and after engaging her ſervants in
a feigned reſiſtance, carried her off
ſenſeleſs. On recovering, ſhe found her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
travelling through a foreſt, whoſe
glooms were deepened by the ſhades of
night. The moon, which was now up,
glancing through the trees, ſerved to
ſhew the dreary aſpect of the place, and
the number of men who ſurrounded her;
and ſhe was ſeized with a terror that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
deprived her of reaſon. They
travelled all night, during which a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
ſilence was obſerved. At the
dawn of day ſhe found herſelf on the
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:0149803000:266"/>
ſkirts of a heath, to whoſe wide deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
her eye could diſcover no limits.
Before they entered on the waſte, they
halted at the entrance of a cave, formed
in a rock, which was overhung with
pine and fir; where, ſpreading their
breakfaſt on the graſs, they offered re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhments
to Mary, whoſe mind was
too much diſtracted to ſuffer her to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
of them. She implored them in the
moſt moving accents, to tell her from
whom they came, and whither they
were carrying her; but they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible
to her tears and her entreaties,
and ſhe was compelled to await in ſilent
terror, the extremity of her fate. They
purſued their journey over the wilds,
and towards the cloſe of day approached
the ruins of an abbey, whoſe broken
arches and lonely towers aroſe in
gloomy grandeur through the obſcurity
of evening. It ſtood the ſolitary inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant
of the waſtes,—a monument of
mortality and of ancient ſuperſtititton,
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:0149803000:267"/>
and the frowning majeſty of its aſpect
ſeemed to command ſilence and vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.
The chilly dews fell thick, and
Mary fatigued in body, and haraſſed
in mind, lay almoſt expiring on her
horſe, when they ſtopped under an arch
of the ruin. She was not ſo ill as to be
inſenſible to the objects around her;
the awful ſolitude of the place, and the
ſolemn aſpect of the fabric, whoſe effect
was heightened by the falling glooms
of evening, chilled her heart with hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror;
and when they took her from the
horſe, ſhe ſhrieked in the agonies of a
laſt deſpair. They bore her over looſe
ſtones to a part of the building, which
had been formerly the cloiſters of the
abbey, but which was now fallen to
decay, and overgrown with ivy. There
was, however, at the extremity of theſe
cloiſters a nook, which had withſtood
with hardier ſtrength the ravages of
time; the roof was here entire, and the
ſhattered ſtanchions of the caſements
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:0149803000:268"/>
ſtill remained. Hither they carried
Mary, and laid her almoſt lifeleſs on the
graſſy pavement, while ſome of the ruf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fians
haſtened to light a fire of the
heath and ſticks they could pick up.
They took out their proviſions, and
placed themſelves round the fire, where
they had not long been ſeated, when
the ſound of diſtant thunder foretold
an approaching ſtorm. A violent ſtorm,
accompanied with peals which ſhook
the pile, came on. They were ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
from the heavineſs of the rain;
but the long and vivid flaſhes of light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
which glanced through the caſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
alarmed them all. The ſhrieks
of Mary were loud and continued;
and the fears of the ruffians did not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
their uttering dreadful impreca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
at her diſtreſs. One of them, in
the fury of his reſentment, ſwore ſhe
ſhould be gagged; and ſeizing her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtleſs
hands to execute the purpoſe,
her cries redoubled. The ſervants who
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:0149803000:269"/>
had betrayed her, were not yet ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
loſt to the feelings of humanity,
as to ſtand regardleſs of her preſent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs;
though they could not reſiſt the
temptations of a bribe, they were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
their lady ſhould be loaded with
unneceſſary miſery. They oppoſed the
ruffians; a diſpute enſued; and the
violence of the conteſt aroſe ſo high,
that they determined to fight for the
deciſion. Amid the peals of thunder,
the oaths and execrations of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batants,
added terror to the ſcene. The
ſtrength of the ruffians were ſuperior to
that of their opponents; and Mary be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
victory deciding againſt herſelf,
uttered a loud ſcream, when the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the whole party was ſurprized
by the ſound of a footſtep in the cloiſter.
Immediately after, a man ruſhed into
the place, and drawing his ſword, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
the cauſe of the tumult. Mary,
who lay almoſt expiring on the ground,
now raiſed her eyes; but what were
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:0149803000:270"/>
her ſenſations, when ſhe raiſed them to
Alleyn!—who now ſtood before her
petrified with horror! Before he could
fly to her aſſiſtance, the attacks of the
ruffians obliged him to defend himſelf;
he parried their blows for ſome time,
but he muſt inevitably have yielded to
the force of numbers, had not the
trampling of feet, which faſt approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
called off for a moment their atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
In an inſtant the place was filled
with men. The aſtoniſhment of Alleyn,
was, if poſſible, now encreaſed; for the
Earl, followed by a party, now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered.
The Earl, when he perceived
Alleyn, ſtood at the entrance, aghaſt!
—But reſuming his firmneſs, he bade
him defend himſelf. The loud voice
of Oſbert re-called Mary, and obſerving
their menacing attitudes, ſhe collected
juſt ſtrength ſufficient to throw herſelf
between them. Alleyn dropped his
ſword, and raiſed her from the ground;
when the Earl rudely puſhed him away,
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:0149803000:271"/>
and ſnatched her to his heart. "Hear
me, Oſbert," was all ſhe could ſay.
"Declare who brought her hither,"
ſaid the Earl ſternly to Alleyn. "I
know not," replied he, "you muſt aſk
thoſe men whom your people have ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured.
If my life is hateful to you,
ſtrike! and ſpare me the anguiſh of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending
it againſt the brother of Mary."
The Earl heſitated in ſurprize, and the
generoſity of Alleyn called a bluſh into
his face. He was going to have replied,
but was interrupted by ſome of his
men, who had been engaged in a ſharp
conteſt with the ruffians, two of whom
they had ſecured, and now brought
to their lord; the reſt were fled. In
the perſon of one of them, the Earl diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
his own ſervant, who ſinking in
his preſence with conſcious guilt, fell on
his knees imploring mercy. "Wretch,"
ſaid the Earl, ſeizing him, and holding
his ſword over his head, "declare by
whoſe authority you have acted, and all
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:0149803000:272"/>
you know of the affair;—remember
your life depends on the truth of your
aſſertions. "I'll tell the truth, my
lord," replied the trembling wretch,
"and nothing elſe, as I hope for mercy.
About three weeks ago,—no, it is not
ſo much; about a fortnight ago, when
I was ſent on a meſſage to the lady Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colm,
the Count de Santmorin's gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
—" "The Count de Sant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morin!"
re-echoed the whole company.
"But proceed," ſaid Oſbert. "The
Count de Santmorin's gentleman called
me into a private room, where he told
me to wait of his maſter who would
soon be there." "Be quick," ſaid the
Earl, "proceed to facts." "I will,
my lord; the Count came, and ſaid to
me, "Robert, I have obſerved you, and
I think you can be faithful,"—he ſaid
ſo, my lord,—God forgive me!"
"Well—well, proceed." "Where
was I?"—"Oh!" he ſaid, "I think you
can be faithful."—"Good God! this
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:0149803000:273"/>
is beyond endurance; you triſle, ralcal,
with my patience, to give your aſſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates
time for eſcape; be brief, or you
die." "I will, my lord, as I hope for
life. He took from his pocket a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
of gold, which he gave me;—'can
you be ſecret, Robert?' ſaid he,—yes,
my lord Count, ſaid I, God forgive me!
—'Then obſerve what I ſay to you.
You often attend your young lady in
her rides to Dunbayne."—"What, then
it was the Count de Santmorin, who
commiſſioned you to undertake this
ſcheme!" "Not me only, my lord."
"Anſwer my queſtion; was the Count
the author of this plot?" "He was,
my lord." "And where is he?" ſaid
Oſbert, in a ſtern voice. "I know not,
my lord." "You know not! Wretch!
remember—your life." "I know not,
as I am a living creature. He em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked,
as you know, my lord, not far
from the caſsttle of Dunbayne, and we
were travelling to a diſtant part of the
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:0149803000:274"/>
coaſt to meet him, when we were all to
have ſet ſail for Switzerland." "You
cannot be ignorant of the place of your
deſtination," ſaid the Earl, turning to
the other priſoner; "where is your em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployer?"
"That is not for me to tell,"
ſaid he, in a ſullen tone. "Reveal the
truth," ſaid the Earl, "turning towards
him the point of his ſword" "or we
will find a way to make you." "The
place where we were to meet the Count,
had no name." "You know the way
to it." "I do." "Then lead me thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther."
"Never!" "Never! Your life
ſhall anſwer the refuſal," ſaid Oſbert,
pointing the ſword to his breaſt.
"Strike!" ſaid the Count, throwing off
the cloak which had concealed him;
"ſtrike! and rid me of a being which
paſſion has made hateful to me;—ſtrike!—and
make the firſt moment of
my entering this place, the laſt of my
guilt." A faint ſcream was uttered by
Mary; the ſmall remains of her ſtrength
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:0149803000:275"/>
forſook her, and ſhe ſunk on the pave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
The Earl ſtarted a few ſteps
back, and ſtood ſuſpended in wonder.
The looks of the whole group defy
deſcription. "Take a ſword," ſaid the
Earl, recovering himſelf, "and defend
your life." "Never, my lord, never!
Though I have been hurried by the
force of paſſion, to rob you of a ſiſter,
I will not aggravate my guilt by the
murder of the brother. Your life has
already been once endangered through
my means, though not by my deſign;
Heaven knows the anguiſh which that
accident coſt me. The impetuoſity of
paſſion impelled me onward with irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtible
fury; it urged me to violate the
ſacred duties of gratitude—of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
—and of humanity. To live in
ſhame, and in the conſciouſneſs of guilt,
is a living death. With your ſword do
juſtice to yourſelf and virtue; and ſpare
me the miſery of long comparing what
I am, with what I was." "Away—
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:0149803000:276"/>
you trifle," ſaid the Earl, "defend
yourſelf." The Count repeated his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal.
"And you, villain," ſaid Oſbert,
turning to the man who had confeſſed
the plot, "your pretended ignorance of
the preſence of the Count; your per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidy
ſhall be rewarded." "As I now
plead for mercy, my lord, I knew not
he was here." "The fellow ſpeaks
truth," ſaid the Count, "he was igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of the place where he was to meet
me. I was approaching this ſpot to
diſcover myſelf to the dear object of my
paſſion, when your people ſurprized and
took me." Mary confirmed the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of the Count, by declaring that
ſhe had not till that moment ſeen him
ſince ſhe quitted the caſtle of Dunbayne.
She pleaded for his life, and alſo for the
ſervants, who had oppoſed the cruelty
of their comrades. "I am no aſſaſſin,"
ſaid the Earl, "let the Count take a
ſword, and fight me on equal terms."
—"Shall virtue be reduced to an
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:0149803000:277"/>
equality with vice?" ſaid the Count,
"No, my lord,—plunge your
ſword in my heart, and expiate my
guilt." The Earl ſtill urged him to
defence; and the Count ſtill perſiſted
in refuſal. Touched by the recollection
of paſt friendſhip, and grieved that a
ſoul like the Count's ſhould ever be
under the dominion of vice, Oſbert
threw down his ſword, and overcome
with a ſort of tenderneſs—" Go, my
lord, your perſon is ſafe; and if it
is neceſſary to your peace,—ſtretching
forth his hand,—take my forgiveneſs."
The Count, overcome by his generoſity,
and by a ſenſe of his own unworthineſs,
ſhrunk back: "Forbear, my lord, to
wound by your goodneſs, a mind alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
too ſenſible of its own debaſement;
nor excite by your generoſity, a remorſe
too keen to be endured. Your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
I can bear,—your vengeance
I ſolicit,—but your kindneſs inflicts
a torture too exquiſite for my ſoul."
"Never, my Lord," continued he, the
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:0149803000:278"/>
big tear ſwelling in his eye,—"never
more ſhall your friendſhip be polluted
by my unworthineſs. Since you will
not ſatisfy juſtice, by taking my life, I
go to loſe it in the obſcurity of diſtant
regions. Yet, ere I go, ſuffer me to
make one laſt requeſt to you, and to that
dear lady whom I have thus injured,
and on whom my eyes now gaze for the
laſt time,—ſuffer me to hope that you
will blot from your memory the exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of Santmorin." He concluded the
ſentence with a groan, which vibrated
upon the hearts of all preſent; and
without waiting for a reply, hurried
from the ſcene. The Earl had turned
away his head in pity, and when he
again looked round to reply, perceived
that the Count was departed; he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
his ſteps through the cloiſter,—he
called—but he was gone.</p>
            <p>Alleyn had obſerved the Count with
a mixture of pity and admiration; and
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:0149803000:279"/>
he ſighed for the weakneſs of human
nature. "How," ſaid the Earl, return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
eagerly to Alleyn,—"how can I
rccompenſe you for my injurious ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions,
and my injurious treatment?—How
can you forgive, or I forget my
injuſtice? But the myſtery of this affair,
and the doubtful appearance of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
muſt ſpeak for me." "O!
let us talk no more of this, my lord,"
replied Alleyn, with emotion; "let us
only rejoice at the ſafety of our dear
lady, and offer her the comfort ſhe is ſo
much in want of." The fire was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindled,
and the Earl's ſervants laid
before him ſome wine, and other provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.
Mary, who had not taſted any
food ſince ſhe left the caſtle, now took
ſome wine; it revived her, and enabled her
to take other nouriſhment. She en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired,
what happy circumſtance had
enabled the Earl to trace her route.
"Ever ſince I diſcovered your ſlight,"
ſaid he, "I have been in purſuit of you.
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:0149803000:280"/>
Chance directed me over theſe wilds,
when I was driven by the ſtorm to
ſeek ſhelter among theſe ruins. The
light, and an uproar of voices, drew me
to the cloiſter, where, to my unutter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
aſtoniſhment, I diſcovered you and
Alleyn: Spare me the remembrance of
what followed." Mary wiſhed to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
what brought Alleyn to the place,
but delicacy kept her ſilent. Oſbert,
however, whoſe anxiety for his ſiſter,
had hitherto allowed him to attend only
to her, now relieved her from the pain
of lengthened ſuſpenſe. "By what
ſtrange accident was you brought hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?"
ſaid he to Alleyn, "and what
motive has induced you ſo long to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
yourſelf from thn caſtle?" At the
laſt queſtion, Alleyn bluſhed, and an
involuntary ſigh eſcaped him. Mary
underſtood the bluſh and the ſigh, and
awaited his reply in trembling emotion.
"I fled, my lord, from your diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
and to tear myſelf from an object
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:0149803000:281"/>
too dangerous, alas! for my peace. I
ſought to wear away in abſence, a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
which muſt ever be hopeleſs, but
which I now perceive, is interwoven
with my exiſtence.—But forgive, my
lord, the intrusion of a ſubject which is
painful to us all. With ſome money,
and a few proviſions, I left my father's
cottage; and ſince that time, have wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
over the country a forlorn and
miſerable being, paſſing my nights in
the huts which chance threw in my way,
and deſigning to travel onward, and to
enliſt myſelf in the ſervice of my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.
Night overtook me on theſe waſtes,
and as I walked on comfortleſs and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wildered,
I was alarmed by diſtant cries
of diſtreſs. I quickened my pace; but
the ſound which ſhould have directed
my ſteps was ceaſed, and a chilling
ſilence enſued. As I ſtood muſing, and
uncertain which courſe to take, I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
a feeble light break through the
gloom; I endeavoured to follow its
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:0149803000:282"/>
rays; it led me to theſe ruins, whoſe
ſolemn appearance ſtruck with a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary
dread. A confuſed murmur
of voices from within, ſtruck my ear;
as I ſtood heſitating whether to enter, I
again heard thoſe ſhrieks which had
alarmed me. I followed the ſound; it led
me to the entrance of the cloiſter, at the
extremity of which I diſcovered a party of
men engaged in fight; I drew my ſword
and ruſhed forward; and the ſenſations
which I felt, on perceiving the lady
Mary, cannot be expreſſed!" "Still,
—ſtill Heaven deſtines you the deliverer
of Mary!" ſaid the Earl, gratitude
ſwelling in his eyes; "O! that I could
remove that obſtacle which with-holds
you from your juſt reward!" A reſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
ſigh ſtole from Alleyn, and he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
ſilent. Never was the ſtruggle
of oppoſing feelings more violent, than
that which now agitated the boſom of
the Earl. The worth of Alleyn aroſe
more conſpicuouſly bright from every
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:0149803000:283"/>
ſhade with which misfortune veiled it.
His noble and diſintereſted enthuſiaſm
in the cauſe of juſtice, had attached
him to the Earl, and had engaged him
in a courſe of enterprizes and of dangers,
which it required valour to undertake,
and ſkill and perſeverance to perform;
and which had produced ſervices, for
which no adequate reward could be
found. He had reſcued the Earl from
captivity and death; and had twice pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
Mary in dangers. All theſe cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
aroſe in ſtrong reflection to
the mind of Oſbert; but the darkneſs of
prejudice and ancient pride, oppoſed
their influence, and weakened their
effect.</p>
            <p>The joy which Mary felt on ſeeing
Alleyn in ſafety, and ſtill worthy of the
eſteem ſhe had ever bore him, was
daſhed by the bitterneſs of reflection;
and reflection imparted a melancholy
which added to the langour of illneſs.
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:0149803000:284"/>
At the dawn of day they quitted the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey,
and ſet forward on their return to
the caſtle; the Earl inſiſting upon Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leyn's
accompanying them. On the way,
the minds of the party were variouſly
and ſilently engaged. The Earl rumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
on the conduct of Alleyn, and the
late ſcene. Mary dwelt chiefly on the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
of her lover, and on the dangers ſhe
had eſcaped; and Alleyn muſed on his
defeated purpoſes, and anticipated fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
trials. The Earl's thoughts, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
were not ſo wholly occupied, as to
prevent his queſtioning the ſervant who
had been employed by the Count, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the further particulars of his
ſcheme. The words of the Count, import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that he had once already endangered
his life, had not eſcaped the notice of
the Earl; though they were uttered in a
moment of too much diſtraction to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
him to demand an explanation. He
now enquired of the man, concerning
the myſterious ſcene of the vaults.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="271" facs="tcp:0149803000:285"/>
"You, I ſuppoſe, are not ignorant who
were the perſons from whom I received
my wound." "I, my lord, had no
concern in that affair; wicked as I am,
I could not raiſe my hands againſt your
life." "But you know who did." "I
—I—ye—yes, my lord, I was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
told.—But they did not mean to
hurt your lordſhip." "Not mean to
hurt me!—What then were their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns,
and who were the people?"
"That accident happened long before
the Count ever ſpoke to me of his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.
Indeed, my lord, I had no hand
in it; and Heaven knows how I grieved
for your lordſhip; and—" "Well
—well, inform me, who were the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
in the vaults, and what were their
deſign." "I was told by a fellow ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant;
but he made me promiſe to be
ſecret; but it is proper your lordſhip
ſhould know all; and I hope your
lordſhip will forgive me for having
liſtened to it.—'Robert,' ſaid he, as
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:0149803000:286"/>
we were talking one day of what had
happened;—'Robert,' ſaid he, 'there
is more in this matter than you, or any
body thinks; but it is not for me to
tell all I know.' With that, I begged
he would tell me what he knew; but
he ſtill kept refuſing. I promiſed him
faithfully I would not tell; and ſo at
laſt he told me—'Why, there is my
lord Count there, he is in love with our
young lady; and to be ſure as ſweet a
lady ſhe is, as ever eyes looked upon;
but ſhe don't like him; and ſo finding
himſelf refuſed, he is determined to
marry her at any rate; and means ſome
night to get into the caſtle, and carry
her off.' "What, then!—was it the
Count who wounded me?—Be quick
in your relation." "No, my lord, it
was not the Count himſelf—but two
of his people, whom he had ſent to
examine the caſtle; and particularly
the windows of my young lady's apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
from whence he deſigned to have
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:0149803000:287"/>
carried her, when every thing was ready
for execution. Theſe men were let
within the walls through a way under
ground, which leads into the vaults,
by my fellow ſervant, as I afterwards
was told; and they eſcaped through the
ſame way. Their meeting with your
lordſhip was accidental, and they fought
only in ſelf-defence; for they had no
orders to attack any body." "And
who is the villain that connived at this
ſcheme?" "It was my fellow ſervant,
who fled with the Count's people, whom
he himſelf let within the ramparts.
Forgive me, my lord; but I did not
dare tell; he threatened my life, if I
betrayed the ſecret."</p>
            <p>After a journey of fatigue, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſant
reflections, they arrived on the
ſecond morning at the caſtle of Athlin.
The Counteſs, during the abſence of her
ſon, had endured a ſtate of dreadful
ſuſpenſe The Baroneſs, in her friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:0149803000:288"/>
had endeavoured to ſoothe her
diſtreſs, by her conſtant preſence; ſhe
was engaged in this amiable office,
when the trampling of horſes in the
court, reached the ears of Matilda.
"It is my ſon," ſaid ſhe, riſing from
her chair;—"it is my ſon; he brings
me life or death!" She ſaid no more,
but ruſhed into the hall, and in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
after claſped her almoſt expiring
daughter to her boſom. The tranſport
of the ſcene repelled utterrance; ſobs
and tears were all that could be given.
The general joy, however, was ſuddenly
interrupted by the Baroneſs, who had
followed Matilda into the hall; and
who now fell ſenſeleſs to the ground;
delight yielded to ſurprize, and to the
buſineſs of aſſiſting the object of it. On
recovering, the Baroneſs looked wildly
round her;—"Was it a viſion that I
ſaw, or a reality?" The whole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
moved their eyes round the hall,
but could diſcover nothing extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary.
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:0149803000:289"/>
"It was himſelf; his very air,
his features; that benign countenance
which I have ſo often contemplated in
imagination!" Her eyes ſtiil ſeemed
in ſearch of ſome ideal object; and
they began to doubt whether a ſudden
phrenzy had not ſeized her brain.
"Ah! again! ſaid ſhe, and inſtantly
relapſed. Their eyes were now turned
towards the door, on which ſhe had
gazed; it was Alleyn who entered, with
water which he had fetched for the
Counteſs, and on whom the attention
of all preſent was now centered. He
approached, ignorant of what had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened;
and his ſurprize was great,
when the Baroneſs reviving, fixed her
eyes mournfully upon him, and aſked
him to uncover his arm.—"It is,—it
is my Philip!" ſaid ſhe, with ſtrong
emotion; I have, indeed, found my
long loſt child; that ſtrawberry on his
arm, confirms the deciſion. Send for
the man who calls himſelf your father,
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:0149803000:290"/>
and for my ſervant Patrick." The ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations
of the mother and the ſon may
be more eaſily conceived than deſcribed;
thoſe of Mary were little inferior to
theirs; and the whole company awaited
with trembling eagerneſs the arrival of
the two perſons whoſe teſtimony was
to decide this intereſting affair. They
came. "This young man you call
your ſon?" ſaid the Baroneſs. "I do,
an' pleaſe your ladyſhip," he replied,
with a degree of confuſion which belied
his words. When Patrick came, his
inſtant ſurprize on ſeeing the old man,
declared the truth. "Do you know
this perſon?" ſaid the Baroneſs to
Patrick. "Yes, my lady, I know him
too well; it was to him I gave your
inſant ſon." The old man ſtarted with
ſurprize—"Is that youth the ſon of
your ladyſhip?" "Yes!" "Then
God forgive me for having thus long
detained him from you! but I was ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
of his birth, and received him
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:0149803000:291"/>
into my cottage as a foundling, ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coured
by lord Malcolm's compaſſion."
The whole company crowded round
them. Alleyn fell at the feet of his
mother, and bathed her hand with his
tears.—"Gracious God! for what haſt
thou reſerved me!" He could ſay no
more. The Baroneſs raiſed him, and
again preſſed him in tranſport to her
heart. It was ſome time before either
of them could ſpeak; and all preſent
were too much affected to interrupt the
ſilence. At length, the Baroneſs pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
Laura to her brother. "Such a
mother! and have I ſuch a ſiſter!"
ſaid he. Laura wept ſilently upon his
neck the joy of her heart. The Earl
was the firſt who recovered compoſure
ſufficient to congratulate Alleyn; and
embracing him—O! happy moment,
when I can indeed embrace you as my
brother! The whole company now
poured forth their joy and their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulations;—all
but Mary, whoſe
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:0149803000:292"/>
emotions almoſt overcame her, and were
too powerful for utterance.</p>
            <p>The company now adjourned to the
drawing-room; and Mary withdrew to
take that repoſe ſhe ſo much required.
She was ſufficiently recovered in a few
hours to join her friends in the ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quetting-room.</p>
            <p>After the tranſports of the ſcene were
ſubſided—"I have yet much to hope,
and much to fear," ſaid Philip Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colm,
who was yet Alleyn in every
thing but in name. "You, madam,"
addreſſing the Baroneſs,—"you will
willingly become my advocate with her
whom I have ſo long and ſo ardently
loved." "May I hope," continued he,
taking tenderly the hand of Mary, who
ſtood trembling by,—"that you have
not been inſenſible to my long attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and that you will confirm the
happineſs which is now offered me?"
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:0149803000:293"/>
A ſmile of ineffable ſweetneſs broke
through the melancholy which had long
clouded her features, and which even
the preſent diſcovery had not been able
entirely to diſſipate, and her eye gave
the conſent which her tongue refuſed to
utter.</p>
            <p>The converſation, for the remainder
of the day, was occupied by the ſubject
of the diſcovery, and with a recital of
Mary's adventure. It was determined,
that on the morrow the marriage of the
Earl ſhould be concluded.</p>
            <p>On this happy diſcovery, the Earl
ordered the gates of the caſtle to be
thrown open; mirth and feſtivity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſounded
through the walls, and the
evening cloſed in univerſal rejoicings.</p>
            <p>On the following morn, the chapel
of the caſtle was decorated for the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
of the Earl; who, with Laura,
came attended by Philip, now Baron
Malcolm, by Mary, and the whole fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily.
When they approached the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,
the Earl addreſſing himſelf to his
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:0149803000:294"/>
bride,—"Now, my Laura," ſaid he,
"we may celebrate thoſe nuptials which
have twice been ſo painfully interrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and which are to crown me with
felicity. This day ſhall unite our fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
in a double marriage, and reward
the worth of my friend. It is now ſeen,
that thoſe virtues which ſtimulated him
to proſecute for another the cauſe of
juſtice, myſteriouſly urged him to
the recovery of his rights. Virtue may
for a time be purſued by misfortune,—and
juſtice be obſcured by the tranſient
triumphs of vice,—but the power whoſe
peculiar attributes they are, clears away
the clouds of error, and even in this world
eſtabliſhes his THRONE OF JUSTICE."</p>
            <p>The Earl ſtepped forward, and join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the hands of Philip and Mary,—"Surely,
ſaid he, this is a moment of
perfect happineſs!—I can now reward
thoſe virtues which I have ever loved;
and thoſe ſervices to which every gift
muſt be inadequate, but this I now
beſtow.</p>
