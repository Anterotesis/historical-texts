         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

OF THE
NON-JUROR,
With ſome Hints of Conſequence

            <opener>
               <salute>Dear Mr. <hi>Rowe,</hi>
               </salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Entirely agree with
you, That there has
not of late appear'd
in Publick, a more
<hi>exquiſite Piece of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire,</hi>
than the Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
call'd the <hi>Non-juror;</hi>
or that better deſerv'd the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0537100200:4"/>
Diſtinction that was ſhown it, not
only by your Self, as His Majeſty's
Laureat, but by all the Loyal Party in
general. I alſo agree with you, that
perhaps there never was a Piece of fine
<hi>Drama-Theological Satire,</hi> the true Scope
of which has been leſs underſtood. I
am at a Loſs which to admire moſt,
the noble, free Spirit of our Friend the
Author; the inſenſibility of thoſe whom
the Satire is <hi>really Aim'd at,</hi> or the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
Rage of thoſe <hi>diſſaffected Jacobite
Wretches</hi> who cry out when they are not
hurt. You were pleas'd to deſire me,
when we met laſt, to put upon Paper
the few Hints I dropt to you in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation
upon this Subject, and which,
I doubt not, are ſufficient to make any
unprejudic'd Re<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ader of your and my
Opinion; namely,</p>
            <p>That Diſſaffection to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is the ſmalleſt Immorality which
is pointed at by this Play; and which
indeed is only introduced to hide a far
<hi>deeper Deſign,</hi> and far <hi>more uſeful Satire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:0537100200:5"/>
In order to ſet this in it's true Light,
I will but barely <hi>point</hi> at the ſeveral Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures
of the Comedy, and make ſome
ſhort Remarks upon their Attitudes,
without the Ill-manners of naming any
particular Perſon, but leaving the free
and impartial Reader to draw his own
Inferences. Two general Obſervations
only, are neceſſary to be premiſed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
every common Judge is not ſo
ſenſible of them, as we who have been
Writers all our Lives.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Firſt</hi> is, That when we <hi>Rebuke
our Superiours,</hi> the Fable ought to be ſo
coucn'd, as to make the Criminal give
Judgment againſt himſelf before he is
aware: (an Art as ancient at leaſt as the
Days of <hi>Nathan)</hi> But if the Scene of
Action be laid in a Subject not only
quite <hi>foreign,</hi> but ſeemingly <hi>oppoſite</hi> to
the principal Aim of the Satire, the
Addreſs will be ſtill the more refined;
becauſe by this Method the Author in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduceth
<hi>Facts</hi> and <hi>Perſonages</hi> which the
guilty will be ſure to Condemn; not
only from <hi>natural Equity,</hi> but <hi>natural
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0537100200:6"/>
Averſion.</hi> Thus, for Example, To en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
a <hi>Tory</hi> to condemn a Piece of Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
in the Abſtract, one need only lay
the Scene among <hi>Whigs,</hi> and ſo on the
contrary. And <hi>Secondly,</hi> I would put
the Reader in mind that in Fables of
this Nature, it is uſual to repreſent <hi>whole
Parties of Men by ſingle Perſonages.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This premiſed, let us obſerve the
principal Figure thar preſents it ſelf to
our View; I mean Dr. <hi>Wolf;</hi> whoſe
Character anſwers to <hi>Moliere</hi>'s <hi>Tartuffe,</hi>
who is known to have repreſented a
<hi>certain puritanical Biſhop in France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We next are to take Notice, That
<hi>Wolf</hi> in the Stile of <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Allegory</hi>
conſtantly ſignifies the <hi>Presbyterian Party:</hi>
You know it is thus in the <hi>Hind</hi> and
<hi>Panther,</hi> and moſt other Pieces of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſial
Divinity or Poetry. So Dr.
<hi>Wolf</hi> is a <hi>Presbyterian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dr.</hi> Wolf <hi>expects for his Services in</hi>
Betraying the Church, <hi>great</hi> Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0537100200:7"/>
Preferment, <hi>(as Sir</hi> John <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth
it)</hi>
               <note n="1" place="margin">Nonju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, pag. 18.</note> an Office for Life,
which, on whatſoever Pretence of
Misbehaviour, no Civil Government
can deprive him of. <hi>This is Ironi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
repreſented afterwards by the</hi>
See of Thetford. <hi>So, in ſhort,
Dr.</hi> Wolf <hi>is a Biſhop.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Biſhop has
wrote ſomething about the <hi>Caſe of
Schiſm;</hi> and the <hi>Colonel</hi> tells his
Father, <hi>That he</hi>
               <note n="2" place="margin">pag. 3.</note> 
               <hi>has read enough
of him in the</hi> Daily Courant.
What Biſhop has publiſh'd in the
<hi>Daily Courant,</hi> is <hi>lippis et tonſoribus
notum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Biſhop proteſts great Zeal
for the <hi>Church,</hi> at the ſame Time
that he is betraying it: On which
the <hi>Colonel</hi> tells Sir <hi>John, Tho'</hi>
               <note n="3" place="margin">pag. 3.</note>
               <hi>I have always honour'd your Concern
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0537100200:8"/>
for the Church, I little thought it
was for a Church that is Eſtabliſh'd
no where.</hi> (i. e.) <hi>No viſible Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Biſhop is mark'd with
another ſtrong Characteriſtick,
managing a Diſpute with <hi>Heartly</hi>
about <hi>the Nature of Prayer.</hi> That
it ought not to be <hi>Tedious;</hi>

neceſſary, ſince Heaven knew the
true Intention of the Heart.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">pag. 12.</note> And
then he talks of his own <hi>Manual
of Devotions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Biſhop alſo pretends a
mighty Regard to <hi>tender Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</hi>
He tell's <hi>Heartly,</hi> That we

               <hi>ought to allure them to what is
Good by the gentleſt, eaſieſt Means

of Offence to tender Conſciences.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:0537100200:9"/>
               <hi>The</hi> Colonel <hi>here urges the</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
<hi>againſt him, and the force
of the Laws; and deſires him to

Biſhop Anſwers</hi>
               <note n="6" place="margin">pag. 13</note>
               <hi>Sir,</hi> I ſhall not
explain my Self: But make your beſt
of what I've ſaid—But Power
perhaps may change it's Hands, and
you e're long as little dare to ſpeak
your mind, as I do; <hi>viz.</hi> That there
may come a Time when this Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
you talk ſo much of, may be
overturned.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>John</hi> is fully ſatisfy'd that
the <hi>Doctor</hi> is all this while a<note n="7" place="margin">pag. 18.</note>

            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:0537100200:10"/>
But leſt theſe Lines ſhou'd not
be ſtrong enough, the Author
gives the finiſhing Stroke.</p>
            <p>This Biſhop is at laſt diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
to be a <hi>Jeſuit</hi> in Diſguiſe,
By whom? By one of his <hi>School-Boys</hi>
in whom he had diſtilled.
ſome of his <hi>Jeſuitical Principles</hi>
And moſt remarkable it is what
the <hi>Colonel</hi> ſays on this Occaſion.
That<note n="8" place="margin">pag. 47.</note>
               <hi>Charles</hi> begs <hi>he will not
inſiſt upon the Diſcovery, 'till his
Circumſtances will allow it:</hi> Almoſt
in the very Stile of ſome <hi>Letters</hi>
that paſſed, upon a parallel Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion,

            </p>
            <p>At laſt <hi>Subſtantial Affadavits</hi>

of a Reverend</hi> Prelate <hi>and a
certain</hi> Jeſuit, is moſt injuriouſly
and ſcandalouſly inſinuated.</p>
            <p>So here is a <hi>Prelate</hi> and a <hi>Jeſuit</hi>
and his <hi>Gang,</hi> got into the Family
of Sir <hi>John!</hi> Let us next ſee
what they are to do there. Why,
they contrive the <hi>Ruin</hi> of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
and the <hi>diſinheriting</hi> and
<hi>expulſion</hi> of his <hi>Children</hi> with ſo
great an Aſſurance of Succeſs, that
the <hi>Doctor</hi> talks of Sir <hi>John</hi> in
this manner:<note n="9" place="margin">pag. 68.</note>
               <hi>Poor Man! he
knows not his own Weakneſs; he is
moulded into any Shape, if you but
gently ſtroke his Humour. I intend
to Morrow, to perſwade him 'tis for

            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:0537100200:12"/>
I muſt here put you in mind
of my ſecond Obſervation, that
by the ſingle Perſon of Dr. <hi>Wolf,</hi>
without any forced Conſtruction,
may be underſtood a whole Sett
or Party of Men. To proceed
then,</p>
            <p>The Play Opens with a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
between Sir <hi>John</hi> and his
<hi>Daughter,</hi> about the Formality of

There is alſo mention made of

I Glory in the Diſgrace your Errors
give me.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, Sir <hi>John</hi>'s Attachment
to Dr. <hi>Wolf</hi> was ſo great, that
there appear'd but ſmall Hopes of
ever opening Sir <hi>John</hi>'s Eyes:

of the <hi>Son</hi> upon that Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;<note n="15" place="margin">pag. 16.</note>
               <hi>What horrid Hands is

            </p>
            <p>When Dr. <hi>Wolf</hi> had wrought
up the Paſſion of Sir <hi>John</hi> to this
degree, as to turn his <hi>Children out

good Offices, and propoſeth a

            <p>I beg the Reader to obſerve

Wolf, and do nothing without

            </p>
            <p>It muſt here be obſerv'd that

Obſerve next, (good Mr.
<hi>Rowe)</hi> how Dr. <hi>Wolf</hi> endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
to debauch Lady <hi>Woodvill,</hi>
and make her Subſervient to his
Villainous deſigns: This Lady
is deſcribed as having a great Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendant
over Sir <hi>John's</hi> Spirit that
<hi>She keeps no Aſſemblys;</hi> that ſhe
had been <hi>Poor</hi> and <hi>Beautiful,</hi> while
Sir <hi>John</hi> was <hi>Rich</hi> and <hi>Amourous.</hi>
This Lady proves honeſt and
truſty; and contributes, in the
concluſion, to the diſcovery of
the wicked purpoſes of Dr.
<hi>Wolf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Pray take notice too of a very
odd Epiſode that ſeem to contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
very little to the main
Action. That is Dr. <hi>Wolf</hi>'s en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring
to Bring Sir <hi>John</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a <hi>Scheme</hi> of <hi>Church Comprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi>
Referring again to his <hi>Caſe of
Schiſm,</hi> he tells Sir <hi>John</hi> that<note n="20" place="margin">pag. 25</note>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:0537100200:18"/>
               <hi>differences are not ſo material as
ſome would repreſent them. Ah!
could we be brought to a Temper,
a great many ſeeming Contradictions
might be reconciled.</hi> I allow this is a
<hi>Comprehenſion</hi> of a different kind;
but I beg leave to remind you
and my Readers of my firſt obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
that the <hi>Circumſtances of a
Fable</hi> do not determine the <hi>Satire.</hi>
But you, Sir, who are intimate
with Mr. <hi>Cibber</hi> may examine and
know the Truth of this.</p>
            <p>Nothing is ſo plain as the
Cataſtrophe; when Dr. <hi>Wolf</hi>
thought himſelf ſure of his Blow,
and had brought Sir <hi>John</hi> to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that his<note n="21" place="margin">pag. 24.</note>
               <hi>hot brain'd</hi> Son
(as he calls him) had a Deſign to
get his Eſtate; he inſtantly makes
Sir <hi>John</hi> reſolve to repay it in kind
by diſinheriting him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:0537100200:19"/>
But at laſt, there ariſes a
misfortune from a Corner where
the <hi>Doctor</hi> leaſt ſuſpected it.
Some of his own Party, whom
he thought inviolably attach'd to
his intereſts, diſcover his wicked
purpoſes. This Sett of Men is
repreſented by <hi>Charles</hi> an ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Gentleman, a Servant of Sir
<hi>John</hi>'s, a man of Buſineſs, a good
<hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Scholar &amp;c.
This <hi>Charles</hi> (it ſeems) highly
obliged by the Generous treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the <hi>Son</hi> and enamour'd
of the good Qualities of the
<hi>Daughter,</hi> both reveals, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents
the whole <hi>myſtery of Iniquity:</hi>
Upon which Dr. <hi>Wolf</hi> ſeeing his
project diſſappointed vents his
Rage upon this honeſt Gentleman;
and attempts his Life.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:0537100200:20"/>
Laſtly, Mr. <hi>Cibber</hi> (to obviate
all poſſibility of miſtaking his
meaning) upon the winding up
of the whole deſign, breaks on a
ſudden into an open diſcourſe of
<hi>Politicks;</hi> talks of <hi>embroiling the
Nation,</hi> and <hi>ending Publick diſputes</hi>
and calls upon King <hi>George,</hi> with
abundance more good <hi>Morality</hi>
very well worth obſerving.</p>
            <p>Thus, Sir, according to your
deſire, I have given a ſhort Sketch
of the <hi>Fable</hi> and <hi>Characters</hi> of this
Play; juſt enough to enable ſome
perſon of greater <hi>Sagacity</hi> to find
out who are meant by every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Perſonage of the <hi>Drama.</hi>
I am ſure I would not preſume
ſo much as to gueſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:0537100200:21"/>
But one Thing I muſt obſerve,
which I remember we both took
particular notice of: It is, that
the Author tho' queſtionleſs a great
maſter of Stile puts <hi>bad Engliſh</hi> into
the mouths of moſt of his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonages:
So that indeed ſcarce any
of e'm talk at all like <hi>Engliſh Folks;</hi>
but perpetually make uſe of an
uncorrect, <hi>Foreign, Jargon.</hi> What
his drift is in this I cannot ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine;

obvious to every Reader; and
numerous <hi>in every Page.</hi>
