            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>A Clear Wit, ſound Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and a Merciful Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, are things ſo rarely united, that it is almoſt inexcuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to entertain them with any

thing leſs excellent in its kind. My knowledge of you were a ſufficient Caution to me, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void your Cenſure of this Trifle, had I not as intire a knowledge of your Goodneſs. Since I have drawn my Pen for a Rencoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, I think it better to engage where, though there be Skill e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to Diſarm me, there is too much Generoſity to Wound; for ſo ſhall I have the ſaving Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of an unſucceſsful Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, if I cannot make it a drawn Battle. But methinks the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon intimates ſomething of a Defiance, and ſavours of Arrogance;

wherefore ſince I am Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious to my ſelf of a Fear which I cannot put off, let me uſe the Policy of Cowards and lay this Novel unarm'd, naked and ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering at your Feet, ſo that if it ſhould want Merit to challenge Protection, yet, as an Object of Charity, it may move Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion.

            <opener>
               <salute>Reader,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>SOME Authors are ſo fond of a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, that they will write one though there be nothing more in it than an Apology for its ſelf. But to ſhow thee that I am not one of thoſe, I will make no Apology for this, but do tell thee that I think it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to be prefix'd to this Trifle, to prevent thy overlooking ſome little pains which I have taken in the Compoſition of the following Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Romances are generally compoſed of the Conſtant Loves and invincible Courages of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro's, Heroins, Kings and Queens, Mortals of the firſt Rank, and ſo forth; where lofty Language, miraculous Contingencies and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible Performances, elevate and ſurprize the Reader into a giddy Delight, which leaves him
<pb facs="tcp:0110402300:8"/>
flat upon the Ground whenever he gives of, and vexes him to think how he has ſuffer'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be pleaſed and tranſported, concern'd and afflicted at the ſeveral Paſſages which he has Read, <hi>viz.</hi> theſe Knights Succeſs to their Damoſels Mis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ortunes, and ſuch like, when he is forced to be very well convinced that 'tis all a lye. Novels are of a more familiar Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; Come near us, and repreſent to us In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues in practice, delight us with Accidents and odd Events, but not ſuch as are wholly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual or unpreſidented, ſuch which not being ſo diſtant from our Belief bring alſo the pleaſure nearer us. Romances give more of Wonder, Novels more Delight. And with reverence be it ſpoken, and the Parallel kept at a due diſtance, there is ſomething of equality in the Proportion which they bear in reference to one another, with that between Comedy and Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy; but the <hi>Drama</hi> is the long extracted from Romance and Hiſtory: 'Tis the Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife to Induſtry, and brings forth alive the Conceptions of the Brain. <hi>Minerva</hi> walks upon the Stage before us, and we are more aſſured of the real preſence of Wit when it is delivered <hi>viva voce</hi>—.</p>
            <q>

Since all Traditions muſt indiſputably give place to the <hi>Drama,</hi> and ſince there is no poſſibility of giving that life to the Writing or Repetition of a Story which it has in the Action, I reſolved in another beauty to imitate <hi>Dramatick</hi> Writing, namely, in the Deſign, Contexture and Reſult of the Plot. I have not obſerved it before in a Novel. Some I have ſeen begin with an unexpected accident, which has been the only ſurprizing part of the Story, cauſe enough to make the Sequel look flat, tedious and inſipid; for 'tis but reaſonable the Reader ſhould expect it not to riſe, at leaſt to keep upon a level in the entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for ſo he may be kept on in hopes that at ſome time or other it may mend; but the 'tother is ſuch a balk to a Man, 'tis carrying him up ſtairs to ſhow him the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Room, and after forcing him to make a Meal in the Kitchin. This I have not only endeavoured to avoid, but alſo have uſed a Method for the contrary purpoſe. The deſign of the Novel is obvious, after the firſt meeting of <hi>Aurelian</hi> and <hi>Hippolito</hi> with <hi>Incognita</hi> and <hi>Leonora,</hi> and the difficulty is in bringing it to paſs, maugre all apparent obſtacles, within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs of two Days. How many probable Caſualties intervene in oppoſition to the main Deſign, <hi>viz.</hi> of marrying two Couple ſo oddly engaged in an intricate Amour, I leave the Reader at his leiſure to conſider: As alſo whether every Obſtacle does not in the progreſs of the Story act as ſubſervient to that purpoſe, which at firſt it ſeems to oppoſe.
<pb facs="tcp:0110402300:10"/>
In a Comedy this would be called the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of Action; here it may pretend to no more than an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of Contrivance. The Scene is continued in <hi>Florence</hi> from the commencement of the Amour; and the time from firſt to laſt is but three days. If there be any thing more in particular reſembling the Copy which I imitate (as the Curious Reader will ſoon perceive) I leave it to ſhow it ſelf, being very well ſatisfy'd how much more proper it had been for him to have found out this himſelf, than for me to prepoſſeſs him with an Opinion of ſomething extraordinary in an Eſſay began and finiſhed in the idler hours of a fortnight's time: For I can only eſteem it a laborious idleneſs, which is Parent to ſo inconſiderable a Birth. I have gratified the Bookſeller in pretending an occaſion for a Preface; the other two Perſons concern'd are the Reader and my ſelf, and if he be but pleaſed with what was produced for that end, my ſatisfaction follows of Courſe, ſince it will be proportion'd to his Approbation or Diſlike.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>A<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>RELIAN</hi> was the only Son to a Principal Gentleman of <hi>Florence.</hi> The Indulgence of his Father promp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and his Wealth enabled him, to beſtow a generous Education upon him, whom, he now began to look upon as the Type of himſelf; an Impreſſion he had made in the Gayety and Vigour of his Youth, before the Ruſt of Age had debilitated and obſcur'd the Splendour of the Original: He was ſenſible, That he ought not to be ſparing in the Adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of him, if he had Reſolution to beautifie his own Memory. Indeed <hi>Don Fabio</hi> (for ſo was the Old Gentleman call'd) has been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd to have fix'd his Eyes upon <hi>Aurelian,</hi> when much Company has been at Table, and have wept through Earneſtneſs of Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if nothing hapned to divert the Object; whether it were for regret, at the Recollection
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0110402300:12"/>
of his former ſelf, or for the Joy he conceiv'd in being, as it were, reviv'd in the Perſon of his Son, I never took upon me to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, but ſuppos'd it might be ſometimes one, and ſometimes both together.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aurelian,</hi> at the Age of Eighteen Years, wanted nothing (but a Beard) that the moſt accompliſhed <hi>Cavalier</hi> in <hi>Florence</hi> could pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to: He had been Educated from Twelve Years old at <hi>Siena,</hi> where it ſeems his Father kept a Receiver, having a large Income from the Rents of ſeveral Houſes in that Town. <hi>Don Fabio</hi> gave his Servant Orders, That <hi>Aurelian</hi> ſhould not be ſtinted in his Expenoes, when he came up to Years of Diſcretion. By which means he was enabled, not only to keep Company with, but alſo to confer many Obligations upon Strangers of Quality, and Gentlemen who travelled from other Countries into <hi>Italy,</hi> of which <hi>Siena</hi> never wanted ſtore, being a Town moſt delightfully ſituate, upon a Noble Hill, and very well ſuiting with Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers at firſt, by reaſon of the agreeableneſs and purity of the Air: There alſo is the quaintneſs and delicacy of the <hi>Italian</hi> Tongue moſt likely to be learned, there being many publick Profeſſors of it in that place; and indeed the very Vulgar of <hi>Siena</hi> do expreſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with an eaſineſs and ſweetneſs ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing, and even grateful to their Ears who underſtand not the Language.</p>
            <p>Here <hi>Aurelian</hi> contracted an acquaintance with Perſons of Worth of ſeveral Countries,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0110402300:13"/>
but among the reſt an intimacy with a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of Quality of <hi>Spain,</hi> and Nephew to the Archbiſhop of <hi>Toledo,</hi> who had ſo wrought himſelf into the Affections of <hi>Aurelian,</hi> thro' a Conformity of Temper, an Equality in Years, and ſomething of reſemblance in Feature and Proportion, that he look'd upon him as his ſecond ſelf. <hi>Hippolito,</hi> on the other hand, was not ungrateful in return of Friendſhip, but thought himſelf either alone or in ill Company, if <hi>Aurelian</hi> were abſent: But his Uncle having ſent him to travel, under the Conduct of a Governour, and the two Years which limitted his ſtay at <hi>Siena</hi> being expired, he was put in mind of his departure.</p>
            <p>His Friend grew melancholy at the News, but conſidering that <hi>Hippolito</hi> had never ſeen <hi>Florence,</hi> he eaſily prevailed with him to make his firſt Journey thither, whither he would accompany him, and perhaps prevail with his Father to do the like throughout his Travels.</p>
            <p>They accordingly ſet out, but not being able eaſily to reach <hi>Florence</hi> the ſame Night, they reſted a League or two ſhort, at a <hi>Villa</hi> of the great Duke's called <hi>Poggio Imperiale,</hi> where they were informed by ſome of his Highneſs's Servants, That the Nuptials of <hi>Donna Catharina</hi> (near Kinſwoman to the great Duke) and <hi>Don Ferdinand de Rovori,</hi> were to be ſolemnized the next day, and that extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Preparations had been making for ſome time paſt, to illuſtrate the Solemnity with Balls and Maſques, and other Divertiſements,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0110402300:14"/>
that a Tilting had been proclaim'd, and to that purpoſe Scaffolds erected around the Spacious Court, before the Church <hi>Di Sancta Croce,</hi> where were uſually ſeen all Cavalcades and Shews, performed by Aſſemblies of the Young Nobility: That all Mechanicks and Tradeſmen were forbidden to work or expoſe any Goods to Sale for the ſpace of three days; during which time all Perſons ſhould be enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd at the Great Duke's Coſt; and publick Proviſion was to be made for the ſetting forth and furniſhing a multitude of Tables, with Entertainment for all Comers and Goers, and ſeveral Houſes appointed for that uſe in all Streets.</p>
            <p>This Account alarm'd the Spirits of our Young Travellers, and they were overjoy'd at the proſpect of Pleaſures they foreſaw. <hi>Aure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> could not contain the ſatisfaction he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd in the welcome Fortune had prepar'd for his dear <hi>Hippolito.</hi> In ſhort, they both Remembred ſo much of the pleaſing Relation had been made them, that they forgot to ſleep, and were up as ſoon as it was light, pound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at poor Signior <hi>Claudio</hi>'s Door (ſo was <hi>Hippolito</hi>'s Governour call'd) to rouſe him, that no time might be loſt till they were arriv'd at <hi>Florence,</hi> where they would furniſh them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with Diſguiſes and other Accoutrements neceſſary for the Proſecution of their Deſign of ſharing in the publick Merriment; the rather were they for going ſo early becauſe <hi>Aurelian</hi> did not think fit to publiſh his being in the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0110402300:15"/>
Town for a time, leaſt his Father knowing of it, might give ſome reſtraint to that looſe they deſign'd themſelves.</p>
            <p>Before Sun riſe they entred <hi>Florence</hi> at <hi>Porta Romana,</hi> attended only by two Servants, the reſt being le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

Not a Window in the Streets but echoed the tuning of a Lute or thrumming of a Gitarr: For, by the way, the Inhabitants of <hi>Florence</hi> are ſtrangely addicted to the love of Muſick, inſomuch that ſcarce their Children can go, before they can ſcratch ſome Inſtrument or other. It was no unpleaſing Spectacle to our Cavaliers (who, ſeeing they were not obſerv'd, reſolved to make Obſervations) to behold the Diverſity of Figures and Poſtu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

Here you ſhould have an affected Vallet, who Mimick'd the Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of his Maſter, leaning careleſly againſt the Window, with his Head on one ſide in a languiſhing poſture, whining, in a low, mournful Voice, ſome diſmal Complaint; while, from his ſympathizing <hi>Theorbo,</hi> iſſued a Baſe no leſs doleful to the Hearers. In Oppoſition to him was ſet up perhaps a
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0110402300:16"/>
Cobler, with a wretched Skeleton of a Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarr, battered and waxed together by his own Induſtry, and who with three Strings out of Tune, and his own tearing hoarſe Voice, would rack attention from the Neighbourhood, to the great affliction of many more moderate Practitioners, who, no doubt, were full as deſirous to be heard. By this time <hi>Aure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi>'s Servant had taken a Lodging and was returned, to give his Maſter an Account of it. The Cavaliers grown weary of that ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Entertainment, which was diverting at firſt ſight, retired whither the Lacquey con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted them; who, according to their Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, had ſought out one of the moſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure Streets in the City. All that day, to the evening, was ſpent in ſending from one Brokers Shop to another, to furniſh them with Habits, ſince they had not time to make any new.</p>
            <p>There was, it happened, but one to be got Rich enough to pleaſe our young Gentlemen, ſo many were taken up upon this occaſion. While they were in Diſpute and Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting one another, (<hi>Aurelian</hi> proteſting that <hi>Hippolito</hi> ſhould wear it, and he, on 'tother hand, forſwearing it as bitterly) a Servant of <hi>Hippolito</hi>'s came up and ended the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy; telling them, That he had met below with the <hi>Vallet de Chambre</hi> of a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who was one of the greateſt Gallants about the Town, but was at this time in ſuch a Condition he could not poſſibly be at the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0110402300:17"/>
Entertainment; whereupon the Vallet had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to dreſs himſelf up in his Maſter's Apparel, and try his talent at Court; which he hearing, told him he would inform him how he might beſtow the Habit for ſome time much more to his profit if not to his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and ſo acquainted him with the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion his Maſter had for it. <hi>Hippolito</hi> ſent for the Fellow up, who was not ſo fond of his deſign as not to be bought off it, but upon having his own demand granted for the uſe of it, brought it; it was very Rich, and upon tryal, as fit for <hi>Hippolito</hi> as if it had been made for him. The Ceremony was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in the Morning, in the great Dome, with all Magnificence correſpondent to the wealth of the great Duke, and the eſteem he had for the Noble Pair. The next Morning was to be a Tilting, and the ſame Night a Maſquing Ball at Court. To omit the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of the univerſal Joy, (that had diffus'd it ſelf through all the Conduits of Wine, which convey'd it in large meaſures to the People) and only relate thoſe effects of it which concern our preſent Adventurers: You muſt know, that about the fall of the Evening, and at that time when the <hi>aequilibrium</hi> of Day and Night, for ſome time, holds the Air in a gloomy ſuſpence between an unwillingneſs to leave the light, and a natural impulſe into the Dominion of Darkneſs. About this time our Hero's, ſhall I ſay, ſally'd or ſlunk out of their Lodgings, and ſteer'd toward the great Palace, whither,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0110402300:18"/>
before they were arriv'd, ſuch a prodigious number of Torches were on fire, that the day, by help of theſe Auxiliary Forces, ſeem'd to continue its Dominion; the Owls and Bats ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending their miſtake, in counting the Hours, retir'd again to a convenient darkneſs; for Madam Night was no more to be ſeen than ſhe was to be heard; and the Chymiſts were of Opinion, That her fuliginous Damps rarefy'd by the abundance of Flame, were evaporated.</p>
            <p>Now the Reader I ſuppoſe to be upon Thorns at this and the like impertinent Digreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, but let him alone and he'll come to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; at which time I think fit to acquaint him, that when I digreſs, I am at that time writing to pleaſe my ſelf; when I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue the Thread of the Story, I write to pleaſe him; ſuppoſing him a reaſonable Man, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude him ſatisfied to allow me this liberty, and ſo I proceed.</p>
            <p>If our Cavaliers were dazled at the ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour they beheld without doors, what ſurprize, think you, muſt they be in, when entering the Palace they found even the lights there to be but ſo many ſoils to the bright eyes that flaſh'd upon 'em at every turn.</p>

Every Body appear'd well ſhap'd, as it is to be ſuppoſed, none who were conſcious to themſelves of any viſible Deformity would preſume to come thither. Their Apparel was equally glorious, though each differing in fancy. In ſhort, our Strangers were ſo well bred, as to conclude from theſe apparent Perfections, that there was not a Maſque which did not at leaſt hide the Face of a Cherubim. Perhaps the Ladies were not behind hand in return of a favourable Opinion of them: for they were both well dreſs'd, and had ſomething inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſibly pleaſing in their Air and Mein, diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from other People, and indeed differing from one another. They fancy'd that while they ſtood together they were more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly taken notice of than any in the Room, and being unwilling to be taken for Strangers, which they thought they were, by reaſon of ſome whiſpering they obſerved near them: They agreed upon an hour of meeting after the company ſhould be broke up, and ſo ſeparate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mingled with the thickeſt of the Aſſembly. <hi>Aurelian</hi> had fixed his eye upon a Lady whom he had obſerv'd to have been a conſiderable time in cloſe whiſper with another Woman; he expected with great impatience the reſult of that private Conference, that he might have an opportunity of engaging the Lady whoſe Perſon was ſo agreeable to him. At laſt he perceived they were broke off, and the 'tother
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0110402300:20"/>
Lady ſeem'd to have taken her leave. He had taken no ſmall Pains in the mean time to put himſelf in a poſture to accoſt the Lady, which, no doubt, he had happily performed had he not been interrupted; but ſcarce had he acquitted himſelf of a preliminary bow (and which, I have heard him ſay, was the loweſt that ever he made) and had juſt opened his Lips to deliver himſelf of a ſmall Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which, nevertheleſs he was very big with, when he unluckily miſcarried, by the interpoſal of the ſame Lady, whoſe depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, not long before, he had ſo zealouſly pray'd for: but, as Providence would have it, there was only ſome very ſmall matter for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got, which was recover'd in a ſhort whiſper. The Coaſt being again cleared, he took heart and bore up, and ſtriking ſail, repeated his Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony to the Lady; who, having obliging<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly returned it, he accoſted her in theſe or the like words:</p>
            <p>

He reply'd, <q rend="inline margSglQuotes">'She had already ſaid enough to convince him of ſomething he heartily wiſh'd might not be to his coſt in the end.</q> She pretended not to underſtand him; but told him, <q rend="inline margSglQuotes">'If he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready found himſelf grieved with her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, he would have ſufficient Reaſon to repent the raſhneſs of his firſt Demand before they had ended: for that now ſhe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to hold Diſcourſe with him on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to puniſh his unadviſedneſs, in preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming upon a Perſon whoſe dreſs and mien might not (may be) be diſagreeable to have wit. I muſt confeſs (reply'd <hi>Aurelian</hi>) my ſelf guilty of a Preſumption, and willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſubmit to the Puniſhment you intend: and though it be an aggravation of a Crime to perſevere in its juſtification, yet I cannot help defending an Opinion in which now I am more confirm'd, that probable conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures may be made of the Ingenious Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the Mind, from the fancy and choice of Apparel. The humour I grant ye (ſaid the Lady) or conſtitution of the Perſon whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther melancholick or brisk; but I ſhould hardly paſs my cenſure upon ſo ſlight an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of Wit: for there is your brisk Fool as well as your brisk Man of Senſe, and ſo of the Melancholick.

Colours; but a decency of Habit (which is all that Men of beſt Senſe pretend to) may be acquired by cuſtom and example, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out putting the Perſon to a ſuperfluous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of wit for the contrivance; and though there ſhould be occaſion for it, few are ſo unfortunate in their Relations and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance not to have ſome Friend capable of giving them advice, if they are not too ignorantly conceited to ask it.</q> 
               <hi>Aurelian</hi> was ſo pleaſed with the eaſineſs and ſmartneſs of her Expoſtulation, that he forgot to make a reply, when ſhe ſeem'd to expect it; but being a Woman of a quick Apprehenſion, and juſtly ſenſible of her own Perfections, ſhe ſoon perceived he did not grudge his attention. However ſhe had a Mind to put it upon him to turn the diſcourſe, ſo went on upon the ſame Subject. <q rend="inline margSglQuotes">'Signior (ſaid ſhe) I have been looking round me, and by your Maxim I cannot diſcover one Fool in the Company; for they are all well dreſt.

Look ye there (ſays he) pointing to a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy who ſtood playing with the Taſſels of her Girdle, I dare anſwer for that Lady, though ſhe be very well dreſs'd, 'tis more than ſhe knows. His fair unknown could not forbear laughing at his particular diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and freely told him, he had indeed light upon one who knew as little as any bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in the Room, her ſelf excepted. Ah! Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, (reply'd <hi>Aurelian</hi>) you know every thing in the World but your own Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and you only know not thoſe, becauſe 'tis the top of Perfection not to know them. How? (reply'd the Lady) I thought it had been the extremity of knowledge to know ones ſelf. <hi>Aurelian</hi> had a little over-ſtrain'd himſelf in that Complement, and I am of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion would have been puzzl'd to have brought himſelf off readily: but by good fortune the Muſick came into the Room and gave him an opportunity to ſeem to decline an anſwer, becauſe the Company prepared to Dance: he only told her he was too mean a Conqueſt for her Wit who was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready a Slave to the Charms of her Perſon. She thanked him for his Complement, and briskly told him ſhe ought to have made
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0110402300:24"/>
him a return in praiſe of his Wit, but ſhe hoped he was a Man more happy than to be diſſatisfy'd with any of his own Endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and if it were ſo, that he had not a juſt Opinion of himſelf, ſhe knew her ſelf incapable of ſaying any thing to beget one.</q> 
               <hi>Aurelian</hi> did not know well what to make of this laſt reply; for he always abhor'd, any thing that was conceited, with which this ſeem'd to reproach him. But however modeſt he had been heretofore in his own thoughts, yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was he ſo diſtruſtful of his good behaviour as now being rally'd ſo by a Perſon whom he took to be of judgment: Yet he reſolved to take no notice, but with an Air unconcerned and full of good humour entreated her to Dance with him: She promiſed him to Dance with no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy elſe, nor I believe had ſhe inclination; for notwithſtanding her tartneſs, ſhe was upon e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual terms with him as to the liking of each others Perſon and Humour, and only gave thoſe little hints to try his Temper; there being certainly no greater ſign of folly and ill breeding, than to grow ſerious and concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at any thing ſpoken in rallery: For his part, he was ſtrangely and inſenſibly fallen in love with her Shape, Wit and Air; which, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with a white Hand, he had ſeen (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps not accidentally) were enough to have ſubdued a more ſtubborn Heart than ever he was maſter of; and for her Face, which he had not ſeen, he beſtowed upon her the beſt his Imagination could furniſh him with.

ſhould by right now deſcribe her Dreſs, which was extreamly agreeable and rich, but 'tis poſſible I might err in ſome material Pin or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in the ſticking of which may be the whole grace of the Drapery depended. Well, they danced ſeveral times together, and no leſs to the ſatisfaction of the whole Company, than of themſelves; for at the end of each Dance, ſome publick not of Applauſe or other was given to the graceful Couple.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aurelian</hi> was amaz'd, that among all that danced or ſtood in view he could not ſee <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polito;</hi> but concluding that he had met with ſome pleaſing Converſation, and was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn to ſome retired part of the Room, he forbore his ſearch till the mirth of that Night ſhould be over, and the Company ready to break up, where we will leave him for a while, to ſee what became of his adventurous Friend.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hippolito,</hi> a little after he had parted with <hi>Aurelian,</hi> was got among a knot of Ladies and Cavaliers, who were looking upon a large Gold Cup ſet with Jewels, in which his Royal High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs had drank to the Proſperity of the new married Couple at Dinner, and which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward he preſented to his Couſin <hi>Donna Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tharina.</hi> He among the reſt was very intent, admiring the richneſs, workmanſhip, and beauty of the Cup, when a Lady came behind him and pulling him by the Elbow, made a ſign ſhe would ſpeak with him; <hi>Hippolito,</hi> who knew himſelf an utter Stranger to <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> and every body in it, immediately gueſſed

For ever ſince the naming of <hi>Don Fabio</hi> he had been very attentive; but before, his Thoughts were wholly taken up with the Beauty of the Face he had ſeen, and from the time ſhe had taken him by the Hand, a ſucceſſive warmth and chilneſs had play'd about his Heart, and ſurpriz'd him with an unuſual Tranſport. He was in a hundred Minds, whether he ſhould make her ſenſible
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0110402300:29"/>
of her Error or no; but conſidering he could expect no farther Conference with her after he ſhould diſcover himſelf, and that as yet he knew not of her place of abode, he reſolv'd to humour the miſtake a little further. Having her ſtill by the Hand, which he ſqueez'd ſomewhat more eagerly than is uſual for Couſins to do in a low and undiſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Voice, he let her know how much he held himſelf obliged to her, and avoiding as many words as handſomly he could, at the ſame time, entreated her to give him her Advice, toward the management of himſelf in this Affair. <hi>Leonora,</hi> who never from the beginning had entertain'd the leaſt Scruple of diſtruſt, imagined he ſpoke faintly, as not being yet perfectly recovered of his Strength; and withal conſidering that the heat of the Room, by reaſon of the Crowd, might be uneaſie to a Perſon in his Condition; ſhe kindly told him, That if he were as inclinable to diſpenſe with the remainder of that Nights Diverſion as ſhe was, and had no other En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement upon him, by her conſent they ſhould both ſteal out of the Aſſembly, and go to her Houſe, where they might with more freedom diſcourſe about a buſineſs of that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, and where he might take ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to refreſh himſelf if he were (as ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd him to be) indiſpoſed with his long ſtanding. Judge you whether the Propoſal were acceptable to <hi>Hippolito</hi> or no; he had been ruminating with himſelf how to bring
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0110402300:30"/>
ſomething like this about, and had almoſt deſpair'd of it; when of a ſuddain he found the ſucceſs of his deſign had prevented his own endeavours. He told his Couſin in the ſame key as before, That he was unwilling to be the occaſion of her Divorce from ſo much good Company; but for his own part, he was afraid he had preſumed too much upon his recovery in coming abroad ſo ſoon, and that he found himſelf ſo unwell, he feared he ſhould be quickly forc'd to retire. <hi>Leonora</hi> ſtay'd not to make him any other reply, only tipp'd him upon the Arm, and bid him follow her at a convenient diſtance to avoid Obſervation.</p>
            <p>Whoever had ſeen the Joy that was in <hi>Hippolito</hi>'s Countenance, and the Sprightlineſs with which he follow'd his Beautiful Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductreſs, would ſcarce have taken him for a Perſon griev'd with uncured Wounds. She led him down a back pair of Stairs, into one of the Palace Gardens which had a Door open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the Piazza, not far from where <hi>Don Mario</hi> her Father lived.

A thouſand things came into his Head in a minute, yet nothing that pleaſed him: And after ſo many Contrivances as he had formed for the diſcovery of himſelf, he found it more rational for him not to reveal him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf at all that Night, ſince he could not fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee what effect the ſurprize would have, ſhe muſt needs be in, at the appearance of a

Stranger, whom ſhe had never ſeen before, yet whom ſhe had treated ſo familiarly. He knew Women were apt to ſhriek or ſwoon upon ſuch Occaſions, and ſhould ſhe happen to do either, he might be at a loſs how to bring himſelf off. He thought he might eaſily pretend to be indiſpoſed ſomewhat more than ordinary, and ſo make an excuſe to go to his own Lodging. It came into his Head too, that under pretence of giving her an account of his Health, he might enquire of her the means how a Letter might be convey'd to her the next Morning, wherein he might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form her gently of her miſtake, and inſinuate ſomething of that Paſſion he had conceiv'd, which he was ſure he could not have oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to ſpeak of if he bluntly revealed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. He had juſt reſolv'd upon this Method, as they were come to the great Gates of the Court, when <hi>Leonora</hi> ſtopping to let him go in before her, he of a ſudden fetch'd his Breath violently as if ſome ſtitch or twinging ſmart had juſt then aſſaulted him. She enquired the matter of him, and adviſed him to make haſte into the Houſe that he might ſit down and reſt him. He told her he found himſelf ſo ill, that he judged it more convenient for him to go home while he was in a condition to move, for he fear'd if he ſhould once ſettle himſelf to reſt he might not be able to ſtir. She was much troubled, and would have had a Chair made ready and Servants to carry him home; but he made anſwer, he would

not have any of her Fathers Servants know of his being abroad, and that juſt now he had an interval of eaſe, which he hop'd would continue till he made ſhift to reach his own Lodgings. Yet if ſhe pleaſed to inform him how he might give an account of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the next morning, in a Line or two, he would not fail to give her the thanks due to her great Kindneſs; and withal, would let her know ſomething which would not a l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

She ſhow'd him a little Window at the corner of the Houſe, where one ſhould wait to receive his Letter, and was juſt taking her leave of him, when ſeeing him ſearch haſtily in his Pocket, ſhe ask'd him if he miſs'd any thing; he told her he thought a Wound which was not tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly heal'd bled a little, and that he had loſt his Handkerchief. His deſign took; for ſhe immediately gave him hers: Which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed accordingly he apply'd to the only Wound he was then griev'd with; which though it went quite through his Heart, yet thank God was not Mortal. He was not a little rejoyc'd at his good Fortune in getting ſo early a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour from his Miſtreſs, and notwithſtanding the violence he did himſelf to perſonate a ſick Man, he could not forbear giving ſome Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of an extraordinary Content; and telling her that he did not doubt to receive a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Proportion of Eaſe from the Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of what had ſo often kiſs'd her fair Hand,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0110402300:33"/>
               <hi>Leonora,</hi> who did not ſuſpect the Compliment, told him ſhe ſhould be heartily glad if that or any thing in her power might contribute to his recovery; and wiſhing him well home, went into her Houſe, as much troubled for her Couſin as he was joyful for his Miſtreſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hippolito,</hi> as ſoon as ſhe was gone in, began to make his Remarks about the Houſe, walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing round the great Court, viewing the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens and all the Paſſages leading to that ſide of the Piazza. Having ſufficiently informed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, with a Heart full of Love, and a Head full of Stratagem, he walked toward his Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, impatient till the arrival of <hi>Aurelian</hi> that he might give himſelf vent. In which inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rim, let me take the liberty to digre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s a little, and tell the Reader ſomething which I do not doubt he has apprehended himſelf long ago, if he be not the dulleſt Reader in the World; yet only for order ſake, let me tell him, I ſay, That a young Gentleman (Couſin to the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid <hi>Don Fabritio</hi>) happened one night to have ſome words at a Gaming Houſe with one <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renzo,</hi> which created a Quarrel of fatal Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to the former, who was killed upon the Spot, and likely to be ſo to the latter, who was very deſperately Wounded.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fabritio,</hi> being much concerned for his Kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, vow'd revenge (according to the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and laudable cuſtom of <hi>Italy</hi>) upon <hi>Lorenzo</hi> if he ſurviv'd, or in caſe of his Death (if it ſhould happen to anticipate that, much more ſwinging Death which he had in ſtore
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0110402300:34"/>
for him) upon his next of Kin, and ſo to deſcend Lineally like an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Eſtate, to all the Heirs Males of his Family. This ſame <hi>Fabritio</hi> had indeed (as <hi>Leonora</hi> told <hi>Hippolito</hi>) taken particular notice of him from his firſt entrance into the Room, and was ſo far doubtful as to go out immediately himſelf, and make enquiry concerning <hi>Lorenzo,</hi> but was quickly inform'd of the greatneſs of his Error, in believing a Man to be abroad, who was ſo ill of his Wounds, that they now deſpair'd of his recovery; and thereupon returned to the Ball very well ſatisfied, but not before <hi>Leonora</hi> and <hi>Hippolito</hi> were departed.</p>
            <p>So, Reader, having now diſcharg'd my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of a ſmall Diſcovery which I thought my ſelf obliged to make to thee, I proceed to tell thee, that our Friend <hi>Aurelian</hi> had by this time danced himſelf into a Net which he nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could, nor which is worſe deſired to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle.</p>
            <p>His Soul was charm'd to the movement of her Body: An Air ſo graceful, ſo ſweet, ſo eaſie and ſo great, he had never ſeen. She had ſomething of Majeſty in her, which appear'd to be born with her; and though it ſtruck an awe into the Beholders, yet was it ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with a familiarity of Behaviour, which rendred it agreeable to every Body. The grandeur of her Mien was not ſtiff, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtudied and unforced, mixed with a ſimplicity; free, yet not looſe nor affected. If the former ſeem'd to condeſcend, the latter ſeem'd to aſpire;
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0110402300:35"/>
and both to unite in the centre of Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. Every turn ſhe gave in dancing ſnatcht <hi>Aurelian</hi> into a Rapture, and he had like to have been out two or three times with the following his Eyes, which ſhe led about as Slaves to her Heels.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as they had done dancing, he began to complain of his want of Breath and Lungs, to ſpeak ſufficiently in her Commendation; She ſmilingly told him, he did ill to dance ſo much then: Yet in Conſideration of the pains he had taken more than ordinary upon her ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, ſhe would bate him a great deal of Compliment, but with this Proviſo, That he was to diſcover to her who he was. <hi>Aurelian</hi> was unwilling for the preſent to own himſelf to be really the Man he was; when a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain thought came into his Head to take upon him the Name and Character of <hi>Hippolito,</hi> who he was ſure was not known in <hi>Florence.</hi> He thereupon, after a little pauſe, pretended to recal himſelf in this manner: <q rend="inline margSglQuotes">'Madam, it is no ſmall demonſtration of the entire Reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation which I have made of my Heart to your Chains, ſince the ſecrets of it are no longer in my Power. I confeſs I only took <hi>Florence</hi> in my way, not deſigning any longer Reſidence, than ſhould be requiſite to inform the Curioſity of a Traveller, of the rarities of the Place. Whether Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs or Miſery will be the Conſequence of that Curioſity, I am yet in fear, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to your Determination; but ſure I am,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0110402300:36"/>
not to depart <hi>Florence</hi> till you have made me the moſt miſerable Man in it, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe me the fatal Kindneſs of Dying at your Feet. I am by Birth a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> of the City of <hi>Toledo;</hi> my name <hi>Hppolito di Savio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lina:</hi> I was yeſterday a Man free, as Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture made the firſt; to day I am fallen into a Captivity, which muſt continue with my Life, and which, it is in your Power, to make much dearer to me. Thus in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to your Commands, and contrary to my Reſolution of remaining unknown in this place, I have inform'd you, Madam, what I am; what I ſhall be, I deſire to know from you; at leaſt, I hope, thefree diſcovery I have made of my ſelf, will encourage you to truſt me with the knowledge of your Perſon.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Here a low bow, and a deep ſigh, put an end to his Diſcourſe, and ſignified his Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of her Reply, which was to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe—(But I had forgot to tell you, That <hi>Aurelian</hi> kept off his Mask from the time that he told her he was of <hi>Spain,</hi> till the period of his Relation.) <q rend="inline margSglQuotes">'Had I thought (ſaid ſhe) that my Curioſity would have brought me in debt, I ſhould certainly have forborn it; or at leaſt have agreed with you beforehand about the rate of your diſcovery, then I had not brought my ſelf to the Inconveniency of being cenſur'd, either of too much eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or reſervedneſs; but to avoid, as much as I can, the extremity of either, I am reſolv'd

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aurelian</hi> interrupted her, and ſwore very ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly (and the more heartily, I believe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he then indeed ſpoke truth) that he would make <hi>Florence</hi> the place of his abode, whatever concerns he had elſewhere. She ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed him to be cautious how he ſwore to his Expreſſions of Gallantry; and farther told him ſhe now hoped ſhe ſhould make him a return to all the Fine Things he had ſaid, ſince ſhe gave him his choice whether he would know whom ſhe was, or ſee her Face.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aurelian</hi> who was really in Love, and in whom Conſideration would have been a Crime, greedily embrac'd the latter, ſince ſhe aſſured him at that time he ſhould not know both. Well, what follow'd? Why, ſhe pull'd off her Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>k, and appear'd to him at once in the Glory of Beauty. But who can tell the aſtoniſhment <hi>Aurelian</hi> felt? He was for a time ſenſeleſs; Admiration had ſuppreſs'd his Speech, and his Eyes were entangled in Light. In ſhort, to be made ſenſible of his condition, we muſt conceive ſome Idea of what he beheld, which is not to be imagined till ſeen, nor then to be expreſs'd. Now ſee the imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinence and conceitedneſs of an Author, who will have a fling at a Deſcription, which he has Prefaced with an impoſſibility. One

might have ſeen ſomething in her Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition reſembling the Formation of <hi>Epicurus</hi> his World, as if every Atome of Beauty had concurr'd to unite an excellency. Had that curious Painter lived in her days, he might have avoided his painful ſearch, when he col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected from the choiceſt pieces the moſt choice Features, and by a due Diſpoſition and Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Symmetry of thoſe exquiſite parts, made one whole and perfect <hi>Venus.</hi> Nature ſeem'd here to have play'd the Plagiary, and to have molded into Subſtance the moſt refined Thoughts of inſpired Poets. Her Eyes diffus'd Rays comfortable as warmth, and piercing as the light; they would have worked a paſſage through the ſtraighteſt Pores, and with a deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious heat, have play'd about the moſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>durate frozen Heart, until 'twere melted down to Love. Such Majeſty and Affability were in her Looks; ſo alluring, yet commanding was her Preſence, that it mingled awe with love; kindling a Flame which trembled to aſpire. She had dancedmuch, which, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with her being cloſe masked, gave her a tincture of Carnation more than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary. But <hi>Aurelian</hi> (from whom I had every tittle of her Deſcription) fancy'd he ſaw a little Neſt of Cupids break from the Treſſes of her Hair, and every one officiouſly betake himſelf to his task. Some fann'd with their downy Wings, her glowing Cheeks; while others bruſh'd the balmy Dew from off her Face, leaving alone a heavenly Moiſture blubbing
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0110402300:39"/>
on her Lips, on which they drank and revell'd for their pains; Nay, ſo particular were their allotments in her ſervice, that <hi>Aurelian</hi> was very poſitive a young Cupid who was but juſt Pen-feather'd, employ'd his naked Quills to pick her Teeth. And a Thouſand other Things his Tranſport Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented to him, which none but Lovers who have experience of ſuch Viſions will believe.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as he awaked and found his Speech come to him, he employ'd it to this effect:</p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline margSglQuotes">' 'Tis enough that I have ſeen a Divinity—Nothing but Mercy can inhabit theſe Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons—Their utmoſt rigour brings a Death preferable to any Life, but what they give—Uſe me, Madam, as you pleaſe; for by your fair ſelf, I cannot think a Bliſs beyond what now I feel—You Wound with Pleaſure, and if you Kill it muſt be with Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſport—Ah! Yet methinks to live—O Heaven! to have Life pronounced by thoſe Bleſs'd Lips—Did they not inſpire where they command, it were an immediate Death of Joy.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aurelian</hi> was growing a little too loud with his Admiration, had ſhe not juſt then inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted him, by clapping on her Maſque, and telling him they ſhould be obſerved, if he proceeded in his Extravagance; and withal, that his Paſſion was too ſuddain to be real, and too violent to be laſting. He replied, Indeed it might not be very laſting, (with a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſive mournful Voice) but it would continue
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0110402300:40"/>
during his Life. That it was ſuddain, he denied, for ſhe had raiſed it by degrees from his firſt ſight of her, by a continued diſcovery of Charms, in her Mein and Converſation, till ſhe thought fit to ſet Fire to the Train ſhe had laid, by the Lightning of her Face; and then he could not help it, if he were blown up.</p>
            <p>He begg'd her to believe the Sincerity of his Paſſion, at leaſt to enjoin him ſomething, which might tend to the Convincing of her Incredulity. She ſaid, ſhe ſhould find a time to make ſome Trials of him; but for the firſt, ſhe charged him not to follow or obſerve her, after the Diſſolution of the Aſſembly. He promiſed to obey, and entreated her to tell him but her Name, that he might have Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to that in his Affliction for her Abſence, if he were able to ſurvive it. She deſired him to live by all means; and if he muſt have a Name to play with, to call her <hi>Incognita,</hi> till he were better informed.</p>
            <p>The Company breaking up, ſhe took her leave, and at his earneſt Entreaty, gave him a ſhort Viſion of her Face; which, then dreſs'd in an obliging ſmile, cauſed another fit of Tranſport, which laſted till ſhe was gone out of Sight. <hi>Aurelian</hi> gathered up his Spirits, and walked ſlowly towards his Lodging, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver remembring that he had loſt <hi>Hippolito,</hi> till upon turning the Corner of a Street, he heard a noiſe of Fighting; and coming near, ſaw a Man make a vigorous Defence againſt two, who preſſed violently upon him. He then
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0110402300:41"/>
thought of <hi>Hippolito,</hi> and fancying he ſaw the glimmering of Diamond Buttons, ſuch as <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polito</hi> had upon the Sleeves of his Habit, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately drew to his Aſſiſtance; and with that Eagerneſs and Reſolution, that the Aſſail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, finding their unmanly odds defeated, took to their Heels. The Perſon reſcued by the Generous Help of <hi>Aurelian,</hi> came toward him; but as he would have ſtoop'd to have ſaluted him, dropp'd, fainting at his feet. <hi>Aurelian,</hi> now he was ſo near him, perceiv'd plainly <hi>Hippolito</hi>'s Habit, and ſtep'd haſtily to take him up. Juſt as ſome of the Guards (who were going the Rounds, apprehenſive of ſuch Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders in an Univerſal Merriment) came up to him with Lights, and had taken Priſoners the Two Men, whom they met with their Swords drawn; when looking in the Face of the Wounded Man, he found it was not <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polito,</hi> but his Governour <hi>Claudio,</hi> in the Habit he had worn at the Ball. He was extreamly ſurpriz'd, as were the Priſoners, who confeſs'd their Deſign to have been upon <hi>Lorenzo;</hi> grounding their Miſtake upon the Habit which was known to have been his. They were Two Men who formerly had been Servants to him whom <hi>Lorenzo</hi> had unfortunately ſlain.</p>
            <p>They made a ſhift to bring <hi>Claudio</hi> to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and part of the Guard carrying off the Priſoners, whom <hi>Aurelian</hi> deſired they would ſecure, the reſt accompanied him bearing <hi>Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dio</hi> in their Arms to his Lodging. He had not patience to forbear asking for <hi>Hippolito</hi> by the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0110402300:42"/>
Way; whom <hi>Claudio</hi> aſſured him, he had left ſafe in his Chamber, above Two Hours ſince. That his coming Home ſo long before the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſements were ended, and Undreſſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, had given him the Unhappy Curioſity, to put on his Habit, and go to the Palace; in his Return from whence, he was ſet upon in the Manner he found him, which if he reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, he muſt own his Life indebted to his timely Aſſiſtance.</p>
            <p>Being come to the Houſe, they carried him to his Bed, and having ſent for Surgeons <hi>Aure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> rewarded and diſmiſſed the Guard. He ſtay'd the dreſſing of <hi>Claudio</hi>'s Wounds, which were many, though they hop'd none Mortal: and leaving him to his Reſt, went to give <hi>Hippolito</hi> an Account of what had happened, whom he found with a Table before him, leaning upon both his Elbows, his Face co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with his Hands, and ſo motionleſs, that <hi>Aurelian</hi> concluded he was aſleep; ſeeing ſeveral Papers lie before him, half written and blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out again, he thought to ſteal ſoftly to the Table, and diſcover what he had been em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed about. Juſt as he reach'd forth his Hand to take up one of the Papers, <hi>Hippolito</hi> ſtarted up ſo on the ſuddain, as ſurpriz'd <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relian</hi> and made him leap back; <hi>Hippolito,</hi> on the other hand, not ſuppoſing that any Body had been near him, was ſo diſordered with the Appearance of a Man at his Elbow, (whom his Amazement did not permit him to diſtinguiſh) that he leap'd haſtily to his Sword,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0110402300:43"/>
and in turning him about, overthrew the Stand and Candles. Here were they both left in the Dark, <hi>Hippolito</hi> groping about with his Sword, and thruſting at every Chair that he felt oppoſe him. <hi>Aurelian</hi> was ſcarce come to himſelf, when thinking to ſtep back toward the Door that he might inform his Friend of his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake, without expoſing himſelf to his blind Fury; <hi>Hippolito</hi> heard him ſtir, and made a full thruſt with ſuch Violence, that the Hilt of the Sword meeting with <hi>Aurelian</hi>'s Breaſt beat him down, and <hi>Hippolito</hi> a top of him, as a Servant alarmed with the noiſe, came into the Chamber with a Light. The Fellow trembled, and thought they were both Dead, till <hi>Hippolito</hi> raiſing himſelf, to ſee whom he had got under him, ſwoon'd away upon the diſcovery of his Friend. But ſuch was the extraordinary Care of Providence in directing the Sword, that it only paſt under his Arm, giving no Wound to <hi>Aurelian,</hi> but a little Bruiſe between his Shoulder and Breaſt with the Hilt. He got up, ſcarce recovered of his Fright, and by the help of the Servant laid <hi>Hippotito</hi> upon the Bed; who when he was come to himſelf could hardly be perſwaded, that his Friend was before him and alive, till he ſhew'd him his Breaſt, where was nothing of a Wound. <hi>Hippolito</hi> begg'd his Pardon a Thouſand Times, and curs'd himſelf as often, who was ſo near to committing the laſt Execrable Act of Ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:0110402300:44"/>
They diſmiſs'd the Fellow, and with many Embraces, congratulated their fortunate Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very from the Miſchief which came ſo near them, each blaming himſelf as the Occaſion: <hi>Aurelian</hi> accuſing his own unadviſedneſs in ſtealing upon <hi>Hippolito; Hippolito</hi> blaming his own temerity and weakneſs, in being ſo eaſily frighted to Diſorder; and laſt of all, his blindneſs, in not knowing his deareſt Friend. But there he gave a Sigh, and paſſionately taking <hi>Aurelian</hi> by the Hand, cry'd, Ah! my Friend, Love is indeed blind, when it would not ſuffer me to ſee you—There aroſe another Sigh; a Sympathy ſeized <hi>Aurelian</hi> immediately: (For, by the Way, ſighing is as catching among Lovers, as yawning among the Vulgar.) Beſide hearing the Name of Love, made him fetch ſuch a Sigh, that <hi>Hippolito</hi>'s were but Fly-blows in Compariſon, that was anſwered with all the Might <hi>Hippolito</hi> had. <hi>Aurelian</hi> ply'd him cloſe till they were both out of Breath.</p>
            <p>Thus not a Word paſs'd, though each won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred why the t'other ſigh'd, at laſt concluded it to be only Complaiſance to one another.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aurelian</hi> broke the Silence, by telling him, the Misfortune of his Governour. <hi>Hippolito</hi> rejoy'd as at the luckieſt Accident which could have befallen him. <hi>Aurelian</hi> wondred at his unſeaſonable Mirth, and demanded the Cauſe of it; he anſwered, It would neceſſitate his longer ſtay in <hi>Florence,</hi> and for ought he knew be the Means of bringing a happy Period to his Amour.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:0110402300:45"/>
His Friend thought him to be little better than a Mad-man, when he perceiv'd him of a ſuddain ſnatch out of his Boſom a Handker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, which having kiſs'd with a great deal of Ardour, he took <hi>Aurelian</hi> by the Hand, and ſmiling at the Surprize he ſaw him in;</p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline margSglQuotes">'Your <hi>Florentine Cupid</hi> is certainly (ſaid he) the moſt Expert in the World.

            <p>
               <hi>Aurelian</hi> ſeeing the Rapture he was in, thought it in vain to expect a ſettled Relation of the Adventure, ſo was reaching to the Table for ſome of the Papers, but <hi>Hippolito</hi> told him, Ifhe would have a little Patience he would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint him with the whole Matter; and thereupon told him Word for Word how he was miſtaken for <hi>Lorenzo,</hi> and his Management of himſelf. <hi>Aurelian</hi> commended his Prudence, in not diſcovering himſelf; and told him, If

he could ſpare ſo much time from the Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of his Miſtreſs, he would inform him of an Adventure, though not ſo Accidental, yet of as great Concern to his own future Happineſs. So related all that had happened to him with his Beautiful <hi>Incognita.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having ended the Story, they began to conſider of the means they were to uſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward a Review of their Miſtreſſes. <hi>Aurelian</hi> was Confounded at the Difficulty he conceived on his Part. He underſtood from <hi>Hippolito</hi>'s Adventure, that his Father knew of his being in Town, whom he muſt unavoidably Diſoblige if he yet conceal'd himſelf, and Diſobey if he came into his Sight; for he had already enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd an Averſion for <hi>Juliana,</hi> in apprehenſion of her being impoſed on him. His <hi>Incognita</hi> was rooted in his Heart, yet could he not Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort himſelfwith any Hopes when he ſhould ſee her: He knew not where ſhe lived, and ſhe had made him no Promiſe of a ſecond Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. Then did he repent his inconſiderate Choice, in preferring the momentary Viſion of her Face, to a certain Intelligence of Her Perſon. Every thought that ſucceeded diſtracted him, and all the Hopes he could preſume upon, were within compaſs of the Two Days Merriment yet to come; for which Space he hop'd he might excuſe his remaining conceal'd to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hippolito</hi> on the other ſide (tho' <hi>Aurelian</hi> thought him in a much better Way) was no leſs afflicted for himſelf. The Difficulties which
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0110402300:47"/>
he ſaw in his Friend's Circumſtances, put him upon finding out a great many more in his own, than really there were. But what terrified him moſt of all, was his being an utter Stranger to <hi>Leonora;</hi> ſhe had not the leaſt knowledge of him but through miſtake, and conſequently could form no Idea of him to his Advantage. He look'd upon it as an unlucky thought in <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relian</hi> to take upon him his Name, ſince poſſibly the Two Ladies were acquainted, and ſhould they communicate each other their Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, they might both reaſonably ſuffer in their Opinions, and be thought guilty of Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhood, ſince it would appear to them as One Perſon pretending to Two. <hi>Aurelian</hi> told him, there was but one Remedy for that, which was for <hi>Hippolito,</hi> in the ſame Manner that he had done, to make uſe of his Name, when he writ to <hi>Leonora,</hi> and uſe what Arguments he could to perſwade her to Secrecy, leaſt his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhould know of the Reaſon which kept him concealed in Town. And it was likely, tho' perhaps ſhe might not immediately entertain his Paſſion; yet ſhe would out of Generoſity conceal, what was hidden only for her ſake.</p>
            <p>Well, this was concluded on, after a great many other Reaſons uſed on either Side, in favour of the Contrivance; they at laſt argued themſelves into a Belief, that Fortune had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friended them with a better Plot, than their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Thinking could have contriv'd. So ſoon had they convinc'd themſelves, in what they were willing to believe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:0110402300:48"/>
               <hi>Aurelian</hi> laid himſelf down to reſt, that is, upon the Bed; for he was a better Lover than to pretend ſleep that Night, while <hi>Hippolito</hi> ſet himſelf again to frame his Letter deſign'd for <hi>Leonora.</hi> He writ ſeveral, at laſt pitched upon one, and very probably the worſt, as you may gueſs when you read it in its proper Place.</p>
            <p>It was break of Day when the Servant, who had been employed all the foregoing Day in procuring Accoutrements for the Two Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers, to appear in at the Tilting, came into the Room, and told them all the Young Gentlemen in the Town were trying their Equipage, and preparing to be early in the Liſts. They made themſelves ready with all Expedition at the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm: And <hi>Hippolito</hi> having made a Viſit to his Governour, diſpatch'd a Meſſenger with the Letter and Directions to <hi>Leonora.</hi> At the Signal agreed upon the Caſement was opened and a String let down, to which the Bearer having faſtned the Letter, ſaw it drawn up, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned. It were a vain attempt to deſcribe <hi>Leonora</hi>'s Surprize, when ſhe read the Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription.—<hi>The <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nfortunate</hi> Aurelian, <hi>to the Beautiful</hi> Leonora—After ſhe was a little recovered from her Amaze, ſhe recollected to her ſelf all the Paſſages between her and her ſuppoſed Couſin, and immediately concluded him to be <hi>Aurelian.</hi> Then ſeveral little Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances which ſhe thought might have been ſufficient to have convinced her, repreſented themſelves to her; and ſhe was in a ſtrange Uneaſineſs to think of her free Carriage to a Stranger.</p>

She was once in a Mind to have burn'd the Letter, or to have ſtay'd for an Opportunity to ſend it again. But ſhe was a Woman, and her Curioſitiy oppoſed it ſelf to all thoughts of that Nature: At length with a fir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>She read the Letter over and over, then flung it by, then read it again; the Novelty of the Adventure made her repeat Curioſity, and
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0110402300:51"/>
take more than ordinary Pains to underſtand it. At laſt her Familiarity with the Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons grew to an Intimacy, and what ſhe at firſt permitted ſhe now began to like. She thought there was ſomewhat in it a little more ſerious, than to be barely Gallantry. She wondred at her own Blindneſs, ſhe fancy'd ſhe cou'd re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member ſomething of a more becoming Air in the Stranger than was uſual to <hi>Lorenzo.</hi> This thought was parent to another of the ſame kind, till a long Chain ſucceſſively had Birth, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one ſomewhat more than other, in Favour of the ſuppoſed <hi>Aurelian.</hi> She reflected upon his Diſcretion, in deferring the Diſcovery of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, till a little time had, as it were, weaned her from her perſwaſion, and by removing her farther from her miſtake, had prepar'd her for a full and determinate Convincement. She thought his Behaviour, in perſonating a Sick Man ſo readily, upon the firſt hint was not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs, and ſmil'd to think of his Excuſe to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure her Handkerchief; and laſt of all, his ſift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out the Means to write to her, which he had done with that Modeſty and Reſpect, ſhe could not tell how to find fault with it.</p>
            <p>She had proceeded thus far in a maze of Thought, when ſhe ſtarted to find her ſelf ſo loſt to her Reaſon, and would have trod back again that path of deluding Fancy; accuſing her ſelf of Fondneſs, and inconſiderate Eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in giving Credit to the Letter of a Perſon whoſe Face ſhe never ſaw, and whoſe firſt Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with her was a Treachery, and he
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0110402300:52"/>
who could ſo readily deliver his Tongue of a Lye upon a Surprize, was ſcarce to be truſted when he had ſufficient Time allow'd him to beget a Fiction, and Means to perfect the Birth.</p>
            <p>How did ſhe know this to be <hi>Aurelian,</hi> if he were? Nay farther, put it to the Extremity, What if ſhe ſhould upon farther Converſation with him proceed to Love him? What Hopes were there for her? Or how could ſhe conſent to Marry a Man already deſtin'd for another Woman? Nay, a Woman that was her Friend, whoſe Marrying with him was to compleat the happy Reconciliation of Two Noble Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, and which might prevent the Effuſion of much Blood likely to be ſhed in that Quarrel: Beſides, ſhe ſhould incurr ſhare of the Guilt, which he would draw upon him by Diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to his Father, whom ſhe was ſure would not be conſenting to it.</p>
            <p>'Tis ſtrange now, but all Accounts agree, that juſt here <hi>Leonora,</hi> who had run like a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Stream againſt <hi>Aurelian</hi> hitherto, now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted with as much precipitation in his Favour. I could never get any Body to give me a ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory Reaſon, for her ſuddain and dexterous Change of Opinion juſt at that ſtop, which made me conclude ſhe could not help it; and that Nature boil'd over in her at that time when it had ſo fair an Opportunity to ſhow it ſelf: For <hi>Leonora</hi> it ſeems was a Woman Beautiful, and otherwiſe of an exellent Diſpoſition; but in the Bottom a very Woman. This laſt Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, this Opportunity of perſwading Man to
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0110402300:53"/>
Diſobedience, determined the Matter in Favour of <hi>Aurelian,</hi> more than all his Excellencies and Qualifications, take him as <hi>Aurelian,</hi> or <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lito,</hi> or both together.</p>
            <p>Well, the Spirit of Contradiction and of <hi>Eve</hi> was ſtrong in her; and ſhe was in a fair Way to Love <hi>Aurelian,</hi> for ſhe lik'd him already; that it was <hi>Aurelian</hi> ſhe no longer doubted, for had it been a Villain, who had only taken his Name upon him for any ill Deſigns, he would never have ſlip'd ſo favourable an opportunity as when they were alone, and in the Night co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming through the Garden and broad Space be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Piazza. In ſhort, thus much ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd at leaſt to conceal the Knowledge ſhe had of him, as he had entreated her in his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and to make particular Remarks of his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour that Day in the Liſts, which ſhould it happen to Charm her with an abſolute liking of his Perſon, ſhe reſolv'd to dreſs her ſelf to the beſt Advantage, and muſter up all her Graces, out of pure Revenge to kill him down right.</p>
            <p>I would not have the Reader now be imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, and look upon this to be force, or a whim of the Author's, that a Woman ſhould proceed ſo far in the Approbation of a Man whom ſhe never ſaw, that it is impoſſible, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ridiculous to ſuppoſe it. Let me tell ſuch a Critick, that he knows nothing of the Sex, if he does not know that a Woman may be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with the Character and Deſcription of a Man when general and extraordinary, that ſhe

               </gap> to our Friends merit, we give ſo large a Deſcription of his Excellencies, that People more more room in their Expectation, than the Intrinſick worth of the Man will fill, which renders him ſo much the more deſpica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as there is emptineſs to ſpare. 'Tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, though the Women ſeldom find that out; for though they do not ſee ſo much in a Man as was promiſed, yet they will be ſo kind to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine he has ſome hidden excellencies which time may diſcover to them, ſo are content to allow him a conſiderable ſhare of their eſteem, and take him into Favour upon Tick. <hi>Aure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> as he had good Credit ſo he had a good Stock to ſupport it, and his Perſon was a good promiſing Security for the payment of any O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bligation he could lie under to the Fair Sex. <hi>Hippolito,</hi> who at this time was our <hi>Aurelian,</hi> did not at all leſſen him in appearing for him: So that although <hi>Leonora</hi> was indeed miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, ſhe could not be ſaid to be much in the wrong. I could find in my Heart to beg the Reader's Pardon for this Digreſſion, if I
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0110402300:55"/>
thought he would be ſenſible of the Civility; for I promiſe him, I do not intend to do it again throughout the Story, though I make ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo many, and though he take them never ſo ill. But becauſe I began this upon a bare Suppoſition of his Impertinence, which might be ſomewhat Impertinent in me to ſuppoſe I do, and hope to make him amends by telling him, that by the time <hi>Leonora</hi> was dreſs'd, ſeveral Ladies of her Acquaintance came to accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny her to the place deſigned for the Tilting, where we will leave them Drinking Chocolate till 'tis time for them to go.</p>
            <p>Our Cavaliers had by good Fortune provided themſelves of two Curious Suits of Light Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, finely Enamelled and Gilt. <hi>Hippolito</hi> had ſent to <hi>Poggio Imperiale</hi> for a couple of fine led Horſes which he had left there with the reſt of his Train at his entrance into <hi>Florence.</hi> Mounted on theſe, and every way well Equipt, they took their way, attended only by two Lacqueys, toward the Church <hi>di Sancta Croce,</hi> before which they were to perform their Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes of Chivalry. <hi>Hippolito</hi> wore upon his Helm a large Plume of Crimſon Feathers, in the midſt of which was artificially placed <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nora</hi>'s Handkerchief. His Armour was gilt, and Enamell'd with Green and Crimſon. <hi>Aure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> was not ſo happy as to were any token to recommend him to the Notice of his Miſtreſs, ſo had only a Plume of Sky-colour and White Feathers, ſuitable to his Armour, which was Silver Enamelled with Azure. I ſhall not deſcribe
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0110402300:56"/>
the Habit of any other Cavaliers, or of the Ladies; let it ſuffice to tell the Reader they were all very Fine and very Glorious, and let him dreſs them in what is moſt agreeable to his own Fancy.</p>
            <p>Our Gallants entred the Liſts, and having made their Obeyſance to his Highneſs, turned round to ſalute and view the Company. The Scaffold was circular, ſo that there was no end of the Delightful Proſpect. It ſeem'd a Glory of Beauty which ſhone around the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring Beholders. Our Lovers ſoon perceiv'd the Stars which were to Rule their Deſtiny, which ſparkled a Luſtre beyond all the Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Conſtellations, and ſeem'd like two Suns to diſtribute Light to all the Planets in that Heavenly Sphere. <hi>Leonora</hi> knew her Slave by his Badge, and bluſhed till the Lillies and Roſes in her Cheeks had reſemblance to the Plume of Crimſon and White Handkerchief in <hi>Hippolito</hi>'s Creſt. He made her a low Bow, and reined his Horſe back with an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Grace, into a reſpectful Retreat. <hi>Aure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> ſaw his Angel his Beautiful <hi>Incognita,</hi> and had no other way to make himſelf known to her, but by ſaluting and bowing to her after the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> mode; ſhe gueſs'd him by it to be her new Servant <hi>Hippolito,</hi> and ſignified her appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion, by making him a more particular and obliging return, than to any of the Cavaliers who had ſaluted her before.</p>
            <p>The Exerciſe which was to be perform'd was in general a running at the Ring, and afterwards
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0110402300:57"/>
two Cavaliers undertook to defend the Beauty of <hi>Donna Catharina,</hi> againſt all who would not allow her preheminence of their Miſtreſſes. This thing was only deſign'd for ſhow and form, none preſuming that any Body would put ſo great an affront upon the Bride and Duke's Kinſwoman, as to diſpute her pretenſions to the firſt place in the Court of <hi>Venus.</hi> But here our Cavaliers were under a miſtake; for ſeeing a large Shield carry'd before two Knights, with a Lady painted upon it; not knowing who, but reading the Inſcription which was (in large Gold Letters) <hi>Above the Inſolence of Competition.</hi> They thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves obliged, eſpecially in the preſence of their Miſtreſſes to vindicate their Beauty; and were juſt ſpurring on to engage the Champions, when a Gentleman ſtopping them, told them their miſtake, that it was the Picture of <hi>Donna Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tharina,</hi> and a particular Honour done to her by his Highneſs's Commands, and not to be diſputed. Upon this they would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd to their Poſt, much concerned for their miſtake; but notice being taken by <hi>Don Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand</hi> of ſome Show of Oppoſition that was made, he would have begg'd leave of the Duke, to have maintained his Lady's Honour againſt the Inſolence of thoſe Cavaliers; but the Duke would by no means permit it. They were arguing about it when one of them came up, before whom the Shield was born, and demanded his Highneſs's Permiſſion, to inform thoſe Gentlemen better of their miſtake, by
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0110402300:58"/>
giving them the Foyl. By the Interceſſion of <hi>Don Ferdinand</hi> leave was given them; where upon a Civil Challenge was ſent to the two Strangers, informing them of their Error, and withal telling them they muſt either maintain it by Force of Arms, or make a publick acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment by riding bear headed before the Picture once round the Liſts. The Stranger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Cavaliers remonſtrated to the Duke how ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible they were of their Error, and though they would not juſtifie it, yet they could not decline the Combate, being preſſed to it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond an honourable refuſal. To the Bride they ſent a Complement, wherein, having firſt begg'd her pardon for not knowing her Picture, they gave her to underſtand, that now they were not about to diſpute her undoubted right to the Crown of Beauty, but the Honour of being her Champions was the Prize they ſought for, which they thought themſelves as able to maintain as any other Pretenders. Wherefore they pray'd her, that if Fortune ſo far befriended their endeavours as to make them Victors, that they might receive no other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, but to be crown'd with the Titles of their Adverſaries, and be ever after eſteem'd as her moſt humble Servants. The excuſe was ſo handſomly deſigned, and much better ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd than it it here, that it took effect. The Duke <hi>Don Ferdinand</hi> and his Lady were ſo well ſatisfied with it as to grant their Requeſt.</p>
            <p>While the running at the Ring laſted, our Cavaliers alternately bore away great ſhare of
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:0110402300:59"/>
the Honour. That Sport ended, Marſhals were appointed for the Field, and every thing in great form ſettled for the Combat. The Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valiers were all in good earneſt, but orders were given to bring 'em blunted Lances, and to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid the drawing of a Sword upon pain of his Highneſs's Diſpleaſure. The Trumpets ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and they began their Courſe: The Ladies Hearts, particularly the <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>cognita</hi> and <hi>Leonora</hi>'s beat time to the Horſes Hoof, and hope and fear made a mock Fight within their tender Breaſts, each wiſhing and doubting ſucceſs where ſhe lik'd: But as the generality of their Prayers were for the graceful Strangers, they accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly ſucceeded. <hi>Aurelian</hi>'s Adverſary was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horſed in the firſt Encounter, and <hi>Hippolito</hi>'s loſt both his Stirrups and dropt his Lance to ſave himſelf. The Honour of the Field was immediately granted to them, and <hi>Donna Catha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rina</hi> ſent them both Favours, which ſhe pray'd them to wear as her Knights. The Crowd breaking up, our Cavaliers made a ſhift to ſteal off unmarked, ſave by the watchful <hi>Leonora</hi> and <hi>Incognita,</hi> whoſe Eyes were never off from their reſpective Servants. There was enquiry made for them, but to no purpoſe; for they, to prevent their being diſcover'd, had prepared another Houſe, diſtant from their Lodging, where a Servant attended to diſarm them, and another carried back their Horſes to the <hi>Villa,</hi> while they walked unſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected to their Lodging; but <hi>Incognita</hi> had given command to a Page to dog 'em till the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0110402300:60"/>
Evening, at a diſtance, and bring her word where they were lateſt houſed.</p>
            <p>While ſeveral Conjectures paſs'd among the Company, who were all gone to Dinner at the Palace, who thoſe Cavaliers ſhould be, <hi>Don Fabio</hi> thought himſelf the only Man able to gueſs; for he knew for certain that his Son and <hi>Hippolito</hi> were both in Town, and was well enough pleaſed with his humour of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining <hi>Incognito</hi> till the Diverſions ſhould be over, believing then that the ſurpize of his Diſcovery would add much to the Gallantry he had ſhown in Maſquerade; but hearing the extraordinary liking that every body ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd, and in a particular manner, the great Duke himſelf, to the Perſons and Behaviour of the unknown Cavaliers, the Old Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman could not forbear the Vanity to tell his Highneſs, that he believed he had an intereſt in one of the Gentlemen, whom he was pleaſed to honour with ſo favourable a Character; and told him what reaſon he had to believe the one to be his Son, and the other a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Nobleman, his Friend.</p>
            <p>This diſcovery having thus got vent, was diffuſed like Air; every body ſuck'd it in, and let it out again with their Breath to the next they met withal; and in half an hours time it was talked of in the Houſe where our Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turers were lodged. <hi>Aurelian</hi> was ſtark mad at the News, and knew what ſearch would be immediately made for him. <hi>Hippolito,</hi> had he not been deſperately in Love, would certainly
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0110402300:61"/>
have taken Horſe and rid out of Town juſt then; for he could make no longer doubt of being diſcovered, and he was afraid of the juſt Exceptions <hi>Leonora</hi> might make to a Perſon who had now deceived her twice. Well, we will leave them both fretting and contriving to no purpoſe, to look about and ſee what was done at the Palace, where their doom was determined much quicker than they ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined.</p>
            <p>Dinner ended, the Duke retired with ſome choſen Friends to a Glaſs of Wine; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong whom were the Marqueſs of <hi>Viterbo</hi> and <hi>Don Fabio.</hi> His Highneſs was no Stranger to the long Fewd that had been between the two Families, and alſo underſtood what O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertures of Reconciliation had been lately made, with the Propoſals of Marriage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Aurelian</hi> and the Marqueſs's Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Having waited till the Wine had taken the effect propoſed, and the Company were rais'd to an uncommon pitch of Chearfulneſ, which he alſo encouraged by an Example of Freedom and Good Humour, he took an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of rallying the two grave Signior's into an Accommodation: That was ſeconded with the praiſes of the young Couple, and the whole Company joined in a large Encomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um upon the Graces of <hi>Aurelian</hi> and the Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>Juliana.</hi> The old Fellows were tickled with Delight to hear their Darlings ſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired, which the Duke perceiving, out of a Principle of Generoſity and Friendſhip, urged
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0110402300:62"/>
the preſent Conſummation of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage; telling them there was yet one day of publick Rejoycing to come, and how glad he ſhould be to have it improved by ſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable an Alliance; and what an honour it would be to have his Couſin's Marriage at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by the Conjunction of ſo extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary a Pair, the performance of which Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony would crown the Joy that was then in Agitation, and make the laſt day vie for equal Glory and Happineſs with the firſt. In ſhort, by the Complaiſant and Perſwaſive Authority of the Duke, the <hi>Dons</hi> were wrought into a Compliance, and accordingly embraced and ſhook Hands upon the Matter. This News was diſperſed like the former, and <hi>Don Fabio</hi> gave orders for the enquiring out his Son's Lodging, that the Marqueſs and he might make him a Viſit, as ſoon as he had acquam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Juliana</hi> with his purpoſe, that ſhe might prepare her ſelf. He found her very chearful with <hi>Donna Catharina</hi> and ſeveral other La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; whereupon the old Gentleman, pretty well warmed with the Duke's Good fellowſhip, told her aloud he was come to crown their Mirth with another Wedding; that his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs had been pleaſed to provide a Husband for h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s Daughter, and he would have her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide her ſelf to receive him to morrow. All the Company at firſt, as well as <hi>Juliana</hi> her ſelf, thought he had rally'd, till the Duke coming in confirmed the ſerious part of his Diſcourſe. <hi>Juliana</hi> was confounded at the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0110402300:63"/>
haſte that was impoſed on her, and deſired a little time to conſider what ſhe was about. But the Marqueſs told her, ſhe ſhould have all the reſt of her Life to conſider in; that <hi>Aurelian</hi> ſhould come and conſider with her in the Morning, if ſhe pleaſed; but in the mean time, he adviſed her to go home and call her Maids to Counſel.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Juliana</hi> took her leave of the Company very gravely, as if not much delighted with her Father's Rallery. <hi>Leonora</hi> happened to be by; and heard all that paſſed; ſhe was ready to ſwoon, and found her ſelf ſeized with a more violent Paſſion than ever for <hi>Aurelian:</hi> Now upon her apprehenſions of loſing him, her active fancy had brought him before her with all the Advantages imaginable, and tho' ſhe had before ſound great tenderneſs in her Inclination toward him, yet was ſhe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ſurprized to find ſhe really lov'd him. She was ſo uneaſie at what ſhe had heard, that ſhe thought it convenient to ſteal out of the preſence and retire to her Cloſet, to bemoan her unhappy helpleſs Condition.</p>
            <p>Our Two Cavalier-Lovers had rack'd their Invention till it was quite diſabled, and could not make diſcovery of one Contrivance more for their Relief. Both ſat ſilent, each depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon his Friend, and ſtill expecting when t'other ſhould ſpeak. Night came upon them while they ſate thus thoughtleſs, or rather drowned in Thought; but a Servant bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Lights into the Room awakened them:
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0110402300:64"/>
And <hi>Hippolito</hi>'s Speech, uſher'd by a profound Sigh, broke Silence.</p>
            <p>'Well! (ſaid he) what muſt we do, <hi>Aure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian?</hi> We muſt ſuffer, replied <hi>Aurelian</hi> faintly. When immediately raiſing his Voice, he cry'd out, <q rend="inline margSglQuotes">'Oh ye unequal Powers, why do ye urge us to deſire what ye doom us to forbear; give us a Will to chuſe, then curb us with a Duty to reſtrain that Choice! Cruel Father, Will nothing elſe ſuffice! Am I to be the Sacrifice to expiate your Offences paſt; paſt ere I was born? Were I to loſe my Life, I'd gladly Seal your Reconcile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with my Blood. But Oh my Soul is free, you have no Title to my Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Being, that has Exiſtence independent of your Power; and muſt I loſe my Love, the Extract of that Being, that Joy, Light, Life, and Darling of my Soul? No, I'll own my Flame, and plead my Title too.—But hold, wretched <hi>Aurelian,</hi> hold, whither does thy Paſſion hurry thee? Alas! the cruel fair <hi>Incognita</hi> loves thee not! She knows not of thy Love! If ſhe did, what Merit haſt thou to pretend?—Only Love.—Exceſs of Love. And all the World has that. All that have ſeen her. Yet I had only ſeen her once, and in that once I lov'd above the World; nay, lov'd beyond my ſelf, ſuch Vigorous Flame, ſo ſtrong, ſo quick ſhe darted at my Breaſt; it muſt rebound, and by Reflection, warm her ſelf. Ah! welcome Thought, lovely deluding Fancy,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0110402300:65"/>
hang ſtill upon my Soul, let me but think, that once ſhe Loves and periſh my Deſpair.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Here a ſuddain ſtop gave a Period alſo to <hi>Hippolito</hi>'s Expectation, and he hoped now that his Friend had given his Paſſion ſo free a vent, he might recollect and bethink himſelf of what was convenient to be done; but <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relian,</hi> as if he had muſtered up all his Spirits purely to acquit himſelf of that paſſionate Harangue, ſtood mute and inſenſible like an Alarum Clock, that had ſpent all its force in one violent Emotion. <hi>Hippolito</hi> ſhook him by the Arm to rouze him from his Lithargy, when his Lacquey coming into the Room, out of Breath, told him there was a Coach juſt ſtopp'd at the Door, but he did not take time to ſee who came in it. <hi>Aurelian</hi> concluded immediately it was his Father in queſt of him; and without ſaying any more to <hi>Hippolito,</hi> than that he was Ruined if diſcovered, took his Sword and ſlipp'd down a back pair of Stairs into the Garden, from whence he conveyed himſelf into the Street. <hi>Hippolito</hi> had not bethought himſelf what to do, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he perceiv'd a Lady come into the Chamber cloſe veil'd, and make toward him. At the firſt Appearance of a Woman, his Imagination flattered him with a Thought of <hi>Leonora;</hi> but that was quickly over upon nearer Approach to the Lady, who had much the Advantage in Stature of his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs. He very civily accoſted her, and asked, if he were the Perſon to whom the Honour
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0110402300:66"/>
of that Viſit was intended. She ſaid, her Buſineſs was with <hi>Don Hippolito di Saviolina,</hi> to whom ſhe had Matter of Concern to import, and which required haſte. He had like to have told her, That he was the Man, but by good Chance reflecting upon his Friend's Adventure, who had taken his name, he made Anſwer, that he believed <hi>Don Hippolito</hi> not far off, and if ſhe had a Moments Patience he would enquire for him.</p>
            <p>He went out, leaving the Lady in the Room, and made ſearch all round the Houſe and Garden for <hi>Aurelian,</hi> but to no purpoſe. The Lady impatient of his long ſtay took a Pen and Ink and ſome Paper which ſhe found upon the Table, and had juſt made an End of her Letter, when hearing a Noiſe of more than one coming up Stairs, ſhe concluded his Friend had found him, and that her Letter would be to no purpoſe, ſo tore it in peices, which ſhe repented; when turning about, ſhe found her Miſtake, and beheld <hi>Don Fabio</hi> and the Marqueſs of <hi>Viterbo</hi> juſt entring at the Door. She gave a Shriek at the Surprize of their Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, which much troubled the Old Gentlemen, and made them retire in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion for putting a Gentlewoman into ſuch a Fright. The Marqueſs thinking they had been misinformed, or had miſtaken the Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, came forward again, and made an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pology to the Lady for their Errour; but ſhe making no reply, walk'd directly by him down Stairs and went into her Coach,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0110402300:67"/>
which hurried her away as ſpeedily as the Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes were able to draw.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Dons</hi> were at a loſs what to think, when, <hi>Hippolito</hi> coming into the Room to give the Lady an Account of his Errant, was no leſs aſtoniſhed to find ſhe was departed, and had left Two Old Signiors in her ſtead. He knew <hi>Don Fabio</hi>'s Face, for <hi>Aurelian</hi> had ſhewn him his Father at the Tilting; but being confident he was not known to him, he ventur'd to ask him concerning the Lady whom juſt now he had left in that Chamber. <hi>Don Fabio</hi> told him, ſhe was juſt gone down, and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed they had been Guilty of a Miſtake, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to enquire for a Couple of Gentlemen whom they were informed were Lodged in that Houſe; he begg'd his Pardon if he had any Relation to that Lady, and deſired to know if he could give them any Account of the Perſons they ſought for. <hi>Hippolito</hi> made an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, He was a Stranger in the Place, and only a Servant to that Lady whom they had di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb'd, and whom he muſt go and ſeek out. And in this Perplexity he left them, going again in Search of <hi>Aurelian,</hi> to inform him of what had paſſed.</p>
            <p>The Old Gentlemen at laſt meeting with a Servant of the Houſe, were directed to Signior <hi>Claudio</hi>'s Chamber, where they were no ſooner entered but <hi>Aurelian</hi> came into the Houſe. A Servant who had skulk'd for him by <hi>Hippolito</hi>'s Order, followed him up into the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0110402300:68"/>
Chamber, and told him who was with <hi>Claudio</hi> then making Enquiry for him. He thought that to be no Place for him, ſince <hi>Claudio</hi> muſt needs diſcover all the Truth to his Father; wherefore he left Directions with the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, where <hi>Hippolito</hi> ſhould meet him in the Morning. As he was going out of the Room he eſpied the torn Paper, which the Lady had thrown upon the Floor: The firſt piece he took up had <hi>Incognita</hi> written upon it; the ſight of which ſo Alarm'd him, he ſcarce knew what he was about; but hearing a Noiſe of a Door opening over Head, with as much Care as was conſiſtent with the haſte he was then in, he gathered up the ſcattered pieces of Paper, and betook himſelf to a Ramble.</p>
            <p>Coming by a Light which hung at the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of a Street, he join'd the torn Papers and collected thus much, that his <hi>Incognita</hi> had Written the Note, and earneſtly deſired him (if there were any reality in what he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to her) to meet her at Twelve a Clock that Night at a Convent Gate; but unluckily the Bit of Paper which ſhould have mentioned what Convent, was broken off and loſt.</p>
            <p>Here was a large Subject for <hi>Aurelian</hi>'s Paſſion, which he did not ſpare to pour forth in Abundance of Curſes on his Stars. So earneſt was he in the Contemplation of his Misfortunes, that he walk'd on unwittingly; till at length a Silence (and ſuch as was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be found in that part of the Town,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0110402300:69"/>
whither his unguided Steps had carried him) ſurpriz'd his Attention. I ſay, a profound Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence rouzed him from his Thought; and a clap of Thunder could have done no more.</p>
            <p>Now becauſe it is poſſible this at ſome time or other may happen to be read by ſome mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious or Ignorant Perſon, (no Reflection upon the preſent Reader) who will not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, or does not underſtand that Silence ſhould make a Man ſtart; and have the ſame Effect, in provoking his Attention, with its oppoſite Noiſe; I will illuſtrate this Matter, to ſuch a diminutive Critick, by a Parallel Inſtance of Light; which though it does chiefly entertain the Eyes, and is indeed the prime Object of the Sight, yet ſhould it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ceaſe, to have a Man left in the Dark by a ſuddain deficiency of it, would make him ſtare with his Eyes, and though he could not ſee, endeavour to look about him. Why juſt thus did it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>are with our Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turer; who ſeeming to have wandred both into the Dominions of Silence and of Night, began to have ſome tender for his own Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and would willingly have groped his Way back again; when he heard a Voice, as from a Perſon whoſe Breath had been ſtopp'd by ſome forcible Oppreſſion, and juſt then, by a violent Effort, was broke through the Reſtraint.—'Yet—Yet—(again reply'd the Voice, ſtill ſtruggling for Air) <q rend="inline margSglQuotes">'Forbear—and I'll forgive what's paſt—I have done nothing yet that needs a Pardon,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0110402300:70"/>
(ſays another) and what is to come, will admit of none.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Here the Perſon who ſeemed to be the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, made ſeveral Attempts to ſpeak, but they were only inarticulate Sounds, being all interrupted and choaked in their Paſſage.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aurelian</hi> was ſufficiently aſtoniſh'd, and would have crept nearer to the Place whence he gueſſed the Voice to come; but he was got among the Ruins of an Old Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, and could not ſtir ſo ſilently, but ſome looſe Stones he met with made a rum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling. The Noiſe alarm'd both Parties; and as it gave Comfort to the one, it ſo Terrified the t'other, that he could not hinder the Oppreſſed from calling for help. <hi>Aurelian</hi> fancy'd it was a Womans Voice, and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately drawing his Sword, demanded what was the Matter; he was anſwered with the Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of a Man, who had opened a Dark Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorn which he had by him, and came to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward him with a Piſtol in his Hand ready cock'd.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aurelian</hi> ſeeing the irreſiſtable advantage his Adverſary had over him, would fain have retired; and, by the greateſt Providence in the World, going backwards fell down over ſome looſe Stones that lay in his Way, juſt in that Inſtant of Time when the Villain fired his Piſtol, who ſeeing him fall, concluded he had Shot him. The Crys of the afflicted Perſon were redoubled at the Tragical Sight, which made the Murderer, drawing a Poniard,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0110402300:71"/>
to threaten him, that the next Murmur ſhould be his laſt. <hi>Aurelian,</hi> who was ſcarce aſſured that he was unhurt, got ſoftly up; and coming near enough to perceive the Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence that was uſed to ſtop the Injured Man's Mouth; (for now he ſaw plainly it was a Man) cry'd out,—Turn, Villain, and look upon thy Death.—The Fellow ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed at the Voice, turn'd about to have ſnatch'd up the Lanthorn from the Ground; either to have given Light only to himſelf, or to have put out the Candle, that he might have made his Eſcape; but which of the Two he deſigned, no Body could tell but himſelf: And if the Reader have a Curioſity to know, he muſt blame <hi>Aurelian;</hi> who think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there could be no foul Play offered to ſuch a Villian, ran him immediately through the Heart, ſo that he drop'd down Dead at his Feet, without ſpeaking a Word. He would have ſeen who the Perſon was he had thus happily delivered, but the Dead Body had fallen upon the Lanthorn, which put out the Candle: However, coming up toward him, he ask'd him how he did, and bid him be of good Heart; he was anſwered with nothing but Prayers, Bleſſings and Thanks, called a Thouſand Deliverers, good Genius's, and Guardian Angels. And the Reſcued would certainly have gone upon his Knees to have worſhipped him, had he not been bound Hand and Foot; which <hi>Aurelian</hi> underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, groped for the Knots, and either untied
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0110402300:72"/>
them or cut them aſunder; but 'tis more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable the latter, becauſe more expeditious.</p>
            <p>They took little heed what became of the Body which they left behind them, and <hi>Aurelian</hi> was conducted from out the Ruins by the Hand of him he had delivered, By a faint light iſſuing from the juſt riſing Moon, he could diſcern that it was a Youth; but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into a more frequented part of the Town, where ſeveral Lights were hung out, he was amaz'd at the extream Beauty which appeared in his Face, though a little pale and diſordered with his late fright. <hi>Aurelian</hi> long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to hear the Story of ſo odd an adventure, and entreated his Charge to tell it him by the way; but he deſired him to forbear till they were come into ſome Houſe or other, where he might reſt and recover his tired Spirits, for yet he was ſo faint he was unable to look up. <hi>Aurelian</hi> thought theſe laſt words were deliveed in a Voice, whoſe accent was not new to him. That thought made him look earneſtly in the Youth's Face, which he now was ſure he had ſomewhere ſeen before, and thereupon asked him if he had never been at <hi>Siena?</hi> That Queſtion made the young Gentleman look up, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of a Joy appeared in his Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, which yet he endeavour'd to ſmother; ſo praying <hi>Aurelian</hi> to conduct him to his Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he promiſed him that as ſoon as they ſhould come thither, he would acquaint him with any thing he deſired to know. <hi>Aurelian</hi>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:0110402300:73"/>
would rather have gone any where elſe than to his own Lodging; but being ſo very late he was at a loſs, and ſo forced to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as they were come into his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and that Lights were brought them and the Servant diſmiſſed, the paleneſs which ſo viſibly before had uſurped the ſweet Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the afflicted Youth vaniſhed, and gave place to a more lively Flood of Crimſon, which with a modeſt heat glow'd freſhly on his Cheeks. <hi>Aurelian</hi> waited with a pleaſing Admiration the diſcovery promiſed him, when the Youth ſtill ſtruggling with his Reſolution, with a timorous haſte, pulled off a Peruke which had concealed the moſt beautiful a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of Hair that ever graced one Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male Head; thoſe diſhevelled ſpreading Treſſes, as at firſt they made a diſcovery of, ſo at laſt they ſerved for a veil to the modeſt lovely bluſhes of the fair <hi>Incognita;</hi> for ſhe it was and none other. But Oh! the inexpreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, inconceivable joy and amazement of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relian!</hi> As ſoon as he durſt venture to think, he concluded it to be all Viſion, and never doubted ſo much of any thing in his Life as of his being then awake.

I need not tell you how you ſaved my Life and my Honour, by revenging me with the Death of my Perfidious Guide. This is the ſumm of my preſent Condition, bating the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions I am in of being taken by ſome of my Relations, and forced to a thing ſo quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to my Inclinations.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aurelian</hi> was confounded at the Relation ſhe had made, and began to fear his own Eſtate to be more deſperate than ever he had imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. He made her a very Paſſionate and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquent Speech in behalf of himſelf (much better than I intend to inſert here) and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed a mighty concern that ſhe ſhould look upon his ardent Affection to be only Rallery or Gallantry. He was very free of his Oaths to confirm the Truth of what he pretended,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:0110402300:78"/>
nor I believe did ſhe doubt it, or at leaſt was unwilling ſo to do: For I would Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the Reader by the bye, not to believe every word which ſhe told him, nor that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable ſorrow which ſhe counterfeited to be accurately true. It was indeed Truth ſo cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly intermingled with Fiction, that it required no leſs Wit and Preſence of Mind than ſhe was endowed with ſo to acquit her ſelf on the ſuddain. She had entruſted her ſelf indeed with a Fellow who proved a Villain, to conduct her to a Monaſtry; but one which was in the Town, and where ſhe intended only to lie concealed for his ſake, as the Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſhall underſtand ere long: For we have another Diſcovery to make to him, if he have not found it out of himſelf already.</p>
            <p>After <hi>Aurelian</hi> had ſaid what he was able up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Subject in hand, with a mournful tone and dejected look, he demanded his Doom. She asked him if he would endeavour to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey her to the Monaſtry ſhe had told him of? <q rend="inline margSglQuotes">'Your commands, Madam, (replied he) are Sacred to me; and were they to lay down my Life I would obey them.</q> With that he would have gone out of the Room, to have given order for his Horſes to be got ready immediately; but with a Countenance ſo full of ſorrow as moved Compaſſion in the tender hearted <hi>Incognita.</hi> 
               <q rend="inline margSglQuotes">'Stay a little <hi>Don Hippolito</hi> (ſaid ſhe) I fear I ſhall not be able to undergo the Fatigue of a Journey this Night.—Stay and give me your advice how I

               <hi>Aurelian</hi> could have ſatisfied her ſhe was not then in a place to avoid Diſcovery: But he muſt alſo have told her then the reaſon of it, <hi>viz.</hi> whom he was, and who were in queſt of him, which he did not think convenient to declare till neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſhould urge him; for he feared leaſt her knowledge of thoſe deſigns which were in agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation between him and <hi>Juliana,</hi> might deter her more from giving her Conſent.

            <p>A World of other Arguments he uſed, which ſhe contradicted as long as ſhe was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, or at leaſt willing. At laſt ſhe told him, ſhe would conſult her Pillow, and in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conclude what was fit to be done. He thought it convenient to leave her to her reſt, and having lock'd her up in his Room, went himſelf to repoſe upon a Pallat by Signior <hi>Claudio.</hi>

In the mean time, it may be convenient to enquire what became of <hi>Hippolito.</hi> He wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred much in purſuit of <hi>Aurelian,</hi> though <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nora</hi> equally took up his Thoughts; He was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting upon the oddneſs and extravagance of his Circumſtances, the Continuation of which had doubtleſs created in him a great unea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, when it was interrupted with the noiſe of opening the Gates of the Convent of St. <hi>Lawrence,</hi> whither he was arrived ſooner than he thought for, being the place <hi>Aurelian</hi> had appointed by the Lacquey to meet him in. He wondred to ſee the Gates opened at ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonable an hour, and went to enquire the reaſon of it from them who were employ'd; but they proved to be Novices, and made him ſigns to go in, where he might meet with ſome body allow'd to anſwer him. He found the Religious Men all up, and Tapers lighting every where: At laſt he follow'd a Friar who was going into the Garden, and asking him the cauſe of theſe Preparations, he was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd, That they were entreated to pray for the Soul of a Cavalier, who was juſt departing or departed this Life, and whom upon farther talk with him, he found to be the ſame <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renzo</hi> ſo often mentioned. <hi>Don Mario,</hi> it ſeems, Uncle to <hi>Lorenzo,</hi> and Father to <hi>Leonora,</hi> had a private Door out of the Garden belonging to his Houſe into that of the Convent, which Door this Father was now a going to open, that he and his Family might come and offer up their Oraiſons for the Soul of their Kinſman.
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:0110402300:81"/>
               <hi>Hippolito</hi> having informed himſelf of as much as he could ask without ſuſpicion, took his leave of the Friar, not a little joyful at the Hopes he had by ſuch unexpected Means, of ſeeing his Beautiful <hi>Leonora:</hi> As ſoon as he was got at convenient diſtance from the Friar, (who 'tis like thought he had returned into the Convent to his Devotion) he turned back through a cloſe Walk which led him with a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Compaſs, to the ſame private Door, where juſt before he had left the Friar, who now he ſaw was gone, and the Door open.</p>
            <p>He went into <hi>Don Mario</hi>'s Garden, and walk'd round with much Caution and Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection; for the Moon was then about to riſe, and had already diffuſed a glimmering Light, ſufficient to diſtinguiſh a Man from a Tree. By Computation now (which is a very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Circumſtance) <hi>Hippolito</hi> entred this Garden near upon the ſame Inſtant, when <hi>Aurelian</hi> wandred into the Old Monaſtry and found his <hi>Incognita</hi> in Diſtreſs. He was pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty well acquainted with the Platform, and Sight of the Garden; for he had formerly ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed the Outſide, and knew what part to make to if he ſhould be ſurpriz'd and driven to a precipitate Eſcape. He took his Stand behind a well grown Buſh of Myrtle, which, ſhould the Moon ſhine brighter than was required, had the Advantage to be ſhaded by the Indulgent Boughs, of an ancient Bay-Tree. He was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted with the Choice he had made, or he found a Hallow in the Myrtle, as if purpoſely
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:0110402300:82"/>
contriv'd for the Reception of one Perſon, who might undiſcovered perceive all about him. He looked upon it as a good Omen, that the Tree Conſecrated to <hi>Venus</hi> was ſo propitious to him in his Amorous Diſtreſs. The Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of that, together with the Obligation he lay under to the Muſes, for ſheltering him alſo with ſo large a Crown of Bays, had like to have ſet him a Rhyming.</p>
            <p>He was, to tell the Truth, naturally ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted to <hi>Madrigal,</hi> and we ſhould undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly have had a ſmall deſert of Numbers to have pick'd and Criticiz'd upon, had he not been interrupted juſt upon his Delivery; nay, after the Preliminary Sigh had made Way for his Utterance. But ſo was his Fortune, <hi>Don Mario</hi> was coming towards the Door at that very nick of Time, where he met with a Prieſt juſt out of Breath, who told him that <hi>Lorenzo</hi> was juſt breathing his laſt, and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to know if he would come and take his final Leave before they were to adminiſter the Extream Unction. <hi>Don Mario,</hi> who had been at ſome Difference with his Nephew, now thought it his Duty to be reconciled to him; ſo calling to <hi>Leonora,</hi> who was coming after him, he bid her go to her Devotions in the Chappel, and told her where he was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>He went on with the Prieſt, while <hi>Hippolito</hi> ſaw <hi>Leonora</hi> come forward, only accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by her Woman. She was in an undreſs, and by reaſon of a Melancholy viſible in her
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:0110402300:83"/>
Face, more Careleſs than uſual in her At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, which he thought added as much as was poſſible to the abundance of her Charms. He had not much Time to Contemplate this Beauteous Viſion, for ſhe ſoon paſſed into the Garden of the Convent, leaving him Confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Love, Admiration, Joy, Hope, Fear, and all the Train of Paſſions, which ſeize up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Men in his Condition, all at once. He was ſo teazed with this Variety of Torment, that he never miſſed the Two Hours tha thad ſlipped away during his Automachy and Inteſtine Conflict. <hi>Leonora</hi>'s Return ſettled his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, at leaſt united them, and he had now no other Thought but how he ſhould preſent him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf before her. When ſhe calling her Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, bid her bolt the Garden Door on the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, that ſhe might not be Surpriz'd by her Father, if he returned through the Convent; which done, ſhe ordered her to bring down her Lute, and leave her to her ſelf in the Garden.</p>
            <p>All this <hi>Hippolito</hi> ſaw and heard to his inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſible Content, yet had he much to do to ſmother his Joy, and hinder it from taking a Vent, which would have ruined the only Opportunity of his Life. <hi>Leonora</hi> withdrew into an Arbour ſo near him, that he could diſtinctly hear her if ſhe Played or Sung: Having tuned her Lute, with a Voice ſoft as the Breath of Angels, ſhe ſung to it this fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Air:</p>

Here <hi>Hippolito</hi> made uſe of his Rhetorick, and it prov'd prevailing: 'Twere tedious to tell the many ingenious Arguments he uſed, with all her Nice Diſtinctions and Objections. In ſhort, he convinced her of his Paſſion, repreſented to her the neceſſity they were under, of being ſpeedy in their Reſolves: That his Father (for ſtill he was <hi>Aurelian</hi>) would undoubtedly find him in the Morning, and then it would be too late to Repent. She on the other Hand, knew it was in vain to deny a Paſſion, which he had heard her ſo frankly own; (and no doubt was very glad it was paſt and done;) beſides apprehending the Danger of delay, and having ſome little Jealouſies and Fears of what Effect might be produced between the Commands of his Father and the Beauties of <hi>Juliana;</hi> after ſome decent Denials, ſhe conſented to be Conducted by him through the Garden into the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, where ſhe would prevail with her Confeſſor to Marry them.

            <p>
               <hi>Hippolito</hi> was in ſuch Concern he could not ſpeak, but was buſily employed in rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing and chafing her Temples; when ſhe opening her Eyes laid hold of his Arm, and cry'd out—<hi>Oh my</hi> Aurelian—<hi>how unhappy have you made me!</hi> With that ſhe had again like to have fainted away, but he ſhook her in his Arms, and begg'd <hi>Don Mario</hi> to have ſome pity on his Daughter, ſince by his Severity ſhe was reduced to that
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:0110402300:90"/>
Condition. The Old Man hearing his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter name <hi>Aurelian,</hi> was a little revived, and began to hope Things were in a pretty good Condition, he was perſwaded to comfort her; and having brought her wholly to her ſelf, was content to hear her Excuſe, and in a little time was ſo far wrought upon as to beg <hi>Hippolito</hi>'s Pardon for the Ill Opinion he had conceived of him, and not long after gave his Conſent.</p>
            <p>The Night was ſpent in this Conflict, and it was now clear Day, when <hi>Don Mario</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducting his new Son and Daughter through the Garden, was met by ſome Servants of the Marqueſs of <hi>Viterbo,</hi> who had been enquiring for <hi>Donna Leonora,</hi> to know if <hi>Juliana</hi> had lately been with her; for that ſhe was miſſing from her Father's Houſe, and no conjectures could be made of what might become of her. <hi>Don Mario</hi> and <hi>Leonora</hi> were ſurprized at the News, for he knew well enough of the Match that was deſign'd for <hi>Juliana;</hi> and having enquired where the Marqueſs was, it was told him, That he was gone with <hi>Don Fabio</hi> and <hi>Fabritio</hi> towards <hi>Aurelian</hi>'s Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. <hi>Don Mario</hi> having aſſured the Servants that <hi>Juliana</hi> had not been there, diſmiſſed them, and adviſed with his Son and Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter how they ſhould undeceive the Marqueſs and <hi>Don Fabio</hi> in their Expectations of <hi>Aure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian. Hippolito</hi> could oftentimes ſcarce for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear ſmiling at the old Man's Contrivances who was moſt deceiv'd himſelf; he at length

adviſed them to go all down together to his Lodging, where he could preſent himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Father, and ingenuouſly confeſs to him the truth, and he did not queſtion his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving of his Choice.</p>
            <p>This was agreed to, and the Coach made ready. While they were upon their way, <hi>Hippolito</hi> pray'd heartily that his Friend <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relian</hi> might be at the Lodging, to ſatisfie <hi>Don Mario</hi> and <hi>Leonora</hi> of his Circumſtances and Quality, when he ſhould be obliged to diſcover himſelf. His Petitions were granted; for <hi>Don Fabio</hi> had beſet the Houſe long before his Son was up, or <hi>Incognita</hi> awake.</p>
            <p>Upon the Arrival of <hi>Don Mario</hi> and <hi>Hippoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,</hi> they heard a great Noiſe and Hubbub above Stairs, which <hi>Don Mario</hi> concluded was occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned by their not finding <hi>Aurelian,</hi> whom he thought he could give the beſt account of: So that it was not in <hi>Hippolito</hi>'s power to diſſwade him from going up before to prepare his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to receive and forgive him. While <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polito</hi> and <hi>Leonora</hi> were left in the Coach at the Door, he made himſelf known to her, and begg'd her pardon a thouſand times for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing the Deceit. She was under ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern at firſt to find ſhe was ſtill miſtaken; but his Behaviour, and the Reaſons he gave, ſoon reconciled him to her; his Perſon was altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as agreeable, his Eſtate and Quality not at all inferior to <hi>Aurelian</hi>'s; in the mean time, the true <hi>Aurelian</hi> who had ſeen his Father, begg'd leave of him to withdraw for a moment;
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:0110402300:92"/>
in which time he went into the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber where his <hi>Incognita</hi> was dreſſing her ſelf, by his deſign, in Woman's Apparel, while he was conſulting with her how they ſhould break the matter to his Father; it happened that <hi>Don Mario</hi> came up Stairs where the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs and <hi>Don Fabio</hi> were; they undoubtedly concluded him Mad, to hear him making Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logies and Excuſes for <hi>Aurelian,</hi> whom he told them if they would promiſe to forgive, he would preſent before them immediately. The Marqueſs asked him if his Daughter had lain with <hi>Leonora</hi> that Night; he anſwered him with another queſtion in behalf of <hi>Aurelian.</hi> In ſhort, they could not underſtand one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but each thought 'tother beſide himſelf, <hi>Don Mario</hi> was ſo concern'd that they would not believe him, that he ran down Stairs and came to the Door out of Breath, deſiring <hi>Hippolito</hi> that he would come into the Houſe quickly, for that he could not perſwade his Father but that he had already ſeen and ſpoke to him. <hi>Hippolito</hi> by that underſtood that <hi>Aurelian</hi> was in the Houſe; ſo taking <hi>Leonora</hi> by the Hand, he followed <hi>Don Mario,</hi> who led him up into the Dining-Room, where they found <hi>Aurelian</hi> upon his Knees, begging his Father to forgive him, that he could not agree to the Choice he had made for him, ſince he had already diſpoſed of himſelf, and that before he underſtood the deſigns he had for him, which was the reaſon that he had hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto concealed himſelf. <hi>Don Fabio</hi> knew not
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:0110402300:93"/>
how to anſwer him, but look'd upon the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs, and the Marqueſs upon him, as if the Cement had been cool'd which was to have united their Families.</p>
            <p>All was ſilent, and <hi>Don Mario</hi> for his part took it to be all Conjuration; he was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forward to preſent <hi>Hippolito</hi> to them, when <hi>Aurelian</hi> ſpying his Friend, ſtarted from his Knees and ran to embrace him—My dear <hi>Hippolito</hi> (ſaid he) what happy chance has brought you hither, juſt at my Neceſſity? <hi>Hippolito</hi> pointed to <hi>Don Mario</hi> and <hi>Leonora,</hi> and told him upon what terms he came. <hi>Don Mario</hi> was ready to run mad, hearing him called <hi>Hippolito,</hi> and went again to examine his Daughter. While ſhe was informing him of the truth, the Marqueſs's Servants returned with the melancholy News that his Daughter was no where to be found. While the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs and <hi>Don Fabritio</hi> were wondering at, and lamenting the Misfortune of her loſs, <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polito</hi> came towards <hi>Don Fabio,</hi> and interceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for his Son, ſince the Lady perhaps had withdrawn her ſelf out of an Averſion to the Match. <hi>Don Fabio,</hi> though very much incens'd, yet forgot not the Reſpect due to <hi>Hippolito</hi>'s Quality; and by his perſwaſion ſpoke to <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relian,</hi> though with a ſtern Look and Angry Voice, and asked him where he had diſpoſed the cauſe of his Diſobedience, if he were worthy to ſee her or no? <hi>Aurelian</hi> made An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, That he deſired no more than for him to ſee her; and he did not doubt a Conſequence
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:0110402300:94"/>
of his Approbation and Forgiveneſs—Well (ſaid <hi>Don Fabio</hi>) you are very conceited of your own Diſcretion, let us ſee this Rari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. While <hi>Aurelian</hi> was gone in for <hi>Incogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi> the Marqueſs of <hi>Viterbo</hi> and <hi>Don Fabritio</hi> were taking their leaves in great diſorder for their loſs and diſappointment; but <hi>Don Fabio</hi> entreated their ſtay a moment longer till the return of his Son. <hi>Aurelian</hi> led <hi>Incognita</hi> into the Room veil'd, who ſeeing ſome Company there which he had not told her of, would have gone back again. But <hi>Don Fabio</hi> came bluntly forwards, and ere ſhe was aware, lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted up her Veil and beheld the Fair <hi>Incognita,</hi> differing nothing from <hi>Juliana,</hi> but in her Name. This diſcovery was ſo extreamly ſurprizing and welcome, that either Joy or A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement had tied up the Tongues of the whole Company. <hi>Aurelian</hi> here was moſt at a loſs, for he knew not of his Happineſs; and that which all along prevented <hi>Juliana</hi>'s con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing her ſelf to him, was her knowing <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polito</hi> (for whom ſhe took him) to be <hi>Aure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi>'s Friend, and ſhe feared if he had known her, that he would never have conſented to have depriv'd him of her. <hi>Juliana</hi> was the firſt that ſpoke, falling upon her Knees to her Father, who was not enough himſelf to take her up. <hi>Don Fabio</hi> ran to her, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken'd the Marqueſs, who then embraced her, but could not yet ſpeak. <hi>Fabritio</hi> and <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onora</hi> ſtrove who ſhould firſt take her in their Arms; for <hi>Aurelian</hi> he was out of his Wits
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:0110402300:95"/>
for Joy, and <hi>Juliana</hi> was not much behind him, to ſee how happily their Loves and Duties were Reconcil'd. <hi>Don Fabio</hi> embraced his Son and forgave him. The Marqueſs and <hi>Fabri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio</hi> gave <hi>Juliana</hi> into his Hands, he received the Bleſſing upon his Knees; all were over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd, and <hi>Don Mario</hi> not a little proud at the diſcovery of his Son-in-Law, whom <hi>Aurelian</hi> did not fail to ſet forth with all the ardent Zeal and Eloquence of Friendſhip. <hi>Juliana</hi> and <hi>Leonora</hi> had pleaſant Diſcourſe about their unknown and miſtaken Rivalſhip, and it was the Subject of a great deal of Mirth to hear <hi>Juliana</hi> relate the ſeveral Contrivances which ſhe had to avoid <hi>Aurelian</hi> for the ſake of <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polito.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having diverted themſelves with many Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks upon the pleaſing ſurprize, they all thought it proper to attend upon the Great Duke that Morning at the Palace, and to acquaint him with the Novelty of what had paſs'd; while, by the way, the two Young Couple entertained the Company with the Relation of ſeveral Particulars of their Three Days Adventures.</p>
