            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>YOU deſired me to ſend you the Life of the Lady <hi>Jane Gray.</hi> I do aſſure you, my Friend, (and hope to be believ'd) that I ſpent a whole Day in the ſearch, and to as little purpoſe, as he that carry'd a lighted Torch at Noon-day, to look for an honeſt Man. But however, you ſhan't altogether loſe your Longing: For you may, if you pleaſe, read this following Account, Collected out of the beſt, and moſt exacteſt, Hiſtorians.</p>
            <p>THis Incomparable Lady was Eldeſt Daughter to <hi>Henry</hi> Lord <hi>Grey,</hi> Duke of <hi>Suffolk.</hi> She was born in the Year 1534. She was Endow'd with all the Graces both of Mind and Body. She gave in her earlieſt Infancy, many Proofs of her growing Piety, and her Veneration for Holy Writ. For once being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting herſelf with her Companions, one had an occaſion to have ſomething that was above her reach, and taking a large Bible to tread on to get it; the young Lady ſeeing her, wou'd not ſuffer her, and expreſt her Reſentment: She was ſo taken with it, that ſhe broke off their ſport, and retir'd to her Cloſet, more than ordinary Melancholly.</p>
            <p>She was a Lady indeed that ſeem'd cut out by Heaven for Greatneſs. As She was a Beautiful and a Graceful Perſon, ſo
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0100302500:3"/>
ſhe was Endow'd with all thoſe Virtues that are eſteem'd by Heaven, and all good Men, as is expreſs'd in the Tragedy of her, by the Poet.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Candour with Goodneſs, Fortitude with Sweetneſs,</l>
               <l>Strict Piety, and love of Truth, with Learning,</l>
               <l>More than the Schools of <hi>Athens</hi> ever knew,</l>
               <l>Or her own <hi>Plato</hi> taught—</l>
            </q>
            <p>When ſhe came to years of more ſolid Underſtanding, Dr. <hi>Elmer</hi> (afterwards Biſhop of <hi>London)</hi> was her Tutor: And from him ſhe learn'd Latin and Greek, to a Perfection, and wou'd Diſcourſe in thoſe Language upon any Subject, and wou'd give her Sentiments to Admiration. Nay, ſhe delighted in ſuch Conferences: For when others of her Sex and Age were taking their Diverſion abroad, ſhe employ'd her time in Reading. The Lady <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Tutor <hi>(Roger Aſcham)</hi> coming once to wait on her at her Father's Houſe in the Country; was ſurpriz'd to find her alone reading of <hi>Plato</hi>'s Works in Greek, while the reſt of the Family were diverting themſelves with Hunting, (in her Father's Park) and other Rural Diverſions. He ask'd her how ſhe could loſe the ſhare of ſuch Diverſion: She anſwer'd, Thoſe were but faint Shadows of what ſhe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd in Contemplation there—<hi>[pointing to</hi> Plato's Phoedon <hi>that lay before her]</hi> And added ſhe, I eſteem it one of the greateſt Bleſſings of my Life, that I have had ſevere Parents, and a Milder Maſter, which have made me delight with thoſe Companions, which were not like Mankind; for when I find my ſelf weary, I can lay by their Company without commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Solieciſm againſt good Manners.</p>
            <p>The young King was ever fond of her Company, and as their Ages were much the ſame, ſo was their Fancies and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires. As the Poet has it.</p>
            <q>
               <l>From their firſt early Days of Infant Life,</l>
               <l>A gentle Band of Friendſhip grew betwixt 'em;</l>
               <l>As Brother, and as Siſter, bred together,</l>
               <l>Beneath one Common Parents Care they liv'd.</l>
               <l>In every Innocent Delight they ſhar'd,</l>
               <l>They Sung, and Danc'd, and Sat, and Walk'd together:</l>
               <l>She left the ſhining Courts to ſhare his Toil,</l>
               <l>To turn with him the Grave Hiſtorian's Page,</l>
               <l>And taſte the Rapture of the Poets Song.</l>
            </q>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:0100302500:4"/>
She was well read in Sacred, as well as Prophane Hiſtory, and had attain'd to a large Knowledge in Divinity: And at the Age when others were but taſting the Notions of Philoſophy, ſhe had Capacity enough to make a full Feaſt. And with all theſe Advantages of Birth and Parts, ſhe was ſo Humble, ſo Meek, and Pious, that all People both Admir'd and Lov'd her. She had a Mind wonderfully rais'd above the World, and the Pleaſures of it ſhe call'd Vanities.</p>
            <p>Lord <hi>Guilford,</hi> Son to the Aſpiring Duke of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> by his Father's Politick means, was Marry'd to her on the Third of <hi>June</hi> 1553, and as well as I can make out in the Twentieth Year of her Age. She expreſt all the ſorrow imaginable at the King's Death, and in his Sickneſs gave him moſt conſtant Attendance, which is finely expreſt in the Poets Lines by <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland</hi> on the occaſion.</p>
            <q>
               <l>All deſolate, and drown'd in flowing Tears,</l>
               <l>By <hi>Edward</hi>'s Bed, the Pious Princes ſits;</l>
               <l>Faſt from her lifted Eyes, the pearly Drops</l>
               <l>Fall trickling o'er her Cheek, while ſtrong Devotion,</l>
               <l>And fervent Zeal pour forth her lab'ring Soul,</l>
               <l>And every ſigh is wing'd with Prayers ſo potent,</l>
               <l>As ſtrive with Heaven to ſave her dying Lord.</l>
            </q>
            <p>When her Father, the Duke of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> with the reſt of the Privy Council, came to attend, and hail her Queen, ſhe expreſt a great deal of Reluctancy, and was rather forc'd to take it, out of an Obedience to her Parents, than any deſire of her own. She ſaid the Crown, by Right of Inheritance, was to deſcend to the Siſters of the late King, and that ſhe was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to burden her Conſcience to enrich herſelf with the ſpoils of others. At laſt, for the Safety of the People, and the Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining and Preſerving the Reformation, ſhe was won upon to accept the Crown. The Author of the Tragedy of Lady <hi>Jane,</hi> has expreſt her unwillingneſs in this manner.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Take me, Crown me;</l>
               <l>Inveſt me with this Royal Wretchedneſs:</l>
               <l>Let me not know one happy Minute more,</l>
               <l>Let all my ſleepleſs Nights be ſpent in Care,</l>
               <l>My Days be vex'd with Tumults and Alarms,</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:0100302500:5"/>
If only I can ſave you; if my Fate</l>
               <l>Has mark'd me out to be the Publick Victim,</l>
               <l>I take the Lot with Joy.—Yes, I will Die</l>
               <l>For that Eternal Truth my Faith is fix'd on,</l>
               <l>And that dear Native Land which gave me Birth.</l>
               <l>All that I ask, is, tho' my Fortune frown,</l>
               <l>And bury me beneath this Fatal Crown;</l>
               <l>Let this one good be added to my Doom,</l>
               <l>To ſave this Land from Tyranny and <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </l>
            </q>
            <p>She was neither lifted up when ſhe wore the Crown, nor caſt down, when her Palace became her Priſon, but carry'd herſelf in an even Temper of Mind in thoſe great inequali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Fortune, that ſo ſuddenly exalted, and depreſs'd her. All the Paſſion ſhe expreſt was, that her Father, Mother, and Huſband were involv'd in her ill Fortune. When ſhe had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice that her Sentence of Death was paſt, ſhe did not expreſs the leaſt concern, but bore it with a Conſtancy of Mind be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond thought. The Queen ſent Dr. <hi>Fecknam</hi> Three Days before to prepare her for Death: He had a long Converſation with her, and anſwer'd to all his Queſtions, with that calmneſs of Mind, and clearneſs of Reaſon, that it was a Wonder to hear, how ſo Young a Perſon of her Sex, cou'd look on Death ſo nigh her with ſo little concern. She ſent a Letter to her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to mitigate his Sorrow for her Unhappy End. She re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced at aproaching Death, and thought the nigher it appear'd it look'd leſs dreadful. She expreſt a great deal of tenderneſs, when ſhe ſaw her Huſband led out firſt to Execution: He had deſir'd to take leave of her before he dy'd, but ſhe declin'd it, ſince (ſhe ſaid) it wou'd rather be an Addition to her Grief: And ſhe hop'd to meet ſhortly, and be united in a much happier State. She ſaw her Huſband's Headleſs Trunk carry'd by her without any outward concern, or Woman's Wailings, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſol'd herſelf in knowing ſhe ſhou'd ſoon follow him. When ſhe was brought to the Scaffold (which for fear of the People was built within the Tower) ſhe confeſt ſhe had Sin'd in taking the Crown when it was proffer'd her, but ſhe took it to a good end. She declar'd ſhe dy d a true Chriſtian in the reform'd Faith, but hoped to be ſav'd only, thro the Merits and Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings of her Bleſſed Lord and and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt. Then having deſir'd the Peoples Prayers, ſhe repeated the 51ſt <hi>Pſam,</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:0100302500:6"/>
when after ſome private Devotion, ſhe undreſs'd herſelf, put her Hankerchief herſelf upon her Eyes, then laying her Head upon the fatal Block, ſhe reſign'd her Breath to him who gave it her.</p>
            <p>Thus fell this Great, this Good, and Pious Lady, which ſeem'd by Virtue to be form'd for Greatneſs, which may be as an Example to the World of the Mutability of Fortune: And I think our Poet has been very exact in his Characters in fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the truth of Hiſtory. Nothing can Deſcribe the Haughty Ambitious <hi>Northumberland</hi> better than himſelf, in the following Lines, where he ſeems to have laid the Scheme of his deſigns even before the King's Death.</p>
            <q>
               <l>She muſt be here, and lodg'd in <hi>Guilford</hi>'s Arms</l>
               <l>E're <hi>Edward</hi> Dyes, or all we have done is Marr'd,</l>
               <l>Ha! <hi>Pembroke!</hi> that's a Bar that thwarts my way;</l>
               <l>His fiery Temper brooks not oppoſition,</l>
               <l>And muſt be met with ſoft and ſubtile Arts,</l>
               <l>With crouching Courteſie and Hony'd Words,</l>
               <l>Such as Aſſwage the fierce and bend the Strong.</l>
            </q>
            <p>See <hi>Baker</hi>'s Chronicle, in giving an account of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> Marching with his Troops out of <hi>London.</hi> The 14th of <hi>July</hi> he March'd thro' <hi>Shoreditch</hi> with 2000 Horſe and 6000 Foot, and tho' there were many Spectators in the Streets as he paſs'd, none wiſh'd him Succeſs. Now judge how high the Poet comes, where he makes <hi>Pembroke</hi> a Spectator.</p>
            <q>
               <l>I ſaw him Marching at his Army's Head,</l>
               <l>I mark'd him Iſſuing thro' the City Gates;</l>
               <l>And (for he wore his Beaver up) cou'd read</l>
               <l>Upon his Viſage Horror and Diſmay.</l>
               <l>No Voice of friendly Salutation cheer'd him,</l>
               <l>None wiſh'd his Arms might thrive, or bad Heaven ſpeed him:</l>
               <l>But thro' a Staring ghaſtly looking Croud,</l>
               <l>Unhail'd, Unbleſt, with heavy Heart he went.</l>
            </q>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Northumberland</hi> went back to <hi>Cambridge</hi> to wait for more Succours from <hi>London;</hi> but hearing how Matters were carry'd, he diſmiſt his Troops, and went to the Market-place, only Accompanied with the Mayor, and himſelf, for want of a Herald, flung up his Cap (for Joy) and cry'd, God Save Queen
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0100302500:7"/>
               <hi>Mary.</hi> But the Earl of <hi>Arundel</hi> came with orders from the Queen to apprehend him, as one guilty of Treaſon, and brought him from <hi>Cambridge</hi> to the Tower on the 25th of <hi>July,</hi> and on the 22d of <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1553 was Beheaded. This paſſage is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd by the Duke of <hi>Suffolk</hi> to his Daughter the Lady <hi>Jane.</hi>
