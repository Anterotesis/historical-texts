            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

we aim at nothing leſs than Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
we deſerve them or not: That this
is my Deſign in <hi>Dedications,</hi> is ſo
apparent, that it's to no Purpoſe to
deny or diſſemble it.</p>
            <p>Wherefore elſe have I made
Choice of ſome of our Learned and
Wealthy <hi>Biſhops</hi> for the Patrons of
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:1207700500:3"/>
theſe <hi>Diſcourſes,</hi> which I foreſaw
would be grateful to their nice and
critical Palates? Wherefore elſe
have I been ſo profuſe of ſuch Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliments
on their <hi>Lordſhips,</hi> as I
was ſure, they would take great
Pleaſure in? Wherefore elſe, <hi>My
Lord,</hi> do I inſcribe <hi>this</hi> to your
<hi>Right Reverend</hi> Name, but that I
expect your Approbation of it, and</p>
            <p>Some, who are envious, <hi>My Lord,</hi>
of my good Fortune in <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons,
will not believe that I have
receiv'd ſo much as one <hi>Purſe</hi> of
<hi>Gold</hi> for any of my <hi>Dedications</hi>; but
I would have ſuch Malignants to
know, that the leſs I have receiv'd,
the more there is behind: And I
can moreover aſſure them, that
their <hi>Lordſhips</hi> have it in their Heads
and their Hearts too, highly to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
me in the World; and if their
Endeavours for my Promotion fail
not, I ſhall be a very <hi>Great</hi> Man.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="v" facs="tcp:1207700500:4"/>
Such primitive Doctrine, <hi>My
Lord,</hi> as I have reviv'd, muſt, in the
Judgment of our <hi>Biſhops,</hi> be deſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of their diſtinguiſh'd Favours:
And if they ſhould Deſign for me
ſuch a <hi>myſtical</hi> Crown of Glory, as
the <hi>Gentile Prieſts</hi> help'd ſome of
the Fathers of the Church to; I
profeſs without Diſſimulation, that,
for all my Love to <hi>Myſteries,</hi> it will
be more than I am ambitious of:
But if the Honour is forc'd on me,
it will be my Duty to their <hi>Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips,</hi>
to ſound an <hi>allegorical</hi> Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet
of their Fame, that their
Names, which might otherwiſe be
ſoon forgotten, may be everlaſting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
remember'd for their Love and
Good-will towards me.</p>
            <p>But the chief Foundation, <hi>My
Lord,</hi> of my Merits lies, they ſay,
in my Treatment of the Miracles
of our Saviour, after the Manner
you handled a Scripture-Prophecy,
of a <hi>Man's kicking a Serpent on the
Pate, for biting him by the Heels</hi>:
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:1207700500:5"/>
And if your <hi>Lordſhip</hi> got a <hi>Welſh-Biſhoprick</hi>
upon it, what may not I
expect for my more meritorious
Works of the ſame kind? The
Great <hi>Mr. Scheme</hi> has celebrated
your Praiſe for that Effort of your
Wit: And I muſt needs ſay, to your
<hi>Lordſhip</hi>'s Applauſe, that were not
your Thoughts unhappily ſhackled
with Intereſt and Subſcriptions, (an
Unhappineſs you ſadly lament!)
you would endeavour to make as
pleaſant Work with the <hi>Letter</hi> of
the <hi>Old,</hi> as I can do with that of
the <hi>New</hi> Teſtament.</p>
            <p>I have not here Room, <hi>My Lord,</hi>
for a ſufficient and deſerv'd <hi>Enco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mium</hi>
on your <hi>Uſe and Intent of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy</hi>;
therefore muſt be content to
ſay of it, in ſhort, that it is a moſt
curious Piece of, what the Fathers
call, <hi>Engaſtromuthiſm</hi>; or ſuch a
ſingular Specimen of a Webb, ſpun
out of a Man's own Bowels, as one
of fewer Brains in his Head can
hardly equal.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="vii" facs="tcp:1207700500:6"/>
It was wiſely done of your <hi>Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip</hi>
to caution your Readers againſt
taking your <hi>Book</hi> for an Anſwer to
Mr. <hi>Grounds</hi>; otherwiſe it had not
been impoſſible, but ſome others as
well as the <hi>Worſhipful Benchers</hi> of
the <hi>Temple</hi> might have miſtaken
the <hi>Uſe</hi> and <hi>Intent</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>After I had gone thro' your <hi>beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully-printed</hi>
Work, I wiſh'd, <hi>My
Lord,</hi> for another <hi>Decoration</hi> of it,
that ſome Annotations out of the
Fathers had been ſubjoin'd to it.
How would your Notions then and
Theirs about Prophecy have ſtood
as a <hi>Foil</hi> to each other! How
ſhould I then have admired the
Difference between a <hi>Rich</hi> Biſhop
and a <hi>Poor</hi> Father as to Wit and

And becauſe ſome of our <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy</hi>

Treatment of the <hi>Letter</hi> of ſome foregoing

            <p>Whether <hi>Jeſus</hi> rais'd any more from the

               </note> the Reaſon

no more than theſe <hi>three</hi> Miracles of this
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:1207700500:10"/>
Kind are recorded by the <hi>Evangeliſts.</hi> But
ſince our <hi>Divines</hi> are averſe to Myſteries on
Miracles, I would gladly know their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
whether <hi>Jeſus</hi> rais'd any others from
the dead, or not: I have made ſome ſearch
into modern Writers for their Opinion in
this Caſe, but can't find it: And unleſs
I knew their Opinion, it would be loſt
Labour to argue againſt either Side of the
Queſtion, and much more againſt both
Sides of it: But I can aſſure our <hi>Divines,</hi>
that, which Side of the Queſtion ſoever
they ſhould hold, the Conſequence upon
the Argument would be neither better nor
worſe, than that they muſt of neceſſity
eſpouſe the myſtical and allegorical Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation
of theſe Miracles, or grant that
<hi>Jeſus</hi> literally rais'd none from the dead
at all.</p>
            <p>But waving that ſort of Argument for
the preſent againſt the <hi>Letter</hi>; theſe three
Miracles are reputed the greateſt that <hi>Jeſus</hi>
wrought: And I believe, it will be
granted on all hands, that the reſtoring a
Perſon, indiſputably dead, to Life again,
is a ſtupendous Miracle; and that two or
three ſuch Miracles well circumſtanced,
and credibly reported, are enough to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliate
the Belief of Mankind, that the
Author of them was a divine Agent, and
inveſted with the Power of God, or he
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:1207700500:11"/>
could not do them. But God knows, (and
for the ſake of the Myſtery, I am not
ſorry to ſay it) this is far from being the
Caſe of theſe three Miracles before us, or
of any one them.</p>
            <p>That theſe three Miracles are not equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
great, but differ in Degree, is viſible
enough to any one, that but curſorily reads,
and compares theirs Stories one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

               </note> greateſt Miracle, that
<hi>Jeſus</hi> is ſuppos'd to have wrought, is that
of <hi>Lazarus</hi>'s Reſurrection; which, in
Truth, was a moſt prodigious Miracle, if
his Corps was putrified and ſtank; or if
there were no juſt Exceptions to be made
to the Credibility of the Story. Next to
that, in magnitude, is <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s raiſing of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:1207700500:12"/>
the Widow's Son, as they were carrying
him to his Burial: And a great Miracle it
was to bring him to Life again; if none be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
or ſince had been miſtaken for dead,
and carried to their Graves alive; or if
no Impoſtor and his Confederates could
frame ſuch a ſeemingly miraculous Scene,
as is that whole Story, to his own Glory.
The leaſt of the three is that of his raiſing
<hi>Jairus</hi>'s Daughter, which in Appearance
is ſo far from a Miracle, that according to
the Story itſelf, ſhe was but aſleep, or by
the Shrieks of By-ſtanders frighted out of
her Senſes for the preſent.</p>
            <p>But however it really might be with
theſe three ſuppoſed dead and revived Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons;
the Caſe of none of them was well
enough circumſtanced to ſerve the Purpoſe
of our <hi>Divines.</hi> I am apt to believe with
the Fathers, that <hi>Jeſus</hi> actually did raiſe
the dead; but then, as theſe Miracles are
only recorded for the ſake of the <hi>Myſtery,</hi>
I affirm that none of them, as to the
<hi>Letter,</hi> will abide the Teſt of a critcal
Examination, nor ſtand its Ground againſt
ſuch Exceptions as may be made to them.
If <hi>Jeſus</hi> was to raiſe any dead Bodies to
Life, for a Teſtimony of his divine Power
and Authority, he would and ſhould have
made Choice of other dead Perſons, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
other Circumſtances of Death; and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:1207700500:13"/>
the Hiſtory of their Reſurrection ſhould
have been more credibly and carefully
tranſmitted to Poſterity, ſo as there ſhould
have been no Room left to make a reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Doubt of the Truth of it. But this,
I ſay, is not the Caſe in the Reſuſcitation
of any of theſe Perſons, as will appear
from the following Remarks and Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations
upon them. And</p>
            <p n="1">1. Obſerve, that the unnatural and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſterous
Order of Time, in which theſe
Miracles are related, juſtly brings them all
under ſuſpicion of Fable and Forgery.
The greateſt of the three is indiſputably
that of <hi>Lazarus</hi>'s Reſurrection; but ſince
this is only mention'd by St. <hi>John,</hi> who
wrote his Goſpel after the other <hi>Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts,</hi>
and above ſixty Years, according to
the beſt Computation, after our Lord's
Aſcenſion; here is too much Room for
Cavil and Queſtion, whether this Story be
not entirely his Invention. What could
be the Reaſon that <hi>Matthew,</hi>
               <hi>Mark,</hi> and
<hi>Luke,</hi> who all wrote their Goſpels before
<hi>John,</hi> and many Years nearer to the
Death of our Saviour, ſhould omit to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
this remarkable and moſt illuſtrious
Miracle of <hi>Lazarus?</hi> They could not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
it, nor be ignorant of it, if the Story
had been really true: and to aſſign any
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:1207700500:14"/>
other Reaſon than Ignorance or Forgetful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
is hard and impoſſible. To aggran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize
the Fame of their Maſter, for a Worker
of Miracles, was the Deſign of all the <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts,</hi>
eſpecially of the three firſt, who
may be preſumed to make a Report of
the greateſt, if not of all, that <hi>Jeſus</hi>
wrought: But that there ſhould come
after them an <hi>Evangeliſt</hi> with an huge and
ſuperlatively great Miracle, and meet with
Credit for it, is againſt all Senſe and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;
neither is there any Story, ſo diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
told, in all Hiſtory, that <hi>Critics</hi> will
admit of the Belief of. The firſt Writer
of the Life of an <hi>Hero,</hi> to be ſure makes
mention of all the grand Occurrences of
it, and leaves no Room for <hi>Biographers</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards,
but to enlarge and paraphraſe
upon what he has written, with ſome
other Circumſtances and Additions of leſs
Moment. If a third or a fourth <hi>Biogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher</hi>
after him ſhall preſume to add a more
illuſtrious Tranſaction of the <hi>Hero</hi>'s Life,
it will be rejected as Fable and Romance,
tho' for no other Reaſon than this, that the
firſt Writer muſt have been appris'd of it,
and would have inſerted its Story, if there
had been any Truth in it. And whether
St. <hi>John</hi>'s Story of <hi>Lazarus</hi>'s Reſurrection,
that Miracle of Miracles, ought not to be
ſubjected to the like Criticiſm upon it,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:1207700500:15"/>
               <hi>Chriſtians</hi> may conſider, and <hi>Infidels</hi> will
judge.</p>
            <p>What then was the Reaſon, I ask again,
that the three firſt <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> neglected to
record this renown'd Miracle of <hi>Lazarus?</hi>
And why too (may I enquire here) did
not <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Mark</hi> mention the Story
of the Widow of <hi>Naim</hi>'s Son, as they
could not but know of it, if true, more
certainly than <hi>Luke,</hi> the Companion of
<hi>Paul,</hi> who alone has made a Report of
it? <hi>Grotius</hi> ſays, <note n="9" place="bottom">Mirum videri poteſt Hiſtoriam hanc tam illuſtrem a Matthae<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

Choice of, the greateſt or the leaſt Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle?
The greateſt, to be ſure, and that
was of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> or of the Widow's Son,
if they knew of either. But inſtead of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of theſe, they tell us the Story of <hi>Jai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi>'s
Daughter, that is <note n="11" place="bottom">Nondum perfecta Mors eſt in Puella. <hi>St. Auguſt.</hi> in Serm. xcviii.</note> an imperfect
and diſputable Miracle, in Compariſon of
the other two, which conſequently they
knew nothing at all of, or they would have

            <p>If <hi>Matthew,</hi> the firſt Writer, had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded

had omitted, then all had been
well; and no Objection had hence lain
againſt the Credit of any of theſe Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
or againſt the Authority of the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſts:</hi>
But this unnatural and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſterous
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:1207700500:17"/>
Order of Time, in which theſe
Miracles are recorded (the greateſt being
poſtponed to the leaſt) adminiſters juſt
Occaſion of ſuſpicion of the Truth and
Credibility of all their Stories. And it is
lucky for Chriſtianity, that <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels</hi>
have not hitherto hit upon the <hi>Abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity</hi>
of this prepoſterous Narration, or
they might have form'd a cogent Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
againſt theſe Miracles thus, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</p>
            <p>"<hi>Jeſus,</hi> it is manifeſt, rais'd not the
dead at all. The only Perſon, that
Chriſtians can reaſonably pretend, he
did raiſe, was <hi>Jairus</hi>'s Daughter, whom
<hi>Matthew</hi> writes of; and ſhe, according
to the Story was only in a Sleep, or an
Extacy, when <hi>Jeſus</hi> revived her. But
the <hi>Galileans,</hi> who were after a Time
call'd <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> finding their Account
in a Reſurrection-Miracle; <hi>Luke,</hi> for
the former Advantage of the Cauſe, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed
another Story of better Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
in the Widow of <hi>Naim</hi>'s Son:
But this not being ſo great a Miracle, as
the Church ſtill wanted; <hi>John,</hi> when
no body was alive to contradict and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtulate
with him for it, trumps up a
long Story of a thumping Miracle, in
<hi>Jeſus</hi>'s raiſing of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> who had
been not only dead, but buried ſo long
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:1207700500:18"/>
that he ſtank again. But to prove the
Story of this Miracle to be falſe and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulous,
we need ſay no more than that
it was laſt recorded. If there had been
any Truth in it, the firſt <hi>Evangeliſt</hi>
would have remember'd us of it.</p>
            <p>"We don't ſuppoſe, that you Chriſtians,
becauſe of your Prejudices, will ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe
to this Account, that we thus
give of the Riſe of theſe Miracles: But
this is certain, that if theſe three Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
had not been reported of <hi>Jeſus,</hi>
but of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> in the ſame diſorder of
Time, by three different Hiſtorians,
you would preſently have ſcented the
Forgery and Impoſture: You would
juſtly have affirm'd that the three Stories
were apparently three Fables and Falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods;
and that the three Hiſtorians
viſibly ſtrove to outſtretch each other:
That the <hi>firſt</hi> was ſparing and modeſt in
his Romance; and the <hi>ſecond,</hi> being ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
of the Inſufficiency of the former's
Tale, deviſes a Miracle of a bigger
Size; which ſtill not proving ſufficient to
the End propoſed; the <hi>third</hi> Writer,
rather than his Prophet's Honour ſhould
ſink for want of a Reſurrection-Miracle,
forges a Story of a monſtrouſly huge
one; againſt which it is, and always will
be Objection enough, that it was not
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:1207700500:19"/>
related by the firſt Hiſtorian. So would
you Chriſtians argue againſt theſe three
Miracles in another Impoſtor's Caſe;
and there is not a judicious <hi>Critic</hi> in the
Univerſe, that would not approve of
the Argument, and applaud the Force
of it, tho' you will not endure the
Thoughts of it in the Caſe of your
<hi>Jeſus.</hi>

            <p>"But to come nearer home to you;
ſuppoſing <hi>John</hi> (who was then above a
Hundred, and in his Dotage) had not
reported this Miracle of <hi>Lazarus</hi>; but
that <hi>Clement</hi> (joining it with his <note n="12" place="bottom">In Epiſt. prima ad Corinth. Cap. xxv.</note> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible
Story of the Reſurrection of a
<hi>Phaenix</hi>) or <hi>Ignatius,</hi> or <hi>Polycarp,</hi> or the
Author of the <hi>Apoſtolical Conſtitutions</hi>
had related it; would not your Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian
<hi>Critics</hi> have been at work to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plode
it? There is not an antient extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evangelical
Tradition of any Note about
<hi>Jeſus,</hi> that ſome or other of your <hi>Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics</hi>
have not boggled at; but ſuch a
Story as this of <hi>Lazarus</hi> would have
been received by none. I queſtion,
whether Mr. <hi>Whiſton</hi> would not have
rejected the <hi>Conſtitutions</hi> upon ſuch a
Story in them; or if his Fancy for ſome
other Things in them had overcome his
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:1207700500:20"/>
Reaſon againſt this; yet <hi>Biſhop Small-broke,</hi>
who has written againſt the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonicalneſs
of the <hi>Conſtitutions,</hi> with
his judicious Animadverſions upon this
Story, would abſolutely have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown
their Authority. And what
would he have ſaid here? Not only
that the Miracle ſmells rankly of Forge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and Fraud, or the <hi>Evangeliſts,</hi> eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<hi>Matthew,</hi> had never forgotten to
record it; but he would have reminded
us of intrinſic Notes (<hi>hereafter to be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd</hi>)
of Abſurdity, and Incredibility,
that would for ever have caſhier'd the
Belief of it. And whether we <hi>Infidels</hi>
ought not to take the ſame Liberty to
criticize on <hi>John</hi>'s Goſpel, which you
do on your Apoſtolical Fathers, who
wrote before him, let the impartial and
unprejudiced judge: If in juſtice we
ought to take it; we are ſure we could
give two or three notable Reaſons (but
that We will not now put Chriſtians
out of Temper with them) why <hi>John</hi>
may be ſuſpected of a Miſtake or Fraud
in this Miracle, rather than any other
Chriſtian Writer of the <hi>firſt</hi> or <hi>ſecond</hi>
Century."</p>
            <p>To ſuch an unhappy Objection, ariſing
from the unnatural and prepoſterous Order
of Time, in which they are recorded,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:1207700500:21"/>
are theſe three Miracles before us obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.
And I am thinking how Miniſters of

accounts for the Order of Time in which
theſe Miracles are related; but my Anſwer

The Evangelical and Eccleſiaſtical
Hiſtory is entirely ſilent as to theſe Queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
which is enough to make us ſuſpect
their Stories to be merely romantick or
parabolical; and that there were no ſuch

he found among Traditions, that <hi>Lazarus</hi>
lived thirty Years after his Reſurrection:
But how did he ſpend his Time all that
while? Was it to the Honour of <hi>Jeſus,</hi>
to the Service of the Church, and Proga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
of the Goſpel? Of that we know
nothing; tho in Reaſon and Gratitude to
<hi>Jeſus,</hi> his Benefactor, it ought to have
been ſo ſpent; and if it had been ſo em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd,
Hiſtory ſurely would have inform'd
us of it. According to the Opinion of
<hi>Grotius,</hi> in a Citation above, <hi>Lazarus</hi> for
the reſt of his reſtored Life abſconded, and
skull'd about the Country for Fear of the
<hi>Jews,</hi> who lay in Wait for him; which is
a Suggeſtion, not only diſhonourable to
<hi>Jeſus,</hi> as if the ſame Power, that rais'd
him from the dead, could not protect him
againſt his Enemies; but reproachful to
<hi>Lazarus</hi> himſelf, who ſhould have choſen
to ſuffer Death again, rather than not bear
an open Teſtimony to <hi>Jeſus,</hi> the Author
of his Reſurrection. However it was, we
hear no more of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> than that he
lived thirty Years afterwards, which Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:1207700500:24"/>
without other Memorials of his
Life, brings the Miracle more under ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion
of Fable, than if he had dy'd ſoon
after it. And of <hi>Jairus</hi>'s Daughter, and of
the Widow of <hi>Naim</hi>'s Son, which is aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing,
we read nothing at all. Does not
this Silence in Hiſtory about them, make
their Miracles queſtionable, and but like
<hi>Gulliverian</hi> Tales of Perſons and Things,
that out of the Romance, never had any
Being.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Jeſus</hi> did but <note n="16" place="bottom">Matt. xviii. 2.</note> 
               <hi>call a little Child, and
ſet him in the midſt</hi> of his Diſciples; and
that Act was remember'd in the Piety and
Zeal <note n="17" place="bottom">In Nicephor. Calliſt. Eccl. Hiſt. L. ii. c. 35.</note> of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> who made a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown'd

conferr'd on theſe three rais'd Perſons
was exceedingly greater; and one might
have expected, that <hi>Lazarus</hi> and the Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow's

of the Goſpel. But inſtead of that,
their Lives afterwards were paſs'd in Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity,
or, what's as bad, Eccleſiaſtical
Hiſtory has neglected a Report of them.
What can any one hereupon think leſs,
than that the Favour of the Miracles was
loſt on undeſerving Perſons, which I ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor
the Thoughts of; or that their Stories
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:1207700500:25"/>
are but Parables, which I rather incline to.</p>
            <p>Miniſters of the <hi>Letter</hi> may here ſay,
"That the Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolical
Age is very ſcanty; and that
many Memorials of other Perſons and
Tranſactions are loſt and buried in Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livion:
Which unhappy Fate has at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
the after-Lives and Actions of
theſe rais'd Perſons, or undoubtedly we
ſhould have had a famous Record of
them." This is not impoſſible; tho'
in the Wiſdom of Providence it is hardly
probable, but that ſome more Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
muſt have been left of one or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
if not of all the three Perſons; in as
much as ſuch a Remembrance of them
would now-a-days have no leſs gain'd a
Belief of the Miracles, than this Hiſtorical
Silence tends to the Diſcredit of them.</p>
            <p>It's ſomewhat ſtrange, that we hear no
more of the after-Fame and Life of any
of the diſeaſed Perſons, whom <hi>Jeſus</hi> mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculouſly
cured; excepting of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
heal'd of an Iſſue of Blood; who,
tho' ſhe <hi>ſpent</hi> ALL <hi>ſhe had, even</hi> ALL
<hi>her Living</hi> upon <hi>Phyſicians</hi>; yet out of
the Remains of it erected, ſays <note n="18" place="bottom">In Eccl. Hiſt. L. vii. c. 18.</note> 
               <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſebius,</hi>
at <hi>Caeſarea Philippi,</hi> two moſt coſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Statues of Braſs, to the Memory of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:1207700500:26"/>
               <hi>Jeſus</hi> and of herſelf, and of the Miracle
wrought by him; which Dr. <hi>Whitby</hi> 
               <note n="19" place="bottom">In Loc. Matthaei.</note>
as if he was tainted with Infidelity, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
to make an idle Tale of. But ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting,
I ſay this Story of this Woman,
we hear nothing of any other heal'd Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;
which is Matter of ſome Specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
But that the Perſons rais'd from
the dead ſhould not at all be mention'd
in Hiſtory for their Labours and Lives
afterwards to the Honour of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely
unaccountable. Whether ſuch a
profound Silence in Hiſtory about them be
not ſhocking of the Credit of the Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
let our <hi>Divines</hi> conſider. I am of
Opinion that if <hi>Jeſus</hi> really rais'd theſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
from the dead; this and no other Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
in the Providence of God, can be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
for the Silence of Eccleſiaſtical Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
about them afterwards, than to make
<hi>dead-letter'd</hi> Stories of their Miracles, in
order to turn our Heads entirely to the
Conſideration of their myſtical Significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
without which the <hi>Letter,</hi> for the
Argument before us, is deſerving of no
Regard nor Credit. But</p>
            <p n="3">3. By way of Objection to the <hi>Letter</hi>
of theſe three Miracles, let us conſider the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:1207700500:27"/>
Condition of the Perſons rais'd from the
dead; and whether they were at all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Perſons for <hi>Jeſus</hi> to work ſuch a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle
upon, in Teſtimony of his divine
Power. If they were improper Perſons
according to the <hi>Letter,</hi> it's not credible
that He, who was the Wiſdom of God,
would raiſe them; or if he did, it was
becauſe they were the propereſt to make
myſtical Emblems of their Stories.</p>
            <p>That <hi>Jeſus</hi> ought to have rais'd all that
dy'd, where-ever he came, during the
Time of his Miniſtry, none, I preſume,
can hold. Two or three Inſtances of his
almighty and miraculous Power of this
Kind will be allow'd to be ſufficient:
But then they muſt be wiſely and judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
made Choice of, out of a vaſt Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Perſons, that muſt needs die in
that Time. Where then was his Wiſdom
and Prudence to chuſe theſe three Perſons
above others to that Honour? Why were
all of them, or indeed any one of them
preferr'd to other Perſons of a different
Age and Condition in the World? Nay,
if the <hi>Letter</hi> of their Stories is only to be
regarded, were not all theſe three Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
almoſt the impropereſt and moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
of any for <hi>Jeſus</hi> to exerciſe that Power
on?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:1207700500:28"/>
               <hi>Jairus</hi>'s Daughter was an inſignificant
<hi>Girl</hi> of twelve Years old: And there
could be no Reaſon for raiſing her, but to
wipe Sorrow from the Hearts, and Tears
from the Eyes of her Parents, who ought
to have been better Philoſophers, than im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderately
to grieve for her. And was
here a good Reaſon for <hi>Jeſus</hi> to interpoſe
with his Almighty Powe? No certainly;
a Lecture of Patience and Reſignation in
this Caſe had been enough. And tho
<hi>Jeſus</hi> could raiſe her from the dead; yet
for as much as that Favour was to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd
but on a few; and his Miracles
ought to be uſeful as well as conſpicuous,
ſhe ſhould have been paſs'd by, as an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper
Object of his Power, in Compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of many others, preſently to be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.
If therefore a better Reaſon, than
what's diſcernible in the <hi>Letter,</hi> is not to
be fetch'd from the Myſtery; I can't ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
that <hi>Jeſus,</hi> the Wiſdom of God would
raiſe this <hi>Girl</hi>; but that the modern Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leif
of her Reſuſcitation, excluſive of the
myſtical Signification, is, as ſhall be by and
by argued, altogether groundleſs.</p>
            <p>The Widow of <hi>Naim</hi>'s Son too was
but a <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Youth,</hi> and whether any
thing older than the <hi>Girl</hi> above is doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful;
but his Life certainly was of no
more Importance to the World after, than
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:1207700500:29"/>
before his Reſurrection. And why was
he then one of the <hi>three</hi> to be rais'd from
the dead? Why had he this Honour done
him, before others of greater Age, Worth,
and Uſe to MankInd? Some will ſay, for
the Comfort of his ſorrowful Mother.
And is this Reaſon ſufficient? A Diſcourſe
on the Pleaſures of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Boſom,
where ſhe would e'er long meet her Son,
had been enough to chear her Heart. If
therefore the Fathers don't help me to a
ſolid myſtical Reaſon, why the Son and
<hi>only Son</hi> of a Widow was to be rais'd by
<hi>Jeſus,</hi> as they were carrying him to his Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial,
I'll not believe, He would raiſe this
dead <hi>Boy</hi> rather than many others, for the
Manifeſtation of his Power; but that the
Story of his Reſurrection, as ſhall ſoon be
reaſonably proved, was all Sham and Cheat.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lazarus</hi> indeed was <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s Friend,
whom he Loved; and as I will not que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
but <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s Affection was wiſely and
deſervedly placed on him; ſo here, to
Appearance, was a better Reaſon for the
raiſing of him, than of either of the other
Two. But even this Reaſon, ſuppoſing
<hi>Jeſus</hi> was to raiſe but three Perſons, is
not ſufficient againſt the Caſes of many
others, that may be put for the Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation
of his Power, for the Illuſtration
of his Wiſdom and Goodneſs, and for the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:1207700500:30"/>
Converſion of Unbelievers: Conſequently,
if this Story of <hi>Lazarus</hi> be not parabolical,
the litteral Fact is diſputable, and obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to ſuch Exceptions preſently to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
againſt it, as will not be eaſily got
over.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Jeſus</hi> rais'd the dead, and wrought o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Miracles, ſay our <hi>Divines</hi> often, not
only to manifeſt his own Power and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
but his Love to Mankind, and his
Inclination to do them good: For which
Reaſon his Miracles are uſeful and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial
as well as ſtupendous and ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Acts, on purpoſe to conciliate Men's
Affections as well as their Faith to him.
On this Topick our <hi>Divines</hi> are copious
and rhetorical, when they write on <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s
Miracles, as if no more uſeful and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
Works could be done, than what
he did. And I do agree with them, that
(what Reaſon beſpeaks) the Miracles of a
pretended Author of Religion ought to be
both as uſeful and great as well as could
be. But ſuch were not <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s Miracles
according to <hi>Letter,</hi> and leaſt of all his Acts
of raiſing the dead. For if we conſider
the Perſons rais'd by him, we ſhall find,
he could hardly have exerted his Power
on any of leſs Importance to the World,
both before and after their Reſurrection.
A young <hi>Girl</hi> indeed is fitter to be rais'd
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:1207700500:31"/>
than a decripid old Woman, who by the
Courſe of Nature was to return to Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
again, as ſoon as reſtored to Life:
And a <hi>Boy</hi> rather than an infirm old Man
for the ſame Reaſon: And <hi>Lazarus</hi> the
Friend of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> perhaps, and but perhaps,
rather than his profeſs'd Enemy. But
what are theſe three Perſons in Compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of many others of other Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances?
Inſtead of a <hi>Boy,</hi> and a <hi>Girl</hi> and
even of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> who were all of no
Conſequence to the Publick, either before
or ſince; I ſhould think, <hi>Jeſus</hi> ought to
have rais'd an uſeful Magiſtrate, whoſe
Life had beed a common Bleſſing; an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious
Merchant, whoſe Death was a
publick Loſs; a Father of a numerous
Family, which for a comfortable Subſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
depended on him. Such dead Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s Power and Compaſſion
could not but offer themſelves, during the
Time of his Miniſtry, and if he meant to
be as uſeful as he could, in his Miracles,
he would have laid hold on them. If a
few Perſons only were to be rais'd from
the dead, the foreſaid were the propereſt,
whoſe Reſurrection and Return to Life
would have begotten the Applauſe as well
as the Wonder of the World; would
moſt extenſively have ſpread <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s Fame;
and would have gain'd him the Love and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:1207700500:32"/>
Diſcipleſhip of all that heard of his being
ſo great a Benefactor to Mankind. Such
Inſtances of his Power would have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated
him to be a moſt benign as
well as a mighty Agent; and none in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
or Prejudice could have open'd their
Mouths againſt him, eſpecially if the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
rais'd from the dead were ſelected
upon the Recommendation of the People
of this or that City. But that an inſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant
<hi>Boy</hi> and a <hi>Girl,</hi> (forſooth!) and the
obſcure <hi>Lazarus,</hi> are preferr'd by <hi>Jeſus,</hi>
to ſuch publick and more deſerving Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
is unaccountable. Their Story there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
upon this Argument, ſavours of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
and Fraud; and unleſs the <hi>Myſtery</hi>
help us to, what the <hi>Letter</hi> can't, a good
Reaſon for <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s Conduct here, the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
may be hence juſtly queſtion'd, and
the Credibility of their Report diſputed.</p>
            <p>But now I am ſpeaking of the Fitneſs
and Unfitneſs of deceaſed Perſons to have
this grand Miracle wrought on them; it
comes into my Head to ask, why <hi>Jeſus</hi>
rais'd not <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt to Life again?
A Perſon of greater Merits, and more
worthy of the Favour of <hi>Jeſus</hi> and of
this Miracle, could not be. If <hi>Jeſus</hi>
could raiſe any from the dead he would
ſurely have raiſed him; and why did he
not? This is a reaſonable Queſtion, and an
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:1207700500:33"/>
Anſwer ſhould be thought on for it. Was
it a Thing out of <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s Power? Not ſo;
He was Omnipotent, and could by Force
or Perſuaſion have reſcued <hi>John</hi>'s Head out
of the Hands of his Enemies; and the
tacking it again to his Body, and the infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
new Life into him was no more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult
to <hi>Jeſus,</hi> than the Reſuſcitation of a
ſtinking Carcaſs. If <hi>Jeſus</hi> had here exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
his Power, and rais'd his deareſt Friend
and choiceſt Miniſter for the Preparation,
if not Propagation of the Goſpel, none
could queſtion his Ability to raiſe any
others, tho he had rais'd no more. But
in as much as <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> one of his
ſingular Merits and Services to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> was
overlook'd and neglected by him; and
three uſeleſs and inſignificant Perſons had
this Honour done them, the Facts may rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably
be called into queſtion, and, if
the Myſteries don't ſolve the Difficulty,
their litteral Stories may hence be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
fooliſh, fictitious and fabulous; eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
if we conſider,</p>
            <p n="4">4. That none of theſe three rais'd Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
had been long enough dead to ampu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
all Doubt of <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s miraculous
Power in their Reſurrection. As to <hi>Jairus</hi>'s
Daughter, ſhe was but newly expired, if
at all dead, when <hi>Jeſus</hi> brought her to
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:1207700500:34"/>
Life again. <hi>Jeſus</hi> himſelf ſays, ſhe was
but aſleep. And according to <hi>Theophanes
Cerameus</hi> 
               <note n="20" place="bottom">Puellam ex illo Tumultu plangentium ſtupore cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reptam eſſe, non vero defunctam. <hi>In Homil. de Juri filia.</hi>
               </note>, and <hi>Theophilact</hi> 
               <note n="21" place="bottom">In Loc. Matthae.</note> there
is Room to ſuſpect that this <hi>Girl</hi> was only
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>beſide herſelf.</hi> And it is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible,
but the paſſionate Skreams of the
Feminine By-ſtanders might fright her into
Fits, that bore the Appearance of Death;
otherwiſe why did <hi>Jeſus</hi> turn theſe inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate
Weepers out of the Houſe, before
he could bring her to her Senſes again? And
why did he tell her Parents, that ſhe was
only in aſleep, but to Comfort them with
the Poſſibility of his awakening her out of it?
Is not this deſtructive of the Miracle, and
making no more of it, than what another
Man might do? And is there not ſome
Probability, that here's all of this Story?
But ſuppoſing ſhe was really dead, yet for
the ſake of an indiſputable Miracle in her
Reſurrection, it muſt be granted, that ſhe
ought to have been much longer, ſome
Days if not Weeks, dead and buried.</p>
            <p>As to the Widow of <hi>Naim</hi>'s Son, there
was ſomewhat more of the Appearance of
Death in him, than in <hi>Jairus</hi>'s Daughter.
He was carried forth to his Burial, and ſo
may be preſumed to be really a dead
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:1207700500:35"/>
Corpſe. But might not here be Fraud or
Miſtake in the Caſe? Hiſtory and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Fame affords Inſtances of the miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
Deaths of Perſons, who ſometimes
have been unfortunately buried alive, and
at other Times happily, by one Means or
other, reſtored to Life: And who knows
but <hi>Jeſus,</hi> upon ſome Information or
other, might ſuſpect this Youth to be
in a lethargick State, and had a Mind to
try, if by chafeing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he could not do,
what ſucceſsfully he did, bring him to his
Senſes again: Or might not a Piece of
Fraud be here concerted between <hi>Jeſus,</hi>
a ſubtil Youth, and his Mother and others;
and all the Formalities of a Death and Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
contrived, that <hi>Jeſus,</hi> whoſe Fame for
a Worker of Miracles was to be rais'd,
might here have an Opportunity to make a
ſhew of a grand one. The Mourning of
the Widow, who had her Tears at Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
and <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s caſual meeting of the
Corpſe upon the Road, looks like Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
to put the better Face upon the
Matter. God forbid, that I ſhould ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect,
there was any Fraud of this Kind
here; but of the Poſſibility of it, none
can doubt. And where there is a Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility
of Fraud, it is Nonſenſe, and
mere Credulity to talk of a real, certain
and ſtupendous Miracle, eſpecially where
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:1207700500:36"/>
the Juggler and pretended Worker of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
has been detected in ſome of his
other Tricks. All that I have to ſay here
to this Matter, is, that if <hi>Jeſus</hi> had a
Mind to raiſe the Son of this Widow, in
Teſtimony of his divine Power, he ſhould
have ſuffer'd him to have been buried two
or three Weeks firſt; otherwiſe, if the
Myſtery don't account for <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s ſtopping
the Bearers of the Corpſe upon the Road,
here is too much Room for ſuſpicion of
Cheat in the Letter of the Story.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lazarus</hi>'s Caſe ſeems to be the leſs excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable
of the three. He had been buried
<hi>four Days,</hi> and ſuppoſed to be putrified in
the Opinion of his Siſter <hi>Mary,</hi> and of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern
Chriſtians: And if ſo, his Reſuſcita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was a moſt grand and indiſputable
Miracle. And I could have wiſh'd, if I
had not loved the <hi>Myſtery</hi> rather than
the <hi>Letter,</hi> that no Cavil and Exception
could have been made to it. Whether <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus,</hi>
who was <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s Friend and beloved
Diſciple, would not come into Meaſures
with his Lord, for the Defence of his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
and Propagation of his Fame, <hi>Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels,</hi>
who take Chriſtianity for an Impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
will not queſtion: And whether he
would not conſent to be interr'd alive, in
a hollow Cave, where there was only a
Stone laid at the Mouth of it, as long as
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:1207700500:37"/>
a Man could faſt, none of them will doubt.
Four Days was almoſt too long for a Man
to faſt without danger of Health; but if
thoſe <hi>four Days</hi> are number'd according to
the Arithmetick of Jeſus'<hi>s three Days</hi> in his
Grave, they are reducible to two Days and
three Nights, which Time, if no Victuals
were ſecretly convey'd with him, a Man
might faſt in <hi>Lazarus</hi>'s Cave. As to the
<hi>ſtinking</hi> of <hi>Lazarus</hi>'s Carcaſs: that, <hi>Infidels</hi>
will ſay, was but the Aſſertion of his Siſter
beforehand, like a Prologue to a Farce.
None of the Spectators at his Reſurrection
ſay one Word of his ſtinking. And as to
the Weepings and Lamentations of <hi>Jeſus</hi>
and of <hi>Lazarus</hi>'s Siſters, they will ſay
that was all Sham and Counterfeit, the
better to carry on the Juggle of a feign'd
Reſurrection. And what's worſt of all,
they will ſay, that tho <hi>Jeſus</hi> did call <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus</hi>
forth with a <hi>loud Voice,</hi> as if he had
been as deaf as a dead Man; yet his <hi>Face
was bound about with a Napkin,</hi> ſo that
the Spectators could not diſcern what was
of the Eſſence of the Miracle, the Change
of his Countenance from a dead to a live
one, which is a plain Sign, that it was all
Fraud and Impoſture.</p>
            <p>God forbid, that I ſhould have the ſame
ſenſe with <hi>Infidels,</hi> of this Matter; but to
be juſt to their Suggeſtions and Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:1207700500:38"/>
here, I muſt needs ſay, there are ſome
other unhappy Circumſtances, preſently to
be conſider'd, in this Story, which, if they
are not emblematical, make it the moſt
notorious Cheat and Impoſture that ever
was put upon Mankind. In the mean
Time, from what is here argued, it is
plain, that <hi>Lazarus</hi> was not ſo long dead
and buried, as that there is no Room to
doubt of the Miracle of his Reſurrection.</p>
            <p>Now whether theſe Arguments againſt
theſe three Miracles, drawn from the
Shortneſs of the Time, in which theſe
Perſons lay for dead, have any Force in
them, let our <hi>Divines</hi> conſider. If no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of all this is in their Opinion affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Credit of the Miracles; yet
they muſt allow, that <hi>Jeſus,</hi> if he could
raiſe the dead, might have made Choice of
other Inſtances of Perſons, more unqueſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onably
dead, who had lain longer in their
Graves, and were in a viſible State of Putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.
And if this grand Miracle of raiſing
the dead was to be wrought by <hi>Jeſus</hi> for
the Manifeſtation of his Glory, and in
Teſtimony of his Authority; he ſhould
have exerciſed his Power on ſome ſuch
Perſons, nominated by the Magiſtrates of
this or that City, who with the People
ſhould be preſent at the miraculous Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
beholding the putrified Bodies,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:1207700500:39"/>
(without a Napkin before their Faces) and
how they were ſuddenly enliven'd and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigorated
with new Fleſh, after the Simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude
of their priſtine Form, when in
Health and full Strength. Becauſe that <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi>
rais'd not ſome ſuch Perſons to Life,
I muſt take the Stories of the three Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
before us to be but typical of more
myſterious Works; or believe them for
the Arguments above to be downright
Cheats and Fables. And what is enough
to induce a modern <hi>Divine</hi> to this Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Is</p>
            <p n="5">5. The Conſideration, that none of
theſe rais'd Perſons did or could, after the
Return of their Souls to their Bodies, tell
any Tales of their ſeparate Exiſtence o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
the Evangeliſts had not been ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
in this main Point, which is of the
Eſſence of Chriſtianity. Are not our <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines</hi>
here reduced to an unhappy <hi>Dilemma,</hi>
either to deny the ſeparate Exiſtence of the
Soul, or the precedent Deaths of theſe
rais'd Perſons? As Chriſtians, we profeſs
to believe both, which ſeemingly are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compatiable;
or the Evangeliſts had made
ſuch a Relation, as their return'd Souls had
given of the other World. Was any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
in this Age, to be rais'd to Life, that
had been any time dead; the firſt Thing
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:1207700500:40"/>
that his Friends and Acquaintance would
enquire of him, would be to know, where
his Soul had been; in what Company;
and how it had fared with him; and Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torians
would certainly record his Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.
The ſame Curioſity could not but
poſſeſs People of old, when theſe Miracles
were wrought; and if the rais'd Perſons
had told any Stories of their ſeparate Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtance,
the Evangeliſts no leſs unqueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally
would have reported them, in as
much as ſuch a Report would have been,
not only a Confirmation of that Doctrine,
which is of the Eſſence of our Religion; but
an abſolute Confutation of the <hi>Sadducees</hi>
and <hi>Sceptiſts</hi> of that Age, and of the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terialiſts</hi>
of this. But this their Silence in
this Caſe is of bad Conſequence, either to
the Doctrine of the Soul's Exiſtence in Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
from the Body, or to theſe Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
themſelves, ſince we muſt hereupon
almoſt neceſſarily hold, that theſe rais'd
Perſons were not at all dead, or that their
Souls dy'd with them.</p>

his Reſurrection made a large Report of
<hi>Hell,</hi> where he had been: But as this is a
mere Fiction of that Author, without the
leaſt Authority from Scripture; ſo I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
it will be accounted a <hi>Blunder</hi> in
him, to ſuppoſe the Soul of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> the
Friend and beloved of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> was in Hell.
The Soul of <hi>Jeſus</hi> indeed, for Reaſons beſt
known to himſelf, upon his Death, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended
into Hell, when ſome think he
ſhould rather have gone, with the penitent
Thief, into Paradiſe. But the Thoughts,
that any of <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s Friends ſhould go to
Hell, I ſuppoſe will not be born with;
or what will become of the Preachers of
this Age, who would be accounted Men
of that Denomination. And if <hi>Lazarus</hi>'s
Soul had been in Paradiſe, it was hardly
a good Work in <hi>Jeſus</hi> to recall it, for thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Years afterwards, to the Miſeries and
Troubles of this wicked World. I wiſh
therefore our <hi>Divines</hi> could determine,
where <hi>Lazarus</hi>'s Soul was for the four
Days of his Burial; becauſe I can't poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
conceive any thing elſe, than that he
was not really dead, or that his Soul dy'd
with him, or went to a bad place, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
after his Reſurrection he had never
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:1207700500:42"/>
abſconded for fear of the <hi>Jews,</hi> as if he
was unwilling to die again, and return to
the Place from whence he came.</p>
            <p>But however it was with the Souls of
theſe rais'd Perſons before their Re-union to
their Bodies, here is another Difficulty and
Objection againſt theſe Miracles; and how
will our <hi>Divines</hi> get over it? Perhaps they
may ſay, that tho' theſe rais'd Perſons were
before really dead; yet their Souls were
not as yet gone to their Places prepared of
God for them, but continued hovering
about their Bodies, like the Flame about
the Snuff of a Candle, with deſires

my Heart let this Anſwer paſs, if our

for my own Opinion, it is this, that theſe
Miracles of <hi>Jeſus</hi> are Parables, and that it
was beſide the Purpoſe of the Parable,
and of the <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> to ſay any thing of
the Place and State of the Soul upon
its Separation from the Body; otherwiſe
the Letter of their Stories is manifeſtly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious

6. And laſtly, Let us conſider the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſick
Abſurdities and Incredibilities of
the ſeveral Stories of theſe three Miracles.
And ſuch Abſurdities ſhall we find in them,
that, if they had been intended as Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
of <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s divine Power, had never
been inſerted in their Narratives.</p>
            <p>As to <hi>Jairus</hi>'s Daughter, and her Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
from the dead, St. <hi>Hilary</hi> 
               <note n="23" place="bottom">Princeps hic, Lex eſſe intelligitur, quae Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num orat pro Plebe, quam ipſa Chriſto praedicata ejus Adventus Expectatione nutriverat, ut Vi tam mortuae reddat. Nam nullum Principem credidiſſe legimus, ex quo Perſona hujus principis orantis merito in Typum ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabitur. <hi>In Loc. Matt.</hi>
               </note>
hints, that there was no ſuch Perſon as
<hi>Jairus</hi> whoſe Name was fictitious, and
coin'd with a ſpiritual Signification for the
Uſe of the Parable; and he gives this
Reaſon, and a good Reaſon it is, why he
thought ſo, becauſe it is elſewhere <note n="24" place="bottom">John vii. 48. and xii. 42.</note>
intimated in the Goſpel, that none of the
Rulers of the Synagogues confeſſedly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
on <hi>Jeſus.</hi> Is not here then a ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling-Block
at the Threſhold of the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of this Story? But why did <hi>Jeſus</hi> ſay,
this Girl was but in a Sleep? If he was
going to work a Miracle in her Reſuſcita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
he ſhould not have call'd Death,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:1207700500:44"/>
               <hi>Sleep</hi>; but if others had been of a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Opinion, he ſhould firſt have convinced
them of the Certainty of her Death, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he did the great Work on her. And
why did he charge the Parents of the Girl
not to ſpeak of the Miracle? If he meant
it as a Teſtimony of his divine Power,
he ſhould rather have exhorted them, in
juſtice to himſelf to publiſh it, and make
it well known. And why, as St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi>
               <note n="25" place="bottom">Quae tamen tantae diverſitatis Cauſa? Supra pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice Viduoe filius ſuſcitatur, hic removentur plures arbitri. <hi>In Loc. Luc.</hi>
               </note> puts the Queſtion, did he turn the
People out of the Houſe, before he would
raiſe her? The more Witneſſes are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
at a Miracle, the better it is atteſted,
and the more readily believed by others;
and who ſhould be preſent at the Miracle
rather than thoſe who were incredulous of
<hi>Jeſus</hi>'s divine Power? Are not all theſe
Circumſtances, ſo many <hi>Abſurdities,</hi> which,
if they are not to be accounted for in the
<hi>Myſtery,</hi> are ſo far deſtructive of the <hi>Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
as that it is Nonſenſe and Folly in our
<hi>Divines</hi> to talk of a Miracle here, againſt
<hi>Jeſus</hi>'s expreſs Word and Prohibition to
the contrary.</p>
            <p>As to the Story of the Widow of <hi>Naim</hi>'s
Son, excepting what is before obſerved of
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:1207700500:45"/>
the ſhortneſs of the Time, in which he lay
dead, and of the Unfitneſs of his Perſon
to be rais'd before an Husband and Father
of a Family, to the Comfort of his Wife
and Children, (which are enough to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
the Credility of the Miracle) I have
here no more Fault to find in the Letter
of it.</p>
            <p>But the long Story of <hi>Lazarus</hi> is ſo brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
of Abſurdities, that, if the Letter alone
is to be regarded; St. <hi>John,</hi> who was then
above a hundred, when he wrote it, had
lived beyond his Reaſon and Senſes, or he
could not have committed them.</p>
            <p>I have not Room here to make Remarks
on all theſe Abſurdities, which would be
the Work of a Volume; but ſhall ſingle
out three or four of them at preſent, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
the reſt for another Opportunity,
when the whole Story of this Miracle will
appear to be ſuch a Contexture of Folly
and Fraud in its Contrivance, Execution,
and Relation, as is not to be equall'd in
all Romantick Hiſtory; and our <hi>Divines</hi>
will find themſelves ſo diſtreſs'd upon the
Diſſection and Diſplay of it, as that they
muſt of Neceſſity allow this Story to be
but a Parable; or, what's moſt grievous
to think on, give up their Religion upon
it.</p>

have <hi>wept.</hi> and <hi>groan'd</hi> for the Death of
<hi>Lazarus:</hi> But why ſo, ſays <note n="26" place="bottom">Qua igitur Ratione, qui tanta haec erat facturus, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

Was not this an <hi>Abſurdity</hi> to weep at all
for the Death of him, whom he could,
and was about to recover to Life again?
Another Man may as reaſonably grieve
for the Abſence of his Friend, whoſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
and Preſence he can retrieve in an
Inſtant, as that <hi>Jeſus</hi> ſhould ſhed Tears
for <hi>Lazarus</hi> in this Caſe. If <hi>Jeſus</hi> could
not or would not raiſe him from the dead,
he ought not, as a Philoſopher, who knows
Man is born to die, to betray ſo much
Weakneſs as to weep for him. Patience
and Reſignation unto God upon the Death
of our deareſt Friends and Relations is
what all Philoſophers have rightly taught;
and <hi>Jeſus,</hi> one would think, ſhould have
been the moſt Heroical Example of theſe
Graces; and how came he to fail of it
here? A Stoical Apathy had better be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
him than ſuch childiſh and effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
Grief, which not only makes him a
mean and poor-ſpirited Mortal; but is a
groſs <hi>Abſurdity</hi> and <hi>Incredibility</hi> upon Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
of his Will and Power to fetch
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:1207700500:47"/>
               <hi>Lazarus</hi> to Life again. If there be not,
according to the Fathers, Myſtery in theſe
Tears of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> they are a fooliſh and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural
Prelude to a Farce, he was acting
in the pretended Reſuſcitation of <hi>Lazarus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some antient Catholicks, not being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed
of the Myſtery; were ſo offended
at theſe Words, <hi>Jeſus wept,</hi> that, as <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius</hi>
               <note n="27" place="bottom">

               </note> ſays, they expung'd them out
of their Bibles; and I wonder, they have
not, before now, diſturb'd the Faith of
Miniſters of the Letter, to the utter Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
of the Miracle.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Obſerve that <hi>John</hi> ſays, it was
with <hi>a loud Voice,</hi> that <hi>Jeſus</hi> call'd <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi>
forth out of his Cave. And why, I
pray, a louder Voice than ordinary? Was
dead <hi>Lazarus</hi> deafer than <hi>Jairus</hi>'s Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
or the Widow's Son? Or was his
Soul at ſo great a Diſtance from his Body,
as he could not hear a ſtill and low Voice?
Some ſuch ſilly Reaſon as <hi>this</hi> muſt be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
for this <hi>loud Voice</hi> here; but how ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd
it is according to the Letter, Infidels
will judge, till Chriſtians can aſſign a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
The dead can hear the Whiſper of
the Almighty, if Power go along with it,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:1207700500:48"/>
as ſoon as the Sound of a Trumpet. St.
<hi>John</hi> then ſhould not have written of a
<hi>loud Voice,</hi> unleſs he meant to adapt his
Story to the Capacities and Conceptions of
the Vulgar, who have no Apprehenſions
of God's Power, out of ſenſible and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Repreſentations of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Becauſe that a Miracle ſhould
be well guarded againſt all Suſpicion of
Fraud, I was thinking to make it an <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity,</hi>
that the Napkin, before <hi>Jeſus</hi> rais'd
<hi>Lazarus,</hi> was not taken from his Face, that
the Spectators might behold his mortified
Looks, and the miraculous Change of his
Countenance from Death unto Life. What
<hi>Infidels</hi> think of this Circumſtance I know
not: I hope it is not with them a Token
of Fraud and Impoſture; tho I muſt needs
ſay, that if the Fathers did not let me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Myſtery of the Napkin about <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi>'s
Face when <hi>Jeſus</hi> call'd him forth, I
ſhould not my ſelf like it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> and laſtly, Obſerve, St. <hi>John</hi>
ſays, v. 45. that <hi>many of the Jews, who
had ſeen the Things that Jeſus did</hi> here;
<hi>believed on him</hi>; and <hi>ſome of them,</hi> v. 46.
who did not believe, <hi>went their Ways to
the Phariſees and told them what Things
Jeſus had done</hi> in this pretended Miracle,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:1207700500:49"/>
and how the Buſineſs was tranſacted:
Whereupon the Chief Prieſts and Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees
were ſo far incens'd as v. 53. <hi>from that
Day forth they took Council together to put
him to Death</hi>; and Ch. xii. 10. <hi>conſulted,
that they might put</hi> Lazarus <hi>alſo to Death.</hi>
Jeſus <hi>therefore</hi> (and his Diſciples and <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus</hi>
fled for it, for they) v. 54. <hi>walk'd
no more openly among the Jews,</hi> but <hi>went
thence into a Country near to the Wilderneſs</hi>
(a convenient hiding Place) <hi>and there con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
with his Diſciples</hi>; otherwiſe in all
Probability they had been all ſacrificed.</p>
            <p>I dare not argue upon theſe Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
neither would I, for the Honour
of <hi>Jeſus</hi> have mention'd them; but that
my old Friend, the Jewiſh <hi>Rabbi,</hi> who
help'd me to the Satirical Invective againſt
<hi>Jeſus</hi>'s Miracle of <hi>turning Water into Wine,</hi>
has hence form'd an Objection againſt <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus</hi>'s
Reſurrection, and ſent me a <hi>Letter</hi>
upon it, deſiring me to publiſh it, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort
the <hi>Clergy</hi> to anſwer it; otherwiſe he
would clandeſtinely hand it about to the
Prejudice of our Religion: Whereupon I,
rather than Chriſtianity ſhould ſo ſuffer, do
here publiſh it, and it is as follows.</p>
            <floatingText type="letter" xml:lang="eng">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Sr.</hi> When we laſt diſcours'd on <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s
Miracles, I promiſed to ſend you my
Thoughts on <hi>Lazarus</hi>'s Reſurrection,
which I look upon as a notorious Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſture,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:1207700500:50"/>
and for the Proof of it, need go no
farther, than to the Circumſtances of its
Story, which your <hi>Evangeliſt</hi> has related.</p>
                  <p>If there had been an indiſputable Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle
wrought in <hi>Lazarus</hi>'s Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
why were the <hi>Chief-Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees</hi>
ſo incens'd upon it, as <hi>to take
Council to put both Jeſus</hi> and <hi>Lazarus</hi> to
<hi>Death for it?</hi> Where was the Provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
I can conceive none. Tho' the
<hi>Jews</hi> were ever ſo canker'd with Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
and Hatred to <hi>Jeſus</hi> before; yet
ſuch a moſt ſtupendous Miracle was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to ſtop their Mouths, and turn
their Hearts: Or if their Prejudices a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<hi>Jeſus</hi> were inſuperable, and they
hated him but the more for the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
and Greatneſs of his Miracles; yet
why is poor <hi>Lazarus,</hi> inoffenſive <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi>
upon whom this good and great
Work was wrought, an Object of their
Hatred too? Your <hi>Divines</hi> are to give a
credible and probable Account of this
Matter, ſuch a one as will comport with
Reaſon and Senſe; or we ſhall conclude,
that it was <hi>Fraud,</hi> detected in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Miracle, which juſtly provok'd
the Indignation of our Anceſtors.</p>
                  <p>To ſay, what is all you can ſay, that
it was downright inhumanity, Barbarity
and Brutality in the <hi>Jews</hi> to hate <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus</hi>
                     <pb n="44" facs="tcp:1207700500:51"/>
as well as <hi>Jeſus,</hi> will not do here.
Tho' this may paſs with many Chriſtians,
who are ready to ſwallow, without
chewing, any evil Reports of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
yet it can't go down with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
and unprejudic'd Men, who
muſt have other Conceptions of human
Nature in all Ages and Nations, than
to think it poſſible, that a Man, in <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus</hi>'s
Caſe, can be hated and perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for having had ſuch a good and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
Work done on him. And why
then was he hated and perſecuted? I
ſay, for this, and no other Reaſon, than
becauſe he was a Confederate with <hi>Jeſus</hi>
in the wicked Impoſture, he was putting
upon Mankind.</p>
                  <p>But ſuppoſing, what is never to be
granted, that the <hi>Jews</hi> of old were ſo
inhuman, brutiſh, and barbarous as to
hate and perſecute <hi>Lazarus</hi> as well as
<hi>Jeſus</hi> for this Miracle; yet why did
<hi>Jeſus</hi> and his Diſciples, with <hi>Lazarus,</hi>
run away and abſcond upon it? for they
v. 54. <hi>walk'd no more openly among the</hi>
Jews, <hi>but went thence into a Country near
to the Wilderneſs, and there</hi> Jeſus <hi>continued
with his Diſciples.</hi> Is not here a plain
Sign of Guilt and of Fraud? Men, that
have God's Cauſe, Truth and Power on
their Side, never want Courage and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:1207700500:52"/>
to ſtand to it. And however
your Chriſtian <hi>Prieſts</hi> may palliate the
cowardly and timerous Conduct of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi>
and his Confederates in this Caſe;
yet with me, it's like Demonſtration,
that there was a diſcover'd Cheat in the
Miracle, or they would undauntedly
have faced their Enemies, without Fears
And Apprehenſions of Danger from them.</p>
                  <p>Our Anceſtors then, who unqueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably
detected the Fraud, were in the
right on't to proſecute with Severity,
the whole Party concern'd in it: And if
they had aveng'd the Wickedneſs of it
upon <hi>Lazarus</hi> as well as they did upon
<hi>Jeſus,</hi> I ſhould have commended them
for it. Whether ſuch a monſtrous Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſture,
as was this pretended Miracle,
happily diſcover'd does not call aloud for
Vengeance and moſt exemplary Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and whether any Nation of the
World would ſuffer the like with Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punity,
let any Man judge.</p>
                  <p>For all the Reports of your Goſpels,
it is unnatural to hate a miraculous
Healer of Diſeaſes; and there muſt be
ſomewhat ſuppreſt about the Inveteracy
of the <hi>Jews</hi> to <hi>Jeſus,</hi> or his healing
Power, if it was ſo great as is imagined,
muſt have reconciled them to him: But
that they ſhould hate not only <hi>Jeſus</hi> for
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:1207700500:53"/>
raiſing the dead, but the Perſon rais'd
by him, is improbable, incredible, and
impoſſible.</p>
                  <p>If Hiſtorians can parrallel this Story of
the Malignity of the <hi>Jews</hi> towards
<hi>Jeſus</hi> and <hi>Lazarus</hi> upon ſuch a real Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle,
with any Thing equally barbarous
and inhuman, in any other Sect or Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
we will acknowledge the Truth
of it againſt our ancient Nation: Or if
ſuch Inhumanity, abſtractedly conſider'd,
be at all agreeable to the Conceptions any
one can form of Human Nature in the
moſt uncivilis'd and brutiſh People, we
will allow our Anceſtors, in this Caſe,
to have been that People.</p>
                  <p>Was ſuch a real and indiſputable Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle,
as this of <hi>Lazarus</hi> is ſuppoſed, to be
wrought at this day in Confirmation of
Chriſtianity, I dare ſay, it would bring
all us <hi>Jews,</hi> to a Man, into the Belief
of it: And I don't think it poſſible, for
any People to be ſo begotten, byaſs'd,
and prejudiced, as not to be wrought
on by it. Or if they would not part
with their Intereſts and Prejudices upon
it, they would have more Wit and
Temper, than to break forth into a
Rage againſt all or any of the Perſons
concern'd in it. And, for my Life, I
can entertain no worſe Thoughts of our

Suppoſing God ſhould ſend an Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador
at this day, who, to convince
Chriſtians of the Miſchiefs and Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience
of an <hi>Hireling Prieſthood,</hi>
ſhould work ſuch a Miracle as was this
of <hi>Lazarus</hi>'s Reſurrection, in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of a multitude of Spectators; how
would your <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Clergy</hi> behave
themſelves upon it? Why, they would
be as mute as Fiſhes; or if they did
fret and grieve inwardly for the Loſs
of their Intereſts; yet they would have
more Prudence (ask them elſe,) than to
ſhow their Anger openly, and perſecute
both <hi>Agent</hi> and <hi>Patient</hi> for it. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
then are they ſo cenſorious and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable
as to preach and believe ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Notion and Doctrine of our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors?</p>
                  <p>But if a falſe Prophet, for the ſubver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of an <hi>Hireling Prieſthood,</hi> ſhould,
in ſpite to the <hi>Clergy,</hi> counterfeit ſuch a
Miracle, and be detected in the Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
how then would Prieſts and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
Magiſtrates and Subjects behave up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it? Why, they would be full of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation,
and <hi>from that day forth would
take Council to put</hi> the Impoſtor and his
Confederate to Death, of which they
would be moſt deſerving; and if they
did not abſcond and fly for it, like <hi>Jeſus</hi>
                     <pb n="48" facs="tcp:1207700500:55"/>
and his Diſciples <hi>to a Wilderneſs in the
Country</hi> to hide themſelves, the Rage of
the Populace would hardly wait the
Leiſure of Juſtice to diſpatch and make
terrible Examples of them. Was not
this exactly the Caſe of <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture
in the Reſurrection of <hi>Lazarus,</hi>
and of the Puniſhment he was threaten'd
with, and afterwards moſt juſtly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went
for it?</p>
                  <p>Mankind may be in ſome Caſes very
obdurate, and ſo hard of Belief, as to ſtand
it out againſt Senſe, Reaſon and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration:
But I will not think worſe
of our Anceſtors than of the reſt of
Mankind; or that they any more than
others would have withſtood a clear and
indiſputable Miracle in <hi>Lazarus</hi>'s Reſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcitation.
Such a manifeſt Miracle, let
it be wrought for what End and Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
we can poſſibly imagine, would
ſtrike Men with Awe and Reverence;
and none could hate and perſecute the
Author of the Miracle; leaſt He who
could raiſe the dead, ſhould exert his
Power againſt themſelves, and either
wound or ſinite them dead with it.
For which Reaſon, the Reſurrection of
<hi>Lazarus,</hi> on the certain Knowledge of
our Anceſtors, was all Fraud, or they
would have reverenc'd and adored the
Power of him, that did it.</p>

It may be true, what <hi>John</hi> ſays, that
<hi>many of the Jews, who had ſeen the
Things that Jeſus did, believed on him,</hi>
that is, believed that he had wrought
here a great Miraale: But who were
theſe? the ignorant and credulous, whom
a much leſs <hi>juggler</hi> than Mr. <hi>Fawkes</hi>
could eaſily impos'd on. But on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

Commentators,</hi> that <hi>ſome of them</hi> did
not believe the Miracle, but <hi>went their
ways to the Phariſees and told them what
Things Jeſus had done,</hi> that is, told
them, after what manner the Intrigue
was managed; and complain'd of the
Fraud in it. How they came to ſuſpect

gueſs at it. Perhaps they diſcern'd ſome
motion in <hi>Lazarus</hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s Body, before the
Word of Command, to <hi>come forth,</hi> was
given; perhaps they diſcover'd ſome
Fragments of the Food, that for <hi>four
days</hi> in the Cave, he had ſubſiſted on:
But however this was, they could not
but take Notice of the <hi>Napkin about his
Face</hi> all the while; which <hi>Jeſus,</hi> to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
all ſuſpicion of Cheat, ſhould have
firſt order'd to be taken off, that his
mortify'd Countenance might be view'd,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:1207700500:57"/>
before the miraculous Change of it to
Life was wrought. This neglect in
<hi>Jeſus</hi> (which I wonder <hi>John</hi> had no
more Wit than to hint at) will be a laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Objection to the Miracle. <hi>Jeſus</hi>
was wiſer, than not to be aware of the
Objection, which he would have obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated,
if he durſt, by a Removal of the
Napkin, to the ſatisfaction of all Spec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators
there preſent. Becauſe this was
not done, we <hi>Jews</hi> now deny, there
was any Miracle wrought; and, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
our Unbelief upon this Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
be not well grounded, we appeal
to Chriſtian Prieſts themſelves, who
muſt own, that if there was a Miracle
here, the Matter was ill conducted by
<hi>Jeſus,</hi> or fooliſhly related by his <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is a ſad Misfortune, that attends our
modern enquiry after Truth, that there
are no other Memorials extant of the
Life and Miracles of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> than what
are written by his own Diſciples. Not
only old Time has devour'd, but Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
themſelves, (which in the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the impartial makes for us) when
they got Power into their Hands, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
deſtroy'd many Writings of our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors,
as well as of <hi>Celſus</hi> and <hi>Porphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
and others, which they could not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer;
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:1207700500:58"/>
otherwiſe I doubt not but they
would have given us clear Light into
the Impoſture of <hi>Lazarus</hi>'s Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
But if <hi>Jeſus,</hi> according to his own
<hi>Evangeliſts,</hi> was arraign'd for a <hi>Decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi>
and <hi>Blaſphemer,</hi> in pretending to the
Sonſhip and Power of God by his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles;
in all Probability this Piece of
Fraud in <hi>Lazarus</hi> was one Article of the
Indictment againſt him; and what makes
it very likely, is that the <hi>Chief Prieſts</hi>
and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> from the Date of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Miracle, <hi>took Council together to
put him to Death,</hi> not clandeſtinely or
tumultuouſly to murder him, but judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
to puniſh him with Death, which,
if they proved their Indictment by cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible
and ſufficient Witneſſes, he was
moſt worthy of.</p>
                  <p>As it is plain from the Story in <hi>John,</hi>
that there was a Diſpute among the By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanders
at <hi>Lazarus</hi>'s Reſurrection, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it was a real Miracle or not; ſo it
is the Opinion of us <hi>Jews,</hi> which is of
the Nature of a Tradition, that the
<hi>Chief-Prieſts</hi> and civil Magiſtrates of <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thany,</hi>
for the better Determination of
the Diſpute and quieting of the Minds of
the People, requir'd that <hi>Jeſus</hi> ſhould

declining this Teſt of his Power, the

of Unbelievers before, queſtion'd the
Reſurrection of <hi>Lazarus</hi>; and were high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
incens'd againſt both him and <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi>
for the Deceit in it. And this was
<hi>one</hi> Reaſon among others of that vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and univerſal Outcry and Demand,
at <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s Tryal, for his Crucifixion. I'll
not anſwer for the Certainty of this
Tradition or Opinion, but as the Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
was obvious, ſo it has the Face of
Truth and Credibility; and for the
Proof of it, I need only appeal to Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Magiſtrates</hi>; whether,
under a Diſpute of a Miracle of that
Conſequence, they would not require,
for full Satisfaction, it ſhould be acted
over again; and, if the <hi>Juggler</hi> refuſed,
whether there would not be a general
Clamour of People of all Ranks for his
<hi>Execution.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Matthev, Mark</hi> and <hi>Luke,</hi> who knew
as much of this Sham Miracle as <hi>John,</hi>
had not the Confidence to report it;
becauſe, when they wrote, many Eye-Witneſſes
of the Fraud were alive to
diſprove and contradict them; therefore
they confined their Narratives to <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s
leſs juggling Tricks, that had paſs'd more
current: But after the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> State
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:1207700500:62"/>
was diſſolved, their judicial Records were
deſtroy'd, and every Body dead that
could confute him, <hi>John</hi> ventures a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
the Story of this Miracle; and if
the good Providence of God had not
infatuated him, in the Inſertion of the
Circumſtances here obſerved, it might
have paſs'd through all Generations to
come, as well as it has done for many
paſt, for a grand Miracle.</p>
                  <p>Thus, <hi>Sir,</hi> have you a few of my
Thoughts on the pretended Miracle of
<hi>Lazarus</hi>'s Reſurrection. I have more to
beſtow on it, but that I would not be
tedious. There's no need to argue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the other two Reſurrection-Stories.
You know <hi>omne majus includit minus,</hi>
and if the greateſt of the three Miracles
be an Impoſture, the two leſs ones of
Conſequence are Artifice and Fraud.
And rather than the Miracle of <hi>Lazarus</hi>
ſhall ſtand its Ground, I'll have t'other
Bout at it from ſome other Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances;
the Conſideration of which will
make it as fooliſh and wicked an Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture,
as ever was contrived and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacted
in the World; ſuch a <hi>wicked Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſture</hi>
of moſt pernicious Conſequence to
the Welfare of the Publick, that it is
no Wonder, the People, by an unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Voice, call'd for the Releaſement
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:1207700500:63"/>
of <hi>Barabbas,</hi> a Robber and Murderer,
before <hi>Jeſus.</hi> I don't ſuppoſe theſe Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
againſt this Miracle will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing
of your Chriſtian <hi>Clergy,</hi> who are
hired to the Belief of it. But howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
a <hi>Biſhop</hi> of many <hi>thouſands</hi> a Year
to believe, can't in Conſcience deny,
that the Arguments above are a ſufficient
Juſtification of our <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Disbelief of
it.</p>
                  <p>If you, Sir, ſhould write a Diſcourſe
gainſt the Letter of the Story of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi>'s
Reſurrection, I beg of you to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
of a few of my Conceptions on that
Head, which, I promiſe you, ſhall be
out of the common Road of thinking.
Your <hi>Divines</hi> think they have exhauſted
that Subject, and abſolutely confuted
all Objections that can be made againſt
it, but are much miſtaken. Sometimes
we <hi>Jews</hi> dip into their Writings on this
Head, and always ſmile with Indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
at their fooliſh Invectives againſt the
Blindneſs of the Eyes, and Hardneſs of
the Hearts of our Anceſtors. If they
would but favour us with a Liberty to
write for our ſelves, a reaſonable Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
which in this Philoſophical Age we
don't deſpair of, eſpecially under ſo wiſe
juſt and good a Civil Adminiſtration, as
this Nation is happily bleſs'd with, we
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:1207700500:64"/>
would cut them out ſome more Work,
which they are not aware of. In the
mean Time I am your aſſured Friend,</p>
                  <closer>
                     <signed>N. N.</signed>
                  </closer>
               </body>
            </floatingText>
            <p>So ends the Letter of my Friend, the
<hi>Jewiſh Rabbi,</hi> which conſiſts of <hi>calm</hi> and
<hi>ſedate</hi> Reaſoning, or I would not have
publiſh'd it; for I am reſolv'd he ſhall no
more impoſe upon me with his ludicrous
and bantering Stuff, like his Satirical In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vective
againſt <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s Miracle of <hi>turning
Water into Wine,</hi> ſo offenſive to our Godly
<hi>Biſhops.</hi> And becauſe it conſiſts of <hi>calm</hi>
and <hi>ſedate</hi> Reaſoning, which <hi>Biſhop Smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broke</hi>
allows of, I hope his <hi>Lordſhip</hi> will
take it into Conſideration, and write an
Anſwer to it, which I, without the Help
of the Myſtery, can't do.</p>
            <p>If the foreſaid <hi>Letter</hi> be offenſive to our
<hi>Clergy,</hi> who don't judge it meet that the
<hi>Jews</hi> ſhould take this Liberty to write
againſt the Miracles of our Saviour, and in
Vindication of their own disbelief of Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity,
I beg of them, for the Love of
<hi>Jeſus,</hi> not to let their Diſpleaſure be viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
ſeen; becauſe the <hi>Jews</hi> will then laugh
in their Sleeves, and perhaps openly inſult
and triumph upon it: But if they will pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately
acquaint me with their Diſpleaſure
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:1207700500:65"/>
at it, I'll promiſe them to hold no more
Correſpondence with ſuch <hi>Jewiſh Rabbies</hi>;
neither will I ever hereafter publiſh any other
Objections againſt <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Religion and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,
than what come from the <hi>Hoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tots</hi>
and <hi>Pawawers:</hi> and then it will be
ſtrange, if our dignified <hi>Clergy,</hi> of moſt
grave and demure Looks, can't ſolidly
confute the worſt, that ſuch ignorant and
illiterate People can urge againſt them.</p>
            <p>And thus have I done with my Objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
againſt the Letter of theſe three Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles.
If our <hi>Divines</hi> ſhall think there is
little or nothing of Force in them; then
an Anſwer, which I ſhould be glad to ſee,
may the more eaſily be made to them.
As for my part, without being conceited
of the Acuteneſs and Strength of any of
the Objections, I think it impoſſible ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factorily
to reply to them, without having
Recourſe to the Opinions of the Fathers,
that theſe three Miracles, whether they
were ever litterally tranſacted or not, are
now but emblematical Repreſentations of
myſterious and more wonderful Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to be perform'd by <hi>Jeſus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To the Fathers then let us go for their
myſtical Interpretation of theſe Miracles.
St. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> in his Introduction to a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:1207700500:66"/>
               <note n="29" place="bottom">Quidam corporalia ejus Miracula ſtupentes, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jora intueri non norunt.

of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and have no Conſideration of

on Men's Bodys, without being aſtoniſh'd

with Admiration his more wonderful
Works on Men's Souls, after the ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of bodily Miracles. And theſe are
the Chriſtians that conform their Studies
to the Will of our Lord; who would
have his corporal Miracles, ſpiritually
interpreted: For He wrought not Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles

Miracles abſtractedly conſider'd; but
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:1207700500:67"/>

can attain to the myſtical Signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s Miracles, are the beſt
Scholars and moſt learn'd Diſciples in
his Church and School. And, (<hi>ſpeaking

Miracles, that he might ſignify ſomewhat

to learn and conſider of. Come
now, <hi>ſays he,</hi> and let us ſee what we are
miſtically and ſpiritually to underſtand
by the Stories of the three Perſons rais'd
from the dead."</p>
            <p>There are two Ways, that the Fathers

<pb n="59" facs="tcp:1207700500:68"/>
ſorts of dead Perſons, ſo rais'd to Life,
are Figures of three ſorts of Sinners,
whom <hi>Jeſus</hi> raiſeth from the death of Sin
to the Life of Righteouſneſs. They who
have conceiv'd Sin in their Hearts, and
have not brought it forth into Act; are
figured by <hi>Jairus</hi>'s Daughter, who lay
dead in the Houſe of her Father, and was
not taken forth to her Burial. Others,
who after Cogitation and Conſent, paſs into
actual Sin are figured by the Young Man,
carried towards his Grave. But thoſe
Sinners, who are habituated and long ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtom'd
to Sin, are like <hi>Lazarus</hi> bury'd,
and in a ſtinking Condition under the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:1207700500:69"/>
of it; whom <hi>Jeſus,</hi> for all that,
with the <hi>loud Voice</hi> of the Praedication of
his Goſpel, will call forth out of the
Death and Grave of their Sins to a new
Life. So does St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> make theſe
three dead Perſons and their Reſurrections,
Emblems of the ſaid three Sorts of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
who are dead in Treſpaſſes and Sins,
and by the Power of <hi>Jeſus</hi> quicken'd to a
Life of Righteouſneſs. And to this Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of St. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> do St. <hi>Ambroſe, Euſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius
Gallicanus,</hi> and Venerable <hi>Bede</hi> agree.
And according to this Notion of theſe
Miracles they deſcend to a particular Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
of the ſeveral Parts of their Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.

Circumſtance of theſe three Miracles,

find, and ſave me the Trouble of a tedious

            <p>But the other myſtical Way of interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
theſe three Miracles is by making
them Types of three great Events at the
Time of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s ſpiritual Advent. Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
the raiſing of <hi>Jairus</hi>'s Daughter is
a Type of the Converſion of the <hi>Jews</hi> at
that Day, as <hi>Euſebius Gallicanus</hi> 
               <note n="35" place="bottom">Quod enim tunc temporis factum eſt in una Puella, hoc in fine Temporum futurum eſt, ut fiat in tota. Sonagoga. <hi>In Homil. Feriae</hi> 5<hi>ta post Domin.</hi> 4<hi>tam.</hi>

the myſtical Reſurrection or Reſtitution of
the <hi>Jewiſh Synagogue,</hi> call'd <hi>Jairus</hi>'s
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:1207700500:72"/>
Daughter, will <hi>Jeſus</hi> come <note n="38" place="bottom">Ad hanc ergo Principis filiam dum properat Dei Verbum, ut ſalvos faceret filios Iſrael, ſancta Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſia de Gentibus congregata, quae inferiorum Lapſu Criminum deperibat, paratam aliis fide praeripuit Sani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem. <hi>St. Ambroſ. in Loc.

               </note> at the
ſame Time he heals the Woman of the
Church of her Iſſue of Blood. And this is
the Reaſon that the Stories of theſe two
Miracles are blended together by the <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts,</hi>
with their ſynchronical Numbers
of the Age of the <hi>Girl</hi> and of the Diſeaſe
of the Woman; becauſe they are Types of
that bleſſed Scene of Affairs at the Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of the <hi>Jews,</hi> when the Fulneſs of the
<hi>Gentiles</hi> is come in. Concerning which
bleſſed ſtate of the Church, <hi>Origen</hi> 
               <note n="39" place="bottom">Quarum Rerum Cauſa multa fuere Jeſu Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cula. <hi>In Johan. Cap. XI.</hi>
               </note>
ſays, <hi>Jeſus</hi> wrought many Miracles, by
Way of Type and Figure.</p>
            <p>Among all the Miracles that <hi>Jeſus</hi>
wrought, and are recorded by the <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts,</hi>
I think, as far as I have had Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to obſerve, the Fathers are moſt ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in their Interpretations of that of the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:1207700500:73"/>
Widow of <hi>Naim</hi>'s Son: Excepting what
is before noted of his being a figure of a
Sinner dead in actual, tho not habitual
Sin, I find very little. But if <hi>Origen</hi>'s
Comments on this Miracle had been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant,
I dare ſay he would have given us
this following Interpretation of it. This
Widow, he would have call'd the Church;
and her <hi>only Son</hi> or maſculine Offspring, he
would have call'd the <hi>Spiritual Senſe</hi> of
the Scriptures, which is now dead, and
that the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of the <hi>Letter,</hi> who are
his Bearers, are for interring him within
the <hi>Earth</hi> of the <hi>Letter:</hi> But <hi>Jeſus,</hi> upon
his Spiritual Advent will put a ſtop to the
Intention of ſuch Bearers, by reviving the
<hi>Spiritual Senſe</hi> of the Scriptures; and by
reſtoring it, like a <hi>quicken'd Son,</hi> to the
Comfort of his Mother, the Church; who
has been in a ſorrowful and lamentable
Condition upon the Death and Want of
it. This, I am ſure, would be <hi>Origen</hi>'s
Interpretation of this Miracle, which, if I
had Room here, by a little Circumlocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
I could prove.</p>
            <p>As to <hi>Lazarus</hi>'s Reſurrection, it is in the
Opinion of the Fathers <note n="40" place="bottom">Per Lazarum Genus humanum oſtenditur. <hi>Theop. Antioch. in Loc. Johan.</hi> Noſtra Reſurrectio figuratur per Lazari Reſurrectionem.—Spelunca ſive Sepulchrum Lazari Litteram Legis umbratilem de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignat.—<hi>Magna Voce clamavit Jeſus,</hi> id <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

<pb n="65" facs="tcp:1207700500:74"/>
general and myſtical Reſurrection of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
in the Perfection of Time. But this
is a moſt copious Subject; and unleſs I
could here throughly handle it, I had much
better ſay nothing.</p>
            <p>And thus have I done with the three
Reſurrection Stories. If the <hi>Convocation,</hi>
next Seſſion, would determine by an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox
Vote, whether <hi>Jeſus</hi> rais'd any
more, than the ſaid three Perſons, from
the dead or not; I would preſent them
with a new and more entertaining Chain
of Thoughts againſt theſe Miracles; ſuch
a Chain of Thoughts, as, upon the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion,
let them hold which Side of the
Queſtion they pleaſe, will neceſſarily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
us to hold the myſtical Meaning of
theſe Miracles, or to grant that <hi>Jeſus</hi>
rais'd none from the dead at all.</p>
            <p>My next and laſt <hi>Diſcourſe</hi> on <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s
Miracles ſhall be againſt the Letter of the
Story of his own Reſurrection, in which,
if our <hi>Biſhops</hi> will keep their Temper
and Patience, till I publiſh it, I'll cut
out ſuch a Piece of Work for our <hi>Boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lean</hi>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:1207700500:75"/>
               <hi>Lectures,</hi> as ſhall hold them tug, ſo
long as the <hi>Miniſtry</hi> of the <hi>Letter</hi> and an
<hi>Hireling Prieſthood</hi> ſhall laſt. If <hi>Chriſt be
not riſen,</hi> then, according to the Inference
of St. <hi>Paul, is their Preaching vain</hi>; and
why ſhould the People be any longer
charg'd with the Maintenance of an igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
and idle Order of Men, to no Uſe and
Purpoſe?</p>
            <p>If I had not had Experience of it, I
could never have believed that, for all the
ludicrous Nature of theſe <hi>Diſcourſes,</hi> our
<hi>dignified Clergy</hi> could have been ſo fooliſh
or malicious as to proſecute me for an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidel</hi>
and <hi>Blaſphemer</hi> upon them. How a
Man may be miſtaken in himſelf! I took
my ſelf for a real Advocate for the Truth
of Chriſtianity; and was ſo vain as to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
theſe Diſcourſes tended to a Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration
of <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s Meſſiahſhip: And tho
the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>London</hi> may be of a contrary
Opinion, yet I am ſtill ſo conceited of
my Ability to defend our Religion, that
I'll ſtake my Life againſt his <hi>Biſhoprick,</hi>
which I'll not be troubled with, if I win it,
that he can't form an Objection againſt
Chriſtianity, which I can't ſolidly confute,
and make our Readers merry too, with his
Weakneſs and Impertinence in it. But
perhaps it may be unbecoming of his
Lordſhip's Character, and againſt the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:1207700500:76"/>
Grain, to make an Objection to that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
which he finds much <hi>temporal,</hi> as
well as ſome <hi>ſpiritual</hi> Comfort in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
of; I will therefore deſcend to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Propoſal, <hi>viz.</hi> If he'll but publiſh
an Anſwer to the <hi>Jewiſh Rabbi</hi>'s Letter in
this Diſcourſe, and vouchſafe me the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of a Reply to him; then (to ſave the
Civil Magiſtrate's Trouble) I will ſuffer
any Puniſhment that in his Clemency he
ſhall think fit to inflict on me, for what's
paſt. Oh, what a Hazard do I here run of
Life or Liberty!</p>
            <p>Some Chriſtians, in my Caſe, would
think it a ſad Misfortune to be odiouſly
repreſented as an <hi>Infidel</hi> and <hi>Blaſphemer</hi>;

ſuch Obloquies, Slanders and Defama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
and would not give a Ruſh to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move

can be an Infidel or Blaſphemer. Upon
