            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>A Surprizing Phaenomenon, was ſeen with us here in the Air, at Eight at Night, on <hi>Thurſday</hi> laſt, much like the Deſcription of what was lately at <hi>Venice;</hi> a ſudden Appearance of a Globe of Fire, equal to the apparent Bigneſs and Bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Sun, illuminating the whole Region as at Noon-day. After a ſmall Pauſe at its firſt break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out (in the South-weſt, betwixt <hi>Orion</hi>'s <hi>Girdle,</hi> and the <hi>Great Dog,</hi> at about 20° Elev.) it ſhot ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizontally with pretty great Velocity into the South-eaſt, leaving a Stream of Light in the Air, and diſappear'd in about 6″ from its firſt Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; but the Streams of Light were continued for a quarter of an Hour, ſeparated into two or three

If my Globe be rightly made, it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween 14 or 15 Degrees high, and about 50 Degrees from the South, counting Weſtward.

be above 10 Degrees high, and was between 37 and 42 Degrees from the South to the Weſtward.</p>

                  <p>ON <hi>Thurſday</hi> Night I ſaw the ſhaking Meteor you make mention of. I was abroad in the Yard, before our Commiſſioner's Door, and obſerv'd both the Beginning, and almoſt the whole Continuance of it: which I take to be thus:</p>
                  <p>At 4 Minutes paſt 8 a Clock, due Weſt from the Place I ſtood, about 40 Degrees high, firſt appear'd a round reddiſh Ball (as near as I could gueſs) 8 or 10′ Diameter, which deſcended ſlowly down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, a little inclining to the South, and all the while encreaſing its Magnitude; when it came with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in 20 Deg. of the Horizon, it alter'd its Motion more aſlant to the Southward, and increas'd its Brightneſs and Magnitude prodigiouſly, till its leaſt Diameter was about 26 to 28 Minutes; its Light and Brightneſs being equal to the Sun, but of a whiter Colour. (I take the Redneſs you mention to proceed from the ſmoaky Air you live in.) The Air was clear, except two thin Clouds through which it paſs'd, as if the Clouds had been heated or ſet on Fire in that Part, and which continu'd near half an Hour. Your Letter, and ſome other Accounts I have ſeen, ſay it continued half a Minute, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed I gueſt by the Slowneſs of the Motion it was near a Minute before it diſappear'd; and when it came within 7 or 8 Deg. of the Horizon my Sight was obſtructed at a Tar-houſe that intercepted. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny People affirm they heard a Noiſe ſometime af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it like to Thunder, or a hot Iron quench'd in Water: and I thought I heard ſuch a Noiſe faintly,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0764901700:6"/>
—which ſeem'd to be about <hi>Yarmouth</hi> in the <hi>Iſle of Wight</hi>—I have ſeen and ſpoke with ſome that were about 28 Miles farther Weſtward, who affirm they did hear ſuch a Noiſe very diſtinctly.</p>

                  <p>LAST Night, a few Minutes before eight a Clock, we had here the terribleſt Flaſh of Lighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that I believe was ever ſeen; it laſted about three Minutes, as near as I can gueſs. It was ſo great that it quite obſcur'd the Light of the Moon, tho' it was a very bright Night. There appear'd in the Sky a Stream as it were of Fire for ſome Minutes after, and at ſome Diſtance as it were a Cloud of Smoke. The Phaenomenon was ſo very ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing, that I did not at firſt well know what to make of it, till after gazing at it about three or four Minutes, we heard a great Clap of Thunder, which at firſt reſembled the Noiſe of Canon, the moſt I e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver heard in my Life.</p>

                  <p>SITTING at the Fire-ſide about Eight a Clock at Night, the <hi>Moon</hi> ſhining then very bright, and the Sky clear, not the leaſt Cloud to be ſeen, on the ſudden there appeared a very great Light far brighter than the Sun at Noon-day, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with ſo great an Heat, that the Arm of mine which was next to the Window burnt for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Hours as if it had been ſcalded. There was ſo great a Smoak, that I thought, and ſo did ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others, that all the Ground had been on Fire; but we ſoon perceived that it was in the Sky. The Light came from the North-Eaſt (which is the Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation of our Room) it ſeem'd to go very ſwift over our Houſe, and ſo over the Church to the South-Weſt. In a very ſhort time it returned back again (but not near ſo big) and as it appeared to us, broke juſt over the Church, like a Sky-Rocket, but ſo large, and with ſo many Sparks of Fire, that it left ſo great a Redneſs (ſeemingly to us juſt the breadth and length of the Church) that it look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed like all Blood, and gave the ſame Reflexion into the Rooms on the other ſide of the Houſe. Some Minutes after this (I ſhould think at leaſt ſeven or eight) we heard a Report like a great Canon (much greater than ever I heard.) It ſhook the Houſe and Windows very much. About a
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0764901700:9"/>
Minute after, there went off to our thinking, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout thirty, not ſo big. They ſounded juſt as the Tower-Guns did, when we were in <hi>Mincing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lane,</hi> but ſhook the Houſe and Windows much more. After this, we heard ſmaller, with a Sound like Drums and Trumpets, which laſted but a ſhort Time. After the Light went off, although the Moon ſeemed to ſhine bright; for about two Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes, it was ſo dark, that we could not ſee our Hands.</p>

                  <p>COming Home this Evening, about 8 a Clock, thro' St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Church-Yard, on the North ſide, my Face being Weſtward, I diſcern'd in the Sky a large Ball of Fire, at about 20 or 25° height from the Horizon, and bearing about <hi>W.</hi> and by <hi>N.</hi> or <hi>W.N.W.</hi> when I firſt ſaw it: It ſeem'd to be as large as the Moon at Full, with a pale blewiſh Light, and to have little Motion; but in a Moment it was thrown into the Shape of a common Meteor, the Head di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhing 'till it was all turn'd into a long Stream of Light, which extended to about 50 or 60° in the Heavens toward <hi>S.W.</hi> and on an Angle of about 10 or 15° from a Parallel with the Horizon, but the broadeſt part of this Stream was at leaſt double to the Diameter of its firſt Appearance, and made ſo ſtrong a Light while it was in its greateſt Extent, that for a Moment the Moon, which was above a Day paſt the firſt Quarter, and all the Stars, ſeem'd to diſappear by the Superiority of this new Light; and at that Moment one might have read the ſmalleſt Print by it. While it was throwing it ſelf into this beautiful Stream, I thought I heard a Noiſe of hiſſing, like what is made by the flying of a large Rocket in the Air, but I heard no other Noiſe. The Light, tho' very ſtrong, was very a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the Eye, and as it vaniſh'd it turn'd from a bright Pale to a Yellowiſh Colour. The Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the whole I do not think was above half a Minute, and of the greateſt Light not the tenth part of a Minute.</p>

                  <p>ON <hi>Thurſday</hi> the 19th of <hi>March,</hi> 1718-9, at 8h 11 ſo eſtimated by a Pendulum Clock, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd the next Day with an Horizontal Dial made at <hi>London;</hi> but without allowing any thing for its deviating a little from the true <hi>North</hi> to the <hi>Eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</hi> At that Time, I ſay, I was walking in my Chamber, with my Face towards the Window, made of a clear Glaſs, from which I was at about three or four Foot Diſtance, when I ſaw on a ſudden, through it, at the <hi>South Weſt,</hi> a very great Flaſh of Fire, expreſs'd in the Figure by A B. I open'd inſtantly the Window, from whence I had a clear Proſpect of that Part of Heaven, except a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout three or four Degrees next to the Horizon. The whole Space A B, was fill'd up in an Inſtant, with a very bright Flame, which might laſt about four Seconds of Time, and perhaps not above two or three Seconds, and ſo did ſuddenly vaniſh, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in the very ſame Place A B, a ſmall thin Cloud, of a grey Colour, ſomewhat reddiſh. At the ſame Time, a ſmall Fire continu'd from B, to run leiſurely along the Line B E C, leaving all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long behind it a grey Stream, about 15′ broad. The Line B E C, was very uniform, a little bend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towards <hi>Sirius;</hi> but the Edges or Sides of it were rough, and not uniform as the Line it ſelf, this Part being in ſome Places a very little broader or narrower than in others. The whole Figure A B E C reſembled exactly a Rod or Staff. The Fire might be about five Seconds in deſcribing the Line B E C, having its handle about 1d broad in A B, in a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect continued Line with the reſt. While the Line B C was a forming, it look'd exactly as if a Roc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket, or a Bomb, had been thrown in our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood. The viſible Remains of this whole Phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomenon
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0764901700:14"/>
continuing about a Quarter of an Hour, gave me an Opportunity of delineating it immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately, with the Stars about it. But becauſe of the Impoſſibility of making a plain Figure, repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing truly ſo great a Part of Heaven, unleſs it be in the Nature of a Projection, I have reduc'd here my Figures to a Planiſphere, whereof the <hi>Zenith</hi> is the Center, the Eye being ſuppos'd in the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite Point, in the Surface of the Sphere. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, I have placed the Stars only by Eſtimation, as my Figures directed me, without uſing any Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the Stars, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In my Draught, I ſuppos'd for a Foundation, that the higher-moſt Star in <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion,</hi> was about 30d high, as I judg'd it to be by Eſtimation. The Situations and Proportions are very near the Matter in the Figure, including in it <hi>Procyon;</hi> at leaſt they are ſo near the Matter, that from this Obſervation, and any tolerable Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion beſide, made in <hi>England,</hi> &amp;c. from any Place fit for that Purpoſe, it may be very ſafely determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned how high this Phenomenon was from the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of the Globe; what Places it was perpendicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar upon; what was its true Bigneſs and Figure, and real Swiftneſs in Burning; and how much it was leaning at its Extremity C, either towards <hi>Worceſter</hi> or from it; and laſtly, whether the Line A B E C, was really uniform in it ſelf, and almoſt ſtreight; or, whether it only ſeemed ſo to me, as being at <hi>Worceſter.</hi> As ſoon as we knew that this Phenomenon had been ſeen at <hi>London,</hi> and that there, as they ſaid, it gave as great a Light as in the Day Time, I concluded that it had been ſeen in <hi>Cornwall</hi> too. The printed Account, in a Letter from <hi>Plimouth, March</hi> the 20th, though very gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and upon that Account imperfect; yet enables us to gueſs very well at the Height and Bigneſs, and Situation of the bright Part A B, of this Phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomenon; and that with ſo much the more Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, becauſe the Part A B was very near the <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nith</hi> at <hi>Plimouth.</hi>

N.B. <hi>That this curious Author's Computation of the middle Point of the larger Part of the Meteor, or of it when it was burſting to Pieces in its Exploſion, is ſcarce</hi> 22½ <hi>Miles. But then, that is only on the Suppoſition that that Point was perpendicularly over</hi> Plimouth, <hi>as ſome imperfect Accounts at firſt ſaid; whereas the Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons by the Stars which are among the exacteſt I have heard of, compar'd with others already ſet down, will prove, That that Point was not then over</hi> Pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth, <hi>but rather over the middle of</hi> Bretaign <hi>in</hi> France; <hi>which greater Diſtance will by the ſame Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of Computation, afford us near forty Miles Alti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, which agrees with the moſt accurate Obſervations of the Interval, between the Sound and the Light, and with the reſt of the Obſervations by the Stars already ſet down; and indeed, with the Generality of the Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations every where that I have met with; and may therefore, I think, be entirely depended on by us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>NOW the proper Reſult of all theſe Accounts, and of many others that I have ſeen and heard, is this; That this Meteor was compos'd of Nitro-ſulphureous Vapours, or Exhalations, collected firſt together in the upper Regions of the Air, over <hi>Radnorſhire</hi> in <hi>Wales,</hi> or the neighbouring Counties: That it was at firſt ſmaller, and to Appearance like a large Star only; that it gathered more Fewel as it rolled along, and grew larger and larger all the Way; that its Courſe was nearly Parallel to the Horizon, and its Direction nearly South, or a very ſmall matter towards the South-Weſt: That by the time it came to be Vertical, between <hi>Cardiff</hi> in <hi>Wales</hi> and, and <hi>Minehead</hi> in <hi>Somerſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> over the <hi>Severn</hi> Sea, it was become vaſtly large and bright, ſo as to exceed the Noon-day Sun in Splendor, near that Line along which it paſs'd, and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0764901700:16"/>
to equal its apparent Magnitude alſo: That it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in this manner quite over <hi>Devonſhire,</hi> but much nearer the Eaſtern Limits of it, than the Weſtern: That it paſt almoſt perpendicularly over the City of <hi>Exeter,</hi> and ſo over the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Channel, till it came over <hi>Bretaign</hi> in <hi>France:</hi> That all this while its Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude and Light were not impair'd; that it made a hiſſing Noiſe like a Rocket all the way, and ſpread a prodigious and continued Lightening, even to the utmoſt Limits of the whole Horizon: That upon its coming near to <hi>Bretaign</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> it began to burſt to Pieces and diſſolve, with a prodigious Noiſe, which endur'd for ſome time, anſwering to the time of its burſting to Pieces, all the while it was diſſolving: That it left a large Smoke, or ſort of Cloud along all that Space where it burſt, above 100 Miles in Length, over our Channel and <hi>Bretaign,</hi> and perhaps ſomewhat further towards <hi>Bell-Iſle:</hi> That the Noiſe of this Explo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionw as heard all along its Courſe, and 50 or 60 Miles at leaſt on both Sides of it; firſt like a vaſt Number of great Guns diſcharg'd together; and then like the rattling or interrupted Noiſe of Drums; ſuch as are in both Caſes uſual in and after great Claps of Thunder: That this Meteor, while it was diſſolving, ſeems to have ſent out leſſer Streams of Light, backwards to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Wales</hi> from the North-end; and backwards to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Exeter,</hi> from the South-end, before it intirely va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed: After which, certain Traces or Streams of the fiery Vapors continued ſor a quarter of an Hour, as Marks where it had paſſed: That this Meteor muſt have been about 38 or 40 Miles in perpendicular Height from the Earth all along, tho' perhaps ſomewhat lower towards its diſſolution: That it went from <hi>Radnor</hi> in <hi>Wales,</hi> to the utmoſt Parts of <hi>Bretaign</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> or about 300 Miles, in 7 or 8″ of Time; or at the Rate of above 2000 Miles in a Minute: That it muſt have been viſible, wherever Clouds did not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſe, within the Compaſs of an Oval, whoſe lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Axis, drawn nearly through <hi>Radnor</hi> and <hi>Bell-Iſle,</hi> muſt have been about 1400 Miles, and its leſſer at right Angles thereto about 1100 Miles, <hi>i. e.</hi> through
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0764901700:17"/>
all <hi>Great Britain</hi> and <hi>Ireland;</hi> through <hi>Holland, Flanders,</hi> the Weſtern Parts of <hi>Germany,</hi> all <hi>France,</hi> and the North-Eaſt Parts of <hi>Spain,</hi> with <hi>Lombardy</hi> in <hi>Italy:</hi> And that it was really about a Mile in Diameter: That therefore it was truly a <hi>Meteor,</hi> or what properly, during its whole Courſe, was within the Limits of our Atmoſphere: As both the hiſſing Noiſe during its Paſſage, and the terrible Thunder afterwards, do plainly demonſtrate. It being well known that no Sound can be propagated, but through the elaſtical Medium of the Air. The remaining Traces of this Meteor left in the ſame Air, and ſeen therein for a quarter of an Hour after it was gone, are alſo evident Demonſtrations of the ſame thing.</p>

It ſeemed to riſe out of the North-Eaſt, and to paſs by the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian to the South-Weſt Parts of the Heavens, near the ſame Tract that the Sun had gone that Day; and diſappear'd behind thick Clouds, where, with a mighty Noiſe, it was ſuppos'd to be blown to pieces and diſpers'd.

<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0764901700:23"/>
either in their <hi>Bigneſs,</hi> which is uſually about or under a Mile in Diameter; while Comets are uſually of the Bigneſs of Planets, or ſeveral thouſand Miles in Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter: or in their <hi>Nature,</hi> which is that of Light or Fire; while Comets are ever as dark or opake in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as the Planets; or in their <hi>Trajectory,</hi> which in Comets is a Line deſcending to, and aſcending from the Sun, and nearly parabolical; while theſe Meteors ſtill paſs in a manner parallel to the Earth's Horizon: or in their <hi>Velocity,</hi> which in theſe Meteors is very diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, but in Comets near the Earth is always the ſame; or in their <hi>Atmoſpheres,</hi> of which theſe Meteors are ſtill deſtitute; but which almoſt always encompaſs the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of Comets, and that to a vaſt Diſtance; or in their <hi>Tails,</hi> of which we have no Signs in theſe Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teors, but which almoſt as certainly accompany the Comets as do their Atmoſpheres themſelves, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed derived from them: or in their <hi>viſible Duration,</hi> which in theſe Meteors is ſeldom many Minutes, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently not many Seconds, but in Comets is uſually many Days or Weeks, nay ſometimes Months.

            <p n="4">IV. I ſhall now give a like Account of Dr. <hi>Halley</hi>'s Hypotheſis about theſe Meteors; <hi>viz.</hi> That they are a ſort of <hi>fortuitous Collection of ſuch Vapours</hi> in the vaſt Void about us, as by Accident only fall into our At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſphere, at certain times; without any other relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereto; with my Reaſons againſt that Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis.</p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Halley</hi> gives us his Hypotheſis, <hi>Tranſact. No.</hi> 341. <hi>p.</hi> 162. in theſe Words, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"I have, ſays he, much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0764901700:24"/>
this Appearance, and think it one of the hardeſt things to account for that I have yet met with in the Phaenomena of Meteors; and am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to think that it muſt be ſome Collection of Matter form'd in the Aether, <hi>as it were by ſome fortui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous Concourſe of Atoms;</hi> and that the Earth met with it as it paſt along in its Orb, then but newly form'd, and before it had conceiv'd any great <hi>Impetus</hi> of Deſcent toward the Sun. For the direction of that over <hi>Italy</hi> was exactly oppoſite to that of the Earth, that is, its Courſe was from <hi>W.S.W.</hi> to <hi>E.N.E.</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Meteor ſeem'd to move the contrary way; and beſides, falling into the Power of the Earth's Gravity, and loſing its Motion from the Oppoſition to the Medium, it ſeems that it deſcended towards the Earth, and was extinguiſh'd in the <hi>Tyrrhene</hi> Sea, to the Weſt South Weſt of <hi>Leghorn.</hi> The great Blow being heard upon its firſt Immerſion into the Water, and the rattling like the driving a Cart over Stones, being what ſucceeded upon its quenching; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like which is always obſerv'd upon quenching a very hot Iron in Water.</q> Thus far Dr. <hi>Halley.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the plain Reaſons why I can no way agree to this Hypotheſis, are theſe:</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) 'Tis very evident, there neither is, nor can be any ſuch <hi>Collection of Vapours form'd in the Aether, as it were by ſome fortuitous Concourſe of Atoms, and without Gravity,</hi> which the Dr. here ſuppoſes as the Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Hypotheſis. Such a Maſs of Matter in an immenſe Vacuum, without any Gravitation to the Sun, the Dr. well knows is a mere Chimaera, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting all the certain Philoſophy in the World. Nor can it be poſſibly ſuppos'd but by immediate Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on out of nothing, or by it ſelf emerging out of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, without being created, before it could be thus <hi>collected together;</hi> neither of which Notions, I imagine, will be juſtify'd by the Dr. himſelf, in his cool Thoughts. But let us for once ſuppoſe ſuch Maſſes of fiery Matter frequently collected in the Aether, tho' we know they cannot poſſibly be ſo collected; yet is it evident,</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:0764901700:25"/>
(2.) That if ſuch Meteors as theſe were thence de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd, they would appear at all ſorts of Diſtances, within the reach of their Light, or within the reach of a thouſand or two of Miles: For a Body ſo large, and a Light ſo nearly equal to that of the Sun, as theſe have, would certainly be viſible ſo far; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as it does not appear, that any of them have been yet ſeen ſo far as 50 Miles from the Earth.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) Theſe Meteors would, on ſuch an Hypotheſis, be equally of all Magnitudes whatſoever; ſuch fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itous Productions, if ſuch there were, going for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain by no Rule at all: Whereas thoſe above-mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſeem never to have been of a larger Size than this laſt, which was about a Mile in Diameter; and the reſt of no very great Variety therefrom.</p>
            <p n="4">(4.) They would and muſt all, upon this Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis, as the Dr. allows, in theſe Climates, go nearly with the ſame Velocity, and in the ſame Courſe, as to our Sight, <hi>i. e.</hi> from Eaſt to Weſt; becauſe their Motion being only apparent, muſt be deriv'd from the Earth's Motions, Annual and Diurnal, which are from Weſt to Eaſt, both the ſame way, and of one tenor. Whereas theſe Meteors go uncertainly, and without any regard to thoſe Motions at all. Accordingly, this laſt went almoſt directly South, and much faſter than even the annual Motion it ſelf; entirely contrary to this Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis.</p>
            <p n="5">(5.) If theſe Balls of Light or Fire were ſuch Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes as did not belong to our Atmoſphere, but only paſs'd through it accidentally, as Dr. <hi>Halley</hi> ſuppoſes; why do we not ſee them before our Atmoſphere reaches them? and after it leaves them, whenever it does ſo, as well as while they paſs through it? not to ſay, that the firſt Collection, as well as laſt Diſſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of theſe Meteors, does, by the Obſervations them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves appear, both to begin and end within the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of that Atmoſphere, and thereby ſhew they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly belong to it, entirely contrary to the Dr's. Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis.</p>
            <p n="6">(6.) If this was the Origin of theſe Meteors, why do they ſeldom or never hit againſt the Body of the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0764901700:26"/>
Earth it ſelf, or terraqueous Globe, but againſt the Air? Or rather, why does the Body of the Earth or terraqueous Globe, ſeldom or never hit againſt theſe Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teors, but only the Air, nay the upper Regions of the Air? Why do theſe Meteors ſeldom or never deſtroy a City, or burn up a Fleet, as well as paſs over our Heads, without doing us any Damage? The Earth's Diameter is near 8000 Miles; the Altitude of any ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Atmoſphere, as Dr. <hi>Halley</hi> has fully prov'd, is not 50 Miles, and thence the Diameter of the whole, not 8100 Miles. Now the Disk or biggeſt Circle of the larger Sphere will be to the Disk or biggeſt Circle of the ſmaller here, as the Squares of thoſe Numbers, or nearly as 40 to 41, and the Difference of thoſe Squares, or the Hazard of ſuch a Ball's hitting againſt the Earth, or the Atmoſphere, will be as the ſmaller Number to the Difference of thoſe Numbers, or as 40 to 1. Nay, ſince only the upper Regions of the Air, for in them alone theſe Meteors have been ſeen, are to be compar'd with the Earth; it will appear on a like Calculation, that the Hazard of ſuch a Ball's hitting againſt the Earth, is to that of its hitting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the upper Parts of the Atmoſphere, at leaſt as 100 to 1, or that, one with another, 100 of theſe ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Meteors will hit againſt the Earth it ſelf, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy all before them, for one that hits againſt the upper Regions of the Air; and above 100 will hit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt either the Earth, or lower Regions of the Air, for one that hits againſt thoſe upper Regions; to which yet we ſee Providence uſually, if not always confines them. I ſay that theſe Meteors ſeem ſeldom or never to hit againſt the terraqueous Globe it ſelf.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, Dr. <hi>Halley</hi> imagines, that thoſe which go off with a Report, as the principal certainly, and all probably do, muſt fall into the Sea, and in quenching make that Noiſe we hear after theſe Mete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors, and that one of thoſe already mentioned deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded towards the Earth, and was extinguiſhed particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly in the <hi>Tyrrhene Sea.</hi> But then, ſince that is a bare Hypotheſis, and without any Fact or Hiſtory to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port it, nay contrary to the known Obſervations them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0764901700:27"/>
while Dr. <hi>Hook</hi>'s Account, ſet down as above, aſſures us, that the <hi>Italian Meteor</hi> which Dr. <hi>Halley</hi> ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to fall into the Sea, only ſet behind a Cloud, I ſhall not need to confute it any farther. In ſhort, this whole Hypotheſis ſeems to me ſo very weak, that it can only be excus'd and forgiven on account of the many other noble and truly excellent Performances of its Author. Tho' I confeſs I think this Author ſhould not eaſily forgive himſelf in one thing, I mean that odd Inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation here made, as if there might be a <hi>formation of Meteors,</hi> at leaſt, if not of other Bodies alſo, <hi>as it were by ſome fortuitous Concourſe of Atoms;</hi> which, I venture to ſay it, is, at this time of Day eſpecially, as little a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to ſound Philoſophy, as to all the Notions we have of Providence and Religion.</p>
         </div>
         <div n="5" type="section">
            <p n="5">V. I ſhall now propoſe a New Hypotheſis of my own, for the Solution of theſe Appearances, <hi>viz.</hi> That they are no other than prodigious Storms, or Blaſts of Thunder and Lightening in the upper Regions of our Air: With my Reaſons for that Hypotheſis.</p>
            <p>Having therefore now given my Reaſons, why I cannot at all go into the Notions of either Dr. <hi>Wallis,</hi> or Dr. <hi>Halley</hi> in this Matter; I come to my own Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis, or Conjecture; ſo I ſhall yet call it: Tho' I confeſs the Evidence for it ſeems to me ſo ſtrong, that, if the future Phaenomena of this kind do confirm it, as much as I think thoſe do which we are hitherto acquainted withal, it may perhaps hereafter merit a higher Denomination.</p>
            <p>My Opinion therefore concerning ſuch Meteors, is plainly this, That they properly deſerve that Name of <hi>Meteors,</hi> as belonging directly to our Atmoſphere; and that they are no other than prodigious Storms or blaſts of Thunder and Lightening, of ſuch Thunder and Lightening, as is proper and peculiar to thoſe more elevated Regions of our Air in which they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear. In order to the true underſtanding of my meaning in which Hypotheſis, the Reader muſt obſerve, that the Air at 39 Miles high, is, by Dr. <hi>Halley</hi>'s Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0764901700:28"/>
agreed to now by all, about 2000 times ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer and weaker than it is here with us; that a Storm or Blaſt of this kind, even here below, ſeems to be a Collection of nitro-ſulphureous and fiery Vapors, into a ſort of a rolling Globe, or Whirl-wind of Fire; that this is that <hi>Fulmen</hi> or <hi>pernicious Lightning,</hi> which is ſo terrible in its Effects; that it is ſtill accompanied with that <hi>Fulgur</hi> or <hi>Flaſh,</hi> we call <hi>common Lightening,</hi> and with that <hi>Tonitru,</hi> that great rolling or rattling Noiſe which we call <hi>Thunder;</hi> and that ſuch Collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of nitro-ſulphureous or fiery Vapors may be vaſtly larger before they are limited or determined by the external Air, which by rarefaction is excluded from within, where it is ſo vaſtly rare, than the like Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections are with us: That the prodigious Velocity of ſuch Balls may alſo be better ſuppos'd in ſuch a rare and thin Medium, than in ours, ſo much denſer and thicker; and that ſo much the greater Quantity of nitro-ſulphureous Vapors will be ſpent and exhauſted by one ſuch Ball or Blaſt, than by one of ours here below, as it is in Magnitude greater; which will alſo render ſuch Phaenomena in the ſame Proportion rarer and ſeldomer in any certain region there than here.</p>
            <p>Theſe things being ſuppoſed, which appear to me very reaſonable; it will be a natural Account of theſe Phaenomenona, if we eſteem them direct Blaſts of this kind. For certainly theſe Fire-balls, as we have ſhew'd, are ſtill within the Limits of our Air, the Place of ſuch Meteors: They have all the three Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters of ſuch, and only of ſuch Blaſts; the <hi>Fulmen,</hi> the Ball or Whirlwind of pernicious Lightening; the <hi>Fulgur,</hi> the Flaſh or common Lightening; and the <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitra,</hi> the Noiſe or Thunder. They go with a Swiftneſs which we have no Examples of here in any Meteors, unleſs it be in ſuch Thunder and Lightening. So that I do not ſee room for much doubt in the Caſe. 'Tis true, the rareneſs of the Air above, will, as in all like Caſes, greatly deaden and damp the ſound of the Thunder; as no doubt it does; but this is no great difficulty here, becauſe the prodigious Vaſtneſs of the Blaſt, if it be at all ſo much more violent as
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0764901700:29"/>
the Fire-ball is greater in Quantity, as it muſt natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally be, will abundantly make up that Defect, and afford us a ſufficient Sound notwithſtanding; as will appear preſently by Calculation. I do not indeed know any mechanical Power, that in ſuch a fluid Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium as the Air, can cauſe ſo ſudden, and ſo prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous a Collection of fiery Vapors, and carry them in one particular horizontal Direction with ſuch an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe Velocity as we here meet with. But then, I am equally at a loſs for the mechanical Cauſe of the ſtrange Effects of Gun-powder, and of the like Cauſe of the Velocity, Force, and Direction of Thunder and Lightening, and indeed of many other Powers of Nature; of whoſe Exiſtence, yet, there is no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Queſtion. So that if it appear, that this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teor is no other than a Blaſt of Thunder and Ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tening, ſuch as is proper and peculiar to the higher Regions of the Air, as I hope it now does; we ought not to object this Difficulty againſt the preſent Soluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is built on the known Properties of nitro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulphureous Vapors in all ſuch Exploſions, whether of Gun-powder below, or of Thunder and Lightening a little above.</p>
         </div>
         <div type="conclusion">
            <p>And now, for a Concluſion, I ſhall Obſerve a few things which may, on this Occaſion, deſerve the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the Curious.</p>
            <p n="1">Note (1.) That ſuch a Collection of nitroſulphureous Vapours as this, of a Mile in Diameter, is to ſuch a Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of the like Vapours in the largeſt Thunder-Storms here below, of ſcarce 20 Feet Diameter, as the Cubes of thoſe Diameters, or as 16,000,000 to 1. So that the Exploſion or Force of ſuch a Ball of Fire as this would naturally, as to Light, Sound, and Strength, be in the ſame Proportion alſo. Whence it is queſtionable, whether if all the Gunpowder now in the World were laid together, and fir'd at once, it could make an Exploſion equal to this before us.</p>
            <p n="2">Note (2.) That therefore it is no Wonder that the Sound of this Exploſion was heard at the Diſtance of at leaſt 80 or 100 Miles from the Exploſion it ſelf, even through that upper Air, where it is about 2000 times
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0764901700:30"/>
rarer, and therefore in the ſame Proportion weaker than it is here below.</p>
            <p n="3">Note (3.) That therefore if this Ball of Fire had been directed downward, and come into our lower Air, and been there exploded, its Sound, at the ſame Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, would have been about 2000 times as great as it now was, So that beſides the ſad Deſolation that might ariſe from the Ball of Fire, which would have been vaſtly ſudden and terrible, the very Sound or Concuſſion of the Air would it ſelf have been exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dreadful, and very fatal alſo to all the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Animals, Trees, and Buildings whatſoever. Some of the ſmaller <hi>Meteors</hi> of this kind afford no Sound at this Diſtance; but the larger ſort, of which the laſt was the Principal, did ſo always to a great Degree, as the foregoing Hiſtories inform us.</p>
            <p n="4">Note (4.) That therefore a ſmaller <hi>Meteor</hi> of this ſort, or ſuch as ſome of the foregoing Hiſtories de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe, if it ſhould deſcend to the Earth, would be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly ſufficient utterly to deſtroy a particular Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and ſuch an one as this, no ſmall part of a County, and that in an inſtant, without giving the leaſt room for foreknowing, preventing, or eſcaping from the ſame.</p>
            <p n="5">Note (5.) That we know of no mechanical Cauſes that can prevent ſuch a Deſcent of theſe <hi>Meteors</hi> down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards: For as our common Thunder and Lightening certainly do, and that not ſeldom, deſcend from the Clouds to the Earth, and make leſſer Deſtructions there, ſo do ſome of the beſt Obſervations incline us to allow that even this, as well as others of theſe <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teors,</hi> have a little deſcended in their Courſe alſo. Nor in caſe of the original Direction downwards, do I know any ſufficient Obſtacle our lower Air, how denſe ſoever, could lay in its way; the Strength and Velocity of ſuch a <hi>Meteor,</hi> vaſtly exceeding any ſuch inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Reſiſtance. Yet it is to be noted,</p>
            <p n="6">(6.) That our late Hiſtories of thoſe <hi>Meteors</hi> of this kind, whoſe Heights have been meaſur'd, never give leſs than 30 Miles Altitude to any of them. Whence it appears, that the Great and Good Author of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0764901700:31"/>
has generally, in the Courſe of his Providence, confin'd them to the upper Regions of our Air, and preſerv'd the lower Parts of it, with the Inhabitants of the Earth and Seas, from the diſmal Effects of them; tho' that Confinement and Preſervation be provided for by Cauſes which no way appear to us at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</p>
            <p n="7">(7.) That we accordingly have no certain Accounts of any great Deſtruction brought upon Mankind by ſuch <hi>Meteors,</hi> excepting that amazing and divine Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah, Admah</hi> and <hi>Zeboim,</hi> which the Sacred Scriptures record, and to which all the Heathen Accounts alſo agree.

            <p>Now how exactly theſe Deſcriptions agree to a Countrey deſtroy'd by ſuch a terrible <hi>Meteor</hi> as this, I dare appeal to all ſober and conſiderate Naturaliſts: while the <hi>Rain of Fire and Brimſtone,</hi> or of <hi>Brimſtone on Fire,</hi> with nitrous Salts intermixed, is here literally true: while the <hi>Smoak like the Smoak of a Furnace,</hi> is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo literally true: it being evident in Fact, that all Vulcano's, great Guns, and ſuch <hi>Meteors</hi> as theſe, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly leave a mighty Smoak after their Exploſion: while the Salt Lake itſelf would eaſily thence ariſe, by the Penetration of ſuch fierce and fiery Particles into the Bowels of a Countrey, which was <hi>full of Slime-pits</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. xiv. 10.</note> already, and ſo prepared to take Fire: while it would thus eaſily deſtroy itſelf by a <hi>Subverſion,</hi> an <hi>Overthrow,</hi> or an Earthquake, and thereupon admit the Waters of the River <hi>Jordan,</hi> from the neighbouring <hi>Sea of the Plain,</hi> and would infect them with its nitrous and ſulphureous Vapours, and ſo become one great <hi>Salt,</hi> or <hi>Dead Sea,</hi> for all future Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: while the Remains of all this would naturally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce ſuch a barren Soil, full of Smoak and Aſhes, as
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0764901700:33"/>
we find adjoyning to the Salt Sea, by the foregoing Deſcriptions. This nitroſulphureous Shower would alſo naturally fall on <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife, while ſhe ſtayed a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle behind, <hi>looking back,</hi> as not fully believing God's threatning concerning this terrible Deſtruction, and would not only kill her in an inſtant, but render her Body immediately ſtiff and fixed, in the ſame Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture wherein ſhe was when it fell on her; which is no uncommon Circumſtance with us, when any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons have been kill'd by Lightening; and which would render her a ſtanding <hi>Pillar of Salt,</hi> of Nitrous Salt, in a literal Senſe; however, a <hi>Pillar of Salt</hi> for Perpetuity, or a laſting Monument of this terrible Judgment for future Generations. And ſo it prov'd, for it was ſtill in Being ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Years after our Saviour's Death,<note place="margin">

            <p n="8">Note (8.) That one great ordinary Intention and Uſe of theſe Meteors ſeems to be the ſame with that of the Tides for the Sea; and of Storms, whether of Wind, or of Thunder and Lightening, for the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Air; I mean not only the agitating the Air, but chiefly the purging and purifying of it, by ſpending and conſuming ſuch noxious Steams and Exhalations, as otherwiſe might be pernicious to Mankind, to the Bruit Animals, and to the other Inhabitants there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, if ſuch there be. I ſay, this ſeems to me at leaſt <hi>one of the Uſes</hi> of Thunder and Lightening, both here below, and there above; without preſuming to deny that there may be other Uſes of the ſame, or that theſe, as well as other Meteors, may be farther inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by Providence for Purpoſes which we have at preſent no certain Means of diſcovering. It does not follow, that becauſe the fixed Stars are very uſeful to us in Aſtronomy, that therefore Providence only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned them for that End. And the Caſe is the ſame in other Inſtances.</p>
            <p n="9">Note (9.) That there ſeem to have been of late more uncommon Meteors ſeen than have been uſual
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0764901700:34"/>
in the like Space of Time. Thus we have had at leaſt Eight or Nine of the Meteors of this kind taken Notice of in theſe Parts of the World, within 53 Years; while we know not where to find ſo many in a much longer Space in any elder Hiſtories. Thus alſo there have been more frequent and remarkable <hi>Aurorae Boreales,</hi> or <hi>Northern Lights,</hi> obſerv'd within ſomewhat more than three Years laſt paſt, than appear in our Hiſtorians, in a much longer Space. To ſay nothing of that pale Light like Twilight, which is chiefly ſeen between the Horizon and the <hi>Pleiades,</hi> about the End of <hi>February,</hi> and Beginning of <hi>March,</hi> which ſome have thought to be peculiar to the laſt 70 or 80 Years. Nor can it well be ſaid, that all this has happened only by the Negligence of the elder Writers in tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting ſuch Things to us: Since, on the contrary, they have generally been but over Superſtitious in ſetting down ſuch ſtrange Appearances, and of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting how ominous they thought them to Mankind.</p>
            <p n="10">Note (10.) That it no way appears that the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenter Phaenomena of theſe ſorts, have yet had any ill Influence on the natural World. The Seaſons, the Air, with the Fruits of the Earth, and the living Creatures, ſeeming in general to have received hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to no Damage thereby. And certainly, if they tend to purge the Air, as I imagine, they may have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved no ſmall Benefit from them. Nay indeed, in caſe they ſhould be deriv'd from any conſiderable or gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Change in our Air of late, I ſhould think it more probable that ſuch Change was for the Benefit and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the ſame, than the contrary.</p>
            <p n="11">Note (11.) That we have no reaſon to ſuppoſe that Comets, or Northern Lights, or theſe Meteors before us, with the like more unuſual Phaenomena of Nature, are properly and generally <hi>ominous,</hi> or directly fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode any future Judgments to the World, or to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Nations, or Parties therein, as the Vulgar are apt to imagine. They are indeed, with other celeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Phaenomena, naturally Invitations to the abſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Minds from continually poring on things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; they call on us to look upwards, to the Works of
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0764901700:35"/>
God that are above us; to his ſuperior Providence, and to a proper Dependance on him. They preach to us this Doctrine, That God has it always in his Power to preſerve or deſtroy the World, and all the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures therein, as he pleaſes; and this without any new Miracles. But they are, I think, of themſelves, and generally ſpeaking, no proper Indications of impen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Judgments, or of God's Will to puniſh or deſtroy any Part of his Creatures. It may be indeed juſtly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem'd a great Sign of the Guilt and conſcious Wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs of Mankind in general; that all ſuch extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Phaenomena are ſtill interpreted to the worſe Senſe, as Fore-runners of Wars, Famines, Plagues, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but they are not, I believe, any Signs that God is really and particularly at ſuch times bringing thoſe or the like Judgments upon them. However, I have ſo fully ſpoken my Mind of this Matter, and of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitations and Reſtrictions thereto belonging, in my Account of the former ſurpriſing <hi>Meteor, March</hi> 6. 1716. <hi>pag.</hi> 74-77. that I ſhall not repeat it here, but refer the Reader thither, who deſires farther Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. I conclude with one more important Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is this:</p>
            <p n="12">Note (12.) That we ought here to obſerve, and to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the good Providence of God, the great Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of univerſal Nature, of the Air in particular, with its ſurpriſing Wonders; and the great Diſpoſer and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rector of them all, in uſually confining the terrible <hi>Meteors</hi> of this kind to the upper Regions of the Air, and not permitting them to deſcend low enough to hurt us here below. And this deſerves more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly our regard, becauſe we know of no mechanical Cauſes that can hinder their Direction downward; and becauſe we know that ordinary Thunder-blaſts are frequently ſo directed, and this ſometimes to the terrible Deſtruction of Buildings and Animals here below. Let us but conſider, what has been above ſhewn, how certainly ſuch a deſcending Ball or Whirl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wind of Fire and Brimſtone as this, which was a full Mile in Diameter, and mov'd at the rate of at leaſt 2000 Miles in a Minute, might have conquer'd all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0764901700:36"/>
of our lower Air; and in a moment, before it could have been in the leaſt foreſeen, or provided a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt by any, might have deſtroy'd ſuch a City as <hi>London</hi> it ſelf.

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Have juſt now got ſome good Obſervations of this Meteor from our famous Obſervato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry at <hi>Greenwich,</hi> and what Accounts were there received, <hi>viz.</hi> that to us about <hi>London</hi> it aroſe from or but little under the Seven Stars, which were then half a Point from the Weſt to the North, at the Altitude of 22° or 23°, that it proceeded above 40° upon the Horizon, till it came under the Sword of <hi>Orion,</hi> near the South Weſt, and about the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of 15°; that the time of its Appearance was near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly 11′ after 8, and that it laſted about 6″, making a hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Noiſe as it paſſed along. All which confirms what I have already advanc'd, and particularly implies what I have noted above, That the Meteor had the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Elevation at firſt, or was not much leſs than 50 Miles high, which is nearly the utmoſt Limit of our Atmoſphere; that it gradually deſcended lower till it came over <hi>Devonſhire,</hi> where it was about 39 Miles high; and that where it brake, over the Sea, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Bretaign</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> its Altitude could not be very much above 30 Miles.</p>
            <p>As to the Monaſtery burnt in <hi>France,</hi> it was the Day before the Appearance of this Meteor, and ſo had no Relation to it. And the like is to be ſaid of ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Accidents elſewhere, none of which appear to have at all been occaſion'd by it.</p>
