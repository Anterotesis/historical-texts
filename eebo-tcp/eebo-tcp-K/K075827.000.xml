            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>SWIFT roll the Rhine's billows, and water the plains,</l>
               <l>Where Falkenstein Castle's majestic remains,</l>
               <l>Their moss-cover'd turrets still rear;</l>
               <l>Oft loves the gaunt wolf midst the ruins to prowl,</l>
               <l>What Time from the battlements pours the lone owl</l>
               <l>Her plaints in the passenger's ear.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>No longer resound through the vaults of yon hall</l>
               <l>The song of the minstrel, and mirth of the ball;</l>
               <l>Those pleasures for ever are fled;</l>
               <l>There now dwells the bat with her light-shunning brood;</l>
               <l>There ravens and vultures now clamour for food,</l>
               <l>And all is dark, silent, and dread!</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Ha! Dost thou not see by the Moon's trembling light,</l>
               <l>Directing his steps, where advances a Knight,</l>
               <l>His eye big with vengeance and fate?</l>
               <l>'Tis Osric—the Lion, his Nephew who leads,</l>
               <l>And swift up the crackling old stair-case proceeds,</l>
               <l>Gains the hall, and quick closes the gate.</l>

               <l>Now round him young Carloman casting his eyes,</l>
               <l>Surveys the sad scene with dismay and surprize,</l>
               <l>And fear steals the rose from his cheeks;</l>
               <l>His spirits forsake him, his courage is flown;</l>
               <l>The hand of Sir Osric he clasps in his own,</l>
               <l>And while his voice falters he speaks:—</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>"Dear Uncle," he murmurs, "why linger we here?</l>
               <l>'Tis late, and these chambers are damp and are drear;</l>
               <l>Keen blows through the ruins the blast!</l>
               <l>Oh! let us away and our journey pursue;</l>
               <l>Fair Blumenberg's Castle will rise on our view,</l>
               <l>Soon as Falkenstein Forest is past.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>"Why roll thus your eye-balls? Why glare they so wild?</l>
               <l>Oh! chide not my weakness, nor frown, that a child</l>
               <l>Should view these apartments with dread;</l>
               <l>For know, that full oft have I heard from my Nurse,</l>
               <l>There still on this Castle has rested a curse,</l>
               <l>Since innocent blood here was shed.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>"She said, too, bad spirits, and ghosts all in white,</l>
               <l>Here use to resort at the dead time of night,</l>
               <l>Nor vanish till breaking of day;</l>
               <l>And still at their coming is heard the deep tone</l>
               <l>Of a bell—loud and awful—Hark! hark! 'twas a groan!</l>
               <l>Good Uncle, oh! let us away!"</l>

               <l>"Peace, serpent!" thus Osric—the Lion, replies,</l>
               <l>While rage and malignity gloom in his eyes;</l>
               <l>"Thy journey and life here must close:</l>
               <l>Thy Castle's proud turrets no more shalt thou see;</l>
               <l>No more betwixt Blumenberg's Lordship and me</l>
               <l>Shalt thou stand, and my greatness oppose.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>"My Brother lies breathless on Palestine's plains,</l>
               <l>And though once remov'd, to his noble domains</l>
               <l>My right can no rival deny:</l>
               <l>Then, stripling, prepare on my dagger to bleed;</l>
               <l>No succour is near, and thy fate is decreed;</l>
               <l>Commend thee to Jesus, and die!"</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Thus saying, he seizes the boy by the arm,</l>
               <l>Whose grief rends the vaulted hall's roof, while alarm</l>
               <l>His heart of all fortitude robs:</l>
               <l>His limbs sink beneath him; distracted with fears,</l>
               <l>He falls at his Uncle's feet, bathes them with tears,</l>
               <l>And—"Spare me! Oh! spare me!" he sobs.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But ah! 'tis in vain that he strives to appease</l>
               <l>The miscreant; in vain does he cling round his knees,</l>
               <l>And sue in soft accents for life:</l>
               <l>Unmov'd by his sorrow—unmov'd by his pray'r,</l>
               <l>Fierce Osric has twisted his hand in his hair,</l>
               <l>And aims at his bosom a knife.</l>

               <l>But e'er the steel blushes with blood, strange to tell!</l>
               <l>Self-struck, does the tongue of the hollow-ton'd bell</l>
               <l>The presence of midnight declare:</l>
               <l>And while, with amazement, his hair bristles high,</l>
               <l>Hears Osric a voice, loud and terrible, cry,</l>
               <l>In sounds heart appalling—"Forbear!"</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Straight curses and shrieks thro' the chambers resound,</l>
               <l>With hellish mirth mingled; the walls shake around;</l>
               <l>The groaning roof threatens to fall;</l>
               <l>Loud bellows the thunder; blue lightnings still flash;</l>
               <l>The casements they clatter; chains rattle; doors clash,</l>
               <l>And flames spread their waves through the hall.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The clamour increases; the portals expand;</l>
               <l>O'er the pavement's black marble now rushes a band</l>
               <l>Of daemons all dropping with gore;</l>
               <l>In visage so grim, and so monstrous in height,</l>
               <l>That Carloman screams, as they burst on his sight,</l>
               <l>And sinks without sense on the floor.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Not so his fell Uncle: he sees that the throng</l>
               <l>Impels, loudly shrieking, a female along,</l>
               <l>And well the sad spectre he knows:</l>
               <l>The daemons with curses her steps onward urge;</l>
               <l>Her shoulders with whips form'd of serpents they scourge,</l>
               <l>And fast from her wounds the blood flows.</l>

               <l>Of which thou hast made me the prey:</l>
               <l>Twelve years have I languish'd thy coming to see;</l>

               <l>My ruin compleated, thy love became hate;</l>
               <l>Thy hand gave the draught which consign'd me to Fate;</l>
               <l>Nor thought I death lurk'd in the bowl;</l>
               <l>Unfit for the grave, stain'd with guilt, swell'd with pride,</l>
               <l>Unblest, unabsolv'd, unrepenting I dy'd,</l>

               <l>See, see, how the fiends are athirst for thy blood!</l>
               <l>Twelve years has my panting heart furnish'd their food,</l>

            <lg>
               <l>She said, and the daemons their prey flock'd around;</l>
               <l>They dash'd him with horrible yell on the ground,</l>
               <l>And blood down his limbs trickl'd fast:</l>
               <l>His eyes from their sockets with fury they tore;</l>
               <l>They fed on his entrails, all reeking with gore,</l>
