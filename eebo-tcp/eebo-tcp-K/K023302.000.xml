            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <hi>London, (to wit)</hi> BE it remembered, that Sir Archibald Macdonald, Knight, Attorney General of our preſent Sovereign Lord King George the Third, who, for our preſent Sovereign Lord the King, proſecutes in this behalf in his own proper per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, comes into the court of our ſaid preſent Sovereign Lord the King, before the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf at Weſtminſter, in the county of Middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſex, on Friday next, after one month from the feaſt day of Eaſter in this ſame term; and for our ſaid Lord the King giveth the court here to underſtand and be informed, that THOMAS PAINE, late of London, gentleman, being a wicked, malicious, ſeditious, and ill-diſpoſed perſon, and being greatly diſaffected to our ſaid Sovereign Lord the now King, and to the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py conſtitution and government of this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and moſt unlawfully, wickedly, ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly, and maliciouſly deviſing, contriving, and intending to ſcandalize, traduce, and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lify, the late happy Revolution, providentially brought about and effected under the wiſe and prudent conduct of his Highneſs William, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore Prince of Orange, and afterwards King of England, France, and Ireland, and the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions thereunto belonging; and the accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the Crown and royal dignity of King and Queen of England, France, and Ireland, and the dominions thereunto belonging, by his ſaid Highneſs William, and her Highneſs Mary,

And alſo by moſt wicked, cunning, and artful inſinuations, to repreſent, ſuggeſt, and cauſe it to be believed, that the Parliament of this kingdom was a wicked, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, uſeleſs, and unneceſſary eſtabliſhment; and that the King and the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in Parliament aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0995201000:4"/>wickedly tyrannized over and oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the ſubjects of this kingdom in general, and to infuſe into the minds of the ſubjects of this kingdom groundleſs and unreaſonable diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents and prejudices againſt our preſent Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Lord the King and the Parliament of this kingdom, and the conſtitution, laws, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment thereof; and to bring them into ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred and contempt, on the ſixteenth day of Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary, in the thirty-ſecond year of the reign of our ſaid preſent Sovereign Lord the King, with force and arms at London aforeſaid, to wit, in the pariſh of Saint Mary le Bow, in the Ward of Cheap, he, the ſaid Thomas, wickedly, maliciouſly, and ſeditiouſly, did write and publiſh, and cauſe to be written and publiſhed, a certain falſe, ſcandalous, malicious, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious libel, of and concerning the ſaid late happy Revolution, and the ſaid ſettlements and limitations of the crown and regal government of the ſaid kingdoms and dominions; and the ſaid act, declaring the rights and liberties of the ſubject; and the ſaid declaration of the rights and liberties of the ſubject therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, and the hereditary regal government of the ſaid kingdoms and dominions; and alſo of and concerning the Legiſlature, Conſtitution, Government, and Laws, of this kingdom; of and concerning our preſent Sovereign Lord the King that now is; and of and concerning the Parliament of this kingdom, intituled, <q>Rights of Man, Part the Second, Combining prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple and practice, by Thomas Paine, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary for Foreign Affairs to Congreſs, in the American War, and Author of the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0995201000:5"/>Work, entitled Common Senſe, and the Firſt Part of the Rights of Man, the Second Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, London, printed for J. S. Jordan, No. 166, Fleet Street, 1792;</q> in which ſaid libel are contained, amongſt other things, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers falſe, ſcandalous, malicious, and ſeditious, matters. In one part thereof, according to the tenor and effect following, that is to ſay, <q>All hereditary government is in its nature ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny. An heritable crown</q> (meaning, amongſt others, the crown of this kingdom) <q>or an heritable throne,</q> (meaning, amongſt others, the throne of this kingdom) <q>or by what other fanciful name ſuch things may be called, have no other ſignificant explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion than that mankind are heritable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty. To inherit a government, is to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit the people, as if they were flocks and herds.</q> And in another part thereof, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the tenor and effect following, (that is to ſay) <q>This Convention met at Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia, in May, 1787, of which General Waſhington was elected preſident. He was not at that time connected with any of the State Governments, or with Congreſs. He delivered up his commiſſion when the war ended, and ſince then had lived a private ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizen. The Convention went deeply into all the ſubjects, and having, after a variety of debate and inveſtigation, agreed among themſelves upon the ſeveral parts of a Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deral Conſtitution, the next queſtion was the manner of giving it authority and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice. For this purpoſe, they did not, like a cabal of courtiers, ſend for a Dutch Stadt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0995201000:6"/>or a German Elector, but they refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the whole matter to the ſenſe and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of the country,</q> (thereby meaning and intending that it ſhould be believed that a cabal of courtiers had ſent for the ſaid Prince of Orange and King George the Firſt, heretofore Elector of Hanover, to take upon themſelves reſpectively the regal government of the ſaid kingdom and dominions, without referring to the ſenſe and intereſt of the ſubjects of the ſaid kingdoms.) And in another part thereof, according to the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor and effect following, that is to ſay, <q>The hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of the Edwards and the Henries</q> (mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Edwards and Henries, heretofore Kings of England) <q>and up to the commencement of the Stuarts,</q> (meaning Stuarts, heretofore Kings of England) <q>exhibits as many inſtances of ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny as could be acted within the limits to which the nation had reſtricted it. The Stuarts</q> (meaning Stuarts, heretofore Kings of England) <q>endeavoured to paſs theſe limits, and their fate is well known. In all thoſe inſtances, we ſee nothing of a conſtitution, but only of reſtrictions on aſſumed power. After this, another William,</q> (meaning the ſaid William Prince of Orange, afterwards King of England) <q>deſcended from the ſame ſtock, and claiming from the ſame origin, gained poſſeſſion</q> (meaning poſſeſſion of the crown of England) <q>and of the two evils, <hi>James</hi> and <hi>William,</hi>
               </q> (meaning James the Second, heretofore King of England, and the ſaid William Prince of Orange, afterwards King of England) <q>the nation preferred what it
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0995201000:7"/>thought the leaſt; ſince from circumſtances it muſt take one. The act called the Bill of Rights</q> (meaning the ſaid act of Parliament intituled, "an act declaring the rights and liberties of the ſubject, and ſettling the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of the crown) <q>comes here into view; what is it</q> (meaning the ſaid act of Parliament laſt mentioned) <q>but a bargain which the parts of the government made with each other to divide powers, profits and privileges?</q> (mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the ſaid laſt-mentioned act of Parliament was a bargain which the parts of the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in England made with each other to divide powers, profits, and privileges. <q>You ſhall have ſo much, and I will have the reſt; and with reſpect to the nation it ſaid, <hi>for your ſhare</hi> YOU <hi>ſhall have the right of petitioning.</hi> This being the caſe, the Bill of Rights</q> (mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſaid laſt-mentioned act of Parliament) <q>is more properly a Bill of Wrongs and of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult; as to what is called the Convention Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, it</q> (meaning the ſaid Convention of Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons herein before mentioned) <q>was a thing that made itſelf, and then made the authority by which it acted. A few perſons got together, and called themſelves by that name; ſeveral of them had never been elected, and none of them for the purpoſe. From the time of William,</q> (meaning the ſaid King William the Third) <q>a ſpecies of government aroſe, iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing out of this coalition Bill of Rights;</q> (meaning the ſaid act, intituled, "an act, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring the rights and liberties of the ſubject, and ſettling the ſucceſſion of the crown) <q>and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0995201000:8"/>more ſo ſince the corruption introduced at the Hanover ſucceſſion</q> (meaning the ſucceſſion of the Heirs of the Princeſs Sophia, Electreſs and Dutcheſs Dowager of Hanover to the crown and dignity of this kingdom) <q>by the agency of Walpole, that</q> (meaning the ſaid ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of government) <q>can be deſcribed by no other name than a deſpotic legiſlation. Though the parts may embarraſs each other, the whole has no bounds; and the only right it acknowledges out of itſelf is the right of peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning. Where then is the conſtitution either that gives or that reſtrains power? It is not becauſe a part of the government</q> (meaning the government of this kingdom) <q>is elective, that makes it leſs a deſpotiſm, if the perſons ſo elected poſſeſs afterwards, as a parliament, unlimited powers; election in this caſe becomes ſeparated from repreſentation, and the candidates are candidates for deſpotiſm.</q> And in another part thereof, according to the tenor and effect following, (that is to ſay) <q>The attention of the government of England (for I rather chuſe to call it by this name than the Engliſh government) appears, ſince its political connection with Germany, to have been ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely engroſſed and abſorbed by foreign af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, and the means of raiſing taxes, that it ſeems to exiſt for no other purpoſes. Domeſtic con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns are neglected; and with reſpect to regular laws, there is ſcarcely ſuch a thing;</q> And in another part thereof, according to the tenor and effect following, (that is to ſay) <q>With reſpect to the two houſes of which the Engliſh Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</q>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:0995201000:9"/>(meaning the Parliament of this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom) <q>is compoſed, they appear to be effectually influenced into one, and, as a Legiſlature, to have no temper of its own. The miniſter,</q> (meaning the miniſter employed by the King of this realm in the adminiſtration of the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof) <q>whoever he at any time may be, touches it</q> (meaning the two Houſes of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament of this kingdom) <q>as with an opium wand; and it</q> (meaning the two Houſes of Parliament of this kingdom) <q>ſleeps obedience. But if we look at the diſtinct abilities of the two Houſes</q> (meaning the two Houſes of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament of this kingdom) <q>the difference will appear ſo great, as to ſhew the inconſiſtency of placing power where there can be no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of the judgement to uſe it. Wretched as the ſtate of repreſentation is in England,</q> (meaning the ſtate of repreſentation of the Commons of this kingdom) <q>it is manhood compared with what is called the Houſe of Lords;</q> (meaning the Lords Spiritual and Temporal in Parliament aſſembled) <q>and ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle is this nick-named Houſe</q> (meaning the Houſe of Lords) <q>regarded, that the people ſcarcely inquire at any time what it is doing. It</q> (meaning the ſaid Houſe of Lords) <q>appears alſo to be moſt under influence, and the furtheſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from the general intereſt of the nation.</q> And in another part thereof, according to the tenor and effect following, viz. <q>Having thus glanced at ſome of the defects of the two Houſes of Parliament,</q> (meaning the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament of this kingdom) <q>I proceed to what is called the crown,</q> (meaning the crown
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0995201000:10"/>of this kingdom) <q>upon which I ſhall be very conciſe. It</q> (meaning the crown of this kingdom) <q>ſignifies a nominal office of a mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion ſterling a year, the buſineſs of which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in receiving the money, whether the perſon</q> (meaning the King of this realm) <q>be wiſe or fooliſh, ſane or inſane, a native or a foreigner, matters not, every miniſtry</q> (meaning the miniſtry employed by the King of this realm in the adminiſtration of the government thereof) <q>acts upon the ſame idea that Mr. Burke writes, namely, that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</q> (meaning the ſubjects of this kingdom) <q>muſt be hoodwinked and held in ſuperſtitious ignorance by ſome bugbear or other; and what is called the crown</q> (meaning the crown of this kingdom) <q>anſwers this purpoſe, and therefore it anſwers all the purpoſes to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from it. This is more than can be ſaid of the other two branches. The hazard to which this office</q> (meaning amongſt others the office of King of this realm) <q>is expoſed in all countries,</q> (meaning amongſt others this kingdom) <q>is not from any thing that can happen to the man,</q> (meaning the King) <q>but from what may happen to the nation,</q> (mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing amongſt others this kingdom) <q>the danger of its coming to its ſenſes.</q> And in another part thereof, according to the tenor and effect following, (that is to ſay) <q>I happened to be in England at the celebration of the centenary of the revolution of 1688. The characters of William and Mary</q> (meaning the ſaid late King William and Queen Mary) <q>have always appeared to me deteſtable; the one</q> (meaning
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0995201000:11"/>the ſaid King William) <q>ſeeking to deſtroy his uncle, and the other</q> (meaning the ſaid Queen Mary) <q>her father, to get poſſeſſion of power themſelves; yet as the nation was diſpoſed to think ſomething of that event, I felt hurt at ſeeing it aſcribe the whole reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it to a man</q> (meaning the ſaid late King William the Third) <q>who had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken it as a jobb, and who, beſides what he otherwiſe got, charged ſix hundred thouſand pounds for the expence of the little fleet that brought him from Holland. George the Firſt</q> (meaning George the Firſt, late King of Great Britain, &amp;c.) <q>acted the ſame cloſe-fiſted part as William the Third had done, and bought the Dutchy of Bremin with the money he got from England, two hundred and fifty thouſand pounds over and above his pay as King; and having thus purchaſed it at the expence of England, added it to his Hanove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian Dominions for his own private profit.— In fact, every nation that does not govern it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf is governed as a jobb: England has been the prey of jobbs ever ſince the revolution.</q> And in another part thereof, according to the tenor and effect following, (that is to ſay)— <q>The fraud, hypocriſy, and impoſition of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments,</q> (meaning, amongſt others, the government of this kingdom) <q>are now begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to be too well underſtood to promiſe them any long career. The farce of monarchy and ariſtocracy in all countries is following that of chivalry, and Mr. Burke is dreſſing for the funeral. Let it then paſs quietly to the tomb of all other follies, and the mourners be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted.
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0995201000:12"/>The time is not very diſtant when England will laugh at itſelf for ſending to Holland, Hanover, Zell, or Brunſwick, for men,</q> (meaning the Kings of theſe realms, born out of the ſame, who have acceded to the crown thereof at and ſince the revolution) <q>at the expence of a million a year, who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood neither her laws, her language, nor her intereſt; and whoſe capacities would ſcarcely have fitted them for the office of a pariſh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable.

And the ſaid attorney general of our ſaid Lord the King, for our ſaid Lord the King, further gives the court here to underſtand and be informed, that the ſaid Thomas Paine, being a wicked, malicious, ſeditious, and ill-diſpoſed perſon, and being greatly diſaffected to our ſaid Sovereign Lord the now King, and to the happy conſtitution and government of this kingdom, and moſt unlawfully, wickedly, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditiouſly, and maliciouſly deviſing, contriving, and intending to ſcandalize, traduce, and vilify the late happy revolution, providentially brought about and effected under the wiſe and prudent conduct of his Highneſs William, heretofore Prince of Orange, and afterwards King of England, France, and Ireland, and the Dominions thereunto belonging; and the

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0995201000:14"/>that the Parliament of this kingdom was a wicked, corrupt, uſeleſs, and unneceſſary eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabliſhment; and that the King and Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament aſſembled, wickedly tyrannized over and oppreſſed the ſubjects of this kingdom in general; and to infuſe into the minds of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of this kingdom groundleſs and unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able diſcontents and prejudices againſt our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Sovereign Lord the King, and the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this kingdom; and the conſtitution, laws, and government, thereof and to bring them into hatred and contempt, on the ſixteenth day of February, in the thirty-ſecond year of the reign of our ſaid preſent Sovereign Lord the King, with force and arms at London aforeſaid, to wit, in the pariſh of Saint Mary le Bone, in the ward of Cheap, he, the ſaid Thomas, wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly, maliciouſly, and ſeditiouſly did print and publiſh, and cauſe to be printed and publiſhed, a certain falſe, ſcandalous, malicious, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious libel, of and concerning the ſaid late happy revolution, and the ſaid ſettlements and limitations of the crown and regal government of the ſaid kingdoms and dominions; and the ſaid act declaring the rights and liberties of the ſubject, and the ſaid declaration of the rights and liberties of the ſubject therein contained, and the hereditary Regal government of the ſaid kingdoms and dominions, and alſo of and concerning the Legiſlature, Conſtitution, Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and Laws of this Kingdom, and of and concerning our preſent Sovereign Lord the King that now is, and of and concerning the Parliament of this kingdom, intituled, <q>Rights
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0995201000:15"/>of Man, part the ſecond, combining prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple and practice, by Thomas Paine, ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary for foreign affairs to Congreſs in the American War, and author of the work, entitled Common Senſe, and the firſt part of the Rights of Man, the Second Edition, London, Printed for J. S. Jordan, No. 166, Fleet Street.</q> In which ſaid libel are contained, amongſt other things, divers falſe, ſcandalous, malicious, and ſeditious matters. In one part thereof, according to the tenor and effect following, (that is to ſay) <q>All he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary government is in its nature tyranny. An heritable crown</q> (meaning, amongſt others, the crown of this kingdom) <q>or an heritable throne,</q> (meaning, amongſt others, the throne of this kingdom) <q>or by what other fanciful name ſuch things may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, have no other ſignificant explanation than than that mankind are heritable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty. To inherit a government is to inherit the people, as if they were flocks and herds.</q> And in another part thereof, according to the tenor and effect following, (that is to ſay) <q>This Convention met at Philadelphia in May, 1787, of which General Waſhington was elected preſident. He was not at that time connected with any of the ſtate govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or with Congreſs; he delivered up his commiſſion when the war ended, and ſince then had lived a private citizen. The Convention went deeply into all the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and having, after a variety of debate and inveſtigation, agreed among themſelves upon the ſeveral parts of a Federal Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0995201000:16"/>the next queſtion was the manner of giving it authority and practice. For this purpoſe they did not, like a cabal of cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers, ſend for a Dutch Stadtholder or a Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Elector; but they referred the whole matter to the ſenſe and intereſt of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</q> (thereby meaning and intending that it ſhould be believed that a cabal of courtiers had ſent for the ſaid Prince of Orange and King George the Firſt, heretofore Elector of Hanover, to take upon themſelves reſpectively the regal government of the ſaid kingdoms and dominions, without referring to the ſenſe and intereſt of the ſubects of the ſaid king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms) And in another part thereof, according to the tenor and effect following, (that is to ſay) <q>The hiſtory of the Edwards and Henries,</q> (meaning Edwards and Henries, heretofore Kings of England) <q>and up to the commence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Stuarts,</q> (meaning Stuarts, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore Kings of England) <q>exhibits as many inſtances of tyranny as could be acted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the limits to which the nation had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtricted it. The Stuarts</q> (meaning Stuarts, heretofore Kings of England) <q>endeavoured to paſs thoſe limits, and their fate is well known. In all thoſe inſtances, we ſee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of a conſtitution, but only of reſtric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on aſſumed power. After this, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther William,</q> (meaning the ſaid William Prince of Orange, afterwards King of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land) <q>deſcended from the ſame ſtock, and claiming from the ſame origin, gained poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion;</q> (meaning poſſeſſion of the crown of England) <q>and of the two evils, James and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0995201000:17"/>William,</q> (meaning James the Second, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore King of England; and the ſaid Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Prince of Orange, afterwards King of England) <q>the nation preferred what it thought the leaſt; ſince from circumſtances it muſt take one. The act, called the Bill of Rights,</q> (meaning the ſaid act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, intituled, "an act declaring the rights and liberties of the ſubject, and ſettling the ſucceſſion of the crown") <q>comes here into view. What is it</q> (meaning the ſaid act of Parliament laſt mentioned) <q>but a bargain which the parts of the government made with each other to divide powers, profits, and privileges,</q> (meaning that the ſaid laſt-mentioned act of Parliament was a bargain which the parts of the government in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land made with each other to divide powers, profits, and privileges) <q>
                  <hi>You</hi> ſhall have ſo much, and I will have the reſt. And with reſpect to the nation, it ſaid, for your ſhare you ſhall have the right of petitioning. This being the caſe, the Bill of Rights</q> (meaning the ſaid laſt-mentioned act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament) <q>is more properly a bill of wrongs and of inſult. As to what is called the Convention Parliament, it</q> (meaning the ſaid convention of Lords Spiritual and Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and Commons, herein-before mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) <q>was a thing that made itſelf, and then made the authority by which it acted. A few perſons got together, and called them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by that name; ſeveral of them had never been elected, and none of them for the purpoſe. From the time of William,</q>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:0995201000:18"/>(meaning the ſaid King William the Third) <q>a ſpecies of government aroſe iſſuing out of this coalition Bill of Rights;</q> (meaning the ſaid act, intituled, an act declaring the rights and liberties of the ſubject, and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tling the ſucceſſion of the crown) <q>and more ſo ſince the corruption introduced at the Hanover ſucceſſion,</q> (meaning the ſucceſſion of the heirs of the Princeſs Sophia, Elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs and Ducheſs Dowager of Hanover, to the crown and dignity of this kingdom) <q>by the agency of Walpole, that</q> (meaning the ſaid ſpecies of government) <q>can be deſcribed by no other name than a deſpotic legiſlation. Though the parts may embarraſs each other, the whole has no bounds; and the only right it acknowledges out of itſelf, is the right of petitioning. Where then is the conſtitution either that gives or that reſtrains power. It is not becauſe a part of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</q> (meaning the government of this kingdom) <q>is elective, that makes it leſs a deſpotiſm. If the perſons ſo elected poſſeſs afterwards, as a Parliament, unlimited pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, election, in this caſe, becomes ſeparated from repreſentation, and the candidates are candidates for deſpotiſm.</q> And in another part thereof, according to the tenor and effect following, (that is to ſay) <q>The attention of the government of England (for I rather chuſe to call it by this name than the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh government) appears, ſince its political connection with Germany, to have been ſo completely engroſſed and abſorbed by foreign affairs, and the means of raiſing taxes, that
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0995201000:19"/>it ſeems to exiſt for no other purpoſes. Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic concerns are neglected; and with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to regular law, there is ſcarcely ſuch a thing.</q> And in another part thereof, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the tenor and effect following,(that is to ſay) <q>With reſpect to the two Houſes of which the Engliſh Parliament</q> (meaning the Parliament of this kingdom) <q>is compoſed, they appear to be effectually influenced into one, and, as a Legiſlature, to have no tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of its own. The miniſter,</q> (meaning the miniſter employed by the King of this realm, in the adminiſtration of the government there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of) <q>whoever he at any time may be, touches it</q> (meaning the two Houſes of Parliament of this kingdom) <q>as with an opium wand, and it</q> (meaning the two Houſes of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this kindom) <q>ſleeps obedience. But if we look at the diſtinct abilities of the two Houſes,</q> (meaning the two Houſes of Parliament of this kingdom) <q>the difference will appear ſo great, as to ſhew the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency of placing power where there can be no certainty of the judgement to uſe it. Wretched as the ſtate of repreſentation is in England,</q> (meaning the ſtate of repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Commons of this kingdom) <q>it is manhood, compared with what is called the Houſe of Lords;</q> (meaning the Lords Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual and Temporal, in Parliament aſſembled) <q>and ſo little is this nicknamed Houſe</q> (mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Houſe of Lords) <q>regarded, that the people ſcarcely inquire at any time what it is doing. It</q> (meaning the ſaid Houſe of Lords) <q>appears alſo to be moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0995201000:20"/>influence, and the fartheſt removed from the general intereſt of the nation.</q> And in another part thereof, according to the tenor and effect following, viz. <q>Having thus glanced at ſome of the defects of the two Houſes of Parliament,</q> (meaning the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament of this kingdom) <q>I proceed to what is called the crown,</q> (meaning the crown of this kingdom) <q>upon which I ſhall be very conciſe. It</q> (meaning the crown of this kingdom) <q>ſignifies a nominal office of a mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion ſterling a year, the buſineſs of which conſiſts in receiving the money. Whether the perſon</q> (meaning the King of this realm) <q>be wiſe or fooliſh, ſane or inſane, a native or a foreigner, matters not; every miniſtry</q> (meaning the miniſtry employed by the King of this realm in the adminiſtration of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment thereof) <q>acts upon the ſame idea that Mr. Burke writes, namely, that the people</q> (meaning the ſubjects of this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom) <q>muſt be hoodwinked and held in ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious ignorance by ſome bugbear or other; and what is called the crown</q> (mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the crown of this kingdom) <q>anſwers this purpoſe, and therefore it anſwers all the purpoſes to be expected from it. This is more than can be ſaid of the other two branches. The hazard to which this office</q> (meaning, amongſt others, the office of King of this realm) <q>is expoſed in all countries,</q> (meaning, amongſt others, this kingdom) <q>is not from any thing that can happen to the man,</q> (meaning the King) <q>but from what may happen to the nation,</q> (meaning,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0995201000:21"/>amongſt this kingdom) <q>the danger of coming to its ſenſes.</q> And in another part thereof, according to the tenor and effect following, (that is to ſay) <q>I happened to be in England at the celebration of the centenary of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution of 1688. The charaters of Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam and Mary</q> (meaning the ſaid late King William and Queen Mary) <q>have always ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to me deteſtable; the one</q> (meaning the ſaid late King William) <q>ſeeking to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy his uncle, and the other</q> (meaning the ſaid Queen Mary) <q>her father, to get poſſeſſion of power themſelves. Yet as the nation was diſpoſed to think ſomething of that event, I felt hurt at ſeeing it aſcribe the whole reputation of it to a man</q> (mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſaid late King William the Third) <q>who had undertaken it as a job, and who, beſides what he otherwiſe got, charged ſix hundred thouſand pounds for the expense of the little fleet that brought him from Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. George the Firſt</q> (meaning George the Firſt, late King of Great Britain, &amp;c.) <q>acted the ſame cloſe-fiſted part as William</q> (meaning the ſaid King William the Third) <q>had done, and bought the Duchy of Bremin with the money he got from England, two hundred and fifty thouſand pounds over and above his pay as King; and having thus purchaſed it at the expence of England, added it to his Hanoverian dominions for his own private profit. In fact, every nation that does not govern it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf is governed as a jobb. England has been the prey of jobbs ever ſince the Revolution.</q>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:0995201000:22"/>And in another part thereof, according to the tenor and effect following (that is to ſay) <q>The fraud, hypocriſy, and impoſition of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</q> (meaning amongſt others, the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of this kingdom) <q>are now beginning to be too well underſtood to promiſe them any long career. The farce of monarchy and ariſtocracy in all countries is following that of chivalry, and Mr. Burke is dreſſing for the funeral. Let it then paſs quietly to the tomb of all other follies, and the mourners be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted. The time is not very diſtant when England will laugh at itſelf for ſending to Holland, Hanover, Zell, or Brunſwick, for Men</q> (meaning the Kings of theſe realms, born out of the ſame, who have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded to the crown thereof at and ſince the Revolution) <q>at the expence of a million a year, who underſtood neither her laws, her language, nor her intereſt, and whoſe capacities would ſcarcely have fitted them for the office of a Pariſh Conſtable. If go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment could be truſted to ſuch hands, it muſt be ſome eaſy and ſimple thing indeed, and materials fit for all the purpoſes may be found in every town and village in England.</q> In contempt of our ſaid Lord the King and his laws, to the evil example of all others in the like caſe offending, and againſt the peace of our ſaid Lord the King, his crown and dignity, and the ſaid Attorney General of our ſaid Lord the King, for our ſaid Lord the King, further gives the Court here to underſtand and be informed, that the ſaid Thomas Paine being a wicked, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious, and ill-diſpoſed, perſon, and wickedly,

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0995201000:27"/>wicked, malicious, and ſeditious intentions, on the ſaid ſixteenth day of February, in the thirty ſecond year aforeſaid, at London aforeſaid, in the pariſh and ward aforeſaid, he, the ſaid Thomas Paine, wickedly, maliciouſly, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditiouſly, did print and publiſh, and cauſe and procure to be printed and publiſhed, a certain other falſe, ſcandalous, malicious, and ſeditious libel, in which, amongſt other things, are contained certain falſe, ſcandalous, malicious, and ſeditious, matters, of and concerning the character of the ſaid late Sovereign Lord King William the Third, and the ſaid revolution, and the ſaid Parliament, and the laws and ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes of this realm, and the happy conſtitution and government thereof, as by law eſtabliſhed, according to the tenor and effect following,— (that is to ſay) <q>The hiſtory of the Edwards and the Henries,</q> (meaning Edwards and Henries heretofore Kings of England) <q>and up to the commencement of the Stuarts,</q> (meaning Stuarts, heretofore Kings of England) <q>exhibits as many inſtances of tyranny as could be acted within the limits to which the nation</q> (meaning England) <q>had reſtricted it. The Stuarts</q> (meaning Stuarts, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore Kings of England) <q>endeavoured to paſs thoſe limits, and their fate is well known. In all thoſe inſtances we ſee nothing of a conſtitution, but only of reſtrictions on aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed power. After this, another William,</q> (meaning the ſaid late King William the Third) <q>deſcended from the ſame ſtock, and claiming from the ſame origin, gained poſſeſſion;</q>—

The act called the Bill of Rights</q> (meaning the ſaid ſtatute, declaring the rights and liberties of the ſubject, commonly called the Bill of Rights) <q>comes here into view. What is it</q> (mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſaid late-mentioned ſtatute) <q>but a bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain which the parts of the government made with each other to divide powers, profits, and privileges?</q> (meaning that the ſaid laſt-mentioned ſtatute was a bargain which the parts of the government in England made with each other to divide powers, profits, and privileges) <q>You ſhall have ſo much, and I will have the reſt. And with reſpect to the nation,</q> (meaning England) <q>it ſaid, for your ſhare you ſhall have the right of petitioning.—This being the caſe, the Bill of Rights</q> (mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſaid laſt-mentioned ſtatute) <q>is more properly a Bill of Wrongs and of inſult. As to what is called the Convention Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</q> (meaning the aforeſaid Parliament of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land) <q>it</q> (meaning the aforeſaid Parliament of England, commonly called the Convention Parliament) <q>was a thing that made itſelf, and then made the authority by which it acted; a few perſons got together and called them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by that name; ſeveral of them had never been elected, and none of them for the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0995201000:29"/>purpoſe.

It is not becauſe a part of the government</q> (meaning the government of this kingdom) <q>is elective that makes it leſs a deſpotiſm, if the perſons ſo elected poſſeſs afterwards, as a Parliament, unlimited powers.

               <speaker>Mr. ATTORNEY GENERAL.</speaker>
               <p>Gentlemen of the Jury,</p>
               <p>You will permit me to ſolicit, and for no long ſpace of time, in the preſent ſtage of this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, ſomewhat of your attention to a cauſe which, conſidering it on its own merits only, is, in my humble judgement, a plain, a clear, a ſhort, and indiſputable caſe. Were it not, Gentlemen, that certain circumſtances have rendered it a caſe of more expectation than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, I do aſſure you that I ſhould literally have contented myſelf this day with conducting myſelf in the manner that I did upon the laſt occaſion that I was called upon to addreſs a Jury upon this ſort of ſubject, namely, by ſimply reading to you the paſſages which I have ſelec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and leaving it entirely to your judgment. But, Gentlemen, it ſo happens that the accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulated miſchief which has ariſen from the particular book that is now before you, and the conſequences, which every body is acquainted with, which have followed from this publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, have rendered it neceſſary, perhaps, that I ſhould ſay a few words more in the opening
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0995201000:45"/>than it would have been my intention to have done, had it not been for thoſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, in the firſt place you will permit me, without the imputation, I think, of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of myſelf,(a very trifling ſubject, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways a diſguſting one to others) to obviate a rumour which I have heard, namely, that this proſecution does not correſpond with my private judgment; that has been ſaid, and has reached my ears from various quarters. The refutation that I ſhall give to it is this: That I ſhould think I deſerved to be with diſgrace expelled from the ſituation with which his Majeſty has honoured me in your ſervice, and that of all my fellow ſubjects, had I, as far as my private judgment goes, heſitated for one inſtant to bring this enormous offender, as I conſider him, before a Jury of his country.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, the publication in queſtion was not the firſt of its kind which this defendant ſent forth into the world. This particular pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication was preceded by one upon the ſame ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and handling, in ſome meaſure, the ſame topics. That publication, although extremely reprehenſible, and ſuch as, perhaps, I was not entirely warranted in overlooking, I did over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look, upon this principle, that it may not be fitting and prudent at all times, for a public proſecutor to be ſharp in his proſecutions, or to have it ſaid that he is inſtrumental in prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any manner of diſcuſſion coming under the public eye, although in his own eſtimation it may be very far indeed from that which is le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimate
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0995201000:46"/>and proper diſcuſſion. Reprehenſible as that book was, extremely ſo in my opinion, yet it was uſhered into the world under circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances that led me to conceive that it would be confined to the judicious reader, and when con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to the judicious reader, it appeared to me that ſuch a man would refute as he went along.</p>
               <p>But, gentlemen, when I found that another publication was uſhered into the world ſtill more reprehenſible than the former, that in all ſhapes, in all ſizes, with an induſtry incredible; it was either totally or partially thruſt into the hands of all perſons in this country, of ſubjects of every deſcription; when I found that even children's ſweet-meats were wrapped up with parts of this, and delivered into their hands, in the hope that they would read it, when all induſtry was uſed, ſuch as I deſcribe to you, in order to obtrude and force this upon that part of the public whoſe minds cannot be ſuppoſed to be converſant with ſubjects of this ſort, and who cannot therefore correct as they go along, I thought it behoved me upon the earlieſt occaſion, which was the firſt day of the term ſucceeding this publication, to put a charge upon record againſt its au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor.</p>
               <p>Now, gentlemen, permit me to ſtate to you what it is that I impute to this book, and what is the intention that I impute to the writer of this book. Try it by every teſt that the human mind can poſſibly ſuggeſt, and ſee whether when tried by all the variety of thoſe teſts, you will not be ſatisfied in the long run, that it does deſerve
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0995201000:47"/>that deſcription which my duty obliges me to give of it.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, in the firſt place I impute to it a wilful, deliberate intention to vilify and degrade, and thereby to bring into abhorrence and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, the whole conſtitution of the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this country; not as <hi>introduced,</hi> that I will never admit, but as <hi>explained</hi> and <hi>reſtored</hi> at the Revolution. That ſyſtem of government under which we this day live, and which if it ſhall be attacked by contemptuous expreſſions, if by dogmatical dicta, if by ready-made propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, offered to the underſtandings of men ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citous about the nature of their conſtitution, properly ſo, (God forbid they ever ſhould be otherwiſe) but who, at the ſame time, may be eaſily impoſed upon to their own deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they may be brought to have diffidence and even abhorrence (for this book goes all that length) of that which is the ſalvation of the public, and every thing which is dear to them.</p>
               <p>I impute then to this book a deliberate deſign to eradicate from the minds of the people of this country that enthuſiaſtic love which they have hitherto had for that conſtitution, and thereby to do the utmoſt work of miſchief that any hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man being can do in this ſociety.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, further I impute to it that, <hi>in terms,</hi> the regal part of the government of this country, bounded and limited as it is, is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented as an oppreſſive and an abominable tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:0995201000:48"/>
                  <hi>Thirdly.</hi> That the whole legiſlature of this country is directly an uſurpation.</p>
               <p>Again, with reſpect to the laws of this realm, which hitherto have been our boaſt, indiſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minately and without one ſingle exception, that they are grounded upon this uſurped autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and are therefore in themſelves null, or, to uſe his own words—that there is little or no law in this country.</p>
               <p>Then, gentlemen, is it to be held out to a community of ten or twelve millions of people, is it to be held out, as well to the lower as to the better informed claſſes of theſe ten or twelve millions, that there is nothing in this ſociety that is binding upon their conduct, excepting ſuch portion of religion or morality as they may individually and reſpectively entertain?</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, are we then a lawleſs banditti? Have we neither laws to ſecure our property, our perſons, or our reputations?—Is it ſo that every man's arms are unbound, and that he may do whatever he pleaſes in the ſociety?— Are we reduced back again to that ſavage ſtate of nature? I aſk you the queſtion! You, gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, know well what the anſwer is; but, gentlemen, are we to ſay, that a man who holds this out to thoſe who are not furniſhed with the means of giving the anſwer which I know you, and every gentleman who hears me at this moment, will give, is diſcuſſing a queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Can any thing add to his ſlander upon the conſtitution; and upon the ſeparate parts of the government, ſo conſtituted as ours is, more than that ſweeping imputation upon the whole ſyſtem of law that binds us together—namely,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0995201000:49"/>that it is null and void, and that there is in reality no ſuch thing to be found?</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, in the ſeveral paſſages which I ſhall read to you, I impute this to him; alſo, that he uſes an artifice groſs to thoſe who can obſerve it, but dangerous in the extreme to thoſe whoſe minds perhaps are not ſufficiently cultivated and habituated to reading to ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble them to diſcover it: the artifice, in order to create diſguſt, is neither more nor leſs than this—it is ſtating all the objections that can poſſibly be urged to monarchy, ſeparately and ſolely conſidered, and to pure and ſimple ariſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tocracy; he never chuſes to ſay a ſingle ſyllable with reſpect to thoſe two as combined with a democracy, forbearing alſo to ſtate, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtriouſly keeping out of the way, every cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance that regards that worſt of all go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments, an unbalanced democracy, which is neceſſarily pregnant with a democratical ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny. This is the groſs artifice; and when you come to diſſect the book in the careful manner that I have done, I believe you and every other reader will eaſily detect that artifice.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, to whom are the poſitions that are contained in this book addreſſed? They are addreſſed, gentlemen, to the ignorant, to the credulous, to the deſperate; to the deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate all government is irkſome, nothing can be ſo palatable to their ears as the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable doctrine that there is neither law nor government amongſt us.</p>
               <p>The ignorant and the credulous, we all know, to exiſt in all countries, and perhaps
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0995201000:50"/>exactly in proportion as their hearts are good and ſimple, are they an eaſy prey to the crafty who have the cruelty to deceive them.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen in judging of the malignant intention which I muſt impute to this author, you will be pleaſed to take into your conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation the phraſe and the manner as well as the matter. The phraſe I ſtate to be inſidious and artful, the manner in many inſtances ſcoffing and contemptuous, a ſhort argument, often a prevalent one, with the ignorant or the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous. With reſpect to the <hi>matter,</hi> in my conſcience I call it treaſon, though technically, according to the laws of the country, it is not. —for, gentlemen, balance the inconvenience to ſociety of that which is technically treaſon, and in this country, we muſt not, thank God, extend it but keep it within its moſt narrow and circumſcribed definitions, but conſider the comparative difference of the miſchief that may happen from ſpreading doctrines of this ſort, and that which may happen from any treaſon whatever.</p>
               <p>In the caſe of the utmoſt degree of treaſon, even perpetrating the death of a prince upon the throne, the law has found the means of ſupplying that calamity in a manner that may ſave the country from any permanent injury. In many periods of the hiſtory of this country, which you may eaſily recollect, it is true that the reign of a good prince has been interrupted by violence,—a great evil!—but not ſo great as this: the chaſm is filled up inſtantly by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of this country, even if that laſt of treaſons ſhould be committed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:0995201000:51"/>But where is the power upon earth that can fill up the chaſm of a conſtitution that has been growing;—not for ſeven hundred years, as Mr. Paine would have you believe, from the Norman conqueſt but from time almoſt eternal, impoſſible to trace; that has been growing as, from the ſymptoms Julius Caeſar obſerved when he found our anceſtors nearly ſavages in the country, has been growing from that period until it was conſummated at the Revolution, and ſhone forth in all its ſplendour.</p>
               <p>In addition to this, this gentleman thinks fit even to impute to the exiſtence of that conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, ſuch as I have deſcribed it the very evils inſeparable from human ſociety, or even from human nature itſelf; all theſe are imputed to that ſcandalous, that wicked, that uſurped con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution under which we, the ſubjects of this country, have hitherto miſtakenly conceived that we lived happy and free.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I apprehend it to be no very difficult operation of the human mind to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh reaſoning and well meant diſcuſſion from a deliberate deſign to calumniate the law and conſtitution under which we live, and to withdraw men's allegiance from that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution; it is the operation of good ſenſe: it is therefore no difficult operation for a jury of the City of London, therefore: you will be pleaſed to obſerve whether the whole of this book, I ſhould rather ſay, ſuch part as I am at preſent at liberty to advert to, is not of this deſcription, that it is by no means calculated to diſcuſs and to convince, but to perform the ſhorter proceſs of inflammation;
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0995201000:52"/>not to reaſon upon any ſubject, but to dictate; and gentleman, as I ſtated to you before, to dictate in ſuch a manner, and in ſuch phraſe, and with all ſuch circumſtances as cannot, in my humble apprehenſion, leave the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote doubt upon your minds of what was paſſing in the heart of that man who compoſed that book.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, you will permit me now to ſay a word or two upon thoſe paſſages, which I have ſelected to you, firſt deſcribing a little what thoſe paſſages are. I have thought it much more becoming, much more beneficial to the public, than any other courſe that I could take, to ſelect ſix or ſeven, and no more, (not wiſhing to load the record unneceſſarily) of thoſe paſſages that go to the very root of our conſtitution, that is the nature of the paſſages which I have ſelected, and gentlemen, the firſt of them is in page 21, where you will find this doctrine.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>All hereditary government is in its nature tyranny, an heritable crown, or an heritable throne, or by what other fanciful name ſuch things may be called, have no other ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant explanation than that mankind are heritable property. To inherit a govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is to inherit the people, as if they were flocks and herds.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Now, gentlemen, what is the tendency of this paſſage? "All hereditary government is in its nature tyranny." So that no quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication whatever, not even the ſubordination to the law of the country, which is the only paramount thing that we know of in this
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0995201000:53"/>country, can take it out of the deſcription of tyranny; the regal office being neither more nor leſs than a truſt executed for the ſubjects of this country; the perſon who fills the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal office being underſtood, in this country, to be neither more nor leſs than the chief exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutive magiſtrate heading the whole gradation of magiſtracy.</p>
               <p>But without any qualification he ſtates it roundly, that under all circumſtances whatever hereditary government muſt in its nature be tyranny; what is that but to hold out to the people of this country that they are nought but ſlaves; to be ſure, if they are living under a tyranny, it is impoſſible to draw any other conſequence.</p>
               <p>This is one of thoſe ſhort propoſitions that are crammed down the throat of every man that is acceſſible to their arts in this country; this is one of thoſe propoſitions, which, if he believes, muſt have the due effect upon his mind, of ſaying, the caſe is come when I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I am opreſſed, I can bear it no longer.</p>
               <p>"An heritable crown." Ours is an heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table crown, and therefore it is comprehended in this dogma: "Or by what other fanciful name ſuch things may be called." Is that diſcuſſion? Contemptuous, vilifying, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grading expreſſions of that ſort are applied to that which we are accuſtomed to look to with reverence, namely, the repreſentation of the whole body of magiſtracy and of the law— <q>have no other ſignificant explanation than that mankind are heritable property. To in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0995201000:54"/>a government is to inherit the people, as if they were flocks and herds.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Why, gentlemen, are the people of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land to be told, without further ceremony, that they are inherited by a King of this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and that they are preciſely in the caſe of ſheep and oxen? I leave you to judge if ſuch groſs, contemptible, and abominable falſehood is delivered out in bits and ſcraps of this ſort, whether that does not call aloud for pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment?</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, only look at the truth; the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe is directly the caſe. The King of this country inherits an office under the law; he does not inherit perſons; we are not in a ſtate of villenage; the direct reverſe to what is here pointed out is the truth of the matter; the King inherits an office, but as to any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance of his people, none, you know, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to him, and I am aſhamed to ſay any thing more upon it.</p>
               <p>The next is in page 47. in which this man is ſpeaking of the Congreſs at Philadelphia in 1787, which was held becauſe the government of that country was found to be extremely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective as at firſt eſtabliſhed.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>This Convention met at Philadelphia, in May 1787, of which General Waſhington was elected preſident; he was not at that time con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with any of the State-governments or with Congreſs. He delivered up his commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion when the war ended, and ſince then had lived a private citizen.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The Convention went deeply into all the ſubjects, and having, after a variety of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0995201000:55"/>and inveſtigation, agreed among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon the ſeveral parts of a federal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, the next queſtion was the manner of giving it authority and practice.</q>
               </p>
               <p>What is the concluſion of that—they cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly agreed upon an appointment of their federal Conſtitution in 1787. I ſhould have thought that a man, meaning nothing more than hiſtory, would have been very well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to have ſtated what actually did hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen upon that occaſion; but, in order to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſs (as poſſibly it may be called) ſomething that formerly did paſs in this country, he choſe to do it in theſe inflaming and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptuous terms.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>For this purpoſe they did not, like a cabal of courtiers, ſend for a Dutch Stadtholder or a German Elector; but they referred the whole matter to the ſenſe and intereſt of the country.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Here again the revolution and the act of ſettlement ſtare us in the face, as if the intereſt and the ſenſe of the country were in no way conſulted; but, on the contrary, it was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more than a mere cabal of courtiers.— Whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>her that is or is not to be endured in this country, your verdict will ſhew; but, in order to ſhew you how totally unneceſſary this paſſage was, except for the deliberate purpoſe of calumny; if this paſſage had been left out, the narration would have been quite perfect. I will read three or four lines juſt to ſhew how perfect it would have been:— <q>The next queſtion was about the manner of giving it authority and practice.</q> The paſſage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0995201000:56"/>that which I call a libel,—<q>They firſt directed that the propoſed Conſtitution ſhould be publiſhed; ſecondly, that each State ſhould elect a Convention, for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of taking it into conſideration, and of ratifying or rejecting it;</q> and ſo the ſtory goes on—but, in order to explain what I mean by a dogma thruſt in, I call your attention to this, as one of thoſe which has no earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly connexion with the ſubject he was then ſpeaking of.</p>
               <p>Does not this paſſage ſtand inſulated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two parts of the connected ſtory officiouſly and deſignedly thruſt in for the purpoſes of miſchief? Gentlemen, the artifice of that book conſiſts alſo in this; the different wicked paſſages that are meant to do miſchief in this country, are ſpread throughout it, and ſtuck in here and there, in a manner that in order to ſee the whole malignity of it, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to have a recollection of ſeveral pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding paſſages; but theſe paſſages when brought together manifeſtly ſhew the full de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of the writer, and therefore extracts of it may be made to contain the whole marrow; and at the ſame time that each paſſage, taken by itſelf, will do miſchief enough, any man reading them together, will ſee that miſchief come out much clearer than by a mere tranſient reading.</p>
               <p>The next paſſage I have to obſerve upon is in page 52, and in page 52 he is pleaſed to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs himſelf in this manner: he ſays,</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The hiſtory of the Edwards and the Henrys, and up to the commencement of
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0995201000:57"/>the Stuarts, exhibits as many inſtances of tyranny as could be acted within the limits to which the nation had reſtricted it; the Stuarts endeavoured to paſs thoſe limits, and their fate is well known. In all theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances we ſee nothing of a Conſtitution, but only of reſtrictions on aſſumed power.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Then, gentlemen, from the reign of the Edwards and the Henrys down to the Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, it was a regular progreſſion of tyranny, not a progreſſion of liberty but of tyranny, till the Stuarts ſtepped a little beyond the line in the gradation that was going for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and that begot a neceſſity for a revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution; but of the Edwards I ſhould have thought, at leaſt, he might have ſpared the great founder of our juriſprudence, King Edward the Firſt, beſide many other Princes, the glory and the boaſt of this country, and many of them regarders of its freedom and Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution; but inſtead of that, this author would have the people of this country believe that up to that time it was a progreſſive tyranny, and that there was nothing of a Conſtitution, only reſtrictions on aſſumed power;—ſo that all the power that exiſted at that time was aſſumption and uſurpation.</p>
               <p>He thus proceeds <q>After this another Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam deſcended from the ſame ſtock, and claiming from the ſame origin, gained poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, and of the two evils, James and William, the nation preferred what it thought the leaſt</q> So that the deliverance of this country by the Prince of Orange was an evil, but the leaſt of the two, <q>since from circumſtances it muſt take one. The act
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0995201000:58"/>called the Bill of Rights comes here into view: What is it but a bargain which the parts of the government made with each other to divide powers, profits, and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges? You ſhall have ſo much, and I will have the reſt; and with reſpect to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it ſaid, for <hi>your ſhare,</hi> YOU <hi>ſhall have the right of petitioning.</hi> This being the caſe, the Bill of Rights is more properly a BILL OF WRONGS AND OF INSULT. As to what is called the Convention Parliament, it was a thing that made itſelf, and then made the authority by which it acted; a few perſons got together, and called themſelves by that name; ſeveral of them had never been elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and none of them for the purpoſe.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>From the time of William a ſpecies of government aroſe, iſſuing out of this coali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Bill of Rights, and more ſo ſince the corruption introduced at the Hanover ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion by the agency of Walpole, that can be deſcribed by no other name than a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpotic legiſlation.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Now, gentlemen, this is the deſcription that this man holds out of that on which reſts the property, the lives, and liberties, and the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges of the people of this country. I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to God, gentlemen, that any Britiſh man (for ſuch this man certainly was, and ſtill is) to uſe the words of our own Poet, when he ſpoke theſe words, A BILL OF WRONGS, A BILL OF INSULT, they did not "ſtick in his throat." What is that Bill of Rights? It can never be too often read. I will make no comment upon it, becauſe your own heads and hearts will
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0995201000:59"/>make that comment; you have a poſterity to look to. Are deſperate ruffians, who are to be found in every country, thus to attack the unalienable rights and privileges which are to deſcend undiminiſhed to that poſterity?</p>
               <p>Are YOU not to take care that this ſhall be ſacred to your poſterity. Is it not a truſt in YOUR hands? It is a truſt in YOUR hands as much as the execution of the law is a truſt in the hands of the crown; each has its guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians in this community, but you are the guardians of the Bill of Rights.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, it is this, <q>That the pretended power of ſuſpending of laws, or the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of laws, by regal authority, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of parliament, is illegal.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>That the pretended power of diſpenſing with laws, or the execution of laws, by the regal authority, as it hath been aſſumed and exerciſed of late, is illegal.</q>
               </p>
               <p>That is the law is above all.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>That levying money for, or to the uſe of, the Crown, by pretence of prerogative, without grant of parliament, for longer time, or in other manner than the ſame is or ſhall be granted, is illegal.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>That it is the right of the ſubjects to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition the king, and all commitments and proſecutions for ſuch petitions are illegal.</q>
               </p>
               <p>All that you get by the Bill of Rights, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this man's doctrine, is, that the Commons of this country have the right of petitioning. We all know this alludes to the caſe of the ſeven biſhops; that was a groſs violation of the rights of thoſe ſubjects of this
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0995201000:60"/>country; therefore, he ſtates, falſely and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciouſly, according to the language of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, which is perfectly correct in the preſent caſe, that the whole that was obtained by the ſubjects of this country was the right of petitioning; whereas it is declared to be their unalterable right, and ever to have been ſo, and adverts, as I before ſtated, to a groſs violation of it in a recent caſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>That the raiſing or keeping a ſtanding army within the kingdom in time of peace, unleſs it be with conſent of parliament, is againſt law.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>That the ſubjects, which are proteſtants, may have arms for their defence, ſuitable to their conditions, and as allowed by law.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>That elections of members of parliament ought to be free.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>That the freedom of ſpeech, and debates or proceedings in parliament, ought not to be impeached, or queſtioned, in any court or place out of parliament.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>That exceſſive bail ought not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, nor exceſſive fines impoſed, nor cruel and unuſual puniſhments inflicted.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>That jurors ought to be duly impannelled and returned; and jurors which paſs upon men in trials for high treaſon ought to be freeholders.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>That all grants and promiſes of fines and forfeitures of particular perſons, before conviction, are illegal and void.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>And that for the redreſs of all griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, and for the amendig, ſtrengthening,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0995201000:61"/>and preſerving of the laws, parliaments ought to be held frequently.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Further, gentlemen, this bill goes on to ſay, <q>For the ratifying, confirming, and eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſaid declaration, and the articles, clauſes, matters, and things, therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, by the force of a law made in due form, by authority of Parliament, do pray it may be declared and enacted, that all and ſingular the rights and liberties aſſerted and claimed in the ſaid declaration are the true ancient and indubitable rights and liberties of the people of this kingdom, and ſo ſhall be eſteemed, allowed, adjudged, deemed, and taken to be; and that all and every the particulars aforeſaid ſhall be firmly and ſtrictly holden and obſerved, as they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in the ſaid declaration, and all officers and miniſters whatſoever ſhall ſerve their majeſties and their ſucceſſors, according to the ſame in all times to come.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Such, gentlemen, is the Bill of Wrongs and of Inſult. I ſhall not profane it by ſaying one more word upon it.</p>
               <p>Now, gentlemen, I would aſk you, whether what is ſaid by this man be reaſoning or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion; or whether it is nothing elſe but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, and that deception conſiſting of a moſt abominable and complete ſuppreſſion? Is there a word of this act quoted? Has the poor mechanic, to whom this paſſage is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed, who is told that he has been wronged and inſulted at the revolution, has he this ſtatute by him to read? Would it not have been fair, at leaſt, to have ſtated what it was? But inſtead of that, unſight, unſeen, (to uſe
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:0995201000:62"/>a very vulgar expreſſion) this propoſition is tendered to the very loweſt man in this country, namely, that the Bill of Rights is a Bill of Wrongs and of Inſult.</p>
               <p>Paſs we then on to another; if you will pleaſe to make a memorandum of page 56, you will find that in the ſame ſpirit, and with the ſame deſign, this man tells you that—"The intention of the government of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land," here comes in another contemptuous expreſſion (<q>for I rather chuſe to call it by this name than the Engliſh government), appears ſince its political connexion with Germany to have been ſo completely en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſſed and abſorbed by foreign affairs, and the means of raiſing taxes, that it ſeems to exiſt for no other purpoſes.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The government of the country then does not exiſt for the purpoſe of preſerving our lives and properties; but the government, I mean the Conſtitution of the country, Kings, Lords, and Commons, exiſts for no other pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe but to be the inſtruments of raiſing taxes. To enter into any diſcuſſion of that, is taking up your time unneceſſarily—I only beg to draw your attention to the dogmatical and cavalier manner in which theſe things are aſſerted; fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he ſays— <q>Domeſtic concerns are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected, and with reſpect to regular law, there is ſcarcely ſuch a thing.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I ſtand in the city of London; I am ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing myſelf to gentlemen eminent in that city, whether the legiſlature, ſince the revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, has, or not, adverted to domeſtic concerns: I think I may appeal to the growing proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0995201000:63"/>of this country, from the moment that the night mare has been taken off its ſtomach, which preſſed upon it up to that moment.</p>
               <p>We then proceed to page 63, where, after the whole Conſtitution of this country has been thus treated in groſs, he proceeds a little to diſſect and conſider the component parts of that Conſtitution; and in page 63, in a dogma, we have this:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>With reſpect to the two Houſes of which the Engliſh Parliament is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, they appear to be effectually in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenced into one, and, as a legiſlature, to have no temper of its own. The Miniſter, whoever he at any time may be, touches it, as with an opium wand, and it ſleeps obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Now, gentlemen, here is another dogma without a ſingle fact, without a ſingle argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but it is held out to the ſubjects of this country, that there is no energy or activity in either the ariſtocratical or democratical parts of this Conſtitution, but that they are aſleep, and you might juſt as well have ſtatues there; it is not merely ſaid that it is ſo now, but it is in the nature of things, ſays he, that it ſhould be ſo.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>But if we look at the diſtinct abilities of the two Houſes, the difference will appear ſo great as to ſhew the inconſiſtency of placing power where there can be no certainty of the judgment to uſe it.—Wretched as the ſtate of repreſentation is in England, it is manhood compared with what is called the Houſe of Lords, and ſo
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0995201000:64"/>little is this nickname, Houſe regarded, that the people ſcarcely inquire at any time what it is doing. It appears alſo to be moſt under influence, and the furtheſt removed from the general intereſt of the nation.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Now, gentlemen, this is again ſpeaking in this man's contemptuous manner, at the expence of the ariſtocratical part of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of government; an eſſentially bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial part, whoſe great and permanent inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in the country renders them a firm barrier againſt any encroachment. I am not to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that you are ſo ignorant of the hiſtory of your country, as not to know the great and brilliant characters that have ſat in that Houſe. No particular period of time is alluded to in this paſſage. He ſurely cannot mean the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent time; but I conceive he ſpeaks of all times, and that from the very nature of our government it muſt everlaſtingly be ſo. Slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der upon that very great and illuſtrious part of the legiſlature (untrue at any period), writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in this ſcurrilous and contemptuous manner, is diſtinguiſhed greatly indeed from any ſober diſcuſſion of, whether an ariſtocratical part of government is a good or bad thing, and is calculated only to miſlead and inflame.</p>
               <p>If you look next to page 107, there you will find that two of the component parts of the legiſlature having been thus diſpoſed of, we come up to the throne itſelf, and this man ſays very truly of himſelf:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Having thus GLANCED at ſome of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of the two Houſes of Parliament, I
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0995201000:65"/>proceed to <hi>what is called the Crown,</hi> upon which I ſhall be very conciſe:</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>It ſignifies a nominal office of a million a year, the buſineſs of which conſiſts in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the money; whether the perſon be wiſe or fooliſh, ſane or inſane, a native or a foreigner, matters not. Every miniſter acts upon the ſame idea that Mr. Burke writes, namely, that the people muſt be hoodwink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and held in superſtitious ignorance by ſome bugbear or other; and what is called the Crown anſwers this purpoſe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it anſwers all the purpoſes to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>—This is more than can be ſaid of the other two branches.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The hazard to which this office is expoſed in all countries, including this among the reſt, is not from any thing that can happen to the man, but from what may happen to the nation, the danger of its coming to its ſenſes.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Then, gentlemen, we have been inſane for theſe ſeven or eight hundred years: and I ſhall juſt diſmiſs this with this obſervation, that this inſanity having ſubſiſted ſo long, I truſt in God that it is incurable.</p>
               <p>In page 116 you have this note,— <q>I hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to be in England at the celebration of the centenary of the revolution of 1688. The characters of William and Mary have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways appeared to me deteſtable; the one ſeeking to deſtroy his uncle, and the other her father, to get poſſeſſion of power them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: yet as the nation was diſpoſed to think ſomething of that event, I felt hurt
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:0995201000:66"/>at ſeeing it aſcribe the whole reputation of it to a man who had undertaken it as a job, and who, beſides what he otherwiſe got, charged ſix hundred thouſand pounds for the expence of a little fleet that brought him from Holland.—George the Firſt acted the ſame cloſe-fiſted part as William had done, and bought the Duchy of Bremen with the money he got from England, two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty thouſand pounds over and above his pay as King; and having thus purchaſed it at the expence of England, added it to his Hanoverian dominions for his own private profit.—In fact, every nation that does not govern itſelf, is governed as a job. England has been the prey of jobs ever ſince the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Then, gentlemen, what he calls a nation governing itſelf, is ſomething extremely diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from a nation having conſented from time immemorial to be governed by a democracy, an ariſtocracy, and an hereditary executive ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme magiſtrate; and moreover, by a law-paramount, which all are bound to obey, he conceives, I ſay, that ſort of government not to be a government of the people themſelves, but he denominates that ſort of government a job, and not a government.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, ſuch are the paſſages which I have ſelected to you, as thoſe that diſcloſe the moſt offenſive doctrines in the book; that is, ſuch as go fundamentally to the overturning the government of this country.—I beg pardon, I have omitted one which contains more of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect invitation than any thing I have yet ſtated,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0995201000:67"/>—it is in page 161: it is ſaid, <q>the fraud, hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſy and impoſition of governments are now beginning to be too well underſtood to promiſe them any long career.—The farce of monarchy and ariſtocracy in all countries is following that of chivalry, and Mr. Burke is dreſſing for the funeral—let it then paſs quietly to the tomb of all other follies, and the mourner be comforted. The time is not very diſtant when England will laugh at itſelf for ſending to Holland, Hanover, Zell, or Brunſwick, for men, at the expence of a million a year, who underſtand neither her laws, her language, nor her intereſt, and whoſe capacities would ſcarcely have fitted them for the office of pariſh conſtable.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This is ſaid of William the Third—this is ſaid of two very illuſtrious Princes of the Houſe of Brunſwick, George the Firſt and Second, and extends to the preſent Sovereign upon the throne.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>If government could be truſted to ſuch hands, it muſt be ſome eaſy and ſimple thing indeed, and materials fit for all the purpoſes may be found in every town and village in England.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The policy of the conſtitution of this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try has ever avoided, excepting when driven to it by melancholy neceſſity, to diſturb the hereditary ſucceſſion to the throne; and it has wiſely thought it more fitting to purſue that ſyſtem, even though a foreigner ſhould be ſeated on the thronce of theſe realms, than to break through it.—This would inſinuate, that the neceſſary defects of an hereditary monarchy
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0995201000:68"/>are ſuch as outweigh the advantages attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that which I have ſtated. Is that ſo? I would aſk any man who hears me, in point of hiſtory, whether it is not the permanent defect of elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive monarchies or ſovereigns, that they ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom are men of any conſideration, and for an obvious reaſon; moſt frequently it has hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened that turbulent factions, after having deſolated their country, one of them (it has ſo happened, at leaſt in moſt inſtances as far as my recollection goes) ſets up a tool whom the ſucceſsful faction can themſelves govern at pleaſure.—Often has it happened that ſuch factions, when a civil war ariſes, which muſt almoſt neceſſarily be the caſe in elective mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchies, not chooſing to come to the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of an armed conteſt, have choſen a very weak perſon, each in hope of ſtrengthening his party by the time the periodical civil war ſhould come round. I believe, upon examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, this will be found to be generally the caſe, and to have prevailed in elective monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies to a greater degree than any inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences that may have ever ariſen from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural infirmities of princes who ſucceeded to their thrones by hereditary rights, in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of Great Britain; for to that, this man alludes.</p>
               <p>Has he ſtated with any ſort of fairneſs, or has he at all ſtated or adverted to the many, many remedies we have for any defect of that ſort? Has he ſtated the numerous councils of a King? His council of Parliament —his council of his Judges in matters of law— his Privy council? Has he ſtated the reſponſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of all thoſe councils? Some in point of
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:0995201000:69"/>character, ſome of perſonable reſponſibility? Has he ſtated the reſponſibility of thoſe imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate ſervants who conduct his executive go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment? Has he ſtated the appointment of regents? Has he ſtated all this, which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſibly neceſſary towards a fair and honeſt diſcuſſion (which this book will poſſibly be called) of this point of his inſuperable ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to hereditary monarchy? Can this be called any other than groſs ſuppreſſion and wilful mis-ſtatement, to raiſe diſcontent in half-informed minds?</p>
               <p>There does come acroſs my mind at this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, unqueſtionably, one illuſtrious excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to that doctrine I have ſtated, of men not the moſt capable of government having in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral been choſen in the caſe of elective mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchies; and that is a man whom no indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, no misfortunes, no disappointments, no civil commotions, no provocations, ever forced from the full and ſteady poſſeſſion of a ſtrong mind, which has always riſen with elaſticity under all the preſſures that I have ſtated; and he, though not in one ſenſe of that word a great <hi>Prince,</hi> yet is certainly a great <hi>Man,</hi> who will go down as ſuch to the lateſt poſterity: I mean the King of Poland. Don't imagine, gentlemen, that my adverting to this illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious character is uſeleſs. Every gentleman who hears knows he had a conſiderable part of his matured education in this country. Here he familiarized himſelf with the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of this country. Here he became in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of the proviſions of what this man calls the Bill of Wrongs and Inſults, without diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paragement
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:0995201000:70"/>to him, for I believe him to be a juſt and wiſe prince, of great natural facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, here it was that he ſaw, and could alone learn how the regal government of a free peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple was conducted, and that under a prince of the houſe of Brunſwick.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, having ſtated thus much to you, I will now, for want of ſuitable expreſſions, (for mine are very feeble) borrow from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; I certainly have formed an opinion upon this ſubject preciſely ſimilar; to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it in plain words would exhauſt the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of my powers, but I will borrow the words of a very able writer, who has moſt properly, for fear ſome ill impreſſion ſhould be made by this book on the weaker part of mankind in America, given an anſwer to this book of Mr. Paine. That diſtinguiſhed gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, I have reaſon to believe, though not the chief magiſtrate in that country, is the ſecond in the executive government of it; that is, he is ſecond in the exerciſe of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal part of the government of that country. He takes care to confute accurately what Mr. Paine ſays with reſpect to America; but, borrowing his <hi>words,</hi> I beg to be underſtood, that this is my <hi>opinion</hi> of the work before you, and which I humbly offer for your conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and adoption. He ſays, <q>his intention appears evidently to be, to convince the people of Great Britain, that they have nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther liberty nor a conſtitution; that their only poſſible means to produce thoſe bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings to themſelves, is to topple down head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:0995201000:71"/>their preſent government, and follow implicitly the example of the French.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Gentlemen, the next paſſage, which I beg to be underſtood as mine, I wiſh I could ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs it as well myſelf, is this:— <q>Mr. Paine, in reply, cuts the Gordian knot at once, declares the parliament of 1688 to have been downright uſurpers, cenſures them for having unwiſely ſent to Holland for a King, denies the exiſtence of a Britiſh Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, and invites the people of England to overturn their preſent government and to erect another upon the broad baſis of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional ſovereignty and government by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation. As Mr. Paine has departed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together from the principles of the revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and has torn up by the roots all reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the Britiſh Conſtitution, by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial of its exiſtence, it becomes neceſſary to examine his work upon the grounds which he has choſen to aſſume. If we judge of the production from its apparent tendency, we may call it an addreſs to the Engliſh nation, attempting to prove that they have a right to form a new Conſtitution; that it is expedient for them immediately to exerciſe that right, and that in the formation of this Conſtitution they can do no better than to imitate the model ſet before them by the French na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional aſſembly. However immethodical his production is, I believe the whole of its ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumentative part may be referred to theſe three points: If the ſubject were to affect only the Britiſh nation, we might leave them to reaſon and act for themſelves; but
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:0995201000:72"/>theſe are concerns equally important to all mankind; and the citizens of America are called upon, from high authority, (he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ludes to a gentleman in a high ſituation in that country, who has publiſhed an opinion of this book) to rally round the ſtandard of this champion of revolutions. I ſhall, therefore now proceed to examine the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons;</q> and ſo he goes on.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I would adopt, with your per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, a few more words from this publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:— <q>When Mr. Paine invited the people of England to deſtroy their preſent govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and form another conſtitution, he ſhould have given them ſober reaſoning, and not flippant witticiſms.</q> Whether that is or not the caſe what I have read to you to-day will enable you to judge. <q>He ſhould have explained to them the nature of the grievances by which they are oppreſſed, and demonſtrated the impoſſibility of reforming the government in its preſent organization. He ſhould have pointed out ſome poſſible method for them to act, in their original character, without a total diſſolution of civil ſociety among them; he ſhould have proved what great advantages they would reap as a nation from ſuch a revolution, without diſguiſing the great dangers and formidable difficulties with which it muſt be attended.</q> So much for the paſſages them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and this interpretation, which I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſubmit to your conſideration.</p>
               <p>The next matter upon which I ſhall proceed is the evidence which I propoſe to adduce, and
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:0995201000:73"/>that evidence will go to ſhew, not only the fact of this man's being the writer of this book, by his own repeated admiſſion, and by letters under his own hand, but will likewiſe go di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to ſhew what is his intent in ſuch publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, which appears I think moſt clearly; and over and above that I ſhall produce to you a Letter, which this man was pleaſed to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs to myſelf, in which Letter he avows himſelf in ſo many words the author, and I ſhall prove it to be his hand-writing; and further than that, there is matter in that let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, apparently ſhewing the intention with which that book was written, namely to vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lify this conſtitution, and to injure this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try irretrievably.</p>
               <p>Two other letters I ſhall be under the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of reading to you, in which he has ſtated himſelf the author. The one is a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to a perſon of the name of Jordan, in which he expreſſes himſelf in this manner:</p>

               </p>
               <p>Gentlemen, with reſpect to his letter writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to me, it is in theſe terms.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. ERSKINE.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, the Attorney General ſtates a letter in the hand writing of Mr. Paine, which eſtabliſhes that he is the author. I deſire to know whether he means to read a letter which may be the ſubject of a ſubſtantive and diſtinct proſecution; I do not mean to diſpute the publication, or even to give him the trouble of proving the letters which he has juſt ſtated; whether the Attorney General will think it conſiſtent with the ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in which he is placed, at this moment, to read a letter written at a time long ſubſequent to the publication, containing, as I underſtand (if I am miſtaken in that I withdraw my ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection) but containing diſtinct clear and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equivocal libellous matter, and which I, in my addreſs to the jury, if I am not deceived in what I have heard, ſhall admit to be upon every principle of the Engliſh Law a libel. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if that ſhould turn out to be the caſe, will your lordſhip ſuffer the mind of the jury to be entirely put aſide from that matter which is the ſubject of the proſecution, and to go into matter which hereafter may be, and I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but ſuppoſe would be, if the defendant
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:0995201000:75"/>were within the reach of the law of this country, the ſubject of a diſtinct and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant proſecution.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>LORD KENYON.</speaker>
               <p>If that letter goes a jot to prove that he is the author of this publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, I cannot reject that evidence; in proſecutions for high treaſon, where overt acts are laid, you may prove overt acts not laid to prove thoſe that are laid; if it goes to prove him the author of the book, I am bound to admit it.</p>
               <p>"Mr. ATTORNEY GENERAL,</p>
               <p>The Letter is thus:</p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Paris,</hi> 11th <hi>of November,</hi> 1ſt <hi>Year of the Republic.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sir, as there can be no perſonal reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment between two ſtrangers, I write this letter to you, as to a man againſt whom I have no animoſity.</p>
                  <p>You have, as Attorney General, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced a proſecution againſt me as the author of the Rights of Man. Had not my duty, in conſequence of my being elected a member of the National Convention of France, called me from England, I ſhould have ſtaid to have conteſted the injuſtice of that proſecution; not upon my own account, for I cared not about the proſecution, but to defend the principles I had advanced in the work.</p>
                  <p>The duty I am now engaged in is of too much importance to permit me to trouble myſelf about your proſecution; when I have
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:0995201000:76"/>leiſure, I ſhall have no objection to meet you on that ground; but, as I now ſtand, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you go on with the proſecution or whether you do not, or whether you obtain a verdict, or not, is a matter of the moſt perfect indifference to me as an individual. If you obtain one (which you are welcome to if you can get it), it cannot affect me, either in perſon, property, or reputation, otherwiſe than to increaſe the latter; and with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to yourſelf, it is as conſiſtent that you obtain a verdict againſt the Man in the Moon, as againſt me; neither do I ſee how you can continue the proſecution againſt me as you would have done againſt one of <hi>your own people,</hi> who had abſented himſelf becauſe he was proſecuted; what paſſed at Dover, proves that my departure from England was no ſecret.</p>
                  <p>My neceſſary abſence from your country affords the opportunity of knowing whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the proſecution was intended againſt Thomas Paine, or againſt the Rights of the People of England to inveſtigate ſyſtems and principles of government; for as I cannot now be the object of the proſecution, the going on with the proſecution will ſhew that ſomething elſe was the object, and that ſomething elſe can be no other than the People of England; for it is againſt <hi>their Rights,</hi> and not againſt me, that a verdict or ſentence can operate, if it can operate at all. Be then ſo candid as to tell the Jury (if you chuſe to continue the proceſs) whom it is
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:0995201000:77"/>you are proſecuting, and on whom it is that the verdict is to fall.</p>
               </q>
               <p>Gentlemen, I certainly will comply with this requeſt. I am proſecuting both him and his work; and if I ſucceed in this proſecution, he ſhall never return to this country otherwiſe than <hi>in vinculis,</hi> for I will outlaw him.</p>
               <q>But I have other reaſons than thoſe I have mentioned for writing you this letter; and however you may chuſe to interpret them, they procceed from a good heart. The time, Sir, is becoming too ſerious to play with Court proſecutions, and ſport with national rights. The terrible examples that have taken place here upon men who, leſs than a year ago, thought themſelves as ſecure as any proſecuting Judge, Jury, or Attorney General, can now do in England, ought to have ſome weight with men in your ſituation.</q>
               <p>Now gentlemen, I do not think that Mr. Paine judges very well of mankind—I do not think that it is a fair concluſion of Mr. Paine, that men ſuch as you and myſelf, who are quietly living in obedience to the laws of the land which they inhabit, exerciſing their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral functions peaceably, and I hope with a moderate ſhare of reputation: I do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that men called upon to think, and in the habit of reflection, are the moſt likely men to be immediately thrown off the hinges by meances and threats; and I doubt whether men exerciſing public functions, as you and I do in the face of our country, could have the courage to run away. All I can tell Mr. Paine
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:0995201000:78"/>is this—if any of his aſſaſſins are here in Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and there is ſome ground to ſuppoſe they may be, or the aſſaſſins of thoſe with whom he is connected; if they are here, I tell them, that I do in my conſcience think, that for a man to die of doing his duty, is juſt as good a thing as dying of a raging fever, or under the tortures of the ſtone. Let him not think, that not to be an incendiary is to be a coward.</p>
               <p>He ſays— <q>That the Government of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land is as great, if not the greateſt perfection of fraud and corruption, that ever took place ſince governments began, is what you cannot be a ſtranger to; unleſs the conſtant habit of ſeeing it has blinded your ſenſe." Upon my word gentlemen, I am ſtone blind, I am not ſorry for it.</q>— <q>But though you may not chuſe to ſee it, the people are ſeeing it very faſt, and the progreſs is beyond what you may chuſe to believe, or that reaſon can make any other man believe, that the capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of ſuch a man as Mr. Guelph, or any of his profligate ſons, is neceſſary to the government of a nation.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Now, gentlemen, with reſpect to this paſſage, I have this to ſay, it is contemptuous, ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous, falſe, cruel;—Why Gentlemen, is Mr. Paine, in addition to the political doctrines that he is teaching us in this country; Is he to teach us the morality and religion, of IM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PLACABILITY? Is he to teach human creatures, whoſe moments of exiſtence, depend upon the permiſſion of a Being, merciful, long ſuffering and of great goodneſs, that thoſe youthful errors from which even royalty is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:0995201000:79"/>are to be treaſured up in a vindictive memory, and are to receive ſentence of irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſible ſin at HIS hands. Are they all to be confounded in theſe ſlanderous terms, ſhock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for Britiſh ears to hear, and I am ſure diſtreſſing to their hearts. He is a barbarian, who could uſe ſuch profligate expreſſions un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called for by any thing which could be the object of his letter addreſſed to me. If giving me pain was his object, he has that helliſh gratification. Would this man deſtroy that great auxiliary of all human laws and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions— "to judge of others as we would be judged ourſelves."—This is the bill of wrongs and inſults of the chriſtian religion. I preſume it is conſidered as that bill of wrongs and inſults, in the heart of that man who can have the barbarity to uſe thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions and addreſs them to me in a way by which I could not but receive them.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, there is not perhaps in the world a more beneficial analogy, nor a finer rule to judge by in public matters, than by aſſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating them to what paſſes in domeſtic life.— A family is a ſmall kingdom, a kingdom is a large family ſuppoſe this to have happened in private life, judge of the good heart of this man, who thruſts into my hands, the grateful ſervant of a kind and beneficent maſter, and that too through the unavoidable trick of the common poſt ſlander upon that maſter, and ſlander upon his whole offspring. Lay your hands upon your hearts, and tell me what is <hi>your</hi> verdict with reſpect to his heart—I <hi>ſee</hi> it!
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:0995201000:80"/>Gentlemen, he has the audacity to ſay, "I ſpeak to you as one man ought to ſpeak to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other." Does he ſpeak to me of thoſe Auguſt Perſonages as one man ought to ſpeak to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other? Had he ſpoken thoſe words to me per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally, I will not anſwer for it, whether I ſhould not have forgot the duties of my office, and the dignity of my ſtation, by being hurried into a violation of that peace, the breach of which I am compelled to puniſh in others. He ſays, <q>And I know alſo, that I ſpeak, what other people are beginning to think. That you cannot obtain a verdict (and if you do, it will ſignify nothing) without <hi>packing a Jury,</hi> and we <hi>both</hi> know that ſuch tricks are practiſed, is what I have very good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to believe.</q>—<hi>Mentiris impudentiſſime.</hi> —Gentlemen, I know of no ſuch practice; I know, indeed, that no ſuch practice exiſts, nor can exiſt; I know the very contrary of this to be true; and I know too that this Letter, containing this dangerous falſehood, was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtined for future publication; that I have no doubt of, and therefore I dwell thus long upon it.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>I have gone into coffee-houſes, and places where I was unknown, on purpoſe to learn the currency of opinion.</q> Whether the ſenſe of this <hi>nation</hi> is to be had in ſome pot-houſes and coffee-houſes in this town of his own chooſing, is a matter I leave to your judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <q>And I never yet ſaw any company of twelve men that condemned the book; but I have often found a greater number than twelve approving it; and this I think
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:0995201000:81"/>is <hi>a fair way of collecting the natural currency of opinion.</hi> Do not then, Sir, be the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of drawing twelve men into a ſituation that may be <hi>injurious</hi> to them afterwards;</q> injurious to them afterwards, thoſe words ſpeak for themſelves. He proceeds thus,</p>
               <p>"I do not ſpeak this from policy," (what then?) "but from" (gentlemen, I will give you a hundred gueſſes) <q>BENEVOLENCE! but if you chuſe to go on with the proceſs, I make it my requeſt that you would read this let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in Court, after which the Judge and the Jury may do as they pleaſe. As I do not conſider myſelf the object of the proſecution, neither can I be affected by the iſſue one way or the other, I ſhall, though a foreigner in your country, ſubſcribe as much money as any other man towards ſupporting the right of the nation againſt the proſecution; and it is for this purpoſe only that I ſhall do it.—THOMAS PAINE.</q>
               </p>
               <p>So it is a ſubſcription defence you hear.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>P. S. I intended, had I ſtaid in England, to have publiſhed the information, with my remarks upon it,</q>—that would have been a decent thing— <q>before the trial came on; but as I am otherwiſe engaged, I reſerve myſelf till the trial is over, when I ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply fully to every thing you ſhall advance;</q> I hope in God he will not omit any one ſingle word that I have uttered to day, or ſhall utter in my future addreſs to you. This <hi>conceited</hi> menace I deſpiſe, as I do thoſe of a nature more <hi>cut-throat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="83" facs="tcp:0995201000:82"/>Gentlemen, I do not think that I need to trouble you any further for the preſent: ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as you ſhall be of opinion, that the neceſſarily miſchievous tendency and intent of this book is that which I have taken the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty (at more length than I am warranted perhaps) to ſtate to you; according as you ſhall or ſhall not be of that opinion, ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily will be your verdict. I have done my duty in bringing before a Jury an offender of this magnitude. Be the event what it may, I <hi>have</hi> done my duty; I am ſatisfied with hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing placed this great and flouriſhing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity under the powerful ſhield of your protection.</p>

                  <speaker>A.</speaker>
                  <p>When I had finiſhed page 112, or ſheet H, the proof ſheet I, came into my hand; upon examining ſheet I, there was a part, which, in my weak judgment, appeared of a dangerous tendency; I therefore immediately concluded
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:0995201000:85"/>in my mind not to proceed any farther in the work; accordingly I wrote a ſhort note to Mr. Paine; this was about two o'clock in the afternoon, determining to ſend a letter, with the remainder of the copy. I felt a degree of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctance from the circumſtance of Mr. Paine's civilities that I had experienced as a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man and an employer; and I was fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful I ſhould not have courage in the morning to deliver up the copy; but a circumſtance occurred in the courſe of the day, which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled me to do it with ſatisfaction to myſelf. I will relate the circumſtance, if you will give me leave.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Q.</speaker>
                  <p>Was Mr. Paine preſent when that cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance happened?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>A.</speaker>
                  <p>He was: and as it may, in the eyes of the Court, exculpate me from a charge that Mr. Paine has thought proper to bring againſt me, I ſhall eſteem it a favor of the Court if they will ſuffer me to mention every circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of that kind.—That very day at ſix o'clock Mr. Paine called upon me.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Q.</speaker>
                  <p>Do you recollect the day?</p>

                  <speaker>A.</speaker>
                  <p>I have a copy of that letter, which is dated the 17th of January, ſo that he muſt have called upon me on the 16th. Mr. Paine called upon me, and, as was rather unuſual, at leaſt to my knowledge, he was rather intoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated by liquor. He had, I believe, that day, dined with Mr. Johnſon, in Saint Paul's Church Yard. Being intoxicated he introduced a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject we have unfortunately differed on ſeveral times; the ſubject of religion, a favourite ſubject with him when intoxicated. I am
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:0995201000:86"/>ſorry to mention theſe circumſtances; but as it will juſtify me in the eyes of the public, as part of the Appendix has done me material injury in my profeſſion. The ſubject of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate ran very high; he oppoſed every thing with great virulence, till at length he came to perſonal abuſe, very much ſo, both to myſelf and Mrs. Chapman. An obſervation was made by Mrs. Chapman, late in the evening, I believe near ten o'clock, at which Mr. Paine was particularly offended; riſing up in a great paſſion, he ſaid he had not been ſo perſonally affronted in the whole courſe of his life be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>

                  <speaker>Chapman.</speaker>
                  <p>Mr. Paine accordingly roſe in a great paſſion, declaring that, as I was a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſenter, he had a very bad opinion of diſſenters in general; he believed them all to be a pack of hypocrites, and therefore he muſt deal very cautiouſly with them, and begged, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that in the morning, before I proceeded any further in his work, we ſhould have a ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement. I felt a degree of pleaſure in it, as it enabled me, with courage, next morning, to deliver up his copy, which I had before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined. I ſent a letter next morning, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſing the whole of his copy. He called upon me, and made many apologies for what
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:0995201000:87"/>he had ſaid: he ſaid that it was the effect of liquor, and hoped that I would paſs it over, and proceed with the work; but being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined on the matter, I would not upon any account.</p>

                     <p>As there can be no perſonal reſentment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two ſtrangers, I write this letter to you, as to a man againſt whom I have no animo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity.</p>
                     <p>You have, as Attorney General, commenced a proſecution againſt me, as the Author of
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:0995201000:92"/>Rights of Man. Had not my duty, in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of my being elected a Member of the National Convention of France, called me from England, I ſhould have ſtaid to have conteſted the injuſtice of that proſecution; not upon my own account, for I cared not about the proſecution, but to have defended the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples I had advanced in the work.</p>
                     <p>The duty I am now engaged in is of too much importance to permit me to trouble myſelf about your proſecution: when I have leiſure, I ſhall have no objection to meet you on that ground; but as I now ſtand, whether you go on with the proſecution, or whether you do not, or whether you obtain a verdict, or not, is a matter of the moſt perfect indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to me as an individual. If you ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain one (which you are welcome to, if you can get it) it cannot affect me either in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, property, or reputation, otherwiſe than to increaſe the latter; and with reſpect to yourſelf, it is as conſiſtent that you obtain a verdict againſt the Man in the Moon as againſt me: neither do I ſee how you can continue the proſecution againſt me as you would have done againſt one of <hi>your own people</hi> who had abſented himſelf becauſe he was proſecuted: what paſſed at Dover proves that my depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from England was no ſecret.</p>
                     <p>My neceſſary abſence from your country now, in conſequence of my duty here, affords the opportunity of knowing whether the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution was intended againſt Thomas Paine, or againſt the Rights of the people of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land to inveſtigate ſyſtems and principles of
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:0995201000:93"/>government; for as I cannot now be the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the proſecution, the going on with the proſecution will ſhew that ſomething elſe was the object, and that ſomething elſe can be no other than the people of England, for it is againſt <hi>their rights,</hi> and not againſt me, that a verdict or ſentence can operate, if it can ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate at all. Be then ſo candid as to tell the jury (if you chuſe to continue the proceſs) whom it is you are proſecuting, and on whom it is that the verdict is to fall.</p>
                     <p>But I have other reaſons than thoſe I have mentioned for writing you this letter; and, however you may chuſe to interpret them, they proceed from a good heart. The time, Sir, is becoming too ſerious to play with Court proſecutions, and ſport with National Rights. The terrible examples that have taken place here, upon men who leſs than a year ago thought themſelves as ſecure as any proſecuting Judge, Jury, or Attorney General, can now do in England, ought to have ſome weight with men in your ſituation. That the government of England is as great, if not the greateſt, perfection of fraud and corruption that ever took place ſince governments be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, is what you cannot be a ſtranger to, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the conſtant habit of ſeeing it has blinded your ſenſes; but though you may not chuſe to ſee it, the people are ſeeing it very faſt, and the progreſs is beyond what you may chuſe to believe. Is it poſſible that you, or I can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, or that reaſon can make any other man believe, that the capacity of ſuch a man as Mr. Guelph, or any of his profligate ſons, is
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:0995201000:94"/>neceſſary to the government of a nation. I ſpeak to you as one man ought to ſpeak to another; and I know alſo, that I ſpeak what other people are beginning to think.</p>
                     <p>That you cannot obtain a verdict (and if you do it will ſignify nothing) without pack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a jury, (and we both know that ſuch tricks are practiſed) is what I have very good reaſon to believe. I have gone into coffee-houſes, and places where I was unknown, on purpoſe to learn the currency of opinion, and I never yet ſaw any company of twelve men that condemned the book; but I have often found a greater number than twelve approv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, and this I think is a fair way of collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the natural currency of opinion. Do not then, Sir, be the inſtrument of drawing twelve men into a ſituation that may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious to them afterwards. I do not ſpeak this from policy, but from benevolence; but if you chuſe to go on with the proceſs, I make it my requeſt to you that you will read this letter in Court, after which the Judge and the Jury may do as they pleaſe. As I do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider myſelf the object of the proſecution, neither can I be affected by the iſſue, one way or the other, I ſhall, though a foreigner in your country, ſubſcribe as much money as any other man towards ſupporting the right of the Nation againſt the proſecution; and it is for this purpoſe only that I ſhall do it.</p>

All hereditary government is in its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture tyranny. An heritable Crown, or an heritable Throne, or by what other fanciful name ſuch things may be called, have no other ſignificant explanation than that mankind are heritable property.

                  <p>This convention met at Philadelphia in May 1787, of which General Waſhington was elected preſident. He was not at that time connected with any of the State-govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or with Congreſs. He delivered up his commiſſion when the war ended, and ſince then had lived a private citizen.</p>
                  <p>The convention went deeply into all the ſubjects; and having, after a variety of debate and inveſtigation, agreed among themſelves upon the ſeveral parts of a federal conſtitution, the next queſtion was, the manner of giving it authority and practice.</p>

                     <pb n="99" facs="tcp:0995201000:98"/>For this purpoſe, they did not, like a cabal of courtiers, ſend for a Dutch Stadtholder, or a German Elector; but they referred the whole matter to the ſenſe and intereſt of the country.</p>

                  <p>The hiſtory of the Edwards and Henries, and up to the commencement of the Stuarts, exhibits as many inſtances of tyranny as could be acted within the limits to which the nation had reſtricted it. The Stuarts endeavoured to paſs thoſe limits, and their fate is well known. In all thoſe inſtances we ſee nothing of a conſtitution, but only of reſtrictions on aſſumed power.</p>
                  <p>After this, another William, deſcended from the ſame ſtock, and claiming from the ſame origin, gained poſſeſſion; and of the two evils, <hi>James</hi> and <hi>William,</hi> the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion preferred what it thought the leaſt; ſince, from circumſtances, it muſt take one. The Act, called the Bill of Rights, comes here into view. What is it but a bargain, which the parts of the Government made with each other to divide powers, profits, and privileges? You ſhall have ſo much, and I will have the reſt; and with reſpect to the nation, it ſaid, for <hi>your ſhare,</hi> YOU <hi>ſhall have the right of petitioning.</hi> This being the caſe, the Bill of Rights is more properly a bill of wrongs, and of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult.
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:0995201000:99"/>As to what is called the Convention Parliament, it was a thing that made itſelf, and then made the authority by which it acted. A few perſons got together, and called themſelves by that name. Several of them had never been elected, and none of them for the purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>From the time of William, a ſpecies of government aroſe, iſſuing out of this coali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Bill of Rights; and more ſo, ſince the corruption introduced at the Hanover ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, by the agency of Walpole; that can be deſcribed by no other name than a deſpotic legiſlation. Though the parts may embarraſs each other, the whole has no bounds; and the only right it acknowleges out of itſelf is the right of petitioning. Where then is the Conſtitution either that gives or that reſtrains power?</p>
                  <p>It is not becauſe a part of the government is elective, that makes it leſs a deſpotiſm, if the perſons ſo elected, poſſeſs afterwards, as a parliament, unlimited powers. Elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in this caſe, becomes ſeparated from repreſentation, and the candidates are can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didates for deſpotiſm.</p>

                  <p>With reſpect to the two Houſes, of which the Engliſh Parliament is compoſed, they appear to be effectually influenced into one, and, as a legiſlature, to have no temper of its own. The Miniſter, whoever he at any time may be, touches it as with an opium wand, and it ſleeps obedience.</p>
                  <p>But if we look at the diſtinct abilities of the two Houſes, the difference will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear ſo great, as to ſhew the inconſiſtency of placing power where there can be no certainty of the judgment to uſe it. Wretched as the ſtate of repreſentation is in England, it is manhood compared with what is called the Houſe of Lords; and ſo little is this nicknamed Houſe regarded, that the people ſcarcely enquire at any time what it is doing.

                  <p>Having thus glanced at ſome of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of the two Houſes of Parliament, I proceed to what is called the Crown, upon which I ſhall be very conciſe.</p>
                  <p>It ſignifies a nominal office of a million ſterling a year, the buſineſs of which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in receiving the money. Whether the perſon be wiſe or fooliſh, ſane or inſane, a native or a foreigner, matters not. Every miniſtry acts upon the ſame idea<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that Mr. Burke writes, namely, that the people muſt be hoodwinked, and held in ſuperſtitious ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance by ſome bugbear or other; and what is called the Crown anſwers this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and therefore it anſwers all the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes to be expected from it. This is more than can be ſaid of the other two branches. The hazard to which this office is expoſed in all countries, is not from any thing that can happen to the man, but from what may happen to the nation—the danger of its coming to its ſenſes.</p>

                  <p>I happened to be in England at the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration of the centenary of the revolution of 1688. The characters of William and Mary have always appeared to me deteſtable; the one ſeeking to deſtroy his uncle, and the other her father, to get poſſeſſion of power themſelves; yet, as the nation was
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:0995201000:102"/>diſpoſed to think ſomething of that event, I felt hurt at ſeeing it aſcribe the whole reputation of it to a man who had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken it as a job, and who, beſides what he otherwiſe got, charged 600,000 l. for the expence of the little fleet that brought him from Holland. George the Firſt acted the ſame cloſe-fiſted part as William had done, and bought the Duchy of Bremin with the money he got from England, 250,000 l. over and above his pay as King; and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus purchaſed it at the expence of England, added it to his Hanoverian do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions for his own private profit. In fact, every nation that does not govern itſelf, is governed as a job. England has been the prey of jobs over ſince the revolution.</p>

                  <p>The fraud, hypocriſy, and impoſition of governments, are now beginning to be too well underſtood to promiſe them any long career. The farce of monarchy and ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy, in all countries, is following that of chivalry, and Mr. Burke is dreſſing for the funeral. Let it then paſs quietly to the tomb of all other follies, and the mourners be comforted.</p>
                  <p>The time is not very diſtant when England will laugh at itſelf for ſending to Holland, Hanover, Zell, or Brunſwick for men, at
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:0995201000:103"/>the expence of a million a year, who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood neither her laws, her language, nor her intereſt, and whoſe capacities would ſcarcely have fitted them for the office of pariſh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable.

It cannot, therefore, by any fair inference, even decypher the mind of the author when he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed his work; ſtill leſs can it affect the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the language in which the work it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf is written. The introduction of this letter at all is, therefore, not only a departure from the charge, but a ſort of dereliction of the object of the proſecution, which is to condemn the book: for if the condemnation of the author is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, not by the work itſelf, but by collateral
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:0995201000:106"/>matter not even exiſting when it was written, nor known to its various publiſhers throughout the kingdom, how can a verdict upon ſuch grounds condemn the work, or criminate other publiſhers, ſtrangers to the collateral matter on which the conviction may be obtained? I maintain, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that, upon every principle of ſound policy, as it affects the intereſts of the crown, and upon every rule of juſtice, as it affects the author of the Rights of Man, the letter ſhould be wholly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed from your conſideration.</p>
                  <p>Gentlemen, the Attorney General has thought it neceſſary to inform you, that a rumour had been ſpread, and had reached his ears, that he only car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on the proſecution as a public proſecutor, but without the concurrence of his own private judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and therefore to add the juſt weight of his own character to his public duty, and to repel what he thinks a calumny, he tells you that he ſhould have deſerved to have been driven from ſociety, if he had not arraigned the work and the author before you.</p>
                  <p>Here too we ſtand in ſituations very different. I have no doubt of the exiſtence of ſuch a rumour, and of its having reached his ears, becauſe he ſays ſo; but for the narrow circle in which any rumour, perſonally implicating my learned friend's charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, has extended, I might appeal to the multitudes who ſurround us, and aſk, which of all them, except the few connected in office with the crown, ever heard of its exiſtence. But with regard to myſelf, every man who hears me at this moment, nay, the whole People of England, have been wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes to the calumnious clamour that, by every art, has been raiſed and kept up againſt me: In every
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:0995201000:107"/>place, where buſineſs or pleaſure collect the public together, day after day my name and character have been the topics of injurious reflection. And for what—only for not having ſhrunk from the diſcharge of a duty which no perſonal advantage recommended, and which a thouſand difficulties repelled. But, gentlemen, I have no complaint to make, either againſt the printers of theſe libels, nor even againſt their authors; the greater part of them, hurried perhaps away by honeſt prejudices, may have believed they were ſerving their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try by rendering me the object of its ſuſpicion and contempt; and if there have been amongſt them others who have mixed in it from perſonal malice and unkindneſs, I thank God I can forgive them alſo.—Little indeed did they know me, who thought that ſuch proceedings would influence my conduct: I will for ever, at all hazards, aſſert the dignity, independence, and integrity of the ENGLISH BAR; without which, impartial juſtice, the moſt valuable part of the Engliſh conſtitution, can have no exiſtence. For, from the moment that any advocate can be permitted to ſay, that he will or will not ſtand between the crown and a ſubject arraigned in the court where he daily ſits to practiſe, from that moment the liberties of England are at an end. If the advocate refuſes to defend, from what he may think of the charge or of the defence, he aſſumes the character of the judge; nay, he aſſumes it before the hour of judgment; and, in proportion to his rank and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, puts the heavy influence of, perhaps, a miſtaken opinion into the ſcale againſt the accuſed, in whoſe favour the benevolent principle of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:0995201000:108"/>law makes all preſumptions, and which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands the very Judge to be his counſel.</p>
                  <p>Gentlemen, it is now my duty to addreſs my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf regularly and without digreſſion to the defence. And the firſt thing which preſents itſelf in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion of a judicial ſubject, and indeed of every other, is to ſtate diſtinctly, and with preciſion, what the queſtion is, and (where prejudice and miſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation have been exerted), to diſtinguiſh it accurately from what it is not. The queſtion then is NOT whether the conſtitution of our fathers, under which we live—under which I preſent myſelf before you, and under which alone you have any juriſdiction to hear me,—be or be not preferable to the conſtitution of America or France, or any other human conſtitution. For upon what principle can a court, conſtituted by the authority of any government, and adminiſtering a poſitive ſyſtem of law under it, pronounce a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion againſt the conſtitution which creates its au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; or the rule of action which its juriſdiction is to enforce? The common ſenſe of the moſt uninformed perſon muſt revolt at ſuch an abſurd ſuppoſition.</p>
                  <p>I have no difficulty, therefore, in admitting, that if by accident ſome or all of you were alienated in opinion and affection from the forms and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the Engliſh government, and were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed with the value of that unmixed repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative conſtitution which this work recommends and inculcates, you could not, on that account, acquit the defendant. Nay, to ſpeak out plainly, I freely admit, that even if you were avowed ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to monarchy, and devoted to republicaniſm, you would be nevertheleſs bound by your oaths,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:0995201000:109"/>as a jury ſworn to adminiſter Engliſh juſtice, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vict the author of the Rights of Man, if it were brought home to your conſciences, that he had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded thoſe widely extended bounds which the ancient wiſdom and liberal policy of the Engliſh conſtitution have allotted to the range of a free preſs. I freely concede this, becauſe you have no juriſdiction to judge either the author or the work, by any rule but by the Engliſh law, which is the ſource of your authority. But having made this large conceſſion, it follows, by a conſequence ſo inevitable as to be invulnerable to all argument or artifice, that if, on the other hand, you ſhould be impreſſed (which I know you to be) not only with a dutiful regard, but with an enthuſiaſm, for the whole form and ſubſtance of your own government; and though you ſhould think that this work, in its circulation amongſt claſſes of men unequal to po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical reſearches, may tend to alienate opinion, ſtill you cannot, upon theſe grounds, without a ſimilar breach of duty, convict the defendant of a libel, unleſs he has clearly ſtepped beyond that extended range of communication which the ſame ancient wiſdom and liberal policy of the Britiſh conſtitution has allotted for the liberty of the preſs.</p>
                  <p>Gentlemen, I admit, with the Attorney Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, that in every caſe where a court has to eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate the quality of a writing, the mind and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the writer muſt be taken into the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; the bona, or mala fides, as lawyers ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs it, muſt be examined: for a writing may undoubtedly proceed from a motive, and be directed to a purpoſe, not to be decyphered by the mere conſtruction of the thing written. But wherever a writing is arraigned as ſeditious or ſlanderous,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:0995201000:110"/>not upon its ordinary conſtruction in language, nor from the neceſſary conſequences of its publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, under any circumſtances and at all times, but that the criminality ſprings from ſome extrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic matter, not viſible upon the page itſelf, nor univerſally operative, but capable only of being connected with it by evidence, ſo as to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate the effect of the publication, and the deſign of the publiſher; ſuch a writing, not libellous PER SE, cannot be arraigned as the author's work is arraigned upon the record before the court. I maintain, without the hazard of contradiction, that the law of England poſitively requires, for the ſecurity of the ſubject, that every charge of a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel complicated with extrinſic facts and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, <hi>dehors the writing,</hi> muſt appear literally upon the record, that the defendant may know what crime he is called upon to anſwer, and how to ſtand upon his defence. What crime is it that the defendant comes to anſwer for to day? what is the notice that I, who am his counſel, have from this parchment of the crime alleged againſt him? I come to defend his having written this book. The record ſtates nothing elſe: the charge of ſedition in the introduction is notoriouſly paper and pack-thread, and the innuendos cannot enlarge the ſenſe, or natural conſtruction of the text. The record does not ſtate any one extrinſic fact or cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, to render the work criminal, at one time more than another; it ſtates no peculiarity of time, or ſeaſon, or intention, not proveable from the writing itſelf, which is the naked charge upon record. There is nothing therefore which, upon any principle of Engliſh law, gives you any juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction beyond the conſtruction of the <hi>work itſelf;</hi>
                     <pb n="112" facs="tcp:0995201000:111"/>and you cannot be juſtified in finding it criminal becauſe publiſhed at this time, unleſs it would have been a criminal publication under any cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, or at any other time.</p>
                  <p>The law of England then, both in its forms and ſubſtance, being the only rule by which the author or the work can be juſtified or condemned, and the charge upon the record being the naked charge of a libel, the cauſe reſolves itſelf into a queſtion of the deepeſt importance to us all, THE NATURE AND EXTENT OF THE LIBERTY OF THE ENGLISH PRESS.</p>
                  <p>But before I enter upon it, I wiſh to fulfil a duty to the defendant, which, if I do not deceive my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, is at this moment peculiarly neceſſary to his impartial trial.—If an advocate entertains ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments injurious to the defence he is engaged in, he is not only juſtified, but bound in duty, to conceal them; ſo, on the other hand, if his own genuine ſentiments, or any thing connected with his character or ſituation, can add ſtrength to his profeſſional aſſiſtance, he is bound to throw them into the ſcale: in addreſſing myſelf, therefore, to gentlemen not only zealous for the honour of Engliſh government, but viſibly indignant at any attack upon its principles, and who would, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, be impatient of arguments from a ſuſpected quarter, I give my client the benefit of declaring, that I am, and ever have been, attached to the genuine principles of the Britiſh government; and that, however the court or you may reject the application, I defend him upon principles not only conſiſtent with its permanence and ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, but, without the eſtabliſhment of which, it never could have had an exiſtence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="113" facs="tcp:0995201000:112"/>The propoſition which I mean to maintain as the baſis of the liberty of the preſs, and without which it is an empty ſound, is this:</p>

                  <p>If, indeed, he writes what he does not think; if, contemplating the miſery of others, he wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly condemns what his own underſtanding ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves; or, even admitting his real diſguſt againſt the government or its corruptions, if he calumni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates <hi>living magiſtrates,</hi> or holds out to individuals, that they have a right to run before the public mind in their conduct; that they may oppoſe by contumacy or force what private reaſon only diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>approves; that they may diſobey the law, becauſe their judgment condemns it; or reſiſt the public will, becauſe they honeſtly wiſh to change it: he
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:0995201000:113"/>is then a criminal upon every principle of ration<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al policy, as well as upon the immemorial prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents of Engliſh juſtice; becauſe ſuch a perſon ſeeks to diſunite individuals from their duty to the whole, and excites to overt acts of miſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct in a part of the community, inſtead of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to change, by the impulſe of reaſon, that univerſal aſſent which, in this and in every country, conſtitutes the law for all.</p>
                  <p>I have therefore no difficulty in admitting that, if, upon an attentive peruſal of this work, it ſhall be found that the defendant has promul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated any doctrines which tend to withdraw in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals from their ſubjection to the law by which the whole nation conſents to be governed; nay, if the direct contrary ſhall not be found to be ſtudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly inculcated—if his book ſhall be found to have warranted or excited that unfortunate criminal who appeared here yeſterday to endeavour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve himſelf from impriſonment, by the deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a priſon, while the law of impriſonment remained, or dictated to him the language of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance which ran through his whole defence—if throughout the whole work there ſhall be found any ſyllable or letter, which ſtrikes at the ſecurity of property, or which hints that any thing leſs than the whole nation can conſtitute the law, or that the law, be it what it may, is not the inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orable rule of action for every individual, I wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly yield him up to the juſtice of the court.</p>
                  <p>Gentlemen, I ſay, in the name of Thomas Paine, and in his words as author of the Rights of Man, as written in the very volume that is charged with ſeeking the deſtruction of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty,</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="115" facs="tcp:0995201000:114"/>
                     <q>The end of all political aſſociations is, The preſervation of the rights of man, which rights are liberty, property, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity; that the nation is the ſource of all ſovereignty derived from it: the right of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty being ſecured and inviolable, no one ought to be deprived of it, except in caſes of evident public neceſſity, legally aſcertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and on condition of a previous juſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnity.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe are undoubtedly the rights of man—the rights for which all governments are eſtabliſhed—and the only rights Mr. Paine contends for; but which he thinks (no matter whether right or wrong) are better to be ſecured by a republican conſtitution than by the forms of the Engliſh government. He inſtructs me to admit, that, when government is once conſtituted, no indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals, without rebellion, can withdraw their obedience from it—that all attempts to excite them to it are highly criminal, for the moſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious reaſons of policy and juſtice—that nothing ſhort of the will of a whole people can change or affect the rule by which a nation is to be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned—and that no private opinion, however honeſtly inimical to the forms or ſubſtance of the law, can juſtify reſiſtance to its authority, while it remains in force. The author of the Rights of Man not only admits the truth of all this doctrine, but he conſents to be convicted, and I alſo conſent for him, unleſs his work ſhall be found ſtudiouſly and painfully to inculcate theſe great principles of government which it is charged to have been written to deſtroy. Let
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:0995201000:115"/>me not, therefore, be ſuſpected to be contending, that it is lawful to write a book pointing out de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects in the Engliſh government, and exciting in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals to deſtroy its ſanctions, and to refuſe obedience. But, on the other hand, I do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, that it is lawful to addreſs the Engliſh na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on theſe momentous ſubjects, for had it not been for this unalienable right (thanks be to God and our fathers for eſtabliſhing it), how ſhould we have had this conſtitution which we ſo loud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly boaſt of? If, in the march of the human mind, no man could have gone before the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhments of the time he lived in, how could our eſtabliſhment, by reiterated changes, have become what it is? If no man could have awak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened the public mind to errors and abuſes in our government, how could it have paſſed on from ſtage to ſtage, through reformation and revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſo as to have arrived from barbariſm to ſuch a pitch of happineſs and perfection that the Attorney General conſiders it as profanation to touch it any further, or to look for any future amendment.</p>
                  <p>In this manner power has reaſoned in every age—government, in <hi>its own eſtimation,</hi> has been at all times a ſyſtem of perfection; but a free preſs has examined and detected its errors, and the people have happily reformed them: this freedom has alone made our government what it is, and alone can preſerve it; and therefore, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the banners of that freedom, to-day I ſtand up to defend Thomas Paine. But how, alas! ſhall this taſk be accompliſhed? How may I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect from you what human nature has not made man for the performance of? How am I to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:0995201000:116"/>your reaſons, or aſk them to pauſe, amidſt the torrent of prejudice which has hurried away the public mind on the ſubject you are to judge?</p>
                  <p>Was any Engliſhman ever ſo brought as a cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal before an Engliſh court of juſtice?—If I were to aſk you, gentlemen of the jury, what is the choiceſt fruit that grows upon the tree of Engliſh liberty, you would anſwer, SECURITY UNDER THE LAW. If I were to aſk the whole people of England, the return they looked for at the hands of government, for the burthens under which they bend to ſupport it, I ſhould ſtill be anſwered, SECURITY UNDER THE LAW; or, in other words, an impartial adminiſtration of juſtice. So ſacred, therefore, has the freedom or trial been ever held in England; ſo anxiouſly does Juſtice guard againſt every poſſible bias in her path, that if the public mind has been locally agitated upon any ſubject in judgment, the forum is either changed, or the trial poſtponed. The circulation of any paper that brings, or which can be ſuppoſed to bring, prejudice, or even well founded know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, within the reach of a Britiſh tribunal, on the ſpur of an occaſion, is not only highly crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, but defeats itſelf, by leading to put off the trial which its object was to pervert. On this principle, his lordſhip will permit me to remind him, that on the trial of the Dean of St. Aſaph for a libel, or rather when he was brought to trial, the circulation of books by a ſociety favourable to his defence, was held by the noble lord, as Chief Juſtice of Cheſter, to be a reaſon for not trying the cauſe; although th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y contained no matter relative to the Dean, nor to the object of his trial;
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:0995201000:117"/>being only extracts from ancient authors of high reputation, on the general rights of juries to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the innocence as well as the guilt of the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed, yet ſtill, as the recollection of theſe rights was preſſed forward with a view to affect the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, to guard the principle the proceedings were poſtponed.</p>
                  <p>Is the defendant then to be the only exception to theſe admirable proviſions?—Is the Engliſh law to judge him, ſtript of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>he armour with which its univerſal juſtice encircles all others?—Shall we, in the very act of judging him for detracting from the Engliſh government, furniſh him with ample matter for juſt reprobation, inſtead of detraction? Has not his cauſe been prejudged through a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand channels? Has not the work before you been daily publicly reviled, and his perſon held up to deriſion and reproach? Has not the public mind been excited, by crying down the very phraſe and idea of the Rights of Man? Nay, have not aſſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations of gentlemen, I ſpeak it with regret, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I am perſuaded, from what I know of ſome of them, that they, amongſt them at leaſt, thought they were ſerving the public; yet have they not, in utter contempt and ignorance of that conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of which they declare themſelves to be the guardians, publiſhed the groſſeſt attacks upon the defendant? Have they not, even while the cauſe has been ſtanding here in the paper for immediate trial, publiſhed a direct proteſt againſt the very work now before you; advertiſing in the ſame paper, though under the general deſcription of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious papers, a reward on the conviction of any perſon who ſhould dare to ſell the book itſelf, to which their own publication was an anſwer?—The
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:0995201000:118"/>Attorney-General has ſpoken of a forced circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this work; but how have theſe prejudging papers been circulated? we all know how: they have been thrown into our carriages in every ſtreet; they have met us at every turnpike; and they lie in the areas of all our houſes. To complete the triumph of prejudice, that high tribunal, of which I have the honour to be a member, (my learned friends know what I ſay to be true) has been drawn into this vortex of ſlander; and ſome of its mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, for I do not ſpeak of the Houſe itſelf, have thrown the weight of their ſtations into the ſame ſcale.</p>
                  <p>By all means I maintain that this cauſe has been prejudged.</p>
                  <p>It may be ſaid, that I have made no motion to put off the trial for theſe cauſes, and that courts of themſelves take no cognizance of what paſſes elſewhere, without facts laid before them. Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, I know that I ſhould have had equal juſtice from that quarter, if I had brought myſelf within the rule. But when ſhould I have been better in the preſent aſpect of things? And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I only remind you of all theſe hardſhips, that you may recollect that your judgment is to proceed upon that alone which meets you here, upon the evidence in the cauſe, and not upon ſuggeſtions deſtructive of every principle of juſtice.</p>
                  <p>Having diſpoſed of theſe foreign prejudices, I hope you will as little regard ſome arguments that have been offered to you in court. The letter which has been ſo repeatedly preſſed upon you, ought to diſmiſs even from your recollection; I have already put it out of the queſtion, as having been written long ſubſequent to the book, and as
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:0995201000:119"/>being a libel on the king, which no part of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation charges, and which may hereafter be proſecuted as a diſtinct offence. I conſider that letter beſides, and indeed have always heard it treated, as a forgery, contrived to injure the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of the cauſe, and to embarraſs me perſonally in its defence. I have a right ſo to conſider it, becauſe it is unſupported by any thing ſimilar at an earlier period. The defendant's whole deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, previous to the publication, has been wholly unexceptionable: he properly deſired to be given up as the author of the book, if any enquiry ſhould take place concerning it; and he is not affected in evidence, directly or indirectly, with any illegal or ſuſpicious conduct; not even with having ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered an indiſcreet or taunting expreſſion, nor with any one matter or thing, inconſiſtent with the duty of the beſt ſubject in England. His opinions in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed were adverſe to our ſyſtem; but I maintain that OPINION is free, and that CONDUCT alone is amenable to the law.</p>

<pb n="121" facs="tcp:0995201000:120"/>paper, and had crept into the very nurſeries of children, as a wrapper for their ſweetmeats.</p>

                  <p>Remember, I am not aſking your opinions of the <hi>doctrines themſelves,</hi> you have given them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready pretty viſibly ſince I began to addreſs you; but I ſhall appeal not only to you, but to thoſe who, without our leave, will hereafter judge with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out appeal of all that we are doing to day; Whether, upon the matter which I haſten to lay before you, you can refuſe in juſtice to pronounce, that from his education—from the accidents and habits of his life—from the time and occaſion of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication—from the circumſtances attending it— and from every line and letter of the work itſelf, and all his other writings, before and <hi>even ſince,</hi> his
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:0995201000:121"/>conſcience and underſtanding <hi>(no matter whether erroneouſly or not)</hi> were deeply and ſolemnly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed with the matters contained in his book,— that he addreſſed it to the reaſon of the nation at large, and not to the paſſions of individuals, and that in the iſſue of its influence, he contemplated only what appeared to <hi>him (though it may not to us)</hi> to be the intereſt and happineſs of England, and of the whole human race. In drawing the one or the other of theſe concluſions, the book ſtands firſt in order, and it ſhall now ſpeak for it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
                  <p>Gentlemen, the whole of it is in evidence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you; the particular parts arraigned having only been read by my conſent, upon the preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that on retiring from the court, you would carefully compare them with the context, and all the parts with the whole viewed together. You cannot indeed do juſtice without it. The moſt common letter, even in the ordinary courſe of bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, cannot be read in a cauſe to prove an obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation for twenty ſhillings without the whole be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing read, that the writer's meaning may be ſeen without deception. But in a criminal charge of only four pages and a half, out of a work con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining nearly two hundred, you cannot, with even the appearance of common juſtice, pronounce a judgment without the moſt deliberate and cautious compariſon. I obſerve that the noble and learned judge confirms me in this obſervation. But if any given part of a work be legally explanatory of every other part of it, the preface, a fortiori, is the moſt material; becauſe the preface is the author's own key to his writing: it is there that he takes the reader by the hand, and introduces him to his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject:
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:0995201000:122"/>it is there that the ſpirit and intention of the whole is laid before him by way of prologue. A preface is meant by the author as a clue to ignorant or careleſs readers: the author ſays by it, to every man who chooſes to begin where he ought, look at my plan—attend to my diſtinctions—mark the purpoſe and limitations of the matter I lay before you.</p>
                  <p>Let then the calumniators of Thomas Paine now attend to his preface, where, to leave no excuſe for ignorance or miſrepreſentation, he expreſſes himſelf thus:</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>I have differed from ſome profeſſional gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen on the ſubject of proſecutions, and I ſince find they are falling into my opinion, which I will here ſtate as fully, but as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely as I can.</p>
                     <p>I will firſt put a caſe with reſpect to any law, and then compare it with a government, or with what in England is, or has been, called a conſtitution.</p>
                     <p>It would be an act of deſpotiſm, or what in England is called arbitrary power, to make a law to prohibit inveſtigating the principles, good or bad, on which ſuch a law, or any other, is founded.</p>
                     <p>If a law be bad, it is one thing to oppoſe the practice of it, but it is quite a different thing to expoſe its errors, to reaſon on its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, and to ſhew cauſe why it ſhould be repealed, or why another ought to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted in its place. I have always held it an opinion (making it alſo my practice) that it is better to obey a bad law, making uſe at
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:0995201000:123"/>the ſame time of every argument to ſhew its errors and procure its repeal, than forcibly to violate it; becauſe the precedent of break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a bad law might weaken the force, and lead to a diſcretionary violation, of thoſe which are good.</p>
                     <p>The caſe is the ſame with principles and forms of government, or to what are called conſtitutions and the parts of which they are compoſed.</p>
                     <p>It is for the good of nations, and not for the emolument or aggrandiſement of particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals, that government ought to be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, and that mankind are at the expence of ſupporting it. The defects of every government and conſtitution, both as to principle and form, muſt, on a parity of reaſoning, be as open to diſcuſſion as the defects of a law, and it is a duty which every man owes to ſociety to point them out. When thoſe defects, and the means of remedying them are generally ſeen by a nation, that nation will reform its go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment or its conſtitution in the one caſe, as the government repealed or reformed the law in the other.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>Gentlemen, you muſt undoubtedly wiſh to deal with every man who comes before you in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as you would be dealt by yourſelves; and ſurely you will not lay it down to day as a law to be binding hereafter even upon yourſelves, that if you ſhould publiſh any opinion concerning the exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing abuſes in your country's government, and point out to the whole public the means of amendment, you are to be acquitted or convicted as any twelve
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:0995201000:124"/>men may happen to agree with you in your opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions. Yet this is preciſely what you are aſked to do to another: it is preciſely the caſe before you. Mr. Paine expreſsly ſays, I obey a law until it is repealed; obedience is not only my principle but my practice, ſince my diſobedience of a law from thinking it bad, might apply to juſtify another man in the diſobedience of a good one; and thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals would give the rule for themſelves, and not ſociety for all.</p>
                  <p>Gentlemen, you will preſently ſee that the ſame principle pervades the reſt of the work; and I am the more anxious to call your attention to it, however repetition may tire you, becauſe it unfolds the whole principle of my argument: for, if you find a ſentence in the whole book that inveſts any individual, or any number of indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals, or any community ſhort of the whole na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, with a power of changing any part of the law or conſtitution, I abandon the cauſe—YES, I freely abandon it, becauſe I will not affront the majeſty of a court of juſtice by maintaining propoſitions which, even upon the ſurface of them, are falſe. Mr. Paine, page 162—168, goes on thus:</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>When a nation changes its opinion and habits of thinking, it is no longer to be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned as before; but it would not only be wrong, but bad policy, to attempt by force what ought to be accompliſhed by reaſon. Rebellion conſiſts in forcibly oppoſing the general will of a nation, whether by a party or by a government. There ought, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:0995201000:125"/>to be, in every nation, a method of occaſionall<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> aſcertaining the ſtate of public opinion with reſpect to government.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>There is, therefore, no power but the voluntary will of the people that has a right to act in any matter reſpecting a general re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form; and, by the ſame right that two per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons can confer on ſuch a ſubject, a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand may. The object in all ſuch prelimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary proceedings is, to find out what the general ſenſe of a nation is, and to be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by it. If it prefer a bad or defective government to a reform, or chooſe to pay ten times more taxes than there is occaſion for, it has a right ſo to do; and, ſo long as the majority do not impoſe conditions on the minority different to what they impoſe on themſelves, though there may be much error, there is no injuſtice; neither will the error continue long. Reaſon and diſcuſſion will ſoon bring things right, however wrong they may begin. By ſuch a proceſs no tumult is to be apprehended. The poor, in all countries, are naturally both peaceable and grateful in all reforms in which their intereſt and happineſs are included. It is only by neglecting and rejecting them that they become tumultuous.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Gentlemen, theſe are the ſentiments of the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the Rights of Man; and, whatever his opinions may be of the defects in our govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it never can change our ſentiments con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it, if our ſentiments are juſt; and a writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:0995201000:126"/>can never be ſeditious in the ſenſe of the Engliſh law, which ſtates that the government leans on the univerſal will for its ſupport.</p>
                  <p>Gentlemen, this univerſal will is the beſt and ſecureſt title which his Majeſty and his family have to the throne of theſe kingdoms; and in proportion to the wiſdom of our inſtitutions, the title muſt in common ſenſe become the ſtronger: ſo little idea, indeed, have I of any other, that in my place in Parliament, not a week ago, I conſidered it as the beſt way of expreſſing my attachment to the conſtitution, as eſtabliſhed at the revolution, to declare (I believe in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the heir apparent of the crown, for whom I have the greateſt perſonal zeal) that his Majeſty reigned in England, by choice and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, as the magiſtrate of the Engliſh people; not indeed a conſent and choice by perſonal election, like a King of Poland, the worſt of all poſſible conſtitutions; but by the election of a family for great national objects, in defiance of that heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary right, which only becomes tyranny, in the ſenſe of Mr. Paine, when it claims to inherit a nation, inſtead of governing by their conſent, and continuing for its benefit.</p>
                  <p>Gentlemen, this ſentiment has the advantage of Mr. Burke's high authority, who ſays with great truth, in a letter to his conſtituents, <q>Too little dependance cannot be had at this time of day on names and prejudices: the eyes of mankind are opened; and communities muſt be held together by a viſible and ſolid inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt.</q> I believe, Gentlemen of the Jury, that the Prince of Wales will always render this title dear to the people. The Attorney General can
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:0995201000:127"/>only tell you what he believes of him; I can tell you what I know, and what I am bound to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, ſince this Prince may be traduced and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniated in every part of the kingdom, without its coming often in queſtion, till brought in to load a defence with matter collateral to the charge. I therefore aſſert what the Attorney General can only hope, that, whenever that Prince ſhall come to the throne of this country (which I hope, but by the courſe of nature, will never happen), he will make the conſtitution of Great Britain the foundation of all his conduct.</p>
                  <p>Having now, Gentlemen, eſtabliſhed the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's general intention by his own introduction, which is the beſt and faireſt expoſition, let us next look at the occaſion which gave it birth.</p>
                  <p>The Attorney General, throughout the whole courſe of his addreſs to you (I knew it would be ſo), has avoided the moſt diſtant notice or hint of any circumſtance having led to the appearance of the author in the political world, after a ſilence of ſo many years; he has not even pronounced, or even glanced at the name of Mr. Burke, but has left you to take it for granted that the defendant volunteered this delicate and momentous ſubject; and that, without being led to it by the provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of political controverſy, he had ſeized a favourable moment to ſtigmatiſe, from mere malice, and againſt his own confirmed opinions, the Conſtitu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>y.</p>
                  <p>Gentlemen, my learned friend knows too well my reſpect and value for him to ſuppoſe that I am charging him w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>th a wilful ſuppreſſion; I know him to be incapable of it; he knew it would come from me. He will premit me,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:0995201000:128"/>however, to lament that it ſhould have been left for me, at this late period of the cauſe, to inform you, that, not only the work before you, but the Firſt Part, of which it is a natural continuation, were written <hi>avowedly, and upon the face of them,</hi> IN ANSWER TO MR. BURKE. They were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten beſides under circumſtances which I ſhall hereafter explain, and in the courſe of which explanation I may have occaſion to cite a few paſſages from the works of that celebrated perſon. And I ſhall ſpeak of him with the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt reſpect: for, with whatever contempt he may delight to look down upon my humble talents, however he may diſparage the principles which direct my public conduct, he ſhall never force me to forget the regard which this country owes to him for the writings which he has left upon record for the illumination of our moſt diſtant poſterity. After the gratitude which we owe to God for the divine gifts of reaſon and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, our next thanks are due to thoſe from the fountain of whoſe enlightened minds they are fed and fructified. But pleading, as I do, the cauſe of freedom of opinions, I ſhall not give offence by remarking that this great author has been thought to have changed ſome of his; and, if Thomas Paine had not thought ſo, I ſhould not now be addreſſing you, becauſe the book which is my ſubject would never have been written. Who is right and who is wrong, in the contention of doctrines, I have repeatedly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed to be the queſtion; I can only ſay that Mr. Paine may be right throughout, but that Mr. Burke cannot—Mr. Paine has been uniform in his opinions, but Mr. Burke has not—Mr.
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:0995201000:129"/>Burke can only be right in part; but, ſhould Mr. Paine be even miſtaken in the whole, ſtill I am not removed from the principle of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. My defence has nothing to do with ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the concealment or rectitude of his doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines. I admit Mr. Paine to be a republican; you ſhall ſoon ſee what made him one—I do not ſeek to ſhade or qualify his attack upon our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution; I put my defence on no ſuch matter— he undoubtedly means to declare it to be defec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive in its forms, and contaminated with abuſes, which, in his judgment, will one day or other bring on the ruin of us all: it is in vain to mince the matter; this is the ſcope of his work. But ſtill, if it contains no attack upon the King's Majeſty, nor upon any other living magiſtrate; if it excites to no reſiſtance to magiſtracy, but, on the contrary, if it even inculcates, as it does, obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to government, then, whatever may be its defects, the queſtion continues as before, and ever muſt remain an unmixed queſtion of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of the preſs. I therefore conſidered it as no breach of profeſſional duty, nor injurious to the cauſe I am defending, to expreſs my own admiration of the real principles of our conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion— a conſtitution which I hope never to ſee give way to any other—a conſtitution which has been productive of various benefits, and which will produce many more hereafter, if we have wiſdom e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ough to pluck up thoſe weeds that grow in the richeſt ſoils and amongſt the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt flowers. I agree with the merchants of London, that the Engliſh government is equal to the reformation of its own abuſes; and, as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitant of the city, I would have ſigned their
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:0995201000:130"/>Declaration, if I had known, <hi>of my own know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> the facts recited in its preamble. But abuſes the Engliſh conſtitution unqueſtionably has which call loudly for reformation, the exiſtence of which has been the theme of our greateſt ſtateſmen, which have too plainly formed the principles of the defendant, and created the very conjuncture which produced his book.</p>
                  <p>Gentlemen, we all but too well remember the calamitous ſituation in which our country ſtood but a few years ago—a ſituation which no man can look back upon without horror, nor feel himſelf ſafe from relapſing into again, while the cauſes remain which produced it. The event I allude to you muſt know to be the American war and the ſtill exiſting cauſes of it, the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of this government. In thoſe days it was not thought virtue by the patriots of England to conceal their exiſtence from the people; but then, as now, authority condemned them as diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affected ſubjects, and defeated the ends they ſought by their promulgation.</p>
                  <p>Hear the opinion of Sir George Saville;—not his ſpeculative opinion concerning the ſtructure of our government in the abſtract, but his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the ſettled abuſes which prevailed in his own time, and which continue at this moment. But firſt let me remind you who Sir George Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville was—I fear we ſhall hardly look upon his like again—How ſhall I deſcribe him to you?— In my own words I cannot. I was lately com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by Mr. Burke, in the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, for ſtrengthening my own language by an appeal to Dr. Johnſon. Were the honourable gentleman preſent at this moment, he would no
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:0995201000:131"/>doubt doubly applaud my choice in reſorting to his own works for the deſcription of Sir George Saville:</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>His fortune is among the largeſt; a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, which, wholly unincumb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>red as it is, without one ſingle charge from luxury, vanity, or exceſs, ſinks under the benevolence of its diſpenſer. This private benevolence, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panding itſelf into patriotiſm, renders his whole being the eſtate of the public, in which he has not reſerved a <hi>peculium</hi> for himſelf of profit, diverſion, or relaxation. During the ſeſſion, the firſt in, and the laſt out of the Houſe of Commons; he paſſes from the ſenate to the camp; and, ſeldom ſeeing the ſeat of his anceſtors, he is always in Parliament to ſerve his country, or in the field to defend it.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is impoſſible to aſcribe to ſuch a character any principle but patriotiſm, when he expreſſed himſelf as follows:</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>I return to you baffled and diſpirited, and I am ſorry that truth obliges me to add, with hardly a ray of hope of ſeeing any change in the miſerable courſe of public ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities.</q>

                  <p>
                     <q>On this melancholy day of account, in rendering up to you my truſt, I deliver to you your ſhare of a country maimed and weakened; its treaſure laviſhed and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpent; its honours faded; and its conduct the laughing-ſtock of Europe: our nation

I return to you ſome of your prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal privileges impeached and mangled. And, laſtly, I leave you, as I conceive, at this hour and moment fully, effectually, and abſolutely, under the diſcretion and power of a military force, which is to act without waiting for the authority of the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil magiſtrates.</q>

                  <p>
                     <q>Some have been accuſed of exaggerating the public misfortunes, nay, of having en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to help forward the miſchief, that they might afterwards raiſe diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents. I am willing to hope, that neither my temper, nor my ſituation in life, will be thought naturally to urge me to promote miſery, diſcord, or confuſion, or to exult in the ſubverſion of order, or in the ruin of property. I have no reaſon to contemplate with pleaſure the poverty of our country, the increaſe of our debts, and of our taxes; or the decay of our commerce.—Truſt not, however, to my report: reflect, compare, and judge for yourſelves.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>But, under all theſe diſheartening cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, I could yet entertain a cheerful hope, and undertake again the commiſſion with alacrity, as well as zeal, if I could ſee any effectual ſteps taken to remove the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal couſe of the miſchief—'Then would there be a hope.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>But, till the Purity of the conſtituent
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:0995201000:133"/>body, and thereby that of the repreſentative, be reſtored, there is NONE.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>I gladly embrace this moſt public opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of delivering my ſentiments, not only to all my conſtituents, but to thoſe likewiſe not my conſtituents, whom yet, in the large ſenſe, I repreſent, and am faithfully to ſerve.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>I look upon reſtoring election and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation in ſome degree (for I expect no miracles) to their original purity, to be that, without which all other efforts will be vain and ridiculous.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>If ſomething be not done, you may, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, retain the outward form of your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, but not the power thereof.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Such were the words of that great good man, loſt with thoſe of many others of his time, and his fame, as far as power could hurt it, put in the ſhade along with them. The conſequences we have all ſeen and felt: America, from an obedient affectionate colony, became an independent nation; and two millions of people, nurſed in the very lap of our monarchy, became the willing ſubjects of a republican conſtitution.</p>
                  <p>Gentlemen, in that great and calamitous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict Mr. Burke and Mr. Paine fought in the ſame field of reaſon together, but with very different ſucceſſes. Mr. Burke ſpoke to a parliament in England, ſuch as Sir George Saville deſcribes it, that had no ears but for ſounds that flattered its corruptions. Mr. Paine, on the other hand, ſpoke TO A PEOPLE; reaſoned with them, that they were bound by no ſubjection to any ſovereignty,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:0995201000:134"/>further than their own benefits connected them; and by theſe powerful arguments prepared the minds of the American people for that GLORIOUS, JUST, and HAPPY revolution.</p>
                  <p>Gentlemen, I have a right to diſtinguiſh it by that appellation, becauſe I aver that at this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment there is as ſacred a regard to property; as inviolable a ſecurity to all the rights of individuals; lower taxes; fewer grievances; leſs to deplore, and more to admire, in the conſtitution of America, than that of any other country under heaven. I wiſh indeed to except our own, but I cannot even do that, till it ſhall be purged of thoſe abuſes which, though they obſcure and deform the ſurface, have not as yet <hi>(thank God)</hi> deſtroyed the vital parts.</p>
                  <p>Why then is Mr. Paine to be calumniated, and reviled, becauſe out of a people conſiſting of near three millions, he alone did not remain attached in opinion to a monarchy. Remember, that all the blood which was ſhed in America, and to which he was for years a melancholy and indignant wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, was ſhed by the authority of the crown of Great Britain, under the influence of its parliament, ſuch as Sir George Saville has deſcribed it, and ſuch as Mr. Burke himſelf will be called upon by and by in more glowing colours to paint it. How then can it be wondered at that Mr. Paine ſhould return to this country in his heart a republican? Was he not equally republican when he wrote Common Senſe? yet that volume has been ſold without reſtraint or proſecution in every ſhop in England ever ſince, and which nevertheleſs <hi>(I appeal to the book, which I have in court, and which is in every body's hands)</hi> contains every one prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of government, and every abuſe in the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:0995201000:135"/>conſtitution, which is to be found in the Rights of Man. Yet Mr. Burke himſelf ſaw no reaſon to be alarmed at its publication, nor to cry down its contents, even when America, which was ſwayed by it, was in arms againſt the crown of Great-Britain. You ſhall hear his opinion of it, in his letter to the ſheriffs of Briſtol, pages 33 and 34.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>The court gazette accompliſhed what the abettors of independence had attempted in vain. When that diſingenuous compilation, and ſtrange medley of railing and flattery, was adduced, as a proof of the united ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the people of Great-Britain, there was a great change throughout all America. The tide of popular affection, which had ſtill ſet towards the parent country, began im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to turn, and to flow with great ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity in a contrary courſe. Far from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing theſe wild declarations of enmity, <hi>the author of the celebrated pamphlet which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared the minds of the people for indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> inſiſts largely on the multitude and the ſpirit of theſe addreſſes; and draws an argument from them, which (if the fact were as he ſuppoſes) muſt be irreſiſtible. For I never knew a writer on the theory of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſo partial to authority, as not to allow, that the hoſtile mind of the rulers to their people, did fully juſtify a change of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; nor can any reaſon whatever be given, why one people ſhould voluntarily yield any degree of pre-eminence to another, but on a ſuppoſition of great affection and benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence towards them. Unfortunately your
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:0995201000:136"/>rulers, truſting to other things, took no notice of this great principle of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>But there is a time, it ſeems, for all things.</p>
                  <p>Gentlemen, the conſequences of this mighty revolution are too notorious to require illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. No audience would ſit to hear (what eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry body has ſeen and felt,) the independence of America notoriouſly produced, not by remote and circuitous effect, but directly and palpably, the revolutions which now agitate Europe, and which portend ſuch new changes over the face of the earth. Let governors take warning. The revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution in France was the conſequence of her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curably corrupt and profligate government. God forbid that I ſhould be thought to lean, by this declaration, upon her unfortunate monarch, bending, perhaps at this moment, under afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which my heart ſinks within me to think of; but, when I ſpeak with deteſtation of the former politics of the French court, I faſten as little of them upon that fallen and unhappy prince, as I impute to our gracious ſovereign the corruptions of our own government. I deſire, indeed, in the diſtincteſt manner, to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood that I mean to ſpeak of his Majeſty, not only with that obedience and duty which I owe to him as a ſubject, but with that juſtice which I think is due to him from all men who examine his conduct either in public or private life.</p>
                  <p>Gentlemen, Mr. Paine happened to be in England when the French revolution took place
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:0995201000:137"/>and notwithſtanding what he muſt be ſuppoſed and allowed from his hiſtory to have felt upon ſuch a ſubject, he remained wholly ſilent and inactive. The people of this country too appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be indifferent ſpectators of the animating ſcene. They ſaw, without viſible emotion, deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potiſm deſtroyed, and the King of France, by his own conſent, become the firſt magiſtrate of a free people. Certainly, at leaſt, it produced none of thoſe effects which are ſo deprecated by government at preſent; nor, moſt probably, ever would, if it had not occurred to the celebrated perſon, whoſe name I muſt ſo often mention, voluntarily to provoke the ſubject; a ſubject which, if dangerous to be diſcuſſed, he ſhould not have led to the diſcuſſion: for, ſurely, it is not to be endured, that any private man is to publiſh a creed for a whole nation; to tell us that we are not to think for ourſelves—to impoſe his own fetters upon the human mind—to dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiſe at diſcretion—and that no man ſhall ſit down to anſwer him without being guilty of a libel. I aſſert, that if it be a libel to miſtake our conſtitution—to ſupport it by means that tend to deſtroy it—and to chooſe the moſt danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>aſon for the interference, Mr. Burke is that libeller; but not therefore the object of a crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal proſecution: for, whilſt I am defending the motives of one man, I have neither right nor diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to criminate the motives of another. All I contend for, is a fact that cannot be contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, viz. that this officious interference was the origin of Mr. Paine's book. I put my cauſe upon its being the origin of it—the avowed origin
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:0995201000:138"/>—as will abundantly appear from the introduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and preface to both parts, and throughout the whole body of the work; nay, from the very work of Mr. Burke himſelf, to which both of them are anſwers.</p>
                  <p>Gentlemen, for the hiſtory of that celebrated work, I appeal to itſelf.</p>
                  <p>When the French revolution had arrived at ſome of its early ſtages, a few, and but a few, perſons (not to be named when compared with the nation) took a viſible intereſt in theſe mighty events; an intereſt well worthy of Engliſhmen. They ſaw a pernicious ſyſtem of government, which had led to cruel deſolating wars, and had been for ages the ſcourge of Great Britain, giving way to a ſyſtem which ſeemed to promiſe har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony and peace amongſt the nations. They ſaw this with virtuous and peaceable ſatisfaction: And a reverend divine <note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. Price.</note>, eminent for his elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, recollecting that the iſſues of life are in the hands of God, ſaw no profaneneſs in mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſubject with public thankſgiving; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minding the people of this country of their own glorious deliverance in former ages. It happened, alſo, that a ſociety of gentlemen, France being then a neutral nation, and her own monarch ſwearing almoſt daily upon her altars to maintain the new conſtitution, thought they infringed no law by ſending a general congratulation. Their numbers, indeed, were very inconſiderable; ſo much ſo, that Mr. Burke, with more truth than
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:0995201000:139"/>wiſdom, begins his volume with a ſarcaſm upon their inſignificance.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Until very lately he had never heard of ſuch a club. It certainly never occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied a moment of his thoughts; nor, he believed, thoſe of any perſon out of their own ſet.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Why then make their proceedings the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of alarm throughout England? — There had been no proſecution againſt them, nor any charge founded upon ſuſpicion of diſaffection againſt any of their body. But Mr. Burke thought it was reſerved for his eloquence to whip theſe curs of faction to their kennels. How he has ſucceeded, I appeal to all that has happened ſince the introduction of his ſchiſm in the Britiſh empire, by giving to the King, whoſe title was queſtioned by no man, a title which it is his Majeſty's moſt ſolemn intereſt to diſclaim.</p>
                  <p>After having, in his firſt work, laſhed Dr. Price in a ſtrain of eloquent irony for conſidering the monarchy to be elective, which he could not but know Dr. Price, in the literal ſenſe of elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, neither did or could poſſibly conſider it, Mr. Burke publiſhed a ſecond treatiſe; in which, after reprinting many paſſages from Mr. Paine's former work, he ridicules and denies the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed right of the people to change their govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, in the following words:</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="141" facs="tcp:0995201000:140"/>"The French revolution, <hi>ſay they,</hi>" (ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Engliſh ſocieties) <q>was the act of the majority of the people; and if the majority of any other people, <hi>the people of England, for inſtance,</hi> wiſh to make the ſame change, they have the ſame right; juſt the ſame undoubtedly; that is, none at all.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>And then, after ſpeaking of the ſubſerviency of will to duty, (in which I agree with him,) he, in a ſubſtantive ſentence, maintains the ſame doctrine; thus:</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>The conſtitution of a country being once ſettled upon ſome compact, tacit or expreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, there is no power exiſting of force to alter it, without the breach of the covenant, or the conſent of all the parties. Such is the nature of a contract.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>So that if reaſon, or even revelation itſelf, were now to demonſtrate to us, that our conſtitution was miſchievous in its effects; that, to uſe Mr. At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torney General's expreſſion, we had been inſane for the many centuries we have ſupported it; yet that ſtill, if the King had not forfeited his title to the crown, nor the Lords their privileges, the univerſal voice of the whole people of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land could not build up a new government upon a legitimate baſis.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="142" facs="tcp:0995201000:141"/>Gentlemen, not to argue for the preſent againſt ſuch a propoſition, and ſuppoſing it could, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all controverſy, be maintained; for hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven's ſake, let wiſdom never utter it! Let policy and prudence for ever conceal it! If you ſeek the ſtability of the Engliſh government, rather put the book of Mr. Paine, which calls it bad, into every hand in the kingdom, than doctrines which bid human nature rebel even againſt that which is the beſt.—Say to the people of England, Look at your conſtitution, there it lies before you—the work of your pious fathers, handed down as a ſacred depoſit from generation to generation, the reſult of wiſdom and virtue, and its parts ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented together with kindred blood. There are, indeed, a few ſpots upon its ſurface; but the ſame principle which reared the ſtructure will bruſh them all away: you may keep it, or you may deſtroy it.—To ſuch an addreſs, what would be the anſwer? A chorus of the nation— YES, WE WILL PRESERVE IT. But ſay to the ſame nation, even of the very ſame conſtitution, It is yours, ſuch as it is, for better or for worſe; it is ſtrapped upon your backs, to carry it as beaſts of burthen, and you have no juriſdiction to caſt it off. Let this be your poſition, and you inſtantly raiſe up (I appeal to every man's conſciouſneſs of his own nature) a ſpirit of uneaſineſs and diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. Yet it is the controverſy alone, which this uſeleſs and miſchievous propoſition ſtirred up, that has pointed moſt of the paſſages arraigned before you, which it will be preſently my duty to explain.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="143" facs="tcp:0995201000:142"/>But let the prudence of the argument be what it may, the argument itſelf is untenable.</p>
                  <p>His Majeſty undoubtedly was not elected to the throne. No man can be ſuppoſed, in the teeth of fact, to have contended it; but did not the people of England elect King William, and break the hereditary ſucceſſion? and does not his Majeſty's title grow out of that election? It is one of the charges againſt the defendant, his having denied the parliament which called the Prince of Orange to the throne to have been a legal convention of the whole people; and is not the very foundation of that charge, that it was ſuch a legal convention, and that it was intended to be ſo? and if it was ſo, did not the people then confer the crown upon King William with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any regard to hereditary right? Did they not cut off the Prince of Wales, who ſtood directly in the line of ſucceſſion, and who had incurred no perſonal forfeiture? Did they not give their deliverer an eſtate in the crown totally new and unprecedented in the law or hiſtory of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try? And, laſtly, might they not, by the ſame authority, have given the royal inheritance to the family of a ſtranger? Mr. Juſtice Blackſtone, in his Commentaries, in terms, aſſerts that they might; and aſcribes their choice of King William, and the ſubſequent limitations of the crown, not to want of juriſdiction, but to their true origin, to prudence and diſcretion in not diſturbing a valuable inſtitution further than public ſafety and neceſſity dictated.</p>
                  <p>The Engliſh government ſtands then on this public conſent, the true root of all governments.
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:0995201000:143"/>And I agree with Mr. Burke, that, while it is well adminiſtered, it is not in the power of fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or libels to diſturb it; though, when miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are in fault, they are ſure to ſet down all diſturbances to theſe cauſes. This is moſt juſtly and eloquently exemplified in the Thoughts on the Cauſe of the preſent Diſcontents, page 5 and 6.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Miniſters contend that no adequate pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation has been given for ſo ſpreading a diſcontent, our affairs having been conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed throughout with remarkable temper and conſummate wiſdom. The wicked induſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of ſome libellers, joined to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues of a few diſappointed politic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ans, have, in their opinion, been able to produce this unnatural ferment in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Nothing, indeed, can be more unnatural than the preſent convulſions of this country, if the above account be a true one. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs I ſhall aſſent to it with great reluctance, and only on the compulſion of the cleareſt and firmeſt proofs; becauſe their account reſolves itſelf into this ſhort but diſcourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing propoſition. 'That we have a very good miniſtry, but that we are a very bad people; that we ſet ourſelves to bite the hand that feeds us; and, with a malignant inſanity, oppoſe the meaſures, and ungratefully vilify the perſons of thoſe whoſe ſole object is our own peace and proſperity. If a few puny
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:0995201000:144"/>libellers, acting under a knot of factious po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticians, without virtue, parts, or character (for ſuch they are conſtantly repreſented by theſe gentlemen), are ſufficient to excite this diſturbance, very perverſe muſt be the diſpoſition of that people, amongſt whom ſuch a diſturbance can be excited by ſuch means.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>He ſays true: never were ſerious diſturbances excited by ſuch means!</p>
                  <p>But to return to the argument.—Let us now ſee how the rights of the people ſtand upon au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and whether this great ſource of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is not maintained by perſons on whom my friend will find it hard to faſten the character of libellers.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall begin with the moſt modern author on the ſubject of government—a gentleman, whoſe work lies ſpread out before me, as it often does for my delight and inſtruction in my leiſure hours. I have alſo, by the favour of a friend who ſits near me in court, the honour of his perſonal acquaintance. He is a man, perhaps more than any other, devoted to the real conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the country, as will be found through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his valuable work; and he is a perſon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, of great learning, which enabled him to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe much uſeful knowledge into my learned friend who introduced me to him <note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. Law, King's Counſel.</note> I ſpeak of Mr. Paley, Archdeacon of Carliſle, and of his work, entitled, The Principles of Political and Moral Philoſophy, in which he inveſtigates the
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:0995201000:145"/>firſt principles of all governments — a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion not thought dangerous till lately: and I hope we ſhall ſoon get rid of this ridiculous panic.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Paley profeſſes to think of governments what the Chriſtian religion was thought of by its firſt teachers:—'If it be of God it will ſtand;' and he puts the duties of obedience to them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on free will and moral duty. After diſſenting from Mr. Locke as to the origin of governments in compact, he ſays,</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Wherefore, rejecting the intervention of a compact as unfounded in its principle, and dangerous in the application, we aſſign for the only ground of the ſubjects' obligation, THE WILL OF GOD, AS COLLECTED FROM EXPEDIENCY.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>The ſteps by which the argument pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds are few and direct — 'It is the will of God that the happineſs of human life be promoted:'—this is the firſt ſtep, and the foundation, not only of this, but of every moral concluſion. 'Civil ſociety conduces to that end:'—this is the ſecond propoſition. 'Civil ſocieties cannot be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held, unleſs in each, the intereſt of the whole ſociety be binding upon every part and member of it:'—this is the third ſtep, and conducts us to the concluſion, namely,— 'That, ſo long as the intereſt of the whole ſociety requires it (that is, ſo long as the eſtabliſhed government cannot be reſiſted
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:0995201000:146"/>or changed without public inconveniency) it is the will of God (which will univerſally determines our duty) that the eſtabliſhed government be obeyed,'—<hi>and no longer.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>But who ſhall judge of this? We anſwer, <hi>'Every man for himſelf.'</hi> In con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions between the ſovereign and the ſubject, the parties acknowledge no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon arbitrator; and it would be abſurd to commit the deciſion to thoſe whoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct has provoked the queſtion, and whoſe own intereſt, authority, and fate, are immediately concerned in it. The danger of error and abuſe is no objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the rule of expediency, becauſe every other rule is liable to the ſame or greater; and every rule that can be propounded upon the ſubject (like all rules which appeal to, or bind the conſcience) muſt, in the application, depend upon private judgment. It may be obſerved, however, that it ought equally to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted the exerciſe of a man's private judgment, whether he determines by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings and concluſions of his own, or ſubmits to be directed by the advice of others, provided he be free to chooſe his guide.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>He then proceeds in a manner rather incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the principles entertained by my learned friend in his opening to you:—</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>No uſage, law, or authority whatever, is
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:0995201000:147"/>ſo binding, that it need or ought to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, when it may be changed with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to the community. The family of the prince—the order of ſucceſſion—the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative of the crown—the form and parts of the legiſlature—together with the reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive powers, office, duration, and mutual dependency of the ſeveral parts; are all only ſo many laws, mutable, like other laws, whenever expediency requires, either by the ordinary act of the legiſlature, or, if the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion deſerve it, BY THE INTERPOSITION OF THE PEOPLE.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>No man can ſay that Mr. Paley intended to dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe diſcontent by this declaration. He muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be taken to think with me, that freedom and affection, and the ſenſe of advantages, are the beſt and the only ſupports of government. On the ſame principle, he then goes on to ſay,— <q>Theſe points are wont to be approached with a kind of awe; they are repreſented to the mind as principles of the conſtitution, ſettled by our anceſtors, and being ſettled, to be no more committed to innovation or debate; as foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations never to be ſtirred; as the terms and conditions of the ſocial compact, to which every citizen of the ſtate has engaged his fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, by virtue of a promiſe which he cannot now recall. Such reaſons have no place in our ſyſtem.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Such are the ſentiments of this excellent author, and there is no part of Mr. Paine's work, from the one end of it to the other, that advances any other propoſition.</p>

                     <pb n="149" facs="tcp:0995201000:148"/>But the Attorney General will ſay, theſe are the grave ſpeculative opinions of a friend to the Engliſh Government, whereas Mr. Paine is its profeſſed enemy; what then? the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is, that every man, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The very ends of ſociety exact this licence, and the policy of the law, in its proviſions for its ſecurity, has tacitly ſanctioned it. The real fact is, that writings againſt a free and well-proportioned Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, need not be guarded againſt by laws. They cannot often exiſt, and never with effect. The juſt and aweful principles of ſociety, are rarely brought forward, but when they are inſulted and denied, or abuſed in practice: Mr. Locke's Eſſay on Government, we owe to Sir Robert Filmer, as we owe Mr. Paine's to Mr. Burke; and indeed, between the arguments of Filmer and Burke, I ſee no eſſential difference; ſince it is not worth diſputing, whether a King exiſts by <hi>Di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>are born under government, and therefore they cannot be at liberty to begin a new one. Every one is born a ſubject to his father, or his prince, and is therefore under the perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:0995201000:149"/>tie of ſubjection and allegiance.</hi> It is plain, mankind never owned nor conſidered any ſuch natural <hi>ſubjection that they were born in,</hi> to one or to the other, that tied them, without their own conſents, to a ſubjection to them and their heirs.</q>

                  <p>
                     <q>It is true, that whatever engagements or promiſes any one has made for himſelf, he is under the obligation of them, but can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, by any compact whatſoever, bind his children or poſterity: for his ſon, when a man, being altogether as free as the father, any <hi>act of the father can no more give away the liberty of the ſon,</hi> than it can of any body elſe.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>So much for Mr. Locke's opinion of the rights of mankind. Let us now examine his ideas of the ſuppoſed danger of truſting them with them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Perhaps it will be ſaid, that the people being ignorant, and always diſcontented, to lay the foundation of government in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteady opinion and uncertain humour of the people, is to expoſe it to certain ruin: and no government will be able long to ſubſiſt, if the people may ſet up a new legiſlature, whenever they take offence at the old one. To this, I anſwer quite the contrary: people are not ſo eaſily got out of their old forms, as ſome are apt to ſuggeſt: they are hardly to be prevailed with to amend the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged faults in the frame they have been accuſtomed to; and if there be any origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal defects, or adventitious ones introduced by time, or corruption, it is not an eaſy thing
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:0995201000:150"/>to be changed, even when all the world ſees there is an opportunity for it. This ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and averſion in the people to quit their old conſtitutions, has in the many revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which have been ſeen in this kingdom, in this and former ages, ſtill kept us to, or, af<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>er ſome interval of fruitleſs attempts, ſtill brought us back again to our old legiſlative of king, lords and commons: and whatever provocations have made the crown be taken from ſome of our princes heads, they never carried the people ſo far as to place it in another line.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Gentlemen, I wiſh I had ſtrength to go on with all that is material, but I have read enough, not only to maintain the true princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of government, but to put to ſhame the narrow ſyſtem of diſtruſting the people.</p>
                  <p>It may be ſaid, that Mr. Locke went great lengths in his poſitions, to beat down the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary doctrine of divine right, which was then endangering the new eſtabliſhment. But that cannot be objected to David Hume, who main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains the ſame doctrine; ſpeaking of the Magna Charta in his hiſtory, vol. ii. page 88, he ſays, <q>It muſt be confeſſed, that the former ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of the great charter, contain ſuch miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations and explanations of the feodal law, as are reaſonable and equitable; and that the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter involve all the chief outlines of a legal Government, and provide for the equal diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution of juſtice and free enjoyment of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty; the great object for which political ſociety was founded by men, <hi>which the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have a perpetual and unalienable right to
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:0995201000:151"/>recall;</hi> and which no time, nor precedent, nor ſtatute, nor poſitive inſtitution, ought to deter them from keeping ever uppermoſt in their thoughts and attention.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe authorities are ſufficient to reſt on, yet I cannot omit Mr. Burke himſelf, who is, if poſſible, ſtill more diſtinct on the ſubject. Speaking not of the ancient people of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, but of Colonies planted almoſt within our memories, he ſays, <q>If there be one fact in the world perfectly clear, it is this; That the diſpoſition of the people of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica is wholly averſe to any other than a free Government" and this is indication enough to any honeſt ſtateſman, how he ought to adapt whatever power he finds in his hands to their caſe. If any aſk me what a free Government is, I anſwer, THAT IT IS WHAT THE PEOPLE THINK SO; AND THAT THEY, AND NOT I, ARE THE NATURAL, LAWFUL, AND COMPETENT JUDGES OF THIS MATTER. If they practically allow me a greater degree of authority over them than is conſiſtent with any correct ideas of perfect freedom, I ought to thank them for ſo great a truſt, and not to endeavour to prove from thence, that they have reaſoned amiſs, and that having gone ſo far, by analogy, they muſt here-after have no enjoyment but by my pleaſure.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Gentlemen, I am ſorry to feel my time conſiderably conſumed before I am arrived at what I conceive to be the material ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of your conſideration. For all that I have been ſtating now, is only to ſhew; that

(I do not mean before my Lord, for the matter was gone to reſt in the Courts, at leaſt long before he came to ſit where he does.) But when, before a Noble and Reverend Magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate of the moſt exalted underſtanding, and of the moſt uncorrupted integrity, to give ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect to it <note n="*" place="bottom">Earl Mansfield.</note>, I had occaſion to maintain it, he
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:0995201000:153"/>treated me, not with diſregard, indeed, for of that his nature was incapable; but he put me aſide with indulgence, as you do a child while it is liſping its prattle out of ſeaſon; and if this cauſe had been tried then, inſtead of now, the Defendant muſt have been inſtantly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed on the proof of the publication, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever <hi>you</hi> might have thought of his caſe.— Yet, I have lived to ſee it reſolved, by an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt unanimous vote of the whole Parliament of England, that I had all along <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Gentlemen, I have inſiſted, at great length, upon the origin of Government being in the conſent of the people, and detailed the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities which you have heard upon the ſubject, becauſe I conſider it to be not only a ſupport, but, indeed, the only foundation of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of the Preſs. If Mr. Burke be right in HIS principles of Government, I admit that the Preſs, in my ſenſe of its freedom, ought not to be free, <hi>nor free in any ſenſe at all;</hi> and that all Addreſſes to the people upon the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Government; and all ſpeculations of amendment, of what kind or nature ſoever, are illegal and criminal:—For, if the people have, without poſſible recall, delegated all their authorities, they have no juriſdiction to act, and therefore none to think, upon ſuch ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; and it is a libel to arraign Government or any of its acts, before thoſe that have no juriſdiction to correct them. But on the other hand, as it is a ſettled rule in the Law of
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:0995201000:154"/>England, that the ſubject may always addreſs a competent juriſdiction on every matter with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it, no legal argument can ſhake the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the Preſs in my ſenſe of it, if I am ſupported in my doctrines concerning the great unalienable rights of the people, to change or to reform their Governments.</p>
                  <p>Gentlemen, it is becauſe the Liberty of the Preſs reſolves itſelf into this great iſſue, that it has been in every time and country, the laſt liberty which ſubjects have been able to wreſt from power.—Other liberties are held under Governments, but the liberty of opinion keeps Governments themſelves in due ſubjection to their duties. This has produced the martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of truth in every age, and the world has only purged itſelf from ignorance with the innocent blood of thoſe who have enlighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it.</p>
                  <p>Gentlemen, my ſtrength and time are waſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and I can only make this melancholy hiſtory paſs like a ſhadow before you.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall begin with the grand type and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.</p>
                  <p>The univerſal God of Nature,—the Saviour of Mankind,—the Fountain of all Light, who came to pluck the world from eternal dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, expired upon a croſs the ſcoff of infidel ſcorn; and his bleſſed Apoſtles followed him in the train of Martyrs. When he came in the fleſh, he might have come like the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometan Prophet, as a powerful Sovereign, and propagated that religion with an uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querable ſword, which even now, after the lapſe of ages, is but ſlowly moving, under the
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:0995201000:155"/>influence of reaſon, over the face of the earth: But ſuch a proceſs would have been incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with his miſſion, which was to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found the pride, and to eſtabliſh the univerſal rights of men; he came therefore in that low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtate which is repreſented in the Goſpel, and preached his conſolations to the poor.</p>
                  <p>When the foundation of this religion was diſcovered to be invulnerable and immortal, we find political power taking the church into partnerſhip; thus began the corruptions both of Religion and Civil Power, and, hand in hand together, what havoc have they not made in the world; ru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> deſtroy the one and to raiſe up the other. Nay, you will find, that in the exact proportion that knowledge and learning have been beat down and fettered, they have deſtroyed the Governments that bound them. The Court of Star-Chamber, the firſt reſtriction on the Preſs of England, was erected in 1637. From that moment no man could legally write without an Imprima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur from the State; but truth and freedom found their way with greater force through ſecret channels, and the unhappy Charles, unwarned by a free preſs, was brought in ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven years afterwards to an ignominious death.</p>
                  <p>When men can freely communicate their thoughts and their ſufferings, real or imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, their paſſions ſpend themſelves in air, like gun-powder ſcattered upon the ſurface; but pent up by terrors, they work unſeen like

                  <p>The Uſurper, Cromwell, purſued the ſame ſyſtem of reſtraint in ſupport of his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the end of it ſpeedily followed.</p>
                  <p>At the Reſtoration of Charles the Second, the Star-Chamber Ordinance of 1637, was worked up into an Act of Parliament, and was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Gentlemen, I will now ſupport the ſame important truth by very great authorities. Upon a ſubject of this kind reſort cannot be had to Law Caſes. The ancient Law of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land knew nothing of ſuch Libels; they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, and ſhould have ended, with the Star-Chamber. What writings are ſlanderous of individuals, muſt be looked for where theſe proſecutions are recorded; but upon general ſubjects we muſt go to general writers. If, indeed, I were to refer to obſcure authors, I
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:0995201000:157"/>might be anſwered, that my very authorities were Libels, inſtead of juſtifications or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples; but this cannot be ſaid with effect of great men, whoſe works are claſſics in our language, taught in our ſchools, and printed under the eye of Government.</p>
                  <p>Gentlemen, I ſhall begin with the Poet Milton, a great authority in all learning.— It may be ſaid, indeed, he was a Republican, but that would only prove that Republicaniſm is not incompatible with virtue; it may be ſaid too, that the work which I cite was written againſt previous Licenſing, which is not contended for to-day. But, in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, if every work is to be adjudged a libel, which is adverſe to the wiſhes of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or to the opinions of thoſe who may try it, the revival of a Licencer would be a ſecurity to the public: For, if I preſent my book to a Magiſtrate appointed by law, if he rejects it, I have only to forbear from the publication, and in the forbearance I am ſafe; and he too is anſwerable to Law for the abuſe of his authority. But, upon the argument of to-day, a man muſt print at his peril, without any guide to the principles of judgment, upon which his work may be afterwards poſecuted and condemned. Milton's argument therefore applies, and was meant to apply, to every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption to writing, which, while they op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the individual, endanger the State.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>We have them not,</q> ſays Milton, <q>that can be heard of, from any ancient ſtate, or polity, or church, nor by any ſtatute left us by our anceſtors, elder or later, nor from the
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:0995201000:158"/>modern cuſtom of any reformed city, or church abroad; but from the moſt antichriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian council, and the moſt tyrannous inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that ever exiſted.

                     <p>Nor is it to the common people leſs than a reproach; for if we be ſo jealous over them
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:0995201000:159"/>that we cannot truſt them with an Engliſh pamphlet, what do we but cenſure them, for a giddy, vicious, and ungrounded people; in ſuch a ſick and weak eſtate of faith and diſcretion, as to be able to take nothing down but through the pipe of a Licenſer.

                     <p>To prevent men thinking and acting for themſelves, by reſtraints on the preſs, is like to the exploits of that gallant man, who, thought to pound up the crows by ſhutting his park gate.</p>
                     <p>This obſtructing violence meets for the moſt part with an event, utterly oppoſite to the end which it drives at: inſtead of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing books, it raiſes them and inveſts them with a reputation: the puniſhment of wits enhances their authority, ſaith the Viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count St. Albans'; and a forbidden writing is thought to be a certain ſpark of truth, that flies up in the face of them who ſeek to tread it out.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>He then adverts to his viſit to the famous Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lileo, whom he found and viſited in the inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <q>for not thinking in Aſtronomy with the Franciſcan and Dominican Monks.</q> And what event ought more deeply to intereſt and affect us. The very laws of Nature were to bend under the rod of a Licenſer; this illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Aſtronomer ended his life within the bars of a priſon, becauſe, in ſeeing the phaſes of Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus through his newly-invented teleſcope, he
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:0995201000:160"/>pronounced, that ſhe ſhone with borrowed light, and from the Sun as the centre of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe. This was the mighty crime, the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the Sun in the center: that Sun which now inhabits it upon the foundation of mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical truth, which enables us to traverſe the pathleſs ocean, and to carry our line and rule amongſt other worlds, which but for Galileo we had never known, perhaps even to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes of an Infinite and Immortal God.</p>
                  <p>Milton then, in his moſt eloquent addreſs to the parliament, puts the liberty of the preſs on its true and moſt honourable foundation. <q>Believe it, Lords and Commons, they who counſel ye to ſuch a ſuppreſſing of books, do as good as bid you ſuppreſs yourſelves; and I will ſoon ſhew how.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>If it be deſired to know the immediate cauſe of all this free writing and free ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, there cannot be aſſigned a truer than your own mild, and free, and humane Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; it is the liberty, Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, which your own valorous and happy counſels have purchaſed us; liberty which is the nurſe of all great wits: this is that which hath rarified and enlightened our ſpirits like the influence of heaven; this is that which hath enfranchiſed, enlarged and lifted up our apprehenſions, degrees above themſelves. Ye cannot make us now leſs ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable, leſs knowing, leſs eagerly purſuing the truth, unleſs ye firſt make yourſelves, that made us ſo, leſs the lovers, leſs the founders of our true liberty. We can grow ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant again, brutiſh formal and ſlaviſh, as ye
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:0995201000:161"/>found us; but you then muſt firſt become that which ye cannot be, oppreſſive, arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and tyrannous, as they were from whom ye have freed us. That our hearts are now more capacious, our thoughts now more erected to the ſearch and expectation of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and exacteſt things, is the iſſue of your own virtue propagated in us. Give me the liberty to know, to utter, and to argue freely according to conſcience, above all liberties.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Gentlemen, I will now refer you to another Author, whoſe opinion you may think more in point, as having lived in our own times, and as holding the higheſt monarchical prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Government. I ſpeak of Mr. Hume, who, nevertheleſs, conſiders, that this Liberty of the Preſs extends not only to abſtract ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation, but to keep the public on their guard againſt all the acts of their Government.</p>
                  <p>After ſhewing the advantages of a Monarchy to public freedom, provided it is duly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trolled and watched by the popular part of the Conſtitution, he ſays, <q>Theſe principles account for the great liberty of the preſs in theſe kingdoms, beyond what is indulged in any other Government. It is apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that arbitrary power would ſteal in upon us, were we not careful to prevent its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, and were there not an eaſy method of conveying the alarm from one end of the kingdom to the other. <hi>The ſpirit of the people m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="163" facs="tcp:0995201000:162"/>effectual to this purpoſe as the liberty of the preſs, by which all the learning, wit, and genius of the nation, may be employed on the ſide of freedom; and every one be ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated to its defence. <hi>As long, therefore, as the republican part of our Government can maintain itſelf againſt the monarchical, it will naturally be careful to keep the preſs open, as of importance to its own preſervation.</hi>

                  <p>There is another authority co-temporary with the laſt, a ſplendid Speaker in the upper Houſe of Parliament, and who held during moſt of his time high offices under the King; I ſpeak of the Earl of Cheſterfield, who thus expreſſed himſelf in the Houſe of Lords:— <q>One of the greateſt bleſſings, my Lords, we enjoy, is Liberty; but every good in this life has its alloy of evil—Licentiouſneſs is the alloy of Liberty, it is —.</q>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lord Kenyon.</speaker>
                  <p>That very ſpeech which did Lord Cheſterfield ſo much honour, is ſuppoſed to have been written by Doctor Johnſon.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Erſkine.</speaker>
                  <p>Gentlemen, I believe it was ſo, and I am much obliged to his Lordſhip for giving me a far higher authority for my doctrine. For though Lord Cheſterfield was a
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:0995201000:163"/>man of great ingenuity and wit, he was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly far inferior in learning and in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchical opinion, to the celebrated writer to whom my Lord has now delivered the work by his authority. Doctor Johnſon then ſays, <q>One of the greateſt bleſſings we enjoy, one of the greateſt bleſſings a people, my Lords, can enjoy, is Liberty; but every good in this life has its alloy of evil: licentiouſneſs is the alloy of liberty: it is an ebullition, an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creſcence; it is a ſpeck upon the eye of the political body, which I can never touch but with a gentle, with a trembling hand, leſt I deſtroy the body, leſt I injure the eye upon which it is apt to appear.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>There is ſuch a connection between licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſneſs and liberty, that it is not eaſy to correct the one, without dangerouſly wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the other; it is extremely hard to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh the true limit between them: like a changeable ſilk, we can eaſily ſee there are two different colours, but we cannot eaſily diſcover where the one ends, or where the other begins.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>I confeſs, I cannot help agreeing with this learned author. The danger of touching the preſs is the difficulty of marking its limits. My learned friend, who has juſt gone out of Court, has drawn no line, and unfolded no principle. He has not told us, if this book is condemned, what book may be written. If I may not write againſt the exiſtence of a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, and recommend a republic, may I write againſt any part of tie Government? May I ſay that we ſhould be better without a
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:0995201000:164"/>Houſe of Lords, or a Houſe of Commons, or a Court of Chancery, or any other given part of our eſtabliſhment? Or if, as has been hinted, a work may become libellous for ſtat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing even legal matter with ſarcaſtic phraſe, the difficulty becomes the greater, and the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of the preſs more impoſſible to define.</p>
                  <p>The ſame author, purſuing the ſubject and ſpeaking of the fall of Roman liberty, ſays, <q>But this fort of liberty came ſoon after to be called licentiouſneſs; for we are told that Auguſtus, after having eſtabliſhed his empire, reſtored order in Rome by reſtraining licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſneſs. God forbid we ſhould in this country have order reſtored, or licentiouſneſs reſtrained, at ſo dear a rate as the people of Rome paid for it to Auguſtus.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Let us conſider, my Lords, that arbitrary power has ſeldom or never been introduced into any country at once. It muſt be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced by ſlow degrees, and as it were ſtep by ſtep, leſt the people ſhould ſee its approach. The barriers and fences of the people's liberty muſt be plucked up one by one, and ſome plauſible pretences muſt be ſound for removing or hoodwinking, one after another, thoſe ſentries who are poſted by the conſtitution of a free country, for warning the people of their danger, When theſe preparatory ſteps are once made, the people may then, indeed, with regret, ſee ſlavery and arbitrary power making long ſtrides over their land; but it will be too late to think of preventing or avoiding the impending ruin.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="166" facs="tcp:0995201000:165"/>
                     <q>The ſtage, my Lords, and the preſs, are two of our out-ſentries; if we remove them, if we hoodwink them, if we throw them in fetters, the enemy may ſurpriſe us.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Gentlemen, this ſubject was ſtill more lately put in the juſteſt and moſt forcible light by a noble perſon high in the Magiſtracy; and whoſe mind is not at all tuned to the introduction of diſorder by improper popular exceſſes; I mean Lord Loughborough, chief Juſtice of the Court of Common Pleas. I believe I can anſwer for the correctneſs of my note, which I ſhall fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low up with the opinion of another member of the Lord's houſe of Parliament; the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Earl Stanhope; or rather, I ſhall take Lord Stanhope firſt, as his Lordſhip introduces the ſubject by adverting to this argument of Lord Loughborough's. "If," ſays his Lordſhip, <q>our boaſted liberty of the preſs, were to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt only in the liberty to write in praiſe of the Conſtitution, this is a liberty enjoyed under many arbitrary governments. I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it would not be deemed quite an unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable offence, even by the Empreſs of Ruſſia, if any man were to take into his head to write a panegyric upon the Ruſſian form of Government. Such a liberty as that might therefore properly be termed the <hi>Ruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian liberty of the Preſs. But, the Engliſh liberty of the Preſs</hi> is of a very different de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription: for, by the law of England, it is not prohibited to publiſh ſpeculative works upon the Conſtitution, whether <hi>they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain praiſe or cenſure.</hi>
                     </q>—<hi>Lord Stanhope's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the Libel Bill.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="167" facs="tcp:0995201000:166"/>You ſee therefore, as far as the general principle goes, I am ſupported by the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Lord Stanhope, for otherwiſe the noble Lord has written a libel himſelf, by exciting other people to write <hi>whatever they may think,</hi> be it good or evil, of the conſtitution of the country. As to the other high authority, Lord Loughborough, I will read what applies to this ſubject—'Every man' ſaid Lord Loughborough, <q>may publiſh at his diſcretion his opinions concerning forms and ſyſtems of Government.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>If they be wiſe and enlightening, the world will gain by them; if they be weak and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd, they will be laughed at and forgotten; and, if they be <hi>bona fide,</hi> they cannot be cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal, however erroneous. On the other hand, the purpoſe and the direction may give a different turn to writings whoſe common conſtruction is harmleſs or even meritorious. Suppoſe men, aſſembled in diſturbance of the peace, to pull down mills or turnpikes, or to do any other miſchief, and that a miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous perſon ſhould diſperſe among them an excitation to the planned miſchief known to both writer and reader, <hi>To your tents, O Iſrael;</hi> that publication would be criminal. But how criminal? not as a libel, not as an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract writing, but as an act; and the act being the crime <hi>it muſt be ſtated as a fact ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſic on the record:</hi> for, otherwiſe, a Court of Error could have no juriſdiction but over the natural conſtruction of the writing; nor would the defendant have any notice of ſuch matter at the trial, without a charge on the
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:0995201000:167"/>Record. To give the Jury cognizance of any matter beyond the conſtruction of the writing, the averrment ſhould be in the caſe as I have inſtanced, that certain perſons were, as I have deſcribed, aſſembled; and that the publiſher, intending to execute theſe perſons ſo aſſembled, wrote <hi>ſo and ſo.</hi> Here the crime is complete, and conſiſts in an overt-act of wickedneſs evidenced by a writing.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>In anſwer to all theſe authorities, the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torney General may ſay, that, if Mr. Paine had written his obſervations with the views of thoſe high perſons and under other circumſtances, he would be protected and acquitted: to which I can only anſwer, that no facts or cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances attending his work are either charged or proved; that you have no juriſdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whatever but over the natural conſtruction of the work before you, and that I am therefore brought without a flaw in the deduction to the paſſages which are the particular ſubject of complaint.</p>
                  <p>Gentlemen, I am not unmindful how long I have already treſpaſſed upon your patience; a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ll not be diſconcerted if any of you ſhould appear anxious to retire from the pain of hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me farther. It has been ſaid, that my vanity has forwarded my zeal in this cauſe; but I might appeal even to the authors of thoſe paragraphs, whether a ſituation ever exiſted which vanity would have been fonder to fly
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:0995201000:168"/>from—the taſk of ſpeaking againſt every known prepoſſeſſion; with every countenance, as it were, planted and lifted up againſt me. But I ſtand at this bar to give to a criminal arraigned before it, the defence which the law of the country entitles him to. If any of my arguments be indecent, or unfit for the Court to hear, the noble Judge preſides to interrupt them: If all, or any of them, are capable of an anſwer, they will be anſwered: Or, if they be ſo unfounded in your own minds, who are to judge of them as not to call for refutation, your verdict in a moment will overthrow all that has been ſaid—We ſhall then have all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged our duties—It is your's to judge, but m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ne only to addreſs your judgments.</p>
                  <p>When my Lord and I were Counſel for Lord George Gordon in 1781, it was not conſidered by that Jury, nor imputed to us by any body, that we were contending for the privileges of over-awing the Houſe of Commons, or recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending the conflagration of this city: <hi>I</hi> am doing the ſame duty now, which <hi>my Lord and I</hi> then did in concert together; and, whatever may become of the cauſe, I expect to be heard: conſcious that no juſt obloquy can be, or will <hi>(in the end)</hi> be caſt upon me for having done my duty in the manner I have endeavoured to perform it.</p>
                  <p>Gentlemen, I come now to obſerve on the paſſages ſelected by the information; and with regard to the firſt I ſhall diſpoſe of it in a moment.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>All <hi>Hereditary</hi> government is in its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture tyranny. An hereditable crown, or
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:0995201000:169"/>an hereditable throne, or by what other fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful name ſuch things may be called, have no other ſignificant explanation than that mankind are hereditable <hi>property.</hi> To <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit</hi> a government is to <hi>inherit</hi> the <hi>people,</hi> as if they were flocks and herds.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>And is it to be endured, ſays the Attorney General, that the people of this country are to be told that they are driven like oxen or ſheep? Certainly not I am of opinion that a more dangerous doctrine cannot be inſtilled into the people of England. But who inſtils ſuch a doctrine? I deny it is inſtilled by Paine. For when he maintains that hereditary monarchy inherits a people like flocks and herds, it is clear from the context <hi>(which is ke<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>t out of view,)</hi> that he is combating the propoſition in Mr. Burke's book, which aſſerts, that the hereditary monarchy of England is faſtened upon the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of England by indiſſoluble compact. Mr. Paine, on the contrary, aſſerts the King of England to be the <hi>magiſtrate of the people,</hi> exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by their conſent, which is utterly incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patible with their being driven like herds. His argument, therefore, is this, and it retorts on his adverſary: he ſays, ſuch a King as you repreſent the King of England to be, inheriting the people by virtue of conqueſt, or of ſome compact, which, having once exiſted, cannot be diſſolved while the original terms of it are kept, <hi>is an inheritance like flocks and herds.</hi> But I deny that to be the King of England's title, he is <hi>the magiſtrate of the people,</hi> and that title I reſpect. It is to your own imaginary King of
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:0995201000:170"/>England therefore, and not to his Majeſty, that your unfounded innuendos apply. It is the Monarchs of Ruſſia and Pruſſia, and all Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments faſtened upon unwilling ſubjects by hereditary indefeaſible titles, that are ſtigma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed by Paine as inheriting the people like flocks. The ſentence, therefore, muſt either be taken in the pure abſtract, and then it is not only merely ſpeculative, but the application of it to our own Government fails altogether, or it muſt be taken connected with the matter which conſtitutes the application, and then it is Mr. Burke's King of England, and not his Majeſty whoſe title is denied.</p>
                  <p>I paſs therefore to the next paſſage, which appears to be an extraordinary ſelection. It is taken at a leap from page 21 to page 47, and breaks in at the words, "This convention." The ſentence ſelected ſtands thus, <q>This con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention met at Philadelphia in May 1787, of which General Waſhington was elected preſident. He was not at that time con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with any of the ſtate governments, or with Congreſs. He delivered up his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion when the war ended, and ſince then had lived a private citizen.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>The Convention went deeply into all the ſubjects; and having after a variety of debate and inveſtigation, agreed among themſelves upon the ſeveral parts of a federal Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, the next queſtion was, the manner of giving it authority and practice.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>For this purpoſe, they did not, like a cabal of courtiers, ſend for a Dutch Stadt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder, or a German Elector; but they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:0995201000:171"/>the whole matter to the ſenſe and intereſt of the country.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This ſentence, ſtanding thus by itſelf, may appear to be a mere ſarcaſm on King William, upon thoſe who effected the Revolution; and upon the Revolution itſelf, without any reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or deduction: But when the context and ſequel are looked at and compared, it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be a ſerious Hiſtorical compariſon between the Revolution effected in England in 1688, and the late one in America when ſhe eſtabliſhed her independence; and no man can doubt that his judgment on that compariſon was ſincere. But where is the Libel on the Conſtitution? For whether King William was brought over here by the ſincereſt and juſteſt motives of the whole people of England, each man acting for himſelf, or through the motives and agencies imputed by the defendant, it ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies not one farthing at this time of day to the eſtabliſhment itſelf. Blackſtone warns us not to fix our obedience or affection to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on the motives of our anceſtors, or the rectitude of their reaſonings, but to be ſatisfied that it is eſtabliſhed. This is ſafe reaſoning, and, for my own part, I ſhould not be differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently affected to the Conſtitution of my country, which my own underſtanding approved, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther angels or demons had given it birth.</p>
                  <p>Do any of you love the reformation the leſs becauſe Henry the eighth was the author of it? Or becauſe luſt and poverty, and not religion, were his motives. He had ſquandered the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of his father, and he preferred Anne Bullen to his Queen; theſe were the cauſes
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:0995201000:172"/>which produced it.—What then! does that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the purity of our reformed religion, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine its eſtabliſhment, or ſhake the King's title as Prince of the country, to the excluſion of thoſe who held by the religion it had aboliſhed? Will the Attorney General affirm, that I could be convicted of a libel for a whole volume of aſperity againſt Henry the Eighth, merely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he effected the reformation; and if not, why againſt King William, who effected the Revolution? Where is the line to be drawn? Is one, two, or three centuries to be the ſtatute of limitation? But do not our own hiſtorians de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail this very cabal of courtiers, from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of our own country? If you will turn to Hume's hiſtory, volume the eighth, page 188, &amp;c. &amp;c. you will find that he ſtates at great length, the whole detail of intrigues which paved the way for the Revolution, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted coalition of parties which gave it effect.</p>
                  <p>But what of all this, concerning the motives of parties, which is recorded by Hume. The queſtion is, <hi>What is the thing brought about,—Not</hi> HOW <hi>it was brought about.</hi> If it ſtands as Blackſtone argues it, upon the conſent of our anceſtors, followed up by our own, no indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual can withdraw his obedience. If he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes the eſtabliſhment, let him ſeek elſewhere for another; I am not contending for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controuled <hi>conduct,</hi> but for freedom of <hi>opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>With regard to what has been ſtated of the <hi>Edwards</hi> and <hi>Henrys,</hi> and the other princes under which the author can only diſcover <hi>"re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrictions on power, but nothing of a conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:"</hi>
                     <pb n="174" facs="tcp:0995201000:173"/>ſurely my friend is not in earneſt when he ſelects that as a libel.</p>
                  <p>Paine inſiſts, that there was no conſtitution under theſe princes, and that Engliſh liberty was obtained from uſurped power by the ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles of the people. So SAY I. And I think it for the honor and advantage of the country that it ſhould be known.</p>
                  <p>Was there any freedom after the original eſtabliſhment of the Normans by conqueſt? Was not the MAGNA CHARTA wreſted from John by open force of arms at Runnymead? Was it not again re-enacted whilſt menacing arms were in the hands of the people? Were not it's ſtipulations broken through, and two and forty times re-enacted by Parliament, upon the firm demand of the people in the following reigns? I proteſt it fills me with aſtoniſhment to hear theſe truths brought in queſtion.</p>
                  <p>I was formerly called upon under the diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of a College to maintain them, and was rewarded for being thought to have ſucceſsfully maintained that our preſent Conſtitution was by no means a remnant of Saxon liberty, nor any other inſtitution of liberty, but the pure con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of the oppreſſion of the Norman tenures, which ſpreading the ſpirit of freedom from one end of the kingdom to another, ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled our brave fathers, inch by inch, not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conquer, <hi>but for the firſt time to obtain</hi> thoſe privileges which are the unalienable inheritance of all mankind.</p>
                  <p>But why do we ſpeak of the Edwards and Henries, when Hume himſelf expreſsly ſays, notwithſtanding all we have heard to-day of
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:0995201000:174"/>the antiquity of our conſtitution, that our monarchy was nearly abſolute till the middle of laſt century. I have his book in Court, and will read it to you. It is his Eſſay on the Liberty of the Preſs, vol. I, page 15.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>All abſolute Governments, and ſuch in a great meaſure was England, till the middle of the laſt century, <hi>notwithſtanding the nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous panegyries on</hi> ANCIENT <hi>Engliſh Liberty,</hi> muſt very much depend on the adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is Hume's opinion; the concluſion of a grave hiſtorian from all that he finds recorded as the materials for hiſtory: and ſhall it be ſaid that Mr. Paine is to be puniſhed for writing to-day what was before written by another, who is now a diſtinguiſhed claſſic in the language? All the verdicts in the world will not make that palateable to an impartial public, or to poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
                  <p>The next paſſage arraigned is this: p. 56. <q>The attention of the government of England, (for I rather chuſe to call it by this name, than the Engliſh government) appears, ſince it's political connection with Germany, to have been ſo compleatly engroſſed and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorbed by foreign affairs, and the means of raiſing taxes, that it ſeems to exiſt for no other purpoſes. Domeſtic concerns are neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected; and with reſpect to regular law, there is ſcarcely ſuch a thing.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>That the government of this country is, in conſequence of it's connection with the Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, and the continental wars which it has occaſioned, been continually loaded with griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:0995201000:175"/>taxes, no man can diſpute; and I appeal to your juſtice, whether this ſubject has not been, for years together, the conſtant topic of unreproved declamation and grumbling?</p>
                  <p>As to what he ſays with regard to there hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly being ſuch a thing as regular law, he ſpeaks in the abſtract of the complexity of our ſyſtem; but does not arraign the adminiſtration of juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice <hi>in it's practice.</hi> But with regard to cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticiſms and ſtrictures on the general ſyſtem, it has been echoed over and over again by various authors; and even from the pulpits of our country, that the law of the land is mainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective, devoid of regularity and preciſion, and overloaded with a variety of expenſive and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary forms. I have a Sermon in Court written during the American war, by a perſon of great eloquence and piety, part of which I will read to you on this ſubject, in which he looks forward to an exemption from the into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable grievances of our old legal ſyſtem in the infant eſtabliſhment of the New World.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>It may be in the purpoſes of providence, on yon weſtern ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="177" facs="tcp:0995201000:176"/>poverty or weakneſs, or eſcape it by legal artifice, or civil privileges, or interpoſing power; wherein the rule of conduct ſhall not be hidden or diſguiſed in the language of principles and cuſtoms that died with the barbariſm which gave them birth; wherein haſty formulas ſhall not diſſipate the reverence that is due to the tribunals and tranſactions of juſtice; wherein obſolete preſcripts ſhall not pervert, nor entangle, nor impede the adminiſtration of it, nor in any inſtance ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it to deriſion or to diſregard; wherein miſrepreſentation ſhall have no ſhare in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciding upon right and truth; and under which no man ſhall grow great by the wages of chicanery, or thrive by the quarrels that are ruinous to his employers.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is ten times ſtronger than Mr. Paine; but who ever thought of proſecuting Mr. Cappe?</p>
                  <p>In various other inſtances you will find de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects in our juriſprudence pointed out and lamented, and not ſeldom by perſons called upon by their ſituations to deliver the law in the ſeat of magiſtracy: therefore, the author's <hi>general</hi> obſervation does not appear to be that ſpecies of attack upon the magiſtracy of the country, as to fall within the deſcription of a libel.</p>
                  <p>With reſpect to the two Houſes of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I believe I ſhall be able to ſhew you that the very perſon who introduced this controverſy, and who certainly is conſidered by thoſe who now adminiſter the government, as a man uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully devoted to maintain the conſtitution of
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:0995201000:177"/>the country in the preſent criſis, has himſelf made remarks upon theſe Aſſemblies; that upon compariſon you will think more ſevere than thoſe which are the ſubject of the Attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney General's animadverſion. The paſſage in Mr. Paine runs thus:</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>With reſpect to <hi>the two houſes,</hi> of which the Engliſh Parliament is compoſed, they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be effectually influenced into one, and, as a legiſlature, to have no temper of it's own. The miniſter, whoever he at any time may be, touches it as with an opium wand, and it ſleeps obedience.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>But if we look at the diſtinct abilities of the two houſes, the difference will appear ſo great, as to ſhew the inconſiſtency of placing power where there can be no certainty of the judgment to uſe it. Wretched as the ſtate of repreſentation is in England, it is manhood compared with what is called the houſe of Lords; and ſo little is this nick-named houſe regarded, that the people ſcarcely inquire at any time what it is doing. It appears alſo to be moſt under influence, and the furtheſt removed from the general intereſt of the nation.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The concluſion of the ſentence, and which was meant by Paine as evidence of the previous affection, the Attorney General has omitted in the information, and in his ſpeech, it is this: <q>In the debate on engaging in the Ruſſian and Turkiſh war, the majority in the Houſe of Peers in favour of it was upwards of ninety, when in the other houſe, which is more than
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:0995201000:178"/>double it's numbers, the majority was ſixty-three.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The terms, however, in which Mr. Burke ſpeaks of the Houſe of Lords, are ſtill more expreſſive. <q>It is ſomething more than a cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury ago, ſince we voted the Houſe of Lords uſeleſs. They have now voted themſelves ſo, and the whole hope of reformation</q> (<hi>ſpeaking of the Houſe of Commons</hi> 
                     <q>is caſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us.</q> This ſentiment, Mr. Burke not only expreſſed in his place in parliament, where no man can call him to an account; but it has been ſince, repeatedly printed amongſt his other va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable works. And his opinion of BOTH THE HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT, which I am about to read to you, was originally publiſhed as a pamphlet, and applied to the ſettled habitual abuſes of theſe high aſſemblies. Remember, I do not uſe them as <hi>argumenta ad hominem,</hi> or <hi>ad invidiam</hi> againſt the author, for if I did, it could be no defence of Mr. Paine. But I uſe them as high authority, the work <note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. Burke's Thoughts on the cauſe of the preſent diſcontents, publiſhed in 1775.</note> having been the juſt foundation of ſubſtantial and laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reputation. Would to God that any part of it were capable of being denied or doubted.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Againſt the being of parliament I am ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied no deſigns have ever been entertained ſince the Revolution. Every one muſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that it is ſtrongly the intereſt of the Court to have ſome ſecond cauſe interpoſed between the miniſters and the people. The gentlemen of the Houſe of Commons have an
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:0995201000:179"/>intereſt equally ſtrong, in ſuſtaining the part of that intermediate cauſe. However they may hire out the uſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ct of their voices, they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver will part with the <hi>ſee and inheritance.</hi> Accordingly thoſe who have been of the moſt known devotion to the will and pleaſure of a court, have at the ſame time been moſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in aſſerting an high authority in the Houſe of Commons. <hi>When they knew who were to use that authority, and how it was to be employed, they thought it never could be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried too far.</hi> It muſt be always the wiſh of an unconſtitutional ſtateſman, that an Houſe of Commons, <hi>who are entirely dependent upon him, ſhould have every right of the people de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent upon their pleaſure.</hi> FOR IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT THE FORMS OF A FREE, AND THE ENDS OF AN ARBITRARY GO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VERNMENT, WERE THINGS NOT ALTO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GETHER INCOMPATIBLE.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>The power of the crown almoſt dead and rotten as Prerogative, has grown up anew, with much more ſtrength and far leſs odium, under the name of influence. An influence which operates without noiſe and violence; which converts the very antagoniſt into the inſtrument of power: which contains in it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a perpetual principle of growth and reno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: and which the diſtreſſe; and the proſperity of the country equally tend to augment, was an admirable ſubſtitute for a Prerogative, that being only the offspring of antiquated prejudices, had moulded in its original ſtamina irreſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ible principles of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay and diſſolution. The ignorance of the
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:0995201000:180"/>people is a bottom but for a temporary ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem; but the intereſt of active men in the ſtate is a foundation perpetual and infallible.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Mr. Burke therefore, in page 66, ſpeaking of the ſame court party, ſays:</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Parliament was indeed the great object of all theſe polities, the end at which they aimed, as well as the INSTRUMENT by which they were to operate.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>And purſuing the ſubject in page 70, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds as follows:</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>They who will not conform their conduct to the public good, and cannot ſupport it by the prerogative of the crown, have adopted a new plan. They have totally abandoned the ſhattered and old-faſhioned fortreſs of pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rogative, and made a lodgement in the ſtrong hold of parliament itſelf. If they have any evil deſign to which there is no ordinary le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal power commenſurate, they bring it into parliament. <hi>There the whole is executed from the beginning to the end. And the power of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining their object abſolute: and the ſafety in the proceeding perfect; no rules to confine, nor after reckonings to terrify.</hi> For parliament cannot with any great propriety puniſh others for things in which they themſelves have been ACCOMPLICES. Thus its controul upon the executory power is loſt ; becauſe it is made to partake in every conſiderable act of government, <hi>and impeachment, that great guardian of the purity of the Conſtitution, is in danger of being loſt even to the idea of it.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Until this time, the opinion of the people, through the power of an Aſſembly, ſtill in
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:0995201000:181"/>ſome ſort popular, led to the greateſt honours and emoluments in the gift of the crown. Now the principle is reverſed; and the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the court is the only ſure way of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining and holding thoſe honours which ought to be IN THE DISPOSAL OF THE PEO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PLE.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Mr. Burke, in page 100, obſerves with great truth, that the miſchiefs he complained of, did not at all ariſe from the Monarchy, but from the parliament, and that it was the duty of the people to look to it. He ſays, <q>The diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of monarchy were the great ſubjects of apprehenſion and redreſs, in the <hi>laſt cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury; in this,</hi> the diſtempers of parliament.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Not the diſtempers of parliament in this year or the laſt, but in <hi>this century,</hi> i. e. its ſettled habitual diſtemper. <q>It is not in parliament alone that the remedy for parliamentary diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders can be compleated; and hardly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed can it begin there. Until a confidence in government is re-eſtabliſhed, the people ought to be <hi>excited</hi> to a more ſtrict and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailed attention to the conduct of their repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives. Standards for judging more ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tematically upon their conduct ought to be ſettled in the meetings of counties and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porations, and frequent and correct liſts of the voters in all important queſtions ought to be procured.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>By ſuch means ſomething may be done, ſince it may appear who thoſe are, that by an indiſcriminate ſupport of all adminiſtrations, have totally ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>I wiſh it was poſſible to read the whole of this moſt important volume—but the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of theſe truths contained in it were all eloquently ſummed up by the author in his ſpeech upon the reform of the houſehold.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>But what I confeſs was uppermoſt with me, what I bent the whole courſe of my mind to, was the reduction of that corrupt influence which is itſelf the perennial ſpring of all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digality and diſorder: which loads us more than millions of debt; which takes away vigour from our arms, wiſdom from our councils, and every ſhadow of authority and credit from the moſt venerable parts of our conſtitution.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſame important truths were held out to the whole public, upon a ſtill later occaſion, by the perſon now at the head of his Majeſty's coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils: and ſo high (as it appears) in the confidence of the nation. <hi>He.</hi> not in the abſtract like the author before you, but upon the ſpur of the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, and in the teeth of what had been juſt declared in the Houſe of Commons, came to, and acted upon reſolutions which are contained in this book. <note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. Erſkine took up a book.</note> Reſolutions pointed to the puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of a parliament, dangerouſly corrupted into the very ſtate deſcribed by Mr. Paine. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member here too, that I impute no cenſure to Mr. Pitt. It was the moſt brilliant paſſage in
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:0995201000:183"/>his life, and I ſhould have thought his life a better one, if he had continued uniform in the ſupport of opinions, which it is ſaid he has not changed, and which certainly have had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to change them. But at all events, I have a right to make uſe of the authority of his ſplendid talents and ſituation, not merely to protect the defendant, but the public, and to reſiſt the precedent, That what one man may do in England with approbation and glory, ſhall conduct another man to a pillory or a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
                  <p>It was the abuſes pointed out by the man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you, that led that Right Hon. Gentleman to aſſociate with many others of high rank, under the banners of the Duke of Richmond, whoſe name ſtands at the head of the liſt, and to paſs various public reſolutions, concerning the abſolute neceſſity of purifying the Houſe of Commons; and we collect the plan from a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amble entered in the book. <q>Whereas the life, liberty and property of every man is or may be affected by the law of the land in which he lives, and every man is bound to pay obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the ſame.</q>

                     <q>And whereas the number of perſons who are ſuffered to vote for electing the members of the Houſe of Commons, do not at this time amount to one-ſixth part of the whole Commons of this realm, whereby far the greater part of the ſaid Commons are deprived of their right to elect their repreſentatives; and the conſent of the majority of the whole community to the paſſing of laws, is given by perſons whom they have not delegated for ſuch purpoſes; and the majority of the ſaid community, and to which the ſaid ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jority have not in fact conſented by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves or by their repreſentatives.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>And whereas the ſtate of election of mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Houſe of Commons, hath in proceſs of time ſo groſly deviated from its ſimple and natural principle of repreſentation and equality, that in ſeveral places, the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers are returned by the property of one man;
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:0995201000:185"/>that the ſmalleſt boroughs ſend as many members as the largeſt counties, and that a majority of the repreſentatives of the whole nation are choſen by a number of votes not exceeding twelve thouſand.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe with many others, were publiſhed, not as abſtract, ſpeculative writings, but within a few days after the Houſe of Commons had declared that no ſuch rights exiſted, and that no alteration was neceſſary in the repreſentation. It was then that they met at the Thatched Houſe, and publiſhed their opinions and reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions to the country at large.—Were any of them proſecuted for theſe proceedings? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly not, (for they were legal proceedings.) But I deſire you as men of honour and truth, to compare all this with Mr. Paine's expreſſion of the Miniſter's touching Parliament with his opiate wand, and let equal juſtice be done—that is all I aſk—let all be puniſhed or none—do not let Mr. Paine be held out to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the public upon the ſcore of his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations on parliament, while others are enjoying all the ſweets which attend a ſuppoſed attachment to their country, who have ſaid the ſame things, and reduced their opinions to practice.</p>
                  <p>But now every man is to be cried down for ſuch opinions. I obſerved that my learned friend ſignificantly raiſed his voice in naming Mr. Horne Tooke, as if to connect him with Paine, or Paine with him. This is exactly the ſame courſe of juſtice; for after all he ſaid no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of Mr. Tooke. What could he have
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:0995201000:186"/>ſaid, but that he was a ſubſcriber with the great names. I have read in theſe proceedings which they have thought fit to deſert.</p>
                  <p>Gentlemen, let others hold their opinions, and change them at their pleaſure; I ſhall ever maintain it to be the deareſt privilege of the people of Great Britain to watch over every thing that affects their good government, either in the ſyſtem, or in the practice: and that for this purpoſe the preſs muſt be free. It has always been ſo, and much evil has been cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by it.—If government finds itſelf an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noyed by it, let it examine it's own conduct, and it will find the cauſe,—let it amend it, and it will find the remedy.</p>
                  <p>Gentlemen, I am no friend to ſarcaſms in the diſcuſſion of grave ſubjects, but you muſt take writers according to the view of the mind at the moment; Mr. Burke as often as any body indulges in it:—hear his reaſon in his ſpeech on reform, for not taking away the ſalaries from Lords who attend upon the Britiſh Court. "You would," ſaid he, <q>have the court deſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by all the nobility of the kingdom.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Sir, the moſt ſerious miſchiefs would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low from ſuch a deſertion. Kings are natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally lovers of low company; they are ſo elevated above all the reſt of mankind, that they muſt look upon all their ſubjects as on a level: they are rather apt to hate than to love their nobility, on account of the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſional reſiſtance to their will, which will be made by their virtue, their petulance, or their pride. It muſt indeed be admitted, that
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:0995201000:187"/>many of the nobility are as perfectly willing to act the part of flatterers, tale-bearers, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſites, pimps, and buſſoons, as any of the loweſt and vileſt of mankind can poſſibly be. But they are not properly qualified for this object of their ambition. The want of a regular education, and early habits, with ſome lurking remains of their dignity, will never permit them to become a match for an Italian eunuch, a mountebank, a ſidler, a player, or any regular practitioner of that tribe. The Roman Emperors, almoſt from the beginning, threw themſelves into ſuch hands; and the miſchief increaſed every day, till it's decline, and it's final ruin. It is, therefore, of very great importance (pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided the thing is not overdone,) to contrive ſuch an eſtabliſhment as muſt, almoſt whether a prince will or not, bring into daily and hourly offices about his perſon, a great number of his firſt nobility; and it is rather an uſeful prejudice that gives them a pride in ſuch a ſervitude: though they are not much the better for a court, a court will be much the better for them. I have therefore, not attempted to reform any of the offices of honour about the King's perſon.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>What is this but ſaying that a King is an animal ſo incurably addicted to low company, as generally to bring on by it the ruin of nations; but nevertheleſs, he is to be kept as a neceſſary evil, and his propenſities bridled by ſurrounding him with a parcel of miſcreants ſtill worſe if poſſible, but better than thoſe he
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:0995201000:188"/>would choſe for himſelf.—This therefore, if taken by itſelf, would be a moſt abominable and libellous ſarcaſm on Kings and Nobility: but look at the whole ſpeech, and you obſerve a great ſyſtem of regulation; and no man, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, ever doubted Mr. Burke's attachment to monarchy. To judge, therefore, of any part of a writing, the whole muſt be read.</p>
                  <p>With the ſame view I mean to read to you the beginning of Harrington's Oceana: but it is impoſſible to name this well known author without expoſing to juſt contempt and ridicule the ignorant or profligate miſrepreſentations which are vomited forth upon the public, to bear down every man as deſperately wicked, who in any age or country has countenanced a Republic, for the mean purpoſe of prejudging this trial.</p>
                  <stage>[Mr. Erſkine took up a book, but laid it down again without reading from it, ſaying ſomething to the gentleman who ſat near him, in a low voice, which I did not hear.]</stage>
                  <p>Is this the way to ſupport the Engliſh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution? Are theſe the means by which Engliſhmen are to be taught to cheriſh it? I ſay, if the man upon trial were ſtained with blood inſtead of ink,—if he were covered over with crimes which human nature would ſtart at the naming of, the means employed againſt him would not be the leſs diſgraceful.</p>
                  <p>For this notable purpoſe then, Harrington, not above a week ago, was handed out to us as a low, obſcure wretch, involved in the murder of the Monarch, and the deſtruction of the
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:0995201000:189"/>Monarchy, and as addreſſing his deſpicable works at the ſhrine of an Uſurper. Yet this very Harrington, this low blackguard, was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended (you may ſee his pedigree at the Herald's Office for ſixpence,) from eight Dukes, three Marquiſſes, ſeventy Earls, twenty-ſeven Viſcounts, and thirty-ſix Barons, ſixteen of whom were Knights of the Garter; a deſcent which I think would ſave a man from diſgrace in any of the circles of Germany. But what was he beſides?—A BLOOD-STAINED RUFFIAN? Oh brutal ignorance of the hiſtory of the Country! He was the moſt affectionate ſervant of Charles the Firſt, from whom he never concealed his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions: for it is obſerved by Wood, that the King greatly affected his company; but when they happened to talk of a Common-wealth, he would ſcarcely endure it.—'I know not,' ſays Toland, <q>which moſt to commend; the King for truſting an honeſt man, though a Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican; or Harrington for owning his principles while he ſerved a King.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>But did his opinions affect his conduct?— Let Hiſtory again anſwer.—He preſerved his fidelity to his unhappy Prince to the very laſt, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all his fawning courtiers had left him to his enraged ſubjects. He ſtaid with him while a priſoner in the Iſle of Wight: came up by ſtealth to follow the fortunes of his monarch and maſter; even hid himſelf in the boot of the coach when he was conveyed to Windſor; and ending a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> he began, fell into his arms and fainted on the ſcaffold.</p>
                  <p>After Charles's death, the Oceana was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:0995201000:190"/>and, as if it were written from juſtice and affection to his memory: for it breathes the ſame noble and ſpirited regard, and aſſerts that it was not Charles that brought on the deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the monarchy, but the feeble and ill conſtituted nature of monarchy itſelf.</p>
                  <p>But the book was a flattery to Cromwell.— Once more and finally let hiſtory decide.</p>
                  <p>It was ſeized by the Uſurper as a libel, and the way it was recovered is remarkable. I mention it to ſhew that Cromwell was a wiſe man in himſelf, and knew on what govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments muſt ſtand for their ſupport.</p>
                  <p>Harrington waited on his daughter to beg for his book, and on entering her apartment, ſnatched up her child and ran away.—On her following him with ſurprize and terror, he turned to her and ſaid, <q>I know what you feel as a mother, feel then for me; your father has got my child:</q> meaning the Oceana. The Oceana was afterwards reſtored on her petition; Cromwell anſwering with the ſagacity of a ſound politician, <q>Let him have his book; if my government is made to ſtand, it has nothing to fear from PAPER SHOT.</q>—He ſaid true.—No good government will ever be battered by paper ſhot. Monteſquieu ſays that <q>In a free nation, it matters not whether indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals reaſon well or ill; it is ſufficient that they do reaſon. Truth ariſes from the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſion, and from hence ſprings liberty, which is a ſecurity from the effect of reaſoning.</q> The Attorney-General read extracts from Mr. Adams's anſwer to this book. Let others do
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:0995201000:191"/>like Mr. Adams: I am not inſiſting upon the infallibility of Mr Paine's doctrines; if they are erroneous, let them be anſwered, and truth will ſpring from the colliſion.</p>
                  <p>A diſpoſition in a nation to this ſpecies of controverſy, is no proof of ſedition or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generacy, but quite the reverſe, as is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by Milton, [I omitted to cite the paſſage with the others] who in ſpeaking of this ſubject, riſes into that inexpreſſibly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime ſtile of writing, wholly peculiar to himſelf. He was indeed no plagiary from any thing human: he looked up for light and expreſſion, as he himſelf wonderfully deſcribes it, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout prayer to that great Being, who is the ſource of all utterance and knowledge; and who ſendeth out his ſeraphim with the hallowed fire of his altars to touch and purify the lips of whom he pleaſes. <q>When the chearfulneſs of the people,</q> ſays this mighty poet, <q>is ſo ſprightly up, as that it has not only where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to guard well it's own freedom and ſafety, but to ſpare, and to beſtow upon the ſolideſt and ſublimeſt points of controverſy and new invention, it betokens us not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated nor drooping to a fatal decay, but caſting off the old and wrinkled ſkin of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption to outlive theſe pangs, and wax young again, entering the glorious ways of truth and proſperous virtue, deſtined to become great and honourable in theſe latter ages. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks I ſee, in my mind, a noble and puiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant nation rouſing herſelf, like a ſtrong man after ſleep, and ſhaking her invincible locks; methinks I ſee her as an eagle muing her
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:0995201000:192"/>mighty youth, and kindling her undazzled eyes at the full mid-day beam; purging and unſcaling her long abuſed ſight at the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain itſelf of heavenly radiance; while the whole noiſe of timorous and flocking birds, with thoſe alſo that love the twilight, flutter about, amazed at what ſhe means, and in their envious gabble would prognoſticate a year of ſects and ſchiſms.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Gentlemen, what Milton only ſaw in his mighty imagination, I ſee in fact; what he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, but which never came to paſs, I ſee now fulfilling: methinks I ſee this noble and puiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant nation, not degenerated and drooping to a fatal decay, but caſting off the wrinkled ſkin of corruption to put on again the vigour of her youth.</p>
                  <p>And it is, becauſe others, as well as myſelf ſee this, that we have all this uproar:—France and its conſtitution are the mere pretences. It is, becauſe Britons begin to recollect the inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance of their own conſtitution, left them by their anceſtors: It is, becauſe they are awakened to the corruptions which have fallen upon its moſt valuable parts, that forſooth the nation is in danger of being deſtroyed by a ſingle pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet.</p>
                  <p>Gentlemen, I have marked the courſe of this alarm: It began with the renovation of thoſe exertions for the public, which the authors of the alarm had themſelves originated and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted; and they became louder and louder when they ſaw theſe principles avowed and ſupported by my admirable and excellent friend
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:0995201000:193"/>Mr. FOX; the moſt eminently honeſt and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened ſtateſman, that hiſtory brings us ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with: a man whom to name is to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, but whom in attempting adequately to deſcribe, I muſt fly to Mr. Burke, my conſtant refuge when eloquence is neceſſary: a man, who to relieve the ſufferings of the moſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant nation, <q>put to the hazard his eaſe, his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, his intereſt, his power, even his darling popularity for the benefit of a people whom he had never ſeen.</q> How much more then for the inhabitants of his native country: yet this is the man who has been cenſured and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avowed in the manner we have lately ſeen.</p>
                  <p>Gentlemen, I have but a few more words to trouble you with: I take my leave of you with declaring, that all this freedom which I have been endeavouring to aſſert, is no more than the freedom which belongs to our own inbred conſtitution: I have not aſked you to acquit Mr. Paine upon any new lights, or upon any principle but the law, which you are ſworn to adminiſter: My great object has been to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcate, that wiſdom and policy, which are the parents of the law of Great Britain, forbid this jealous eye over her ſubjects; and that, on the contrary, they cry aloud in the language of the poet, employed by Lord Chatham on the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable ſubject of America, unfortunately without effect:
<q>
                        <l>Be to their faults a little blind,</l>
                        <l>Be to their virtues very kind;</l>
                        <l>Let all their thoughts be unconfin'd,</l>
                        <l>And clap your padlock on the mind.</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="195" facs="tcp:0995201000:194"/>Engage them by their affections, convince their reaſon, and they will be loyal from the only principle that can make loyalty ſincere, vigorous, or rational, a conviction that it is their trueſt intereſt, and that their form of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is for their common good. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint is the natural parent of reſiſtance, and a pregnant proof, that reaſon is not on the ſide of thoſe who uſe it. You muſt all remember, gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, Lucian's pleaſant ſtory; Jupiter and a countryman were walking together, converſing with great freedom and familiarity upon the ſubject of heaven and earth. The countryman liſtened with attention and acquieſcence, while Jupiter ſtrove only to convince him; but hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening to hint a doubt, Jupiter turned haſtily round and threatened him with his thunder.— "Ah! ha!" ſays the countryman, <q>now Jupiter, I know that you are wrong; you're always wrong when you appeal to your thunder.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is the caſe with me—I can reaſon with the people of England, but I cannot fight againſt the thunder of authority.</p>
                  <p>Gentlemen, this is my defence for free opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions. With regard to myſelf, I am, and ever have been, obedient and affectionate to <hi>the law:</hi> to that rule of action, as long as I exiſt, I ſhall ever give my voice and my conduct; but I ſhall ever do as I have done to-day, maintain the dignity of my high profeſſion, and perform, as I underſtand them, all its important duties.</p>
               </sp>
               <p>[Mr. Attorney General aroſe immediately to reply to Mr. Erſkine, when Mr. Campbell (the
