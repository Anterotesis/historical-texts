            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>I NATURALLY begin this little hiſtory with the account of <hi>Tre Eden Owain,</hi> the place where I firſt made my entrance into this buſy world. The principal houſe in this townſhip, <hi>Downing,</hi> was built in the year 1627.<note place="margin">DOWNING.</note> It certainly had no pretenſions to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> name of <hi>Downing,</hi> which doubtleſsly was a corruption from <hi>Eden Owain,</hi> the <hi>Tre</hi> or townſhip in which it ſtands. The founder was <hi>John Pennant,</hi> ſon of <hi>Nicholas Pennant,</hi> a younger ſon of <hi>Hugh Pennant,</hi> of <hi>Bychton.</hi> He married the heireſs of the place, and built a houſe, which was much too large for the eſtate. The ſtones were brought from <hi>Nant-y-bi,</hi> a dingle oppoſite to the houſe. There is a tradition, that the ſtones were rolled along a platform from the top of the quarry, raiſed on an
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0140800700:10"/>
inclined plane till they reached the building, and there were ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated as the work increaſed in height, till the whole was finiſhed. The houſe is in form of a <hi>Roman</hi> H, a mode of architecture very common in <hi>Wales</hi> at that period. On the front is the pious motto frequent on the <hi>Welſh</hi> houſes, <hi>Heb Dduw heb ddim, a duw a dig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>n,</hi> which ſignifies,
<q>Without God there is nothing, with God enough.</q>
There were only four generations of this branch; <hi>Thomas,</hi> the laſt, died in 1724, and was buried in <hi>Whiteford</hi> church, on <hi>June</hi> 6th of the ſame year. He bequeathed his eſtate to my father, who made the houſe his reſidence; his own father being living, and the houſe much better than our paternal.</p>

By conſulting a drawing of it in that ſtate, may be known the changes made by myſelf. With the eſtate, I luckily found a rich mine of lead ore, which enabled me to make the great improvements I did. The grounds were much hurt by a vile road running in front and on one ſide of the houſe, and through the middle of the demeſne, to the hamlet called <hi>Gwibnant,</hi>

But I ſoon laid open the natural beauties of the place, and by the friendly exchange Sir <hi>Roger Moſtyn</hi> made with me, enlarged the fine ſcenery of the broken grounds, the woods, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of water.

He is dreſſed in the military dreſs of the time, a laced turn-over, and an elegant buff coat, much ornamented, and a muſket with an aukward old lock in his hand, and a ſword by his ſide. I ſuſpect him to have been a ſon of <hi>Pyers Pennant,</hi> who was ſlain the ill-conducted expedition to the iſle <hi>Rhi,</hi> under the duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> in 1627.

In the laſt century it was inhabited by my grandfather, during the life-time of his father. My uncle <hi>John Pennant,</hi> and two of my aunts, were born there. I have often heard it ſaid, with pride, that once three baronets were

                  <p>MY father has often told me a ridiculous ſtory of the effect of a jolly evening paſſed there by ſome of the convivial neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors. They had made very free with ſome ale which had been brewed with malt made of ſoul barley, unfortunately mixed with the ſeeds of certain plant, which brought on a temporary blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. The gueſts had not gone far before the ſymptoms ſeized them, and they were led back to their hoſt, who was in the ſame condition. They were ſuddenly alarmed with a violent ſcream in a female voice. It ſeems that the <hi>butlereſs,</hi> or female butler, had, in her repeated viſits to the cellar, ſipped too plentifully of the <hi>cwrw,</hi> and, terrified with the effect, betrayed herſelf by giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unguardedly full vent to her fears.</p>

They never went to bed, even ſhould the <hi>term</hi> laſt a week; they either ſlept in their chairs or on the floor, as it happened, then awoke and reſumed their jollity. At length, when the barrel was exhauſted, they reeled away, and the hero of this <hi>Bacchanalian</hi> rout always carried the ſpiggot in triumph.

                     <note place="margin">OUR FIRST SHE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIFF.</note>TILL the advancement of <hi>Richard Pennant</hi> to the title of <hi>Penrbyn,</hi> our houſe was never diſtinguiſhed by any honors beyond the moſt uſeful one, that of juſtice of the peace. I ſhould bluſh if a <hi>Pennant</hi> ſhould be found, who through lack of public ſpirit, ſloth, or ſelfiſhneſe, could decline that great conſtitutional office! The firſt ſheriff of our houſe was <hi>Pyers Pennant,</hi> who diſcharged that truſt in 1612. He had the lot of marrying the daughter of a family not famed for placidity, or the milder virtues. <hi>Valdè valde, irritabile genus!</hi> 'And from them, <hi>Tom</hi> (a moſt worthy aunt of mine uſed often to tell me) we got our paſſion;'—and frequently added the wiſe <hi>Welſh</hi> caution, <hi>Beware of a Breed!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THE fruits of this marriage appeared very ſoon. <hi>Thomas,</hi> the eldeſt ſon, in a <hi>furor brevis,</hi> killed his miller: was indicted for the manſlaughter, tried, and convicted; but received his pardon, dated in the firſt of <hi>Charles</hi> I. or the year 1625. This grace preſerved him from the ignominious part of the ſentence, and the more important advantage of preſerving his perſonality, which would otherwiſe have been forfeited to the crown.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="37" facs="tcp:0140800700:49"/>THIS is ſufficient to ſhew that the offence did admit of every palliation; but a ſtronger proof than that may be drawn from the following honor having been conferred on him, when we find that in eight years afterwards, in 1633, he was intruſted with the care of the county of <hi>Flint,</hi> by having the office of high ſheriff committed to his charge. He died the next year; <hi>cujus animae propitietur</hi> DEUS! This unfortunate man married a grand-daughter of that nuptial-loving dame <hi>Catherine y Berran</hi> (See <hi>Tour in Wales,</hi> vol. ii. p. 29) <hi>Mary,</hi> daughter of <hi>Edward Wynn,</hi> of <hi>Yſtrad,</hi> ſon of <hi>Morris Wynn,</hi> of <hi>Gwydir,</hi> fourth and laſt huſband of our famous <hi>Catherine.</hi> There was no iſſue from this match; ſo <hi>Bychton</hi> deſcended to <hi>David,</hi> the next brother.</p>
                  <p>IN thoſe days, and long preceding,<note place="margin">PRESENTS TO SHERIFFS.</note> it was cuſtomary for the friends and neighbors of the ſheriff to make preſents to him to aſſiſt in defraying the expences. I have among my papers two long rolls of gifts. To give the whole would be very tedious. I extract only a few of the moſt remarkable, among which are ſeveral in money, which his friends were not aſhamed to offer: nor the ſheriff to receive. The caſh received in 1612, was £. 10. 18 <hi>s.</hi> 6 <hi>d.;</hi> that in 1642, £. 5.</p>

                     <q>GOD preſerve us from public calamities! for ſerpentine monſters have been often ill favored preſages. I remember in the <hi>Roman</hi> ſtory, to have read how, when ſnakes or ſerpents were found near the ſtatues of their Gods, at one time about <hi>Jupiter</hi>'s neck, another time about <hi>Minerva</hi>'s thigh, there fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed bloody civil wars after it.</q>

the book itſelf to Sir <hi>Theodore Maiherne,</hi> knight. In that he lays before him the wonderful caſe. He tells us that he was ſent on <hi>October</hi> 7th, 1637, by Lady
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0140800700:60"/>
                     <hi>Herris,</hi> wife to Sir <hi>Francis Herris,</hi> knight, to diſſect her nephew <hi>John Pennant,</hi> who had deceaſed the night before, to know the cauſe of his death. The doctor brought with him Maſter <hi>Jacob Heyden,</hi> ſurgeon, to aſſiſt in the enquiry. Mr. <hi>Heydon</hi> made in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion into the left ventricle of the heart, which was full of blood. On thorough examination, the monſter was diſcovered, the head of which was ſo like to that of a ſerpent, that Lady <hi>Herris</hi> ſhivered to ſee it. To judge by the prints, all the upper part of it was cylindrical; towards the lower part bifurcated, and each fork divided into five long and ſlender fibrillae. I leave to the reader the peruſal of the reſt of Dr <hi>May</hi>'s moſt curious diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition.</p>
                  <p>THIS is not the only inſtance of ſimilar appearances in the heart: but we hear no more of ſerpents; the name was changed to <hi>polypuſes,</hi> to which, for their numerous ramifications, they might bear the reſemblance. In our Philoſophical Tranſactions are more than one paper on the ſubject. In Mr. <hi>Lowthorp</hi>'s Abridg. iii. p. 70, and tab. p. 120, is an account, and the figure of one found in the heart of a man at <hi>Oxford;</hi> and in Mr. <hi>Martyn</hi>'s Abridg. ix. p. 135, is the account of ſeveral diſcovered in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of ſailors who died immediately on their return from the <hi>Weſt Indies.</hi> This paper was written by the celebrated Dr. <hi>Huxbam;</hi> he quotes <hi>Malpighius, Bartholinus, Tulpius,</hi> and <hi>Pechlin,</hi> as giving inconteſtible inſtances of the exiſtence of polypi in the heart, in the ſtricteſt ſenſe. This opinion is now exploded. The only uncommon circumſtance (my ingenious friend Dr. <hi>Haygarth</hi> aſſures me) is, that the left ventricle of the heart, and probably the <hi>aorta,</hi> which after death are uſually empty, were
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0140800700:61"/>
in theſe caſes full of blood. The <hi>craſſamentum,</hi> upon coagula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, had taken the form of the arteries in which it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</p>
                  <p>I BREAK a little into chronology,<note place="margin">BARBAROUS EVENTS.</note> to conclude with an event relative to another of my houſe; of little moment indeed, but merely to give a picture of the barbarous days, even of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the laſt century, which I collected from the journal kept by <hi>Peter Roberts,</hi> of <hi>St. Aſaph,</hi> before mentioned. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords, that on <hi>July</hi> 22d, 1615, <hi>Hugh Pennant,</hi> brother to <hi>Pyers Pennant,</hi> 
                     <abbr>eſq</abbr> of <hi>Bychton,</hi> died of a broken head given him at <hi>Denbigh,</hi> by <hi>Pyers Hughes:</hi> That in the year 1626, <hi>Rowland Evan,</hi> a vicar of <hi>St. Aſaph,</hi> was killed at an ale-houſe in <hi>Llandrillo Eiderneon:</hi> That on <hi>October</hi> 3d, 1628, Mr. <hi>Richard Thelwal</hi> was ſlain at his own houſe at <hi>Ruthen:</hi> And that, in 1634, one <hi>Foulkes,</hi> of <hi>Cilowen,</hi> killed his wife, and cut his own throat.</p>
                  <p>THE mention of ale houſe tempts me to ſpeak of a houſe of mine, by the ſea-ſide, in the townſhip of <hi>Bychton,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">LLETTY GONEST.</note> called <hi>Lletty Goneſt,</hi> or the <hi>honeſt houſe.</hi> It had been formerly in the higheſt repute for its excellent ale, brewed by a good ale-wife yclep'd <hi>Jane,</hi> of <hi>Lletty,</hi> whom I well remember. She acquired both fame and wealth, both of which I may ſay ſhe bequeathed to her deſcendants; who to this day, by their own induſtry, continue to flouriſh on the effect of her's.</p>
                  <p>THE houſe was originally built by one <hi>Smith,</hi> from <hi>Worceſter,</hi> partly for the purpoſes of diſtilling, and partly for a warehouſe. I am told, that it occaſionally had ſerved for the place of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement for impreſſed men, at the time in which the colliers
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0140800700:62"/>
had ſuch great trade with <hi>Dublin.</hi> The ſtrong bars in the lower windows favor that notion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">SINGULAR HEAD.</note>ABOVE the door is a very ſingular ſculpture, cut in bas-relief, in ſtone, and let into the wall. One part is a ſtrange chimerical figure of a monſter with four legs, and the head of an owl, fixing its claws in the ſide of a human head. The face is averted, and expreſſing much agony. The eye-lids are drawn up, the eyes the ſame, the mouth half opened, and the teeth cloſely fixed together. The face is young, but has a pair of whiſkers, and is far from being ill cut. It has the character of one of <hi>Le Brun</hi>'s paſſions, article <hi>Pain.</hi> It evidently never was deſigned for this place, but ſeems originally to have been one of thoſe fanciful <hi>gothic</hi> ſculptures be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to ſome antient church.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">SMUGGLING.</note>IN the reign of King <hi>William,</hi> this houſe was remarkable for the violent hands laid on a vaſt ſeizure of <hi>French</hi> wines, to the amount of ſixty pipes, which had been ſmuggled into the great barn at <hi>Trelacre,</hi> in the pariſh of <hi>Llanaſa,</hi> deſtined for the uſe of the <hi>Welſh</hi> gentry in this and the neighboring counties. It muſt be obſerved, that in thoſe days port-wine was in very little uſe in our country. The officers had conveyed this prize with ſafety as far as <hi>Lletty Goneſt,</hi> where they intended to ſleep that night. At midnight they were alarmed by the entry of multitudes of colliers, who tied every body in the houſe neck and heels. They removed the wine into other carriages, and conveyed it into places ſo ſecure that it never more could be heard of. Many of the colliers were obſerved to have rings on their fingers, and fine linen. In fact numbers of them were the gentlemen intereſted in the wine, and concerned in the re-capture, who mixed with
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0140800700:63"/>
the colliers, to direct them in their operations. A proclamation was iſſued out for the diſcovery of the offenders; but ſuch was the fidelity of our people, that they were never detected. The poor tapſter, in particular, knew perfectly well who they were, and large rewards were offered to him by the cuſtom-houſe; but nothing could ſhake his attachment to his friends. He lived long after, ſupported by the grateful contributions of the neighboring 'ſquires.</p>
                  <p>HIGH above <hi>Lletty Goneſt</hi> ſtands a ſummer-houſe, built by my grandfather, to which he often adjourned with his gueſts, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gale them with the delicious beer, brewed by the famous <hi>Jane.</hi> Many years after, when I became maſter of the eſtate, I alſo had my adjournment, but it was either to eat ſhrimps or to drink tea. An honeſt vicar of a diſtant pariſh, who had been a moſt intimate friend of my convivial grandfather, enquired whether I ever went to the ſummer-houſe; and was anſwered, 'Now and then, to drink tea.' Struck with horror at the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generacy of the grandſon, the good man with indignation ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamed,
<q>DRINK TEA! his grandfather would have SCORNED IT!</q>

                  <p>THE turnpike road deſigned for the enabling the ſmelters and others to convey our coal to the places of its deſtination, from the <hi>Moſtyn</hi> and <hi>Bychton</hi> pits, paſſes by <hi>Lletty Goneſt,</hi> and goes along the ſhore towards <hi>Holywell.</hi> In the ſpace of a mile it paſſes by three ſmelting-houſes, <hi>Shop-goch,</hi> the property of Sir <hi>Roger Moſtyn,</hi> and <hi>Pen-y-Ro</hi> and <hi>Llanerch-y-môr,</hi> belonging to me. The laſt diſputes antiquity with moſt in the county, the late works at <hi>Gadlis</hi> excepted.</p>

                     <pb n="52" facs="tcp:0140800700:64"/>ABOVE the laſt is the neat houſe of <hi>Kinſale,</hi> inhabited by my good friend and tenant Mr. <hi>Ralph Richardſon,</hi> who for ſeveral years had with great ſucceſs and integrity carried on the ſmelting buſineſs, with the advantage of ſhipping the produce from the very ſpot, after a ſhort carriage to the veſſels.</p>
                  <p>A SMALL marſh begins a little beyond <hi>Lletty Goneſt,</hi> and widens as it extends ſouthward. It borders on the manor of <hi>Moſtyn:</hi> but itſelf owns no lord but the king. The ſame may be ſaid of the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable remainder, as far as the manor of <hi>Coleſhill,</hi> in the pariſh of <hi>Flint.</hi> The minor of <hi>Greenfield,</hi> in the pariſh of <hi>Holywell,</hi> was long ſuppoſed to have been the property of one or other of two clamants, who fell into diſpute about the right. The matter was referred to two gentlemen of the law, eminent for their abilities, and not leſs ſo for their probity. After examining all the proofs adduced by the rivals, they adjudged that neither had any clame to the lordſhip; ſo it is now left to the freeholders under our ſovereign lord the king: a rich tract for future incloſures.</p>
                  <p>A LITTLE beyond <hi>Kinſale</hi> is the end of our pariſh on this ſide. The boundary between it and the pariſh of <hi>Holywell,</hi> is a ſmall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It reaches to the ſea-ſide: on which, as well as the whole, trees of every kind grow moſt admirably.</p>
                  <p>IT is divided from <hi>Tre Bychton,</hi> in the lower part by the turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pike road, which extends from the ſea-ſide to <hi>Henllan,</hi> ſixteen miles diſtant, originally deſigned for the conveyance of coal from the pits of this townſhip, and that of <hi>Tre Bychton,</hi> to the great lime-works near <hi>Denbigh.</hi> The firſt act was obtained in 1768, the ſecond in 1770: before which our roads were ſcarcely paſſable.

                  <p>OPPOSITE to <hi>Moſtyn</hi> gates, on this part of the turnpike road,<note place="margin">THE RHEWL.</note> is a hamlet, called the <hi>Rhewl, yr Heol, platea,</hi> a way or ſtreet.

On this approach is a moſt venerable avenue, which goes for a
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0140800700:66"/>
conſiderable way in a direct line; then turns ſhort, and terminates with a view of the old part of the old manſion. The park is ſmall, but beautifully broken, and cloathed in various parts with fine oaks, and moſt magnificent beeches; but amidſt the trees is ſuffered to remain rugged with the veſtiges of the antient col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieries. The ground ſlopes finely to the ſea, facing the North Eaſt. The trees grow with vigor cloſe to the water, unhurt by the rude winds with which they are affailed.</p>
                  <p>THE houſe is placed about half a mile from the ſhore. I find ſome difficulty in making a deſcription. I ſhall therefore refer the reader to the firſt plate of <hi>Welſh</hi> ſeats, by Mr. <hi>Boydel,</hi> and to my own, as the only method of giving him ſome idea of the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity of the ſtructure. That plate attempts the front—

For it conſiſts of the moſt antient hall; a leſſer, deſigned for a ſort of <hi>ſympoſium</hi> for ſervants; and on the outſide, annexed and jutting out, is the <hi>quondam</hi> chapel, now converted into a bed-chamber. I have a ſketch of the whole as it was in the year 1684, made by a Mr. <hi>Thomas Dinely,</hi> an attendant on <hi>Henry,</hi> firſt duke of <hi>Beaufort,</hi> then lord preſident of the council in the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipality of <hi>Wales,</hi> and lord lieutenant of the twelve counties; who in that year made a reviewing progreſs of the militia of <hi>North Wales,</hi> and of courſe paid his reſpects to the great man of our country.</p>

They ſeem to have been copied from the great chimney-piece in the hall.</p>
                  <p>I CANNOT trace the time of building of this part of the houſe. It muſt have been at leſt early in the time of <hi>Henry</hi> VI. but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably more antient, for in <hi>Bolton</hi> Hall, in <hi>Bowland, Yorkſhire</hi> (the moſt antique ſeat we know) is a hall in a leſſer ſcale indeed, but greatly ſimilar; and in that houſe it is well known that the unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate prince concealed himſelf for a long time. Poſterity may find the account in my
<q>Tour in Part of the <hi>Mercian</hi> and <hi>Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brian</hi> Kingdoms.</q>
The great gloomy hall is furniſhed with a <hi>Dais</hi> or elevated upper end,<note place="margin">THE OLD HALL.</note> and with a long table for the lord and his jovial companions; and another in the ſide, the ſeat of the inferior partakers of the good cheer. To this day the ſimilitude of the old times is kept up when the family is at home. The head ſervants take their dinner at the <hi>Dais,</hi> and the numerous inferior ſervants fill the long table. The roof is lofty, croſſed with long beams. The <hi>nen-bren,</hi> or top-beam, was in all times a frequent toaſt, whenever the maſter of the houſe's health was drank; and '<hi>Jached y nen-bren y ty,</hi>' was the cordial phraſe. The chimney-piece is magnificently plain, unleſs where the arms of the houſe and its alliances are cut on the ſtone, and properly emblazoned.</p>
                  <p>THE firſt are the arms (a lion rampant, ermin,<note place="margin">COATS OF ARMS.</note> erminé) of <hi>Jevan Vychan,</hi> of <hi>Pengwern,</hi> near <hi>Llangollen,</hi> (ſee <hi>Tour in Wales,</hi> vol. i. p. 295.) ſixteenth in deſcent from <hi>Owen Tudor.</hi> By the marriage of <hi>Jevan</hi> with <hi>Angharad,</hi> daughter and ſole heireſs of <hi>Howel ap Tudor ap Ithel Vychan,</hi> of <hi>Moſtyn,</hi> he added that eſtate to his paternal acres in the reign of <hi>Richard</hi> II.</p>
                  <p>IT ſeems (from the <hi>Moſtyn</hi> pedegree) that in 1444 <hi>Jevan</hi> had

                  <p>THE third are the arms of <hi>Gloddaeth,</hi> (gules a chevron argent between three plates) acquired by the marriage of <hi>Howel ap Evan Vychan,</hi> ſon of the former, in 1460, with <hi>Margaret,</hi> daughter and heir of <hi>Gryffydd ap Rhys ap Gryffydd ap Madoc Gloddaeth ap Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doc ap Jerweth Goch,</hi> of <hi>Cryddyn,</hi> the hundred in which the houſe ſtands.</p>
                  <p>THE fourth are the arms of Sir <hi>Gryffydd Lloyd.

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0140800700:70"/>
morning of the 26th. The preciſe time it reached our country is not known; therefore we are uncertain whether this bird exceeded in ſwiftneſs the hawk which flew thirty miles in an hour in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of a woodcock; or that which made a flight out of <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phalia</hi> into <hi>Pruſſia</hi> in a day—inſtances recorded by the learned Sir <hi>Thomas Brown.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THE adjacent kitchen is overlooked by a gallery leading to the antient apartments of the lady of the houſe,<note place="margin">KITCHEN.</note> at a period when the odors of the pot and ſpit were thought no ill ſavors. From the commanding height of the gallery the good lady might give her orders to her <hi>Coges,</hi> or ſhe-cook, as <hi>Syrus</hi> is humorouſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by <hi>Terence</hi> to do to his ſcullion <hi>Dromo:</hi>—
<q>Let the great eel ſport a little longer in the water.—See that you gut the other fiſhes, and ſtew the great carp well.—Freſhen the ſalt fiſh.— Look to the baked meats, good <hi>Douſe.</hi>—Criſp the pig nicely.— Pray do not over-roaſt the ſurloin again.—Boil the pudding ſufficiently, and do not ſpare plums and ſuet.—Be ſure not to ſmoke the flummery.—Remember, no onions to-day—neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor <hi>P.</hi> dines with us, &amp;c. &amp;c.</q>

                  <p>IN the roof to this gallery are numbers of ſmall rooſting-holes, to which the inferior maidens of the family nightly repair to reſt from their labors.</p>
                  <p>AT one end of the gallery is a great room,<note place="margin">GREAT ROOM.</note> remarkable for a ſingular event. During the time that <hi>Henry</hi> earl of <hi>Richmond</hi> was ſecretly laying the foundation of the overthrow of the houſe of <hi>York,</hi> he paſſed concealed from place to place, in order to form an intereſt among the <hi>Welſh,</hi> who favored his cauſe on account of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to his grandfather <hi>Owen Tudor,</hi> their countryman. While
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0140800700:71"/>
he was at <hi>Moſtyn,</hi> a party attached to <hi>Richard</hi> III. arrived there to apprehend him. He was then about to dine, but had juſt time to leap out of a back window, and make his eſcape through a hole, which,<note place="margin">HENRY VII.</note> to this day, is called the King's. <hi>Richard ap Howel,</hi> then lord of <hi>Moſtyn,</hi> joined <hi>Henry</hi> at the battle of <hi>Boſworth;</hi> and after the victory, received from the king, in token of gratitude for his preſervation, the belt and ſword he wore on that day; he alſo preſſed <hi>Richard</hi> greatly to follow him to court: but he nobly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, like the <hi>Shunamitiſh</hi> woman:
<q>I dwell among mine own people.</q>
The ſword and belt were preſerved in the houſe till within theſe few years. It is obſervable that none of our hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians account for a certain period of <hi>Henry</hi>'s life, previous to his acceſſion. It is very evident that he paſſed the times when he diſappeared from <hi>Bretagny,</hi> in <hi>Wales.</hi> Many cotemporary bards, by feigned names, record this part of his life, under thoſe of the LION, the EAGLE, and the like, which were to reſtore the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire to the <hi>Britons:</hi> for the inſpired favorers of the houſe of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> did not dare to deliver their verſes in other than terms allegorical, for fear of the reigning prince.</p>

In the plate of <hi>Moſtyn</hi> is given the view of the ſeat of a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of large fortune in antient times. In that of <hi>Bychton,</hi> one of middling fortune. In that of the late Mr. <hi>Parry</hi>'s of <hi>Merton,</hi> one of ſmall fortune. As to our eſtate, I think the rent-roll in the year 1572 might amount to about 300<hi>l.</hi> a year, conſiſting of a little money, and rents in kind, and ſervices.</p>
                  <p>BEFORE I quit the old houſe, let me ſay, that the beſt view of the <hi>chaotic</hi> additions backward is from the garden, from a very handſome ſummer-houſe, built by the firſt baronet, as appears by his arms quartered with thoſe of his wife, <hi>Bulkeley</hi> of <hi>Baron Hill.</hi> From this ſpot is ſeen great part of the buildings, and the appurtenances to the old houſe, one tacked to the other, as the increaſe or the wants of the family made neceſſary.</p>
                  <p>IN the year 1631, Sir <hi>Roger Moſtyn,</hi> knight,<note place="margin">NEW HOUSE, 1631.</note> gave to the houſe a very handſome addition; a ſquare maſs, conſiſting of ſix bed-chambers, a very large eating-room, and a dining-room or drawing-room above, with a large bow-window in the middle of each. In that below are the arms of <hi>Gwynne</hi> and <hi>D'Arcy,</hi> well emblazoned on glaſs. Theſe are complimentary to two great alliances; the one of Sir <hi>Roger</hi> himſelf with <hi>Mary,</hi> daughter of the famous Sir <hi>John Wynne,</hi> of <hi>Gwydir;</hi> the other out of reſpect to the alliance with <hi>Bridget Savage,</hi> daughter of <hi>D'Arcie Savage,</hi> 
                     <abbr>eſq</abbr> of <hi>Leighton,</hi> in <hi>Cheſhire,</hi> by whom the family acquired the great eſtates they poſſeſs in that county. From the principal gate of the park they have the pleaſing view of thoſe of <hi>Beeſton,</hi> and thoſe above <hi>Parkgate.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>OPPOSITE to this window is a fire-place ſuitable to the room. Above are the arms of the numerous alliances of the houſe,

Two <hi>Termini</hi> ſupport the entablature of this genealogical table. The other ornaments are elegant; but unfortunately, as if to daſh the mirth of the company, the architect has added, in full view, the monumental croſs-bones and bared ſkull.</p>
                  <p>AT the upper end of the room are two fine portraits by <hi>Mytens,</hi> full lengths. One is of Sir <hi>Roger Moſtyn,</hi> knight, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned at p. 17. His face is an excellent repreſentation of the <hi>viridis ſenectus,</hi> his countenance florid, his peaked beard of ſtrong whiteneſs. On his head is a black cloſe cap, turned up with <hi>Flanders</hi> lace; round his neck a flat large ruff; his whole dreſs beſides is black; round the waiſtband of his great breeches is a girdle ſtuck with points. This piece of magnificence gave riſe to a very coarſe proverb, applicable to inferior people, ambitious of acting beyond their ſtation. Round his knees are ſimilar gir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles.

His boots are large, and of white leather, turned down at top, and ornamented in the ſame finical manner as the cap: ſuch was the foppery of the times, even in ſo manly a figure as was our knight of <hi>Moſtyn.</hi> But then he was in full dreſs, his ſpurs of fine gold, with vaſt ſpur-leathers. His right hand reſts on his ſtick, his left on a table covered with a carpet moſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirably painted; on it his hat, broad-brimmed, and with a moſt immoderate crown. The date on his portrait is 1634; his age 67. He died on <hi>Auguſt</hi> 18th, 1642, and was interred at <hi>Whiteford,</hi> on <hi>September</hi> the 1ſt.</p>
                  <p>HIS lady's neck (in a picture of the ſame date) is ornamented with a large ruff, ſingle and elevated; her right hand has in it a fan, and reſts on an elbow-chair; on a finger of her left hand is a ring, tied to her arm by ſeveral black ſtrings.</p>
                  <p>SHE is dreſſed in a handſome long gown, with a ſaſh up to her very arms, exactly like the no-waiſted fair of the preſent days. Her ſhape is contrived to have ſome degree of elegance, notwithſtanding ſhe ſeems to have been a large woman. I wiſh our modern <hi>embonpoints</hi> reſembled this lady. They ſeem to emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late in faſhion the form of a ſack of wool, bulging out on every ſide, undulating their plump graces, here and there, as motion gives occaſion. Over the mouth of the ſack ſeems to have been oftimes flung by accident a light horſeman's cap, or any other incongruity, inſtead of the venerable <hi>coeffure</hi> of the Lady <hi>Moſtyn,</hi> at the ſober age of forty-nine.</p>
                  <p>HIS ſon <hi>Roger,</hi> the firſt baronet, created <hi>Auguſt</hi> 3d, 1660,<note place="margin">SIR ROGER, FIRST BARONET.</note> is the middle figure of a picture of the moſt ridiculous compoſition. This diſtinguiſhed character is repreſented a kit-kat length, in a ſtrange long flaxen wig, a breaſt-plate, buff ſkirts, and antique
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0140800700:77"/>
                     <hi>Roman</hi> ſleeves; a negro holding his helmet. By him is his ſecond lady, <hi>Mary,</hi> eldeſt daughter of <hi>Thomas,</hi> lord <hi>Bulkeley,</hi> of <hi>Baron Hill.</hi> She is reading, with one hand on a ſkull, and her little lap-dog placed by her warlike huſband. His third wife is doubled up, and concealed behind the frame. This lady ſhewed ſuch a mercenary diſpoſition, and ſo miſchievous to the children of her predeceſſor, that one of the family affixed this ſtigma. I have taken a peep at her, and may pronounce her countenance to be truly ſymptomatic of her interior.</p>
                  <p>SIR <hi>Roger</hi> was a zealous loyaliſt. He raiſed a regiment in ſupport of the crown, conſiſting of fifteen hundred men, in twelve hours time, moſtly colliers. <hi>Whitelock,</hi> whoſe ſiſter had been married to Sir <hi>Thomas Moſtyn,</hi> of <hi>Kilken,</hi> in this county, knight, father to Sir <hi>Roger,</hi> ſpeaks of him in the following terms; notwithſtanding their principles, and the parts they took were widely different. 'Then the parliament forces (in 1643)' ſays the hiſtorian, at p. 78,
<q>took in <hi>Moſtyn-houſe,</hi> belonging to colonel <hi>Moſtyn,</hi> the governor of <hi>Flint;</hi> and in <hi>Moſtyn</hi> they took four pieces of ordnance and ſome arms.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>THIS colonel <hi>Moſtyn</hi> is my ſiſter's ſon, a gentleman of good parts, and mettle; of a very ancient family, large poſſeſſions, and great intereſt in that country; ſo that in twelve hours he raiſed 1,500 men for the king, and was well beloved there, living very nobly.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>THIS gentleman's loyalty coſt him and the family dear. He ſpent about ſixty thouſand pounds in the ſervice of his majeſty. His houſe of <hi>Moſtyn</hi> was plundered and ſtripped, ſo that he was obliged to retire to a ſmall houſe called <hi>Plas-ycha,</hi> about a mile diſtant from <hi>Moſtyn.</hi> The firſt was built by his grandfather, the

                  <p>SIR <hi>Roger</hi> had a great intimacy with <hi>Pyers Pennant,</hi> his cotem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary neighbor at <hi>Bychton.</hi> Both ſeem to have been boon companions, as is evident from the <hi>P. S.</hi> to the following cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious epiſtle:

This affair gave occaſion to a thouſand controverſies: which ſide had the right is little worth enquiry. Mr. <hi>Miſſon</hi> enters deeply into it, ſee vol. ii. p. of his <hi>Travels.</hi>

He takes the affirmative part, and gives us an engraving of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous chair (ſee tab. vii. p. 119) on which every pope, after the cruel deception, is obliged to ſit. It has in the middle a hole like that of a <hi>ſelle-percée,</hi> on which the new pope is obliged to ſit <hi>ſans culottes,</hi> and the youngeſt deacon to make a report that his holineſs has not impoſed on the <hi>catholic</hi> world.</p>

                        <hi>Chroniques de Jean Froiſſart, en deux livres, avec figures.</hi> Folio, vell. illum.—A very fair and antient manuſcript, with the hiſtory of every chapter curiouſly painted in gold and water-colors.

                     <p>THE fronteſpiece to this volume is a battle, with a town at a diſtance. The <hi>French</hi> appear victorious; their cavalry driving be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them that of the fugitive <hi>Engliſh.</hi> I compared the text of this valuable MS. with the <hi>French</hi> edition, printed at <hi>Lyons</hi> in 1559, and the famous tranſlation by Sir <hi>John Berniers,</hi> lord <hi>Bourchier,</hi> done in 1525, and find both vary in language, but not in ſenſe, from this manuſcript. Another volume of the firſt and ſecond books, equally beautiful, is to be found in the <hi>Gloddaeth</hi> library; which I thus deſcribe in my <hi>Tour in Wales,</hi> ii. p. 337.
<q>The fronteſpiece repreſents the author on his knees, in a blue man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, preſenting his book to <hi>Edward</hi> III. A king of <hi>France,</hi> diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed by the <hi>fleurs-de-lis</hi> on his robes, holds a queen by the hand, who, from the arms of <hi>England,</hi> and the lions on her robe, ſeems to be queen <hi>Philippa,</hi> to whom <hi>Froiſſart</hi> was clerk of the cloſet. She holds by the hand a little boy, whoſe robe is alſo marked with the lions.

                        <hi>Maximiliam</hi> I. was born in 1459. He firſt married, in 1477, <hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>Burgundy.</hi> After her death he married by proxy <hi>Ann</hi> of <hi>Bretagne:</hi> but <hi>Charles</hi> VIII. of <hi>France</hi> actually married her in perſon, and in conſequence added her dominion to that of his ſucceſſors. The illuminations are very beautiful. His own portrait is the firſt, ſitting in a rich chair, at a table, with his pen in his hand. That of his chriſtening is the next. In another he is inſtructed in the art of beleaguering. A fourth places him in his ſtudy, drawing figures aſtrological, calculating ſome great event. From the king to the cobler, every one was in thoſe ages an aſtrologer.—Conſult <hi>Sully,</hi> 410 edit. i. 78.81.382.530.</p>

                        <pb n="78" facs="tcp:0140800700:93"/>ONE ſide of the ſtudy is filled with books, moſtly claſped, with their faces outwards, the leaves gaily painted. Above <hi>Maximi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> are his croſs-bows, his bows and arrows, the inſtruments of the chace; and by them his art in muſic is expreſſed by the lute. On the floor is ſhewn the objects of his various ſtudies. That of artillery, by two golden cannon. Of painting, by the grinding-ſtone for colors, and the pallet. Of huſbandry, by a hoe. Of his ſkill in the arts of the carpenter and joiner, by the ax, plane, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. Of the ſmith, by the iron anvil.—A more curious illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination is not to be found!</p>
                     <p>IN one or other of them are depicted the deeds of his buſy life. His amuſements in the chace are given in various draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; ſuch as that of the bear, the boar, the ſtag, the chamois, and <hi>ibex.</hi> The ſcenery of vaſt rocks and precipices, and the manner of the chaſſeurs overcoming all difficulties, make this a moſt curious delineation. There is one ſhewing him employed in falconry. Tilts ending moſt fatally, and as cruelly as ſhows of gladiators, next are exhibited. His marriage, and his being inſtructed in virtuous gallantry with the ladies of the court, and the maids of honor, all true <hi>Platonic</hi> lovers. <hi>Maximilian</hi> was alſo great in the field. <hi>Voltaire</hi> tells us that prince introduced the arms of the <hi>Macedonian</hi> phal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>Venlo,</hi> and defended it valiantly againſt <hi>Maximilian,</hi> who ſoon reduced her to ſubmit to his mercy.—Let this cloſe his glorious life.

It is adorned with a fronteſ-piece, and various head-pieces, from paintings by Sir <hi>James Thornhill,</hi> and others, engraven by <hi>Vander Gutch, de Boſche,</hi> &amp;c. The ridiculous miſtake is in the running-title to the twentieth chapter of St. <hi>Luke;</hi> in which 'Parable of the vineyard' is printed 'Parable of the <hi>vinegar;</hi>' and on that account the edition is better known by the name of the <hi>Vinegar Bible,</hi> than any other.</p>

Whether this was purely <hi>Roman,</hi> or whether it might not have been common to both nations, I will not diſpute. The uſe was that of a baldric, to ſuſpend gracefully the quiver of men of rank, which hung behind, by means of the hook; and the golden wreath croſſed the breaſt, and paſſed over the ſhoulder. <hi>Virgil,</hi> in his beautiful deſcription of the exerciſes of the <hi>Trojan</hi> youth, expreſſes the manner, in theſe frequently miſconſtrued lines:

The wealth which <hi>Louis</hi> had acquired was conſiderable. Above ſixteen hundred pounds paſſed through my hands.

Death ſoon put the lawyer in poſſeſſion of the principal. I lament this; for I had been left by him reſiduary legatee and ſole executor, with a power to diſpoſe of the remainder (all legacies paid) in charitable uſes. Thus a thouſand pounds were loſt to <hi>Whiteford</hi> pariſh.

Many pious men I have ſeen offer up at ſhort ejaculation in our <hi>Welſh</hi> churches (even when alone) to the Almighty Being, to whoſe ſervice they were founded, and in whoſe praiſe we all unite. A few monumental marks of reſpect are to be ſeen, and three on the north wall not inelegant.</p>
                        <p>ALL are ſmall. The firſt has the figure of a man and woman kneeling on oppoſite ſides of a deſk. Two ſons are behind the man, and three daughters behind the woman, in the ſame at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes. They are moſt neatly engraven on a tablet of white marble, and the whole included in a very neat frame. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription gives their brief tale:

tablet. Above is the creſt, and on the entablature, MORTUUS VIVO. The inſcription follows:

                        <p>ON a braſs plate, now covered with the <hi>Downing</hi> ſeat, is a memorial of <hi>Morris Kyffin,</hi> of <hi>Maenan,</hi> who died (a youth) <hi>June</hi> 2d, 1610, at <hi>Bychton,</hi> on a viſit to his ſiſter <hi>Jane,</hi> wife to <hi>Pyers Pennant.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>THE next townſhip to the village is in <hi>Whitford Garn.</hi>
                           <note place="margin">GARREG.</note> In this townſhip is <hi>Garreg,</hi> or <hi>The Rock,</hi> the higheſt land in the pariſh; it is a large incloſed hill, the property of Sir <hi>Roger Moſtyn.</hi> Part of it is a fine turf, and excellent ſheep-walk;

the ſummit, and part of the ſides, rocky. From <hi>Whiteford</hi> to the top is a continual aſcent. From this height the traveller may have an auguſt foreſight of the lofty tract of <hi>Snowdon,</hi> from the crooked <hi>Moel Shabog,</hi> at one end, to the towering <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maen-mawr</hi> at the other; of the vaſt promontory of <hi>Llandudno,</hi> and part of the iſle of <hi>Angleſea,</hi> with the great bay of <hi>Llanddulas,</hi> forming an extenſive creſcent; the eſtuaries of the <hi>Dee</hi> and the <hi>Merſey;</hi> and to the <hi>North</hi> (at times) the iſle of <hi>Man</hi> and the <hi>Cumberland Alps,</hi> the frequent preſages of bad weather.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">PHAROS.</note>THE <hi>Romans</hi> took advantage of this elevated ſituation, and placed on its ſummit a <hi>Pharos,</hi> to conduct the navigators to and from <hi>Deva,</hi> along the difficult channel of the <hi>Seteia Portus.</hi> The building is ſtill remaining. It is tolerably entire; its form is circular; the inner diameter twelve feet and a half; the thickneſs of the walls four feet four inches. The doors, or entrances, are oppoſite to each other; over each is a ſquare funnel, like a chimney, which opens on the outſide, about half-way up the building. On each ſide is a window. About four feet from the ground are three circular holes, lined with mortar, as is frequent in <hi>Roman</hi> buildings; and penetrate the whole wall, for purpoſes now unknown.</p>
                        <p>WITHINSIDE are the veſtiges of a ſtair-caſe, which led to the floors, of which there appear to have been two. Along ſuch part of the upper, which was conſpicuous from the channel, are eight ſmall ſquare openings, caſed with free-ſtone (the reſt of the building being of rude lime-ſtone, bedded in hard mortar) and each of theſe were ſeparated by wooden pannels, placed in deep grooves, the laſt ſtill in a perfect ſtate. In each of theſe

                        <p>TO the building is very evidently a broad and raiſed road, pointing from the eaſt; and near its upper end are the marks of a trench, which ſurrounded and gave protection to this uſeful edifice. It certainly had in later times been repaired, or perhaps applied to ſome other uſe, for in one part is a piece of timber which could not have been aboriginal.</p>
                        <p>THE curious croſs called <hi>Maen Achwynfan,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">MAEN ACHWYN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FAN.</note> or the ſtone of lamentation, ſtands in a ſmall field oppoſite to the gate which opens from the turnpike-road into <hi>Garreg.</hi> It takes its name, in all probability, from the penances, which were often finiſhed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuch ſacred pillars; attended with weeping, and the uſual marks of contrition: for an example, near <hi>Stafford</hi> ſtood one called the <hi>weeping croſs,</hi> a name analogous to ours. This is of an elegant form and ſculpture; is twelve feet high, two feet four inches broad at the bottom, and ten inches thick. The baſe is let into another ſtone. The top is round, and includes, in raiſed work, the form of a <hi>Greek</hi> croſs. Beneath, about the middle, is another, in the form of St. <hi>Andrew</hi>'s: and under that, a naked figure, with a ſpear in his hand. Cloſe to that, on the ſide of the column, is repreſented ſome animal. The reſt is covered with very beautiful fret-work, like what may be ſeen on other pillars, of antient date, in ſeveral parts of <hi>Great Britain.</hi> I do not preſume (after the annotator on <hi>Camden</hi> has given up the point) to attempt a gueſs at the age; only muſt obſerve, that
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:0140800700:136"/>
it muſt have been previous to the reign of groſs ſuperſtition among the <hi>Welſh,</hi> otherwiſe the ſculptor would have employed his chizzel in ſtriking out legendary ſtories, inſtead of the elegant knots and interlaced work that cover the ſtone.</p>
                        <p>THOSE, who ſuppoſe it to have been erected in memory of the dead ſlain in battle on the ſpot, draw their argument from the number of adjacent tumull, containing human bones, and ſculls often marked with mortal wounds; but theſe earthy ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchres are of more antient times than the elegant ſculpture of this pillar will admit. This likewiſe (from the croſſes) is evidently a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> monument. The former were only in uſe in pagan days.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">GELLI.</note>THERE is likewiſe, near to it, an antient chapel, now a farm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, called <hi>Gelli,</hi> or the <hi>Hazel-grove,</hi> the name of an adjacent tract. This might have relation to the croſs; as well as a place for performance of divine ſervice to the abbot of <hi>Baſingwerk,</hi> who had a houſe at no great diſtance. This tract (mis-ſpelt by the <hi>Engliſh, Geteley,</hi>) with the wood (at that time on it) was granted by <hi>Edward</hi> I. to the abbot and convent, on the tenth of <hi>November,</hi> at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> before the death of our laſt prince. He alſo gave him power to grub up the wood; which by the nakedneſs of the place appears to have been done moſt effectually.</p>
                        <p>FARTHER to the weſt is another incloſed mountain called <hi>Glol.</hi> my own property; part is covered with hazels and large white-thorn trees (perhaps a continuation of the <hi>Gelli,</hi>) part is very <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="115" facs="tcp:0140800700:137"/>
this incloſure are often ſeen vipers, which always prefer the dry and ſunny parts of a country.</p>
                        <p>ON <hi>Sarn-Hwlkin,</hi> a little common to the eaſt of <hi>Glol,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">SARN-HWLKIN.</note> was a very long but low <hi>tumUlus,</hi> ſuppoſed by the vulgar to have been a <hi>giant's grave,</hi> from a tradition that one of our ſons of <hi>Anak</hi> had been there interred. It probably did cover the remains of ſome <hi>Britiſh</hi> heroes of the common ſize, who there found their grave, after ſome fierce action, I have before ſuppoſed to have happened before the place.</p>
                        <p>THE townſhip of <hi>Tre'r-Abbot,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">TRE'R-ABBOT.</note> one of the eight which compoſe our pariſh, joins to this part of <hi>Tre-Moſtyn.</hi> In it ſtands the houſe of the ſame name, originally the country-ſeat of the abbots of <hi>Baſingwerk,</hi> but long ſince the property of the <hi>Davies's,</hi> lately ſold to <hi>Edward Jones,</hi> of <hi>Wepre,</hi>

                        <p>THIS townſhip was once exempted from the payment of tythes by a <hi>modus,</hi> originally granted by the abbot of <hi>Baſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werk,</hi> but which by negligence has been totally loſt.</p>

                           <note place="margin">MILES DAVIES.</note> produced a very extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary genius indeed! The talents of this eccentric gentleman were poetical.

                        <p>HAVING reached the fartheſt part of our pariſh, to the north-weſt, I return along the great heath <hi>Mynydd Tegen,</hi> or <hi>Tegen-Mountain,</hi> which yet preſerves the antient name of <hi>Tegengl,</hi> which comprehended the three modern hundreds of <hi>Coleſhill, Preſtatyn,</hi> and <hi>Rudland.</hi> It had been the property of <hi>Edwin,</hi> deſcended from <hi>Roderick</hi> the Great, and called prince of <hi>Tegengl.</hi> His <hi>Llys,</hi> or royal reſidence, was, in 1041, near <hi>Llaneurgan</hi> or <hi>Northop.</hi> This common, for I cannot call it mountain, ſtretches along the whole of the higher parts of our pariſh, and is covered with the <hi>erica vulgaris,</hi> or common heath. It feeds numbers of ſheep, and is part of the mineral tract of <hi>Flintſhire.</hi>

                        <p>ON the eaſt-ſide of <hi>Moſtyn</hi> pool, in <hi>Tegen</hi> mountain,<note place="margin">PLAS CAPTAIN.</note> is a grave bounded at each end by a rude ſtone, above four feet high.

On the head was a red cap, I think of velvet, and round his neck a ſilk handkerchief. By him lay his ſword, and his helmet; and beneath the ſkeleton two bullets, which had fallen out of the body on its diſſolution; all which verify the report of his having been ſlain in battle, or in ſome ſkirmiſh during the civil wars, and that he was interred, according to his wiſh, under the ſpot on which he fell. In a collection of pede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees lent to me by <hi>Thomas Gryffith,</hi> 
                           <abbr>eſq</abbr> of <hi>Rhual,</hi> I find this ſhort memorial of the captain, in the pedegree of his family: 'Capt. <hi>Edward Morgan,</hi> ſlain at <hi>Cheſhire</hi> raiſe.' If he was ſlain in that county, I cannot ſuppoſe that his body would have been carried ſo far; nor can I account for this relation, or for the body being found here, unleſs that the above is a miſtake, and that he fell in ſome ſkirmiſh near to his own houſe.</p>

                        <p>THIS ſemi-metal, and its ore, has been long known in <hi>India,</hi> and imported from thence in a metallic ſtate, under the name of <hi>tutenag,</hi> as early as the year 1647. It had even been fuſed in the <hi>Goſlar</hi> mines, as early as 1617. Yet the ſecret of its being an ingredient in making braſs, did not reach us till the year 1738; when it was communicated to us by Mr. <hi>Von Swob.</hi> I refer to the learned Biſhop <hi>Watſon</hi>'s entertaining and inſtructive works, for a full account of this uſeful mineral. Let me here inform the reader from the ſame authority, (iv. p. 2.) that by the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident of the <hi>Dutch</hi> taking a <hi>Portugueſe</hi> ſhip laden with cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, we learn the origin of the name, it being derived from the <hi>Arabic, calaem,</hi> the ſame mineral as our <hi>calamine,</hi> which is

                           <note place="margin">MILL-DISTEMPER.</note>A MOST excruciating, and often fatal diſorder, frequently at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacks the miners who work in the hard veins of lead ore, or of black jack, or of ſuch as are ſolid and lodged between ſides, or immerſed in the rock. The diſorder is called the <hi>Felyn,</hi> from <hi>Felyn,</hi> a mill. It may be tranſlated into <hi>Mill-diſtemper,</hi> becauſe it was at firſt moſt frequent in the ſmelting-mills; but for a conſiderable time paſt has ceaſed in thoſe buildings; and that happineſs may be dated from the period in which lime has been uſed as a flux for the lead ores.</p>
                        <p>IN the mines it ariſes from the workmen being obliged to uſe the pick-axe in the hard veins to get the ore out. The mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute particles fly about, and are taken down into the ſtomach, and into the lungs. This occaſions a moſt obſtinate coſtiveneſs, attended with moſt dreadful pains, which have been known to laſt fourteen, and even twenty-one days, and attended with a ſtrong ſymptomatic fever.</p>

                              <hi>William Spencer,</hi> a miner, worked in <hi>Meilwr,</hi> (a mine near <hi>Holywell</hi>) in a cloſe confined ſituation, and where the ore was of a particular hard nature. He was attacked annually, during fifteen or ſixteen years, (uſually in the ſpring) with an acute pain in the pit of his ſtomach, extending itſelf downwards, with a griping pain in the bowels; and attended with a violent reaching, vomiting, coſtiveneſs, and teneſmus. His bowels and abdominal muſcles were much contracted, his pulſe feeble and low, he was ſubject to cold clammy ſweats, and an unuſual coldneſs of his extremities. In the efforts to vomit, he ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:0140800700:152"/>
parted with a quantity of bile; and in each evacuation I obſerved a depoſition of a number of particles of lead, by parting with which he found great relief. The coſtiveneſs continued ſometimes eight, nine, or ten days, notwithſtanding the repeated uſe of purgatives, (chiefly caſtor-oil, in large doſes, which I found to be the moſt effectual remedy). When this was got the better of, and a ſtool procured, I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in each evacuation a quantity of lead, by which, from the relief he obtained, his pulſe became better, the contraction of his bowels diſappeared, and likewiſe the cold clammy ſweats. In three or four days, and in the two laſt attacks, he felt a ſimilar acute pain in the lower part of his belly, attended with a ſcantineſs, pain, and difficulty in voiding his urine. I conſequently ſuſpected that ſome leaden particles might have found their way into the bladder, and gave him ſome diuretic medicines, as balſam of <hi>copaiba, gum-arabic,</hi> and oil of juniper. In the courſe of twenty-four hours his urine was voided much eaſier, and in greater quantity, and he parted with as much pure lead by urine as would lie on a ſhilling. He in the latter part of his days became aſthmatic, and weak, and died <hi>Nov.</hi> 30, 1754, in the 51ſt year of his age.</q>

                           <note place="margin">CHERT.</note>CHERT, which I have mentioned before, as being often the lodgement of the mineral veins, is the <hi>petroſilex,</hi> and <hi>lapis corneus,</hi> of <hi>Cronſtedt,</hi> i. 189. It is of a flinty nature, and the only one of that claſs we have in our county. Nodular flints, the attendant on chalks, are quite unknown here. This is in the neighborhood of lime-ſtone, as flints are concomitant with chalk. It is an opaque ſtone, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times plain, often varied with ſtripes. I have ſpoken of it as a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix of the ores. I now conſider it as uſeful in manufactures. It is frequently cut out of its quarries in great maſſes, and ſent to the pottery countries of <hi>Staffordſhire,</hi> firſt, for the purpoſes of form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtones to grind and comminute the calcined flints, which are the great ingredients in the ſtone ware; and I think it is itſelf calcined, and being homogeneous with the purer flints, ſerves alſo for the ſame purpoſes. Much of it is found in the midſt of our hills, ſinking, as I have ſaid, to depths unknown. In Sir <hi>Roger Moſtyn</hi>'s land, near <hi>Pen-yr-allt,</hi> where the upper part of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh hangs abrupt over the lower, it forms the broken precipitous front, and has been of late quarried out for exportation.

The duke of <hi>Rutland</hi> contents himſelf with five ſhillings <hi>per</hi> ton, as lord of the rock. The workmen have three ſhillings for raiſing.

I have mentioned the immenſity of the beds: but it is often found mixed with calamine and ore. Its uſes cannot be unknown to any, whether in building, whether for the purpoſes of agriculture. I am ſenſible its application is not extended as far as it ought to be; (but more of that under the article <hi>Rural Oeconomy.</hi>) Here I may ſay that it is the common flux uſed by the ſmelters in the fuſing the lead ores; which has taken off much of the noxious effect it formerly had on the ſmelters, who were engaged in the operation, and on the cattle who fed on the graſs within reach of the ſmoke.</p>
                        <p>ON the weſt ſide of <hi>Celyn</hi> rake, is a large ſtratum of a deep grey lime-ſtone, which, when calcined, makes, mixed with common lime, an excellent cement or terras, for works con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in water.

The ſtratum is in front univerſally changed in its diſpoſition, and run into a horrible maſs of red and black; often porous, in all parts very hard. In it is a hollow, a vein in which was lodged the pyritical matter that took fire, which continued burning by its own <hi>phlogiſton,</hi> (ſee Biſhop <hi>Watſon,</hi> i. 167, to p. 200.) and cauſed the phenomenon.

                        <p>I SHALL here introduce the mention of damps found in col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieries, which are not unfrequent,<note place="margin">A FIRE-DAMP.</note> and ſometimes act with amaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fury, and fatal conſequences. There are two ſpecies, the ſuffocating, and the fire. The laſt is very rare in the lead-mines, unleſs in thoſe parts where the <hi>ſhale,</hi> or ſtone attendant on coal, begins. The firſt kills inſtantaneouſly, by its mephitic vapor, and is a diſaſter common to neglected vaults, and draw-wells. The other is inflammable, and burns and deſtroys in a dreadful man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as the colliers, through negligence in not ſetting fire to the vapor before it gets to a head, do often experience. The moſt tremendous inſtance was on <hi>February</hi> 3d, 1675, in a coal-work at <hi>Moſtyn,</hi> which I ſhall relate from the <hi>Philoſophical Tranſactions;</hi> and ſo conclude the account of our mineral concerns.</p>
                        <p>
                           <q>THE damp had been perceived for ſome time before, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling fiery blades, darting and croſſing each other from both ſides of the pit. The uſual methods were taken to free the pit from this evil. After a ceſſation of work for three days, the ſteward, thinking to fetch a compaſs about from the eye of the pit that came from the day, and to bring wind by a ſecure way along with him, that, if it burſt again, it may be done without danger of men's lives, went down, and took two men
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:0140800700:162"/>
along with him, which ſerved his turn for this purpoſe. He was no ſooner down, but the reſt of the workmen that had wrought there, diſdaining to be left behind in ſuch a time of danger, haſted down after them; and one of them, more indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet than the reſt, went headlong with his candle over the eye of the damp pit, at which the damp immediately catched, and flew up, to and fro, over all the hollows of the work, with a great wind, and a continual fire; and, as it went, keeping a mighty great roaring noiſe on all ſides.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>THE men, at firſt appearance of it, had moſt of them fallen upon their faces, and hid themſelves as well as they could, in the looſe ſlack, or ſmall coal, and under the ſhelter of poſts; yet nevertheleſs, the damp returning out of the hollows, and drawing towards the eye of the pit, it came up with incredible force; the wind and fire tore moſt of their clothes off their backs, and ſinged what was left, burning their faces and hands; the blaſts falling ſo ſharp on their ſkin, as if they had been whipt with cords. Some that had leſs ſhelter were carried fifteen or ſixteen yards from their firſt ſtation, and beaten againſt the roof of the coal, and ſides of the poſts, and lay afterwards a good while ſenſeleſs, ſo that it was long before they could hear or find one another. As it drew up to the day-pit, it caught one of the men along with it that was next to the eye; and up it comes, with ſuch a terrible crack, not unlike, but more ſhrill, than a cannon, that was heard fifteen miles off, with the wind, and ſuch a pillar of ſmoke as darkened all the ſky over-head for a good while. The brow of the hill above the pit was eighteen yards high, and on it grew trees of fourteen or fifteen
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:0140800700:163"/>
yards long; yet the man's body, and other things from the pit, were ſeen above the tops of the higheſt trees, at leſt 100 yards. On this pit ſtood a horſe-engine, of ſubſtantial timber, and ſtrong iron-work; on which lay a trunk, or barrel, for winding the rope up and down, of above 1000 pounds weight; it was then in motion, one bucket going down, and the other coming up full of water. This trunk was faſtened to that frame with locks and bolts of iron; yet it was thrown up, and carried a good way from the pit; and pieces of it, though bound with iron hoops and ſtrong nails, blown into the woods about; ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe were the two buckets; and the ends of the rope, after the buckets were blown from them, ſtood awhile upright in the air like pikes, and then came leiſurely drilling down. The whole frame of the engine was ſtirred and moved out of its place; and thoſe men's clothes, caps, and hats, that eſcaped, were afterwards found ſhattered to pieces, and thrown amongſt the woods a great way from the pit.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>ANOTHER of theſe damps happened in the ſame lands within my memory. In the year 1751,<note place="margin">ANOTHER IN 1751.</note> one man was beat to pieces in the bottom of the pit. Two others were taken up alive, but died ſoon after; and two others ſurvived, but were moſt dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully burnt: and one who is now living, remains a dreadful evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the effects of the damp. All his fingers burnt off, and his viſage terribly disfigured.</p>
                        <p>I SHALL here deſcribe agitations of the earth derived from other cauſes, which,<note place="margin">EARTHQUAKES.</note> dreadful as they have been in diſtant coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, have here occaſioned little more than a momentary alarm. I have at this houſe felt four ſhocks of the earthquake. I ſhall
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:0140800700:164"/>
relate their effects, from the <hi>Philoſophical Tranſactions,</hi> in which they are recorded. On <hi>April</hi> 2d, 1750, between the hours of ten and eleven at night, I was greatly alarmed with a violent ſhock of an earthquake. I, who was in bed, was frequently moved up and down; and the bed, having caſtors, was removed ſome ſmall ſpace from its proper ſituation.</p>
                        <p>DURING the ſhock, a great noiſe was heard in the air; and, ſome nights before, lights were ſeen in the ſky; ſuch as were previous to the earthquake in town.</p>

                              <p>It is very ſingular, that in three days after my return home, I ſhould be reminded of my promiſe by a repetition of the very phenomenon on which I had engaged to write to you: for on <hi>Saturday</hi> laſt, between four and five in the evening, we were alarmed with two ſhocks of an earthquake; a ſlight one, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately followed by another very violent. It ſeemed to come from the north-eaſt, and was preceded by the uſual noiſe. At preſent I cannot trace it farther than <hi>Holywell.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>THE earthquake preceding this was on the 29th of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> 1780, about a quarter before nine in the morning. I was fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warned of it by a rumbling noiſe, not unlike the coming of a great waggon into my court-yard. Two ſhocks immediately followed, which were ſtrong enough to terrify us. They came
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:0140800700:165"/>
from the north-weſt; were felt in <hi>Angleſea,</hi> at <hi>Caernarvon, Llan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rwſt,</hi> in the vale of <hi>Clwyd</hi> ſouth of <hi>Denbigh,</hi> at this houſe, and in <hi>Holywell;</hi> but I could not diſcover that their force extended any farther.</p>
                              <p>THE next, in this retrograde way of enumerating theſe pheno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena, was on the 8th <hi>September,</hi> 1775, about a quarter before ten at night. The noiſe was ſuch as preceded the former; and the ſhock ſo violent as to ſhake the bottles and glaſſes on the table round which myſelf and ſome company were ſitting. This ſeemed to come from the eaſt. I ſee in the <hi>Gentleman's Maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zine</hi> of that year, that this ſhock extended to <hi>Shropſhire,</hi> and quite to <hi>Bath,</hi> and to <hi>Swanſea</hi> in <hi>South Wales.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>THE earlieſt earthquake I remember here was on the 10th of <hi>April,</hi> 1750. It has the honor of being recorded in the <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophical Tranſactions;</hi> therefore I ſhall not trouble you with the repetition of what I have ſaid.</p>
                              <p>PERMIT me to obſerve, that I live near a mineral country, in a ſituation between lead-mines and coal-mines; in a ſort of neutral tract, about a mile diſtant from the firſt, and half a mile from the laſt. On the ſtricteſt inquiry I cannot diſcover that the miners or colliers were ever ſenſible of the ſhocks under ground: nor have they ever perceived, when the ſhocks in queſtion have happened, any falls of the looſe and ſhattery ſtrata, in which the laſt eſpecially work; yet, at the ſame time, the earthquakes have had violence ſufficient to terrify the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the ſurface.</p>
                              <p>TO this obſervation I may add, that no eruptions of water were ever obſerved to follow the ſhocks; no water from the vaſt
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:0140800700:166"/>
reſervoirs of that element, formed in the deſerted pits, which have often burſt through the hollow which contained them, and more than once drowned the unhappy colliers who have been working beneath.</p>
                              <p>I HAVE ſeen in prints an obſervation of ſome gentleman learned in earthquakes, that the cauſe of thoſe I have mentioned, which leave the ſhattery ſtrata of the coal-mines unaffected, to have been electricity, which in theſe inſtances moved equally and gently, ſo as not to cauſe any concuſſion, or to go perhaps far below the ſurface, ſo that they leave the worked depths totally untouched.</p>
                              <p>NONE of theſe earthquakes were local; for, excepting the firſt, all may be traced to very remote parts. The weather was remarkable ſtill at the time of every earthquake I have felt.</p>

It is the property of Sir <hi>Roger Moſtyn,</hi> and uſed on his noble demeſn, which is kept in admirable order. I muſt not conceal, that Sir <hi>Roger</hi> would be the beſt farmer in the pariſh, if he was permitted to have his own way: but no one can be ignorant of the tenacity of ſervants to old cuſtoms, and the difficulty of over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming ingrafted obſtinacy.</p>

The reſt is exported to <hi>Leverpool,</hi> to ſupply the county of <hi>Lancaſhire</hi> with bread, that vaſt county not being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive of much wheat.

Without ſuch means of ſale, or, we may call it, exchange of commodities, the great farmer would ceaſe to plough, would ceaſe to form thoſe magazines of corn, on which, at all times, our markers depend, and which are the great preſervative from famine in theſe kingdoms. At times, bad ſeaſons occaſion bad crops, and of courſe enhance the price. An inordinate luſt of gain may ſometimes occaſion criminal confederacies; which, criminal as they are, have hitherto baffled every attempt of the legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature to prevent.

At preſent a calamitous war aſſiſts that evil; but ſurely we cannot grudge food to our brave countrymen, who are fighting for all that is dear to us. Among them we may have neighbors, ſons of tenants, our own ſons, or different relations: to whom, if we think a moment, we ſhould be aſhamed to deny a ſhare in the produce of the labor of their native country, in which it is poſſible they themſelves might have bore a ſhare.</p>

Our greateſt farm is rented at £. 110 <hi>per ann.</hi> at the rate of about 14 <hi>s. per</hi> acre. Our ſmall farms have from 20 to 10 acres; and the rent <hi>per</hi> acre from 12 <hi>s.</hi> to 7 <hi>s.</hi> There may be in every pariſh inſtances of the exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant raiſe of rent: an evil moſt frequently originating in the luxury of the landlord. Our rents are moderate, becauſe our gentry would bluſh to add one diſh to their table at the expence of the tenant. Mr. <hi>Wedge,</hi> in his <hi>Survey of Cheſhire,</hi> p. 72, ſpeaks humanely and ſenſibly on the affected maxim of
<q>high rents being a ſpur to induſtry.</q>
This (for I muſt help Mr. <hi>Wedge</hi> with a ſimile) reſembles the practice of the prudent planter, who wiſhes to quicken the induſtry of his negroes by the invigorating appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the cart-whip to their velvet ſkin.</p>
                        <p>IN reſpect to leaſes, the utility is not perfectly agreed on. In our parts of <hi>North Wales</hi> I have known leaſe-tenants of very mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate rent continue on their farms their whole term without ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs: and I know in this pariſh, and within a ſmall diſtance, ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral rack-rent tenants, with large farms, the moſt proſperous of any in the country. They improve boldly, and reap amply the fruits of their induſtry. They have confidence in their landlords, nor can they recollect more than one inſtance (and that indeed diſgrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful enough <note n="*" place="bottom">Survey of North Wales, <hi>article</hi> Denbighſhire, <hi>p. 17.</hi>
                           </note>) in which they found it miſplaced. They are maſters
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:0140800700:191"/>
of the knowlege of the ſoil, and the nature of the climate of their own country. The appearance of their tenements does them credit. When they heard of a perſon ſent among them to inculcate the principles of good farming, they ſmiled at the deſign, but ſpoke with gratitude of the kind intent of the <hi>Board of Agriculture. Denbighſhire</hi> has long had its little board, for <hi>North Wales</hi> does not neglect its own intereſts. An agricultural ſociety has, for a number of years, been eſtabiſhed in the vale of <hi>Clwyd.</hi> None who have viſited that beautiful tract can deny the general excellency of its culture.</p>
                        <p>IN <hi>Cheſhire</hi> the antient practice of leaſing is growing faſt out of uſe: and agriculture will increaſe in that county in proportion.</p>
                        <p>MR. <hi>George Kay,</hi> of <hi>Leith,</hi> the miſſionary to whom was commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the inſpection of every farm in the ſix counties of <hi>North Wales,</hi> favored me with a call ſome time in the laſt ſummer, and delivered to me his credentials from Sir <hi>John Sinclair.</hi> I was really at the time out of ſpirits. At the ſame time, a report was circulated, that the object of the miſſion was to aſcertain the reality of our land-tax; which was much credited by my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen. I was certain that the report was entirely unfounded; but I did not chuſe to trouble myſelf with militating againſt what I knew muſt ſpeedily become ſelf-confuted. I treated Mr. <hi>Kay</hi> with all civility. He left me, and I believe, through all his journey, (one place excepted) had no reaſon to complain of the reception he met with. Sir <hi>John Sinclair</hi> is a man of honor. He had not the leſt occaſion to give himſelf the trouble of making to me ſo earneſt an aſſeveration of the purity of his intentions, as he did in his laſt favor. He is above taking clandeſtine means of getting at any kind of information.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="167" facs="tcp:0140800700:192"/>WE lament that Mr. <hi>Kay</hi> did not ſee, in any one of our ſix counties, a ſingle cuſtom that could be uſeful to others <note n="*" place="bottom">Hints for Improvements in North Wales, <hi>p. 40.</hi>
                           </note>. From the ſtate of numbers of our farms, I ſuſpect that we had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viouſly adopted many methods of agriculture from <hi>Engliſh</hi> coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which muſt have occaſioned his remark. I would fain pay that compliment to his candour. On the whole, I fear that the miſſion has paſſed moſt unprofitably to both <hi>viſitor</hi> and <hi>viſitè.</hi> Nothing ſeems to have been learned by the one, and nothing taught by the other.</p>
                        <p>WE thatch our hay-ricks with admirable neatneſs, and in that manner preſerve the hay for years. I do not know a better expedient, even could the landlord afford to every little farm a hay-barn, or give them a moveable canopy, which is liable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually to be out of order. Neceſſity in every country cauſes different modes of oeconomy. Send <hi>Shenkin ap Morgan</hi> on a ſurvey of <hi>Cathneſs,</hi> and he would at firſt ſtare at the <hi>bykes</hi> 
                           <note n="†" place="bottom">
                              <hi>Tour in Scotland,</hi> 1769. 3d ed. p. 201.</note>, but would admire the ingenuity of the contrivances, and acknowlege the wiſdom of the farmer in the preſervation of his grain, where other means were wanting.</p>
                        <p>THERE are, certainly, both beyond the <hi>Tweed,</hi> and beyond the <hi>Dee,</hi> many thouſands of acres, of which a tenant ſhould be court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to attempt the cultivation, and be bribed by leaſes to ſettle upon them. In <hi>North Britain</hi> the practice is common. In <hi>North Wales,</hi> our mountain landlords rarely grant leaſes, poſſibly from their not finding the neceſſity.</p>
                        <p>IN all the mineral part of <hi>Flintſhire</hi> are numbers of ſmall farms, tenanted by carriers, who entirely ſupport themſelves by the
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:0140800700:193"/>
carriage of the lead ore, and calamine or coal. Theſe are reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned the moſt ſlovenly farmers we have. They apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to carriage to ſuch a degree, as to neglect their tenements. The minerals are the great natural ſtaple of this, and moſt of the pariſhes; ſo that theſe ſpecies of farms are quite indiſpenſable.</p>
                        <p>LET not the little farmer, or the cottager, repine at the wealth of the great farmers. It is not many weeks ſince their empty ſtomachs have been filled from the hoards of the latter. Had they not been able to form a ſtock, or to enable by ſale others to do ſo, what would have become of you? The good, the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volent, have been able to purchaſe from them the food that has contributed to preſerve, for many months, you and your's from cruel want. The inſtances of the recent charities have not been equalled. I may ſpeak of the univerſal charities. But I will recal to your minds thoſe of your ſeveral neighborhoods. In public calamities little ſouls lie ſquat in their holes: great ſouls ariſe, and are called forth to action; ſome from a generous ſenſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, others from ſelfiſh motives. I cannot but confeſs myſelf to be among the latter. I am ſelfiſh enough to wiſh to put out my money at leſt on reverſionary intereſt, but that on ſecurity inconteſtible.

Our general manure is lime, burnt in ſod-kilns. The lime-ſtone, broken ſmall,<note place="margin">SOD-KILNS.</note> is placed within a thick circular wall of ſods, and the ſtrata of ſtone, broken ſmall, interlaid with beds of coal, which is ſet on fire by wood placed in certain holes left at the ſides. Theſe holes ſerve likewiſe to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the air, which promotes the fierceneſs of the fire within. The lime-ſtones are piled in a conic form, to a great height above the top of the ſod-wall, and then covered thickly with ſods. I muſt mention that the holes are four in number, placed oppoſite to each other, and have a gutter cut from one to the other, which is left hollow by means of flat ſtones over them, to promote the current of air. A circular gutter alſo runs cloſe to the interior ſide of the ſod wall. A common-ſized kiln will require about ſixteen tons of ſtone: but there are larger, and thoſe often of an oval form.</p>
                        <p>SOMETIMES the lime-ſtone is burnt in common kilns, then taken and carried to form a compoſt with earth, which had been depoſited in ſome adjacent place, and which uſually had been dug out of old ditches.

No light into the matter can be collected from the charters preſerved by Sir <hi>William Dugdale.</hi> There are three of them, either ſerving to confirm the antient donations, or confer new: in each is mention of the earl as a benefactor; but there is not the leſt hint of his having been the founder. I muſt attribute that honor to one of the princes of <hi>Wales;</hi> for both <hi>Lhewelyn ap Jor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werth,</hi> and his ſon <hi>David,</hi> in their reſpective charters recite, that they give and confirm the ſeveral donations to GOD, St. <hi>Mary,</hi> the monaſtery of <hi>Baſingwerk,</hi> and the monks, which had been beſtowed on them by their predeceſſors for the ſalvation of their ſouls.</p>
                  <p>RANDAL was certainly a great benefactor; for it appears, that before his days the monks had only a chapel here. From that period it became conſiderable; and about that time part of the preſent buildings were erected, for the conveniency of its inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, who were of the <hi>Ciſtercian</hi> order.</p>

on one ſide by hanging woods. In former times the ſacred ſtream hurried to the ſea unconfined by the buſy manufactures. During the reign of pilgrimages nothing but the corn-mills, the property of the monks, found employ for its waters.</p>

<pb n="207" facs="tcp:0140800700:221"/>
braſs are all at hand. The copper ſhot and clippings are from the adjacent works, the calamine from our own mines, and the charcoal from our woods. The art of making braſs in early times, is mentioned before at pp. 123, 124. The firſt patent for the calamine ſtone, and the uſe thereof, was granted to <hi>William Humſrey,</hi> and <hi>Chriſtopher Shutz,</hi> dated the 17th of <hi>September,</hi> 1565, at which time the long loſt art in theſe kingdoms began to revive.</p>
                  <p>IN digging the foundation for the braſs melting-houſes,<note place="margin">HYPOCAUST.</note> Mr. <hi>Donbavand</hi> diſcovered an antient <hi>Roman</hi> hypocauſt, furniſhed with various flues, with the ſuperincumbent tiles of a fine red color.

                  <p>NOT far from this work, on the eaſt-ſide of the river,<note place="margin">WIRE-WORK.</note> is the great manufactory of braſs wire of every denomination.

The largeſt and moſt commodious build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for the purpoſe it is applied to, of any in the kingdom. Its area within the walls meaſures eighty-ſix feet in length, by ſixty-nine in breadth, floored with iron flags. Its height in the center is twenty-eight feet and an half. The roof is ſingle, and covered with copper, ſupported in the center by two pillars, eleven feet and a half diſtant from each other; on their tops are tranſverſe timbers ſupporting one end of each beam which more immediately ſuſtains the roof, the other end reſting on the wall.</p>
                  <p>THE water-wheels are of caſt-iron, upon a curious conſtruction. They are three in number, each of which receives its ſupply of water, at a height of about forty-five degrees, from an iron-pipe fixed in the bottom of the penſtock, and ſo fitted to the buckets of the wheel, that ſcarce any water is waſted (of which we are ſtudiouſly careful.) Wheels ſo receiving their water are called <hi>breaſt-wheels,</hi> of which kind I believe all the wheels on this ſtream are, excepting that belonging to the corn-mill, and another at this company's braſs-works, which is uſed for grinding calamine; the water by that mode of delivery communicating the moſt powerful impulſe, and the moſt ſteady motion. The iron-wheels here are twenty feet diameter, and they will, when unclogged with
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:0140800700:223"/>
heavy weights, perform twenty revolutions in a minute. Now if we ſuppoſe a wheel of that diameter moving upon a plane with the ſame rapidity with which it revolves on its axis, it will, in a year, deſcribe a line nearly equal in length to five circles of our globe at the equator.

                     <p n="1">1ſt. IT is a certain fact that the people conſtantly employed in the copper-manufactories are as healthy, and arrive to as great an age, as the generality of people employed in other occupations not connected with fire or metal; but they are ſcrupulous ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervers of the antient law, which forbade to eat with unwaſhen hands; and they find it highly neceſſary to perform a careful ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of the whole body at leſt once a week, to rub off the cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per duſt, which adheres to their bodies, and occaſions violent eruptions of a green color, evincing, by the tinge, their origin. The pain and ſymptoms are eaſily removed by waſhing with clean water; but if that is neglected, the conſequences become ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, and even to require chirurgical aſſiſtance.</p>
                     <p n="2">2d. YOUNG dogs, which have acquired a habit of licking cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſheets or bars, have never been known to ſurvive long. The metallic virus by that means conveyed into the inteſtines ſoon deſtroys the animal by violent purging.</p>

                        <pb n="210" facs="tcp:0140800700:224"/>3d, YET it may deſerve notice, that the writer of theſe hints having formerly kept a great number of poultry running about the yard, he obſerved that the fowls preferred drinking the water from a ſhallow copper pan that lay out of doors, and was generally full of rain-water, tinged of a deep green color, to freſh clear water, of which there was abundance. No ill effect was ever known to have happened to them from the green water, though a ſucceſſion of poultry reſorted to it for years.</p>
                     <p>THE writer of this having been employed on the ſpot, from the firſt opening of the ground for the foundations of the mill and other buildings, found frequent proofs that the ſurface of the land had formerly been about fourteen or ſixteen feet lower than at the time the buildings were erected. His inducements to form that opinion were,</p>
                     <p n="1">1ſt. THAT though the ſoil contained many large pebbles throughout its whole depth, yet at the depth of twelve to ſixteeen or eighteen feet, grey pebbles of large ſize were every where found in great abundance, and mixed with ſand or gravel, juſt as they appear on the ſhelving ſhores of many rivers.</p>
                     <p n="2">2d. AT the depth of fifteen feet, under the wood where the warehouſe now ſtands, the head of a battle-axe was picked up. The writer not chancing to be on the ſpot when it was taken up, could gather no information whether any part of the handle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained, but ſuppoſes not. He was ſhewn the ſpot where it lay, and meaſured fifteen feet to the ſurface.</p>
                     <p n="3">3d. AND the moſt deciſive proof is, that, after cutting down an oak-tree of pretty large girth, and afterwards clearing away the root, in digging ſtill deeper, for the foundation of the preſent

                     <p>THE word <hi>latten</hi> is alſo uſed for a diſtinct metal, as appears by two patents, one of the 30th <hi>Henry</hi> VI. to his chaplain and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troller of all his mines of gold, &amp;c. in <hi>Devon</hi> and <hi>Cornwal,</hi> (ſee <hi>Stringer,</hi> p. 20.); the other in the patent of 10th <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> (ſee <hi>Watſon,</hi> iv. 70.) both which mention mines of <hi>latten.</hi> But, as the Biſhop obſerves, whatever the name did mean, it is now loſt.

If in foreign bottoms, a penny <hi>per</hi> pound is paid. About fifteen years ago, not more than five hundred bags were culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated in the <hi>Brazils;</hi> but of late years, on an average, fifty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand.

Each hank is 840 yards long, ſo that one pound of cotton thread thus fine will be 62 miles 80 yards long. The new principle (for it is not yet 30 years old) by which cotton wool is made ſo perfect a thread, is by the uſe of iron-rollers moving horizontally; their ſpeed is governed by braſs wheels of different ſizes and numbers, calculated to produce what fineneſs is wanted; the twiſt required is given by the flier and ſpindle. The cotton-twiſt made here is ſent chiefly into <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> to be woven into ginghams, muſlins, muſlinets, dimities, nankeens, fine callicoes, fuſtians, &amp;c. &amp;c. which goods, when finiſhed, are either admitted or ſmuggled into every part of the known world.

                     <p>ON one ſide of a wall that ſupports the roof, was painted the tale of the tutelar ſaint; at preſent almoſt defaced: over it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, <hi>in honorem Sanctae Wenefredae,</hi> V. &amp; M.</p>

                     <p>OVER this ſpring is a chapel,<note place="margin">CHAPEL.</note> of the ſame date with the other building: a neat piece of gothic architecture; but in a very ruinous ſtate. The eaſt end is a pentagon, and had five windows with elegant tracery. The top arched, and croſſed with neat ſlender ribs. It had been open to the body of the chapel; but the fine arch which formed the diviſion, has been bricked up a great number of years ago. On one ſide of the body is an oblong receſs, divided from it by three arches, ſupported by pillars; and within is a window impending over the well. Under the centre window muſt have ſtood the altar. The whole length of the chapel is fifty-two feet: the breadth is twenty. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs is twenty-ſix feet long, and eight broad. The roof is neat wood-work. This had been a free chapel, in the gift of the biſhop, with the reſerve of a ſtipend to the chapter; but the reſt of the offerings were to be expended on the chapel.

                     <p>THE window in this chapel impends a vaſt height over the bathing well.<note place="margin">CHAPEL WINDOW.</note> Several perſons (not in their ſober ſenſes) have leaped into the water, without receiving any other damage than the ſmart cauſed by the daſhing on the ſurface from their exalted ſtation. Within my memory, one <hi>John Blackwall,</hi> of <hi>Llanaſaph,</hi> took a far more deſperate leap into the ſame water, from the church-yard wall, almoſt adjoining to the chapel. The leap would have been great, had it been on level ground. Here, had he not reached the water, the conſequence would have been, that of being daſhed to pieces on the flags.</p>
                     <p>THE bathing-well is an oblong, 38 feet by 16, with ſteps for the deſcent of the fair-ſex, or of invalids.

ſent up at the ſame time a certain ejaculation, by way of charm: but the charm is forgotten, and the efficacy of the waters loſt.</p>
                     <p>THE well is common; for I find by a deciſion of the court of chancery, on a law-ſuit reſpecting the lordſhip of <hi>Holywell,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Sir <hi>John Egerton,</hi> knight, and <hi>John Eldred;</hi> chancellor <hi>Elleſmere</hi> decrees,
<q>That on calling to mind, that within the ſaid manor there is a fountain or well of antient and worthy memory, he doth not think fit that the petitioner, or any other, ſhould have the property thereof, notwithſtanding the general words of the grant of the manor: and therefore his lordſhip doth order, that notwithſtanding the ſaid grant, that the well ſhall-continue as now it is, or heretofore hath been; ſaving to the petitioner, and his heirs and aſſigns, the benefit of the ſtream and watercourſe, with the appertainances.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>THERE are two different opinions about the origin of this ſtream. One party makes it miraculous: the other aſſerts it to be owing only to natural cauſes. The advocates for the firſt, deliver their tale thus:</p>

I refer the reader to the arguments uſed by the antiquary Doctor <hi>Powel,</hi> in his notes on the Itinerary of <hi>Giraldus Cambrenſis,</hi> and to Biſhop <hi>Fleetwood</hi>'s annotations on the life of the ſaint, for proofs againſt the truth of the tale: but with Proteſtants, and temperate Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lics, it carries with it ſelf-confutation.</p>
                     <p>THE waters are indiſputably endowed with every good quality attendant on cold baths; and multitudes have here experienced the good effects that thus reſult from natural qualities, implanted in the ſeveral parts of matter by the divine Providence, in order to fulfil his will. Heaven for a ſhort period deigned to convince a dark and obdurate age with a ſeries of miracles; which were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered down to ſucceeding times, as inconteſtible proofs of the reality of the divine miſſion. Without them, a ſufficient ground of truſt and reliance upon the Supreme Being has long ſince been eſtabliſhed. Second cauſes innumerable are diſperſed throughout the univerſe, ſubordinate to the FIRST. Every element proves to us a medicine or a bane, as ſuits His unerring diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. We cannot want, we cannot have the mediation of poor departed mortals. The ſuppoſition would be beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on them the attributes of the Deity; omnipreſence and omniſcience.</p>
                     <p>SOME eminent botaniſts of my acquaintance have reduced the ſweet moſs, and the bloody ſtains, to mere vegetable produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, far from being peculiar to our fountain. The firſt is

Mr. <hi>William Chambers,</hi> of <hi>Holywell,</hi> has aſſured me that he has ſeen the penſtock and contiguous parts, which lie
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:0140800700:249"/>
always under water, in ſome parts pierced with a few holes, in others eaten quite thorough; and that the planks appeared, after the moſs was ſeparated, as if conſuming by the wet rot. He adds, that the moſs firſt adheres to the oaken planks, and then it is that the ſmall grubs eat into them; and in ſome parts quite penetrate, ſo that the moſs becomes ſeemingly the nurſery or receptacle of the grubs. The method uſed to preſerve the wheels, was by ſcraping the moſs off annually.</p>
                     <p>THIS account is corroborated by Mr. <hi>Robert Tart,</hi> a very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent maſter-carpenter, who ſays, that the wheels made of the beſt oak are deſtroyed remarkably ſoon by the <hi>Holywell</hi> ſtream. A wheel which ought to have laſted thirty years, has here been known to become unfit for uſe in about twelve. Mr. <hi>Tart</hi> recommends wheels made of pine or red deal, and that the ſurface of the wheels be paid with pitch, tar, and ruddle; but even this has proved ineffectual, for the water occaſions the mixture ſoon to peel away. Mr. <hi>Donbavand</hi> was ſo ſenſible of the evil, as to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute, inſtead of timber, wheels of caſt-iron in the works which he ſuperintends.</p>
                     <p>EDWARD DAVIES, an experienced wheel-wright, aged ſeventy-five, confirms the above; and adds that red deal periſhes in the ſame manner, but in a much ſlower degree, by reaſon of its reſinous qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. There have been formerly inſtances of oaken planks, which had laid long under water, being found as full of holes as if they had been eaten through by <hi>Norway</hi> rats; and were kept as curioſities by the late Meſſrs. <hi>Barker,</hi> of <hi>Brynmadin,</hi> or <hi>Gadlys.</hi>

                     <p>AN account of the tythes will be given in the Appendix, with thoſe of <hi>Whiteford</hi> pariſh.</p>
                     <p>THIS vicarage even wants a globe, unleſs we call the garden to the houſe by that name. Neither has it any other endowment, unleſs the ſhare of tithes mentioned in the Appendix, and an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition of Queen <hi>Anne</hi>'s bounty of two hundred pounds. This, in the time of the Rev. <hi>Ellis Price,</hi> vicar, received the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of two hundred more, which lay at intereſt till the laſt year, when, on the donation of a hundred and fifty pounds from <hi>Jeſus College,</hi> the whole was laid out in the purchaſe of a portion of the waſte lands in the pariſh of <hi>Kilken.</hi> An act had been paſſed in the year 1793, for the purpoſe of incloſing the common, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding it among the freeholders, and ſelling certain portions to defray the expences of the act, &amp;c &amp;c. &amp;c. One part was bought with the above ſums, and ſettled on the miniſter of <hi>Holywell</hi> and his ſucceſſors, in addition to their income; and ſay the activity of the preſent vicar, the ground has already been incloſed, drained, ploughed and ſown! The other ſupport of the vicars is the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient one,
<q>
                           <hi>oblationes altaris,</hi> among which are reckoned the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:0140800700:253"/>
at burials for the pious uſe of the prieſt, and the good eſtate of the ſoul of the deceaſed.</q>
(See <hi>Kennet's Parochial An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquities. Gloſſary.</hi>) Thoſe of <hi>Holywell</hi> pariſh amount, <hi>communibus annis,</hi> to eighty pounds.</p>
                     <p>THE vicarage houſe, about the middle of this century, became ſo ruinous as to be uninhabitable. In a few years it was rebuilt by the piety of two brothers, <hi>Thomas</hi> and <hi>John Barker,</hi> of <hi>Bryn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madyn,</hi> agents to the great ſmelting-company at <hi>Gadlys,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queathed to the vicar of <hi>Holywell</hi> 400<hi>l.</hi> for the purpoſe of build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a new glebe houſe at <hi>Holywell,</hi> for him and his ſucceſſors, on the ſame ſpot as that on which the old one ſtood. It was finiſhed in the year 1760, and, with the adjacent premiſes, has been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderably improved by the preſent vicar, the Reverend <hi>John Lloyd,</hi> and made a moſt comfortable reſidence.</p>
                     <p>NOT far diſtant, at the very foot of the hill, above the well,<note place="margin">CHURCH.</note> ſtands the pariſh church, placed in that inconvenient ſituation, out of reſpect to the guardian ſaint. It has only one bell, and that not to be heard at any diſtance; ſo that the congregation is aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled by a walking ſteeple, a man with a ſmall bell, who ſounds the notice through every ſtreet.</p>
                     <p>THE preſent church was rebuilt in 1769, on the ſite of the old, and of the ſame length and breadth, <hi>viz.</hi> the length ſixty-eight feet, the breadth fifty-ſix. It is difficult to aſcertain the antient archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecture of this church. Near the entrance, at the weſt-end, is a door-way, with an obtuſe <hi>gothic</hi> arch. The pillars, plain them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and with plain capitals, which ſupport the gallery on each ſide of the nave, are original; and by the ſpecimens given by Dr. <hi>Ducarel,</hi> in his <hi>Norman Antiquities,</hi> tab. xiii. appear to have
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:0140800700:254"/>
been in uſe among the <hi>Saxons</hi> and the <hi>Normans.</hi> The arches, which might have confirmed my ſuſpicion that the church was built in the <hi>Norman</hi> reign, are taken away, but the ſtyle con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued till about the year 1200. The church has a nave and two ailes, over which are two handſome galleries; and the whole is ſuppoſed to contain three thouſand people. It is plain, neat, and calculated for uſe.</p>
                     <p>SHOULD it be ever thought neceſſary to commemorate the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair of the church by an inſcription, I would venture to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the energetic lines inſcribed, on a ſimilar occaſion, on a church at <hi>Briſtol,</hi> adapting the date and third line to the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of that of <hi>Holywell.</hi>

<q>She was prudent, pious, and charitable; in the midſt of misfortunes ſhewed a great example of meekneſs and humility, of patience and reſignation to the will of GOD.</q>
With the beſt and moſt affectionate intent to improve the affairs of her ſon, ſhe engaged in a partnerſhip with a ſmelting-company in the neighborhood. The company failed; and the creditors, in an unrelenting manner, purſued the good lady till ſhe was obliged to take ſhelter in the iſle of <hi>Man;</hi> where ſhe died, on the 28th of <hi>February,</hi> 1750, aged forty, and was interred in the church at <hi>Douglas.</hi>

Adjoining, in a room of retreat, in the intervals of play, the perſons out, took their pipe and ale, or perhaps a ſmall bowl of punch: for in thoſe plain days wine was ſeldom called for, unleſs by the few with whom other liquors might diſagree <note n="*" place="bottom">

                     <p>IN the town are three places of worſhip beſides the church, two for the <hi>Roman Catholics,</hi> and one for diſſenters. The laſt was built on my ground, by leaſe dated <hi>April</hi> 16, 1788, and is maintained by voluntary contributions. Of the former, one ſupports a ſecular or pariſh prieſt. The other a gentleman of the late order of Jeſuits. Both of their cures are endowed with lands veſted in truſtees. Each of their houſes had been a ſpecies of hotel, probably de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for the reception of pilgrims of better rank. One was called the <hi>Croſs-keys,</hi> the other the <hi>Star.</hi> I remember at one or other of them <hi>Edward</hi> duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> and other viſitants of diſtinction.</p>

                     <p>IT is ſingular that no mention is made in the <hi>Doomſday-Book</hi> of either chapel, church, or well; yet townſhips now of leſs note are named; ſuch as <hi>Brunford, Caldecote,</hi> and others. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding biſhop <hi>Fleetwood</hi>'s opinion, I think the legend of St. <hi>Wenefrede</hi> was known previous to that ſurvey; for the very name of <hi>Holywell</hi> is <hi>Saxon,</hi> probably beſtowed on it before the Conqueſt, on account of the imputed ſanctity of the well.</p>
                     <p>THE ſpring is certainly one of the fineſt in theſe kingdoms; and, by the two different trials and calculations lately made for my information, is found to fling out about twenty-one tons of water in a minute. It never freezes. In reſpect to the equality of the water in droughts, or after the greateſt rains, I find I muſt place it among the vulgar errors. From the authority of Mr. <hi>Chriſtopher Smalley,</hi> and other reſpectable manufacturers on the ſtream, I diſcover that the variation is extremely great, and that there is a decreaſe in ſummer of more than one-third, and in great droughts of ſtill more, and after violent rains the increaſe is in like proportion: ſome even ſay it is one-half. As long as I remember, the fountain, after heavy falls of wet, became of a wheyey color. This is increaſed to a great degree, grows more turbid, and even depoſits a mud upon the ſtones.</p>

Every great farmer ſeems now to have taken the early part of his education in Change-Alley, and is as expert in prices of corn, as any academy of that noted place is in thoſe of ſtocks.

To ſuch who require the uſe of a cold-bath, few places are more proper; for, beſides the excellence of the waters, exceeding good medical aſſiſtance, and comfortable accommodations, may be found here; and the mind entertained, and the body exerciſed in a variety of beautiful rides and walks.</p>

This has in old times been very rich in ſeveral places.</p>
                     <p>THE old vein, or <hi>Pant Ithel,</hi> is another rich vein, which firſt
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:0140800700:271"/>
appeared in <hi>Pantaſa,</hi> and yielded great quantities of ore and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamine. From thence croſſes <hi>Butler's fields,</hi> and <hi>Pen-y-Bal,</hi> and then to <hi>Coetia fawr;</hi> from thence to <hi>Pant Ithel,</hi> where it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcends near <hi>

                           </gap>ynford</hi> houſe, and croſſes the road into <hi>Highgate</hi> te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nement, the property of Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> of <hi>Trelunnian.</hi> It then enters into my tenement called <hi>Meilwr,</hi> and was the firſt place in which ore was found in the level; the leaſe of which was granted by my father, on <hi>December</hi> the 20th, 1754.</p>
                     <p>THE next is the <hi>Highgate</hi> vein, which about <hi>Piſtill</hi> had branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into many ſtrings. As they advance from <hi>Piſtill</hi> eaſtward, they enter <hi>Highgate</hi> tenement, and become very productive, both in Mrs. <hi>Williams</hi>'s land, and alſo my own, which for many years poured on me in great abundance its mineral wealth. I never conſidered this ſpecies of riches but of the moſt precarious nature, liable inſtantly to fail: I therefore ſecured them on the beſt of tenures, and purchaſed with them the moiety of the <hi>Bagillt-Hall</hi> eſtate, which has turned out to me uncommonly fortunate. I alſo was enabled by another part to improve my houſe at <hi>Downing</hi> to what it now is.</p>
                     <p>EVERY thing has its end. The vein or veins at length grew poorer. A great fire-engine was erected a few years ago, in hopes of clearing the water, and getting at the ore which was ſuppoſed to have been left in the ſoles.</p>
                     <p>THE level begins at the bottom of the north ſide of <hi>Nant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill-brwc,</hi> and runs ſouth-weſt. How uncertain is mineral know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, even among the moſt knowing! The object of the leſſees was the working up to a certain rich vein, named the <hi>hard ſhaft,</hi> in the lands belonging to <hi>Brynfordd.</hi> An object that never
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:0140800700:272"/>
yet has been obtained. But in purſuit of that object they moſt unexpectedly met with the veins which produced ſo much wealth to Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> and myſelf. Perhaps I fall ſhort in my eſtimate if I ſay, that to leſſors and leſſees, the total amount muſt have exceeded a hundred thouſand pounds.</p>
                     <p>THE next vein to the <hi>high-gate,</hi> is a ſtring within five yards of the <hi>high gate,</hi> which his been very productive. Into the field called <hi>Coetia Yſcubor,</hi> the <hi>hard ſhaft</hi> vein is expected to enter, and croſs the whole breadth, into the ground of <hi>Pen y pylle.</hi> And at the very corner of the ſame field, another vein croſſes into the ſame land, and has been tolerably rich.</p>
                     <p>I NOW quit my mineral territories in this part of the country; and croſs over the road to <hi>Pen y pylle,</hi> the ſeat of <hi>Hugh Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phreys,</hi> eſquire, deſcended from <hi>Edwyn,</hi> prince of <hi>Tegengl.</hi> That gentleman has had large ſhare of the mineral wealth. The vein <hi>Reſt y cegin</hi> paſſes under his very houſe and garden. The mine-hillocks fill the land: but by his judicious walks and plantations, which now cover them, he has turned them into beauties. The vein continues to his grounds, below his houſe, and may probably be a ſource of new wealth.</p>
                     <p>THE <hi>Lucky Venture,</hi> is the laſt vein I can mention in this pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, which ranges from the mountain, and croſſes the road into a corner of a field of Mr. <hi>Humphreys,</hi> and immediately from thence into the land belonging to <hi>Edward Jones,</hi> eſquire, of <hi>Wepre,</hi> in which abundance of ore has been got.

                     <p>THE reſpectable company, long known by the name of the <hi>Governor and Company for ſmelting down Lead with Pit Coale and Sea Coale,</hi> by the royal charter, granted in the 4th of <hi>William</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> began buſineſs in this county about the year 1700. They flouriſhed with a moſt fair reputation for a great number of years, till their decline, either through want of ore, or other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitable cauſes, induced them to remove their antient furnaces to ſome works, built by the late Meſſrs. <hi>Smedley,</hi> on the bank above <hi>Bagillt.</hi> Thoſe they purchaſed; and continued ſmelting, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the direction of their agent, Mr. <hi>William Smith</hi>

                     <p>THE town of <hi>Shrewſbury,</hi> and I may ſay of every manufactur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing county, have ſucceeded to admiration in their attempts, and ſhould be examples to us.

We ſquires are leſs qualified for operations which require vigor and activity, but we can contribute countenance and power, equally eſſential to the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the deſign.

                        <note place="margin">VITRIOL-WORKS.</note>ON gaining the ſummit of this road, appears a vitriol-work, the property of Mr. <hi>Donbavand,</hi> placed under the care of Mr. <hi>John Jones,</hi> of <hi>Holywell,</hi> an able chymiſt. His operations are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to three articles: blue vitriol, or vitriol of copper, which is made by diſſolving copper in oil of vitriol or acid of ſulphur. After the ſolution has taken place, the produce is diſſolved in boiling water, evaporated down to a given weight, and put in coolers to evaporate.</p>
                     <p>THE uſe of this ſpecies of vitriol is in dying cottons of a green or olive color, and hats and woollen cloths black; and alſo for making green verditer for painting in oil or water-colors,<note place="margin">VERDITER.</note> by precipitation with whiting.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">SUGAR OF LEAD</note>THE laſt article is ſugar of lead, or <hi>ſaccharum ſaturni,</hi> which is lead diſſolved in diſtilled vinegar. When the vinegar is ſatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated with the lead, it is boiled down to a given weight, and, like the blue vitriol, is put in coolers to cryſtallize. For the purpoſe of making the wort for the vinegar, twelve hundred hobbets of barley or malt had been employed in a ſingle year; but in the late ſeaſon of ſcarcity the proprietor totally deſiſted from this branch of buſineſs.</p>
                     <p>SUGAR of lead is uſed in the cotton printing buſineſs, for fixing the colors in the ſtuff dyed or printed. Such I believe to be the ſole application of it from theſe works; but from others nearer to the capital I fear a moſt criminal one is frequently in practice, (for it is a moſt dangerous poiſon) I mean that of uſing it in the refining of white wines, or in reſtoring the ſweetneſs to ſuch which are grown ſour: for this drug is the ſweeteſt of all ſweet things. It occaſions to the drinkers of wines thus reſtored,
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:0140800700:283"/>
or rather thus endowed with the powers of poiſon, numbers of maladies they cannot account for, ſuch as colics, obſtinate coſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiveneſs, and paralytic affections of the limbs. Finally, we may add death itſelf. The fatal dinner at <hi>Salt Hill,</hi> on <hi>March</hi> 27th, 1773, which ended in the deſtruction of ſeveral gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, ſuppoſed to have been cauſed by wine impregnated with this fatal drug, has been much talked of. I believe that not to have been the caſe. The gentlemen did not ſicken till after ſeveral days. One (Mr. <hi>Pote,</hi> who had drank as the reſt did) never was infected. It happened that he walked in the garden during the time a moſt miſerable object, a pauper, had been examined, from whom the peſtilential <hi>miaſmata</hi> of a fever, probably of the nature of the jail-fever, had diffuſed themſelves among the company preſent; for all, except Mr. <hi>Pote,</hi> ſickened <note n="*" place="bottom">

In this inſtance the vintners may be cleared; but ſince it is probable that numbers of people fall victims to their art, I wiſh legiſlature would frame a law to condemn them, not to the halter, but to the more apt puniſhment of ſwallowing a competent draught of their own <hi>Stygian</hi> liquor. <hi>Nec lex eſt juſtior ulla!</hi>—Biſhop <hi>Watſon</hi> (iii. 369) ſays, that in <hi>Germany</hi> ſuch adulteration is puniſhed with death.

He is ninth in deſcent from the abbot, and third from <hi>Gifford Pennant,</hi> ſecond ſon of <hi>Edward Pennant,</hi> of <hi>Bagillt,</hi> by <hi>Catherine,</hi> daughter of <hi>Edward Kynaſton,</hi> of <hi>Otely,</hi> in the county of <hi>Salop.</hi> He went to <hi>Jamaica,</hi> in the time of <hi>Oliver Cromwel;</hi> had a grant of lands there <hi>November</hi> 5th, 1665; ſettled in the pariſh of <hi>Clarendon,</hi> and died in 1677. His lordſhip's property in that iſland is immenſe, and his addition to it in the county of <hi>Caernarvon,</hi> in this his native iſland, is very conſiderable, by his marriage with <hi>Anne Suſanna,</hi> daughter and heireſs of the late general <hi>Warburton,</hi> of <hi>Winnington,</hi> in <hi>Cheſhire.</hi> With ſingular fortune, by this match his lordſhip poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſes <hi>Penrhyn,</hi> the ſeat and eſtate belonging to the family of <hi>Angbarad,</hi> his diſtant anceſtreſs; from whom lady <hi>Penrhyn</hi> is by her grandmother alſo deſcended. All theſe fortunes they enjoy with dignity, and with utility to their numerous tenantry. I particularly allude to thoſe about <hi>Penrhyn,</hi> where he has made
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:0140800700:288"/>
his vaſt ſlate-quarries an object of admiration to travellers, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to himſelf, and the ſource of opulence to the ſurrounding country. I had not, at the publication of my <hi>Welſh Tour,</hi> oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of informing myſelf about theſe important works; I, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, give a brief ſketch of their hiſtory.</p>
                     <p>WHEN his lordſhip came to poſſeſſion of his fortunes in part of the iſland, he found great appearance of neglect and poverty among the tenantry; the ſlate-quarries, one great ſtaple of the country, in a very low ſtate; and the export of that valuable article did not annually exceed a thouſand tons; and there were not four carts on his eſtate, and only three in all <hi>Nant-Frankon,</hi> and the roads ſcarcely paſſable for a horſe. By his judicious management a happy reverſe took place. The carriages have encreaſed to the preſent time, to rather more than a hundred broad-wheel carts and waggons.</p>
                     <p>PORT <hi>Penrhyn,</hi> formerly <hi>Aber-cegid,</hi> is now highly improved by quays for the reception of veſſels; ſo that thoſe of two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred tons burden can lie cloſe to them, and take in their cargo. Veſſels of above three hundred tons can enter the port, but cannot get cloſe to the quays.</p>
                     <p>BEFORE the country experienced his lordſhip's improving ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents, not above a thouſand tons have been exported in the year. In 1794 the export amounted to fifteen thouſand. In 1795 there was every reaſonable hope that it would have increaſed to twenty thouſand, but the tax on the ſlates has given it a check; though it is expected that the return of peace, and a modification of the duty, will reſtore the progreſs of the trade.</p>

Here is a butcher and a ſhoe-maker, but no corrupting ale-houſe is permitted. His lordſhip has built a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket houſe, ſo that the workmen need not wander for the neceſſary proviſions. Let me not forget that he erected an elegant pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilion, called <hi>Ogwen Bank,</hi> with a kitchen, ſtables, &amp;c. which lord and lady <hi>Penrhyn</hi> often viſit, either to examine into this creation of theirs, or to amuſe their gueſts.</p>
                     <p>HIS lordſhip was elected member for <hi>Petersfield,</hi> in the firſt parlement of his preſent majeſty; and in 1767 vacated his ſeat to be elected for <hi>Leverpool.</hi> He was returned in 1768, 1774, and again in 1784.

His family,

and two other families not remote from him, had long poſſeſſed reſpectable freeholds of fifty pounds a-year each.
<q>Time and chance happeneth to all men.</q>
Our humble curate is far diſtanced by the other two.

                     <p>AFTER paſſing the turnpike-gate, I find myſelf on the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of the turnpike-road from <hi>Greenfield</hi> to <hi>Flint.</hi> The diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from the <hi>Greenfield</hi> gate to <hi>Flint</hi> is only four miles. Let me add, that within little more than one mile from the fountain of <hi>St. Wenefrede,</hi> at <hi>Holywell,</hi> to the gate juſt mentioned, <hi>Britain</hi> may be challenged to ſhew, on an equal ſpace, a ſimilar aſſemblage of commercial buildings, or of capitals employed in erecting and in carrying on their ſeveral objects. I refer the reader back to p. 203, for an account of thoſe upon the <hi>Holywell</hi> ſtream. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume the chain of commerce, from the copper-forge, the loweſt link, which reaches to the very road.</p>
                     <p>A LITTLE to the right of the turnpike-gate, the little rill <hi>Nant-hil-brwe</hi> divides the ſmall townſhip of <hi>Whelſtone</hi> from that of <hi>Holywell.</hi> This tract, of which I have the tythes, is one of the portions of <hi>Bagillt</hi> townſhip, which is very large, and ſubdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into two others, <hi>Bagillt-ſawr,</hi> and <hi>Bagillt-fechan.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>ON the ſide of the rill ſtand the works called the <hi>River Bank,</hi> eſtabliſhed on my land, by leaſe dated <hi>September</hi> 22, 1785,<note place="margin">RIVER BANK WORKS.</note> granted to Meſſrs. <hi>William Roe</hi> and <hi>Edward Hawkins.</hi> Theſe buildings are employed for the double purpoſes of calcining ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamine for the braſs-works at <hi>Cheadle</hi> and <hi>Macclesfield,</hi> and for

the ſmelting lead-ore. It has the advantage of a ſmall ſtream, which improves the operation of the latter.</p>
                     <p>IT turns two wheels, one of which is twenty-four feet in dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter, and from the ſize and breadth makes a noble appearance. At each end of theſe wheels is a balance-wheel; one of them ſets the great refining bellows in motion, the other that of the ſlag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearth.</p>
                     <p>HERE is alſo a curious contrivance for ſaving the calx of the lead-ore, which would otherwiſe have gone away in ſmoke. It beſides leſſens the bad effects on the grounds above. For this purpoſe two brick flues have been conſtructed, one from each furnace; each of them is horizontal, and is ſupported by three arches, and over each is a channel to contain a ſmall current of water, for the purpoſe of turning the wheels, and alſo to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſe the ſmoke in its paſſage. Theſe flues converge, and meet a little beyond the third arch, and terminate in the condenſing room, to the walls of which the calx adheres. This room is opened three times a-year: the calx is taken out, and re-ſmelted with ſome profit.</p>
                     <p>THE two flues, in iſſuing out of the building, are united in one, and are continued, forming a right angle for a very conſiderable way. Out of the end riſes a vertical flue, forty-three feet high, out of which the ſmoke iſſues. The length of the horizontal flues which paſs over the arches is fifty-ſeven feet; of the ſingle one which paſſes from the room which catches the calx, is two hundred and ten feet.</p>

                        <hi>Thomas,</hi> the diſinherited ſon of this <hi>John,</hi> by his induſtry and ſkill in agriculture, became enabled to purchaſe this lordſhip, in 1617, of the firſt earl of <hi>Bridgewater,</hi> ſon of the lord chancellor <hi>Egerton.</hi> At the time when paper credit was little known, to him was intruſted caſh to be conveyed to <hi>London,</hi> which, by a letter of <hi>Pyers Pennant</hi>'s, I find he did in perſon. The manor has continued in the family from his time. In 1753, the preſent gentleman improved it greatly, by an embankment from the <hi>ſea,</hi> which in parts is productive of moſt excellent wheat, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>THE firſt I find of the line of the <hi>Pantons,</hi> is <hi>Jevan Panton,</hi> twelfth in deſcent from <hi>March-weithian,</hi> one of the fifteen tribes of <hi>North Wales.</hi> His wife was daughter and heir of <hi>Bennet,</hi> fourteenth in deſcent from <hi>Marchudd,</hi> another of the fifteen tribes. Their hiſtory, and their ſeveral deſcendants, are given in the Appendix to this Work.</p>
                     <p>ALL the coaſt of <hi>Whiteford</hi> and <hi>Holywell</hi> pariſhes are more particularly ſubject than the drier parts to pleuriſies,<note place="margin">DISEASES.</note> intermittents, and fevers of the putrid kinds. The laſt chiefly in the places where the poorer people are obliged to crowd into ſmall apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:0140800700:296"/>
by which the air ſoon becomes ſoul, and produces this ſpecies of fever.</p>
                     <p>A CRUEL kind of quinzy has of late years infeſted theſe pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes, and others adjacent. In 1794 it raged particularly in the townſhip of <hi>Greenfield,</hi> and pariſh of <hi>Halkin,</hi> and made dreadful havock among children from the age of three to that of five. The average loſs was four or five in ſeven. In this viſitation the diſeaſe did not attack adults; not that inſtances are wanting in other places of its attacking grown-up perſons. In <hi>September,</hi> 1771, a Mr. <hi>Poole,</hi> his wife and mother, were buried in one vault in <hi>Bunhill-fields.</hi> His daughter fell a victim alſo, and made the ſum of the family, who died at the ſame time, and by the ſame malignant diſorder.</p>
                     <p>THE name given by the learned to this fatal diſeaſe, is <hi>angina maligna,</hi> and <hi>cynanche maligna. Cynanche,</hi> becauſe the patients are often obſerved to protrude their tongue far out of their mouth, like an over-heated dog.</p>
                     <p>THE ſymptoms are too terrible for deſcription. They may uſeleſsly affect parents, who may ſafely truſt to the medical peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple for the knowlege of them, for they are by no means equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal; but, if any one's curioſity is excited, it may be ſatisfied by the peruſal of the works of the late Dr. <hi>Fothergill,</hi> p. 198. and Dr. <hi>Huxham</hi>'s Eſſays, p. 286. It ſeems to have been one of the <hi>Nova Cohors Febrium.</hi> It was firſt obſerved in <hi>Spain,</hi> in 1610, from whence it ſpread into <hi>Malta, Sicily, Otr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="280" facs="tcp:0140800700:297"/>
p. 132.) was in <hi>Milo,</hi> in the year 17<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>0. In <hi>Spain</hi> it got the name of <hi>garrotillo,</hi> from the horrible noiſe made by the patients, like that of perſons ſtrangled by a rope.</p>
                     <p>THIS fatal diſorder reached <hi>England</hi> in 1739. Its firſt victims were two ſons of Mr. <hi>Pelham,</hi> on the 27th of <hi>November</hi> of that year. After this it ſeemed to diſappear, but began again in 1742; and with great fatality in 1746, when ſeveral of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of <hi>Brom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>wall;</hi> and from the latter part of that year, to <hi>May</hi> 1753, carried off numbers of children, and ſome adults.</p>
                     <p>IN the year 1743 it appeared in <hi>North Wales.</hi> From <hi>March</hi> 5th to <hi>March</hi> 10th, our late worthy vicar, the Reverend <hi>Griffith Griffith,</hi> buried three children. It was too much for his paternal feelings, and ever after greatly hurt his mind. And in the year 1744/5 that calamity viſited the county of <hi>Caernarvon;</hi> and from <hi>January</hi> 28th to <hi>February</hi> 9th, the late Sir <hi>Thomas Moſtyn,</hi> ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronet, at <hi>Gloddaeth,</hi> in <hi>Caernarvonſhire,</hi> loſt four. Theſe were obſerved to have been the only inſtances of the diſeaſe in their reſpective neighborhoods.</p>
                     <p>I CANNOT trace the progreſs of this diſeaſe any farther north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward than my own country. If it has not made any advances towards the colder climates, it may be deemed a malady of the warm and temperate parts of <hi>Europe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>THAT it has found its way to the New World, appears from the following inſtances. In 1746 it viſited many parts of <hi>North America,</hi> from <hi>Philadelphia</hi> to <hi>New-York</hi> and <hi>New-England,</hi> and
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:0140800700:298"/>
with a rage unknown in <hi>Great-Britain;</hi> for in <hi>New-England</hi> it depopulated whole villages. And that it either continues on the continent, or has re-viſited it, is evident from its having appeared in <hi>New York,</hi> in the year 1771.</p>
                     <p>THE <hi>cynanche trachialis,</hi> or <hi>croup,</hi> has appeared here too fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently. A few years ago it deſtroyed not fewer than ſix chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in the family of a reſpectable farmer in a neighboring pariſh.</p>
                     <p>THE ſmelting-works at <hi>Flint</hi> are at a very ſmall diſtance from the eaſtern boundary of <hi>Holywell.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">FLINT SMELLING-WORKS.</note> The diviſion of the pariſh of <hi>Flint</hi> from that of the latter, is by a rill not far from the town of <hi>Flint.</hi> The works are of great antiquity. They are here men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned as the laſt link of the chain of metallic operations along the ſhore. There is no limiting the antiquity of the ſmelting-works; for we have proofs of very conſiderable ones having been near the town of <hi>Flint,</hi> at a place called <hi>Croes Ati,</hi> which is evident from the quantity of ſcoria of lead, bits of lead-ore, and frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of melted lead, diſcovered in ſeveral places. I refer the reader, for a full account of them, and of the various antiquities met with on the ſpot, to p. 52. vol. i. of my <hi>Welſh Tour,</hi> which evince that they had been <hi>Roman</hi> works; ſo that it is probable there had been a ſucceſſion of ſmelting-hearths in one part or other of this county, even to the preſent day.</p>
                     <p>TO return to the works in queſtion. They are frequently known by the name of the <hi>ſalt-works;</hi> which poſſibly implies that the ſite had been occupied by works of that nature, prior to the exiſtence of the ſmelting-works.

                     <p>
                        <hi>N. B.</hi> TITLE PAGE to <hi>Whiteford,</hi> the date 1796.—I requeſt that this may be read 1795. It was expected that the whole book would have been printed in that year; but by various delays, too well known to authors, it was not completed till the month of <hi>March</hi> 1796. I therefore beg the reader would conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that the ſeveral references which may be ſuppoſed to relate to 1796 can only intend 1795: for example, p. 161. l. 9. 'next ſeaſon' means the wheat-ſowing ſeaſon of that year. 'In the next year,' means 1796. The attentive reader will diſcover many other reference of that kind.</p>
                     <p>PAGE 99, after paragraph 2d.—We retain in <hi>Whiteford</hi> church the decent ſervice of praying for the ſick, inſtead of lazily ſinking it into the xxixth ſupplicatlon of the <hi>Litany.</hi> The prayers on that occaſion are ſo pathetic, ſo admonitory to the congregation, that I am amazed that any miniſter ſhould remain inſenſible of the impropriety of the omiſſion.</p>
                     <p>I NOW cannot but moſt earneſtly exhort the ſquires of every pariſh to attendance on divine ſervice, if it was only to hear the ſad catalogue of the miſerable objects which compoſe the largeſt part of thoſe for whom the devotions I allude to are intended. It will direct their benevolence to their relief. They may find among them objects of their charity, whom they may never otherwiſe have heard of. They may find tenants to whom they ought to be fathers. They certainly will find congenerous beings, to whom every duty of humanity is enjoined by the SA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VIOUR of the world: This I ſhould hope is thus irreſiſtibly enforced:</p>

                        <p>COME, YE BLESSED OF MY FATHER, INHERIT THE KINGDOM PREPARED FOR YOU FROM THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD.</p>
                        <p>FOR I WAS AN HUNGRED, AND YE GAVE ME MEAT; I WAS THIRSTY, AND YE GAVE ME DRINK; I WAS A STRANGER, AND YE TOOK ME IN; NAKED, AND YE CLOATHED ME; I WAS SICK, AND YE VISITED ME; I WAS IN PRISON, AND YE CAME UNTO ME.</p>
                        <p>THEN SHALL THE RIGHTEOUS ANSWER HIM, SAYING, LORD, WHEN SAW WE THEE AN HUNGRED, AND FED THEE? OR THIRSTY, AND GAVE THEE DRINK?</p>
                        <p>WHEN SAW WE THEE A STRANGER, AND TOOK THEE IN? OR NAKED, AND CLOTHED THEE?</p>
                        <p>OR WHEN SAW WE THEE SICK, OR IN PRISON, AND CAME UNTO THEE?</p>
                        <p>AND THE KING SHALL ANSWER, AND SAY UNTO THEM, VERILY I SAY UNTO YOU, INASMUCH AS YE HAVE DONE IT UNTO ONE OF THE LEAST OF THESE MY BRETHREN, YE HAVE DONE IT UNTO ME.</p>

                     <p>To theſe benedictory verſes let me add one, in which the penalty, as well as the reward is united. I cannot reſiſt the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe, as it is ſo admirably adapted to the times. It ſhall be followed by an extract from p. 164 of this work, which I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to the public through the channel of the <hi>Cheſter</hi> paper, followed by ſome declarations to prevent the miſtaking of any part. I fervently wiſh to promote a friendly agreement between landlord and tenant; between tenant and every poor laborer. The benevolent Duke of BEAUFORT, and I believe others of the benevolent GREAT, have made the attempt; and, to
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:0140800700:344"/>
the glory of landlord and tenant, are to this moment diſpenſing their generous plan to a grateful people. Such an agreement was entered into by the farmers of part of this and a neighbor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing county; but to their infamy, many of them withdrew from their words and their ſignatures. May the landlords become the inſtruments of compelling them to accept the bleſſing offered in the laſt part of the line, and to ſhun the curſe denounced in the firſt! There is one deſcription of men, on whom it ſhould fall in a moſt exemplary manner. The badger, or factor, employed to exhauſt the ſtock of corn and other proviſions, not by fair agreement, but by openly raiſing the price, by offering more than the farmer would have aſked; and even telling them, in open market, 'Aſk what you will, and we will give it.' The poor, ſince the repeal of the 5th and 6th of <hi>Edward</hi> IV. by the 12th of <hi>George</hi> III. are left defenceleſs. The means of inflicting the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment by the ſtatute is taken away, and they are to ſeek juſtice through the tedious expenſive labyrinths of the common law.</p>
                     <q>HE THAT WITHHOLDETH CORN, THE PEOPLE SHALL CURSE HIM: BUT BLESSING SHALL BE UPON THE HEAD OF HIM THAT SELLETH IT.

                           <p>
                              <q>I would never grant a leaſe to a great corn-tenant. I would preſerve a power over his granary, which legiſlature will not, or

cannot aſſume. Should he attempt by exportation to exhauſt it in years of ſcarcity, and not leave a ſufficient ſupply for the country which produced the grain; — ſhould he attempt a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopoly,—ſhould he refuſe to carry a proper quantity to the next market;—or ſhould he refuſe to ſell, to the poor who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not attend the market, corn in ſmall quantities, I WOULD INSTANTLY ASSUME THE POWER OF THE LANDLORD, AND EXPEL HIM FROM MY ESTATE. A juſt puniſhment for the tenant, who, through rapacity, declines to comply with my deſires, excited with no other view than to promote the good of the public.</q>

                           <p>THE end which we wiſh by the above radically to correct, may ſoon be paſt cure, I therefore commit the extract to your hands. The evil is entirely local; other parts of <hi>Great Britain</hi> are poſſibly unaffected by it, and have no occaſion to take alarm. We do not wiſh the farmers ſolely to feed the poor; we only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt them to reſerve in the country corn enough of EVERY kind to enable others to exert their benevolence to their poorer neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors; not by gratu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

GOD forbid that we ſhould deny them FAIR profits, ſuch as every other dealer has a right to. I wiſh to inculcate univerſal juſtice; but let us remember that CHARITY begins at home. We ſhall gladly impart our ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluity to our moſt diſtant neighbors, even ſhould we be obliged to pay more for the bare competency we may reſerve.</p>
