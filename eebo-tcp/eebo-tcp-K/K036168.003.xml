            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head type="sub">Of the DIFFERENT SPECIES of PHILOSOPHY.</head>
            <p>MORAL philoſophy, or the ſcience of human
nature, may be treated after two different
manners; each of which has its peculiar merit, and
may contribute to the entertainment, inſtruction, and
reformation of mankind. The one conſiders man
chiefly as born for action; and as influenced in his
actions by taſte and ſentiment; purſuing one object,
and avoiding another, according to the value which
theſe objects ſeem to poſſeſs, and according to the
light in which they preſent themſelves. Virtue, of all
objects, is the moſt valuable and lovely; and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
this ſpecies of philoſophers paint her in the
moſt amiable colours; borrowing all helps from poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
and eloquence, and treating their ſubject in an
eaſy and obvious manner, ſuch as is beſt fitted to
pleaſe the imagination, and engage the affections.
They ſelect the moſt ſtriking obſervations and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
from common life; place oppoſite characters
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0050800103:7"/>
in a proper contraſt; and alluring us into the paths
of virtue by the views of glory and happineſs, direct
our ſteps in theſe paths by the ſoundeſt precepts and
moſt illuſtrious examples. They make us <hi>feel</hi> the
difference betwixt vice and virtue; they excite and
regulate our ſentiments; and ſo they can but bend
our hearts to the love of probity and true honour,
they think, that they have fully attained the end of all
their labours.</p>
            <p>THE other ſpecies of philoſophers treat man rather
as a reaſonable than an active being, and endeavour
to form his underſtanding more than cultivate his
manners. They regard mankind as a ſubject of ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation;
and with a narrow ſcrutiny examine human
nature, in order to find thoſe principles, which regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
our underſtanding, excite our ſentiments, and
make us approve or blame any particular object, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or behaviour. They think it a reproach to all
literature, that philoſophy ſhould not yet have fixed,
beyond controverſy, the foundation of morals, reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and criticiſm, and ſhould for ever talk of truth
and falſehood, vice and virtue, beauty and deformity,
without being able to determine the ſource of theſe
diſtinctions. While they attempt this arduous taſk,
they are deterred by no difficulties; but proceeding
from particular inſtances to general principles, they
ſtill puſh on their inquiries to principles more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
and reſt not ſatisfied till they arrive at thoſe ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0050800103:8"/>
principles, by which, in every ſcience, all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
cu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ioſity muſt be bounded. Tho' their ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
ſeem abſtract, and even unintelligible to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
readers, they pleaſe themſelves with the appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation
of the learned and the wiſe; and think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
ſufficiently compenſated for the labours of their
whole lives, if they can diſcover ſome hidden truths,
which may contribute to the inſtruction of poſterity.</p>
            <p>'TIS certain, that the eaſy and obvious philoſophy
will always, with the generality of mankind, have
the preference to the accurate and abſtruſe; and by
many will be recommended, not only as more agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
but more uſeful than the other. It enters more
into common life; moulds the heart and affections;
and, by touching thoſe principles which actuate men,
reforms their conduct, and brings them nearer that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del
of perfection which it deſcribes. On the contrary,
the abſtruſe philoſophy, being founded on a turn of
mind, which cannot enter into buſineſs and action,
vaniſhes when the philoſopher leaves the ſhade, and
comes into open day; nor can its principles eaſily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
any influence over our conduct and behaviour.
The feelings of our ſentiments, the agitations of our
paſſions, the vehemence of our affections, diſſipate all
its concluſions, and reduce the profound philoſopher
to a mere plebeian.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:0050800103:9"/>
THIS alſo muſt be confeſſed, that the moſt durable,
as well as juſteſt fame has been acquired by the eaſy
philoſophy, and that abſtract reaſoners ſeem hitherto
to have enjoyed only a momentary reputation, from
the caprice or ignorance of their own age, but have
not been able to ſupport their renown with more
equitable poſterity. 'Tis eaſy for a profound philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher
to commit a miſtake in his ſubtile reaſonings;
and one miſtake is the neceſſary parent of another,
while he puſhes on his conſequences, and is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terred
from embracing any concluſion, by its unuſual
appearance, or its contradiction to popular opinion.
But a philoſopher, who propoſes only to repreſent the
common ſenſe of mankind in more beautiful and
more engaging colours, if by accident he commits a
miſtake, goes no farther; but renewing his appeal to
common ſenſe, and the natural ſentiments of the
mind, returns into the right path, and ſecures him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
from any dangerous illuſions. The fame of CI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CERO
flouriſhes at preſent; but that of ARISTOTLE
is utterly decayed. La BRUYERE paſſes the ſeas,
and ſtill maintains his reputation: But the glory of
MALEBRANCHE is confined to his own nation, and to
his own age. And ADDISON, perhaps, will be read
with pleaſure, when LOCKE ſhall be intirely for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten.</p>
            <p>THE
mere philoſopher is a character which is
commonly but little acceptable in the world, as being
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0050800103:10"/>
ſuppoſed to contribute nothing either to the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
or pleaſure of ſociety; while he lives remote
from communication with mankind, and is wrapped
up in principles and notions equally remote from
their comprehenſion. On the other hand, the mere
ignorant is ſtill more deſpiſed; nor is any thing
deemed a ſurer ſign of an illiberal genius in an age
and nation where the ſciences flouriſh, than to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
void of all reliſh for thoſe noble entertainments.
The moſt perfect character is ſuppoſed to lie between
thoſe extremes; retaining an equal ability and taſte
for books, company, and buſineſs; preſerving in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation
that diſcernment and delicacy which ariſe
from polite letters; and in buſineſs, that probity and
accuracy which are the natural reſult of a juſt philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy.
In order to diffuſe and cultivate ſo accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed
a character, nothing can be more uſeful than
compoſitions of the eaſy ſtyle and manner, which draw
not too much from life, require no deep application
or retreat to be comprehended, and ſend back the ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
among mankind full of noble ſentiments and
wiſe precepts, applicable to every exigence of human
life. By means of ſuch compoſitions, virtue becomes
amiable, ſcience agreeable, company inſtructive, and
retirement entertaining.</p>
            <p>MAN is a reaſonable being; and as ſuch, receives
from ſcience his proper food and nouriſhment: But ſo
narrow are the bounds of human underſtanding, that
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0050800103:11"/>
little ſatisfaction can be hoped for in this particular?
either from the extent or ſecurity of his acquiſitions.
Man is a ſociable, no leſs than a reaſonable being:
But neither can he always enjoy company agreeable
and amuſing, or preſerve the proper reliſh of them.
Man is alſo an active being; and from that diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition,
as well as from the various neceſſities of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
life, muſt ſubmit to buſineſs and occupation:
But the mind requires ſome relaxation, and cannot
always ſupport its bent to care and induſtry. It
ſeems, then, that nature has pointed out a mixed kind
of life as moſt ſuitable to human race, and ſecretly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed
them to allow none of theſe biaſſes to <hi>draw</hi>
too much, ſo as to incapacitate them for other occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations
and entertainments. Indulge your paſſion
for ſcience, ſays ſhe, but let your ſcience be human,
and ſuch as may have a direct reference to action and
ſociety. Abſtruſe thought and profound reſearches I
prohibit, and will ſeverely puniſh, by the penſive me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy
which they introduce, by the endleſs uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
in which they involve you, and by the cold re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
which your pretended diſcoveries will meet
with, when communicated. Be a philoſopher; but,
amidſt all your philoſophy, be ſtill a man.</p>
            <p>WERE the generality of mankind contented to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
the eaſy philoſophy to the abſtract and profound,
without throwing any blame or contempt on the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
it might not be improper, perhaps, to comply
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0050800103:12"/>
with this general opinion, and allow every man to
enjoy, without oppoſition, his own taſte and ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
But as the matter is often carried farther,
even to the abſolute rejecting all profound reaſonings,
or what is commonly called <hi>metaphyſics,</hi> we ſhall now
proceed to conſider what can reaſonably be pleaded in
their behalf.</p>
            <p>WE may begin with obſerving, that one conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
advantage which reſults from the accurate and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract
philoſophy, is, its ſubſerviency to the eaſy and
humane; which, without the former, can never attain
a ſufficient degree of exactneſs in its ſentiments, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts,
or reaſonings. All polite letters are nothing
but pictures of human life in various attitudes and ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuations;
and inſpire us with different ſentiments, of
praiſe or blame, admiration or ridicule, according to
the qualities of the object which they ſet before us.
An artiſt muſt be better qualified to ſucceed in this
undertaking, who, beſides a delicate taſte and a quick
apprehenſion, poſſeſſes an accurate knowledge of the
internal fabric, the operations of the underſtanding,
the workings of the paſſions, and the various ſpecies
of ſentiment which diſcriminate vice and virtue. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
painful this inward ſearch or inquiry may appear,
it becomes, in ſome meaſure, requiſite to thoſe, who
would deſcribe with ſucceſs the obvious and outward
appearances of life and manners. The anatomiſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents
to the eye the moſt hideous and diſagreeable ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects;
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0050800103:13"/>
but his ſcience is highly uſeful to the painter in
delineating even a VENUS or an HELEN. While
the latter employs all the richeſt colours of his art,
and gives his figures the moſt graceful and engaging
airs; he muſt ſtill carry his attention to the inward
ſtructure of the human body, the poſition of the muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
the fabric of the bones, and the uſe and figure of
every part or organ. Accuracy is, in every caſe, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous
to beauty, and juſt reaſoning to delicate
ſentiments. In vain would we exalt the one by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preciating
the other.</p>
            <p>BESIDES, we may obſerve, in every art or profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
even thoſe which moſt concern life or action,
that a ſpirit of accuracy, however acquired, carries all
of them nearer their perfection, and renders them
more ſubſervient to the intereſts of ſociety. And tho'
a philoſopher may live remote from buſineſs, the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius
of philoſophy, if carefully cultivated by ſeveral,
muſt gradually diffuſe itſelf thro' the whole ſociety,
and beſtow a ſimilar correctneſs on every art and call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
The politician will acquire greater foreſight
and ſubtilty, in the ſubdividing and balancing of
power; the lawyer more method and finer principles
in his reaſonings; and the general more regularity in
his diſcipline, and more caution in his plans and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.
The ſtability of modern governments above
the antient, and the accuracy of modern philoſophy,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0050800103:14"/>
have improved, and probably will ſtill improve, by
ſimilar gradations.</p>
            <p>WERE there no advantage to be reaped from theſe
ſtudies, beyond the gratification of an innocent curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity,
yet ought not even this to be deſpiſed; as being
one acceſſion to thoſe few ſafe and harmleſs pleaſures
which are beſtowed on human race. The ſweeteſt
and moſt inoffenſive path of life leads thro' the ave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues
of ſcience and learning; and whoever can either
remove any obſtructions in this way, or open up any
new proſpect, ought ſo far to be eſteemed a benefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
to mankind. And tho' theſe reſearches may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
painful and fatiguing, 'tis with ſome minds as
with ſome bodies, which being endowed with vigorous
and florid health, require ſevere exerciſe, and reap a
pleaſure from what, to the generality of mankind, may
ſeem burdenſome and laborious. Obſcurity, indeed,
is painful to the mind as well as to the eye; but to
bring light from obſcurity, by whatever labour, muſt
needs be delightful and rejoicing.</p>
            <p>BUT this obſcurity, in the profound and abſtract
philoſophy, is objected to, not only as painful and
fatiguing, but as the inevitable ſource of uncertainty
and error. Here indeed lies the juſteſt and moſt plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
objection againſt a conſiderable part of meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſics,
that they are not properly a ſcience, but ariſe ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
from the fruitleſs efforts of human vanity, which
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0050800103:15"/>
would penetrate into ſubjects utterly inacceſſible to
the underſtanding, or from the craft of popular ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition,
which, being unable to defend themſelves on
fair ground, raiſe theſe intangling brambles to cover
and protect their weakneſs. Chaced from the open
country, theſe robbers fly into the foreſt, and lie in
wait to break in upon every unguarded avenue of the
mind, and overwhelm it with religious fears and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices.
The ſtouteſt antagoniſt, if he remits his
watch a moment, is oppreſſed. And many, thro'
cowardice and folly, open the gates to the enemies,
and willingly receive them with reverence and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,
as their legal ſovereigns.</p>
            <p>BUT is this a juſt cauſe why philoſophers ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
from ſuch reſearches, and leave ſuperſtition ſtill in
poſſeſſion of her retreat? Is it not reaſonable to draw a
direct contrary concluſion, and perceive the neceſſity
of carrying the war into the moſt ſecret receſſes of the
enemy? In vain do we hope, that men, from fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
diſappointments, will at laft abandon ſuch airy
ſciences, and diſcover the proper province of human
reaſon. For, beſides that many perſons find too ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
an intereſt in perpetually recalling ſuch topics;
beſides this, I ſay, the motive of blind deſpair can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
reaſonably have place in the ſciences; ſince, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
unſucceſsful former attempts may have proved,
there is ſtill room to hope, that the induſtry, good
fortune, or improved ſagacity of ſucceeding genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0050800103:16"/>
may reach diſcoveries unknown to former ages.
Each adventurous genius will ſtill leap at the arduous
prize, and find himſelf ſtimulated, rather than diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged,
by the failures of his predeceſſors; while he
hopes, that the glory of atchieving ſo hard an adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is reſerved for him alone. The only method of
freeing learning, at once, from theſe abſtruſe queſtions,
is to inquire ſeriouſly into the nature of human under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
and ſhew, from an exact analyſis of its
powers and capacity, that it is by no means ſitted for
ſuch remote and abſtruſe ſubjects. We muſt ſubmit
to this fatigue, in order to live at eaſe for ever after:
And muſt cultivate true metaphyſics with ſome care,
in order to deſtroy the falſe and adulterate. Indolence,
which to ſome perſons, affords a ſafeguard againſt this
deceitful philoſophy, is, with others, overbalanced by
curioſity; and deſpair, which, at ſome moments, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails,
may give place afterwards to ſanguine hopes
and expectations. Accurate and juſt reaſoning is the
only catholic remedy, ſitted for all perſons and all
diſpoſitions, and is alone able to ſubvert that abſtruſe
philoſophy and metaphyſical jargon, which being
mixed up with popular ſuperſtition, renders it in a
manner impenetrable to careleſs reaſoners, and gives
it the air of ſcience and wiſdom.</p>
            <p>BESIDES this advantage of rejecting, after deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate
inquiry, the moſt uncertain and diſagreeable
part of learning, there are many poſitive advantages,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0050800103:17"/>
which reſult from an accurate ſcrutiny into the powers
and ſaculties of human nature. 'Tis remarkable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the operations of the mind, that tho' moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timately
preſent to us, yet whenever they become the
object of reflection, they ſeem involved in obſcurity,
nor can the eye readily find thoſe lines and bounda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
which diſcriminate and diſtinguiſh them. The
objects are too fine to remain long in the ſame aſpect
or ſituation; and muſt be apprehended, in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant,
by a ſuperior penetration, derived from nature,
and improved by habit and reflection. It becomes,
therefore, no inconſiderable part of ſcience barely to
know the different operations of the mind, to ſeparate
them from each other, to claſs them under their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
diviſions, and to correct all that ſeeming diſorder,
in which they lie involved, when made the object of
reflection and inquiry. This taſk of ordering and
diſtinguiſhing, which has no merit, when performed
with regard to external bodies, the objects of our ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
riſes in its value, when directed towards the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
of the mind, in proportion to the difficulty and
labour which we meet with in performing it. And if
we can go no farther than this mental geography, or
delineation of the diſtinct parts and powers of the
mind, 'tis at leaſt a ſatisfaction to go ſo far; and the
more obvious this ſcience may appear (and it is by no
means obvious) the more contemptible ſtill muſt the
ignorance of it be eſteemed in all pretenders to learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and philoſophy.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:0050800103:18"/>
NOR can there remain any ſuſpicion, that this ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
is uncertain and chimerical; unleſs we ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
ſuch a ſcepticiſm as is intirely ſubverſive of all
ſpeculation, and even action. It cannot be doubted,
that the mind is endowed with ſeveral powers and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties,
that theſe powers are totally diſtinct from each
other, that what is really diſtinct to the immediate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
may be diſtinguiſhed by reflection; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently,
that there is a truth and falſhood in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions
on this ſubject, and a truth and falſhood,
which lie not beyond the compaſs of human under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.
There are many obvious diſtinctions of
this kind, ſuch as thoſe between the will and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
the imagination and paſſions, which fall
within the comprehenſion of every human creature;
and the finer and more philoſophical diſtinctions are no
leſs real and certain, tho' more difficult to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended.
Some inſtances, eſpecially late ones, of
ſucceſs in theſe inquiries, may give us a juſter notion
of the certainty and ſolidity of this branch of learning.
And ſhall we eſteem it worthy the labour of a philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher
to give us a true ſyſtem of the planets, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt
the poſition and order of thoſe remote bodies;
while we affect to overlook thoſe, who, with ſo much
ſucceſs, delineate the parts of the mind, in which we
are ſo intimately concerned?</p>
            <p>BUT may we not hope, that philoſophy, if culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated
with care, and encouraged by the attention of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0050800103:19"/>
the public, may carry its reſearches ſtill farther, and
diſcover, at leaſt in ſome degree, the ſecret ſprings and
principles, by which the human mind is actuated in its
operations? Aſtronomers had long contented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
with proving, from the phaenomena, the true
motions, order, and magnitude of the heavenly bodies:
Till a philoſopher, at laſt, aroſe, who ſeems from the
happieſt reaſoning, to have alſo determined the laws
and forces by which the revolutions of the planets are
governed and directed. The like has been performed
with regard to other parts of nature. And there is no
reaſon to deſpair of equal ſucceſs in our inquiries con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the mental powers and oeconomy, if proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with equal capacity and caution. 'Tis probable,
that one operation and principle of the mind depends
on another; which, again, may be reſolved into one
more general and univerſal: And how far theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearches
may poſſibly be carried, it will be difficult for
us, before, or even after, a careful trial, exactly to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine.
This is certain, that attempts of this kind
are every day made even by thoſe who philoſophize
the moſt negligently: and nothing can be more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite
than to enter upon the enterprize with thorough
care and attention; that, if it lie within the compaſe
of human underſtanding, it may at laſt be happily at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieved;
if not, it may, however, be rejected with
ſome confidence and ſecurity. This laſt concluſion'
ſurrely, is not deſireable, nor ought it to be embraced
too raſhly. For how much muſt we diminiſh from
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0050800103:20"/>
the beauty and value of this ſpecies of philoſophy, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſuch a ſuppoſition? Moraliſts have hitherto been
accuſtomed, when they conſidered the vaſt multitude
and diverſity of actions that excite our approbation or
diſlike, to ſearch for ſome common principle, on which
this variety of ſentiments might depend. And tho'
they have ſometimes carried the matter too far, by
their paſſion for ſome one general principle; it muſt,
however, be confeſſed, that they are excuſable, in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting
to find ſome general principles, into which
all the vices and virtues were juſtly to be reſolved.
The like has been the endeavour of critics, logicians,
and even politicians: Nor have their attempts been
wholly unſucceſsful; tho' perhaps longer time, great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
accuracy, and more ardent application may bring
theſe ſciences ſtill nearer their perfection. To throw
up at once all pretenſions of this kind may juſtly be
deemed more raſh, precipitate, and dogmatical, than
even the boldeſt and moſt affirmative philoſophy,
which has ever attempted to impoſe its crude dictates
and principles on mankind.</p>
            <p>WHAT tho' theſe reaſonings concerning human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
ſeem abſtract, and of difficult comprehenſion?
This affords no preſumption of their falſhood. On
the contrary, it ſeems impoſſible, that what has hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
eſcaped ſo many wiſe and profound philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
can be very obvious and eaſy. And whatever
pains theſe reſearches may coſt us, we may think our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0050800103:21"/>
ſufficiently rewarded, not only in point of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
but of pleaſure, if, by that means, we can make
any addition to our ſtock of knowledge, in ſubjects
of ſuch unſpeakable importance.</p>
            <p>BUT as, after all, the abſtractedneſs of theſe ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
is no recommendation, but rather a diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
to them, and as this difficulty may perhaps be
ſurmounted by care and art, and the avoiding all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary
detail, we have, in the following inquiry,
attempted to throw ſome light upon ſubjects, from
which uncertainty has hitherto deterred the wiſe, and
obſcurity the ignorant. Happy, if we can unite the
boundaries of the different ſpecies of philoſophy, by
reconciling profound inquiry with clearneſs, and truth
with novelty! And ſtill more happy, if, reaſoning in
this eaſy manner, we can undermine the foundations
of an abſtruſe philoſophy, which ſeems to have ſerved
hitherto only as a ſhelter to ſuperſition, and a cover to
abſurdity and error!</p>

            <head>SECTION II.</head>
            <head type="sub">Of the ORIGIN of IDEAS.</head>
            <p>EVERY one will readily allow, that there is a
conſiderable difference between the perceptions
of the mind, when a man feels the pain of exceſſive
heat, or the pleaſure of moderate warmth, and when
he afterwards recalls to his memory this ſenſation, or
anticipates it by his imagination. Theſe faculties
may mimic or copy the perceptions of the ſenſes; but
they never can reach entirely the force and vivacity of
the original ſentiment. The utmoſt we ſay of them,
even when they operate with greateſt vigour, is,
that they repreſent their object in ſo lively a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
that we could <hi>almoſt</hi> ſay we feel or ſee it: But
except the mind be diſordered by diſeaſe or madneſs,
they never can arrive at ſuch a pitch of vivacity, as
to render theſe perceptions altogether undiſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.
All the colours of poetry, however ſplendid,
can never paint natural objects in ſuch a manner as
to make the deſcription be taken for a real landſkip.
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0050800103:23"/>
The moſt lively thought is ſtill inferior to the dulleſt
ſenſation.</p>
            <p>WE may obſerve a like diſtinction to run thro' all
the other perceptions of the mind. A man, in a fit
of anger, is actuated in a very different manner from
one who only thinks of that emotion. If you tell
me, that any perſon is in love, I eaſily underſtand
your meaning, and form a juſt conception of his ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation;
but never can miſtake that conception for the
real diſorders and agitations of the paſſion. When
we refiect on our paft ſentiments and affections, our
thought is a faithful mirror, and copies its objects
truly; but the colours which it employs are faint and
dull, in compariſon of thoſe in which our original
perceptions were clothed. It requires no nice diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment
nor metaphyſical head to mark the diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
between them.</p>
            <p>HERE therefore we may divide all the perceptions
of the mind into two claſſes or ſpecies, which are
diſtinguiſhed by their different degrees of force and
vivacity. The leſs forcible and lively are commonly
denominated THOUGHTS or IDEAS. The other ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
want a name in our language, and in moſt others;
I ſuppoſe, becauſe it was not requiſite for any, but
philoſophical purpoſes, to rank them under a general
term or appellation. Let us, therefore, uſe a little
freedom, and call them IMPRESSIONS; employing
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0050800103:24"/>
that word in a ſenſe ſomewhat different from the uſual.
By the term <hi>impreſſion,</hi> then, I mean all our more
lively perceptions, when we hear, or ſee, or feel, or
love, or hate, or deſire, or will. And impreſſions
are diſtinguiſhed from ideas, which are the leſs lively
perceptions of which we are conſcious, when we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect
on any of thoſe ſenſations or movements above
mentioned.</p>
            <p>NOTHING, at firſt view, may ſeem more unbounded
than the thought of man, which not only eſcapes all
human power and authority, but is not even reſtrained
within the limits of nature and reality. To form
monſters, and join incongruous ſhapes and appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances,
coſts no more trouble than to conceive the
moſt natural and familiar objects. And while the
body is confined to one planet, along which it creeps
with pain and difficulty; the thought can in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
tranſport us into the moſt diſtant regions of the
univerſe; or even beyond the univerſe, into the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded
chaos, where nature is ſuppoſed to lie in
total confuſion. What never was ſeen, nor heard of,
may yet be conceived; nor is any thing beyond the
power of thought, except what implies an abſolute
contradiction.</p>
            <p>BUT tho' thought ſeems to poſſeſs this unbounded
liberty, we ſhall find, upon a nearer examination,
that it is really confined within very narrow limits,
and that all this creative power of the mind amounts
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0050800103:25"/>
to no more than the compounding, tranſpoſing, aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting,
or diminiſhing the materials afforded us by
the ſenſes and experience. When we think of a
golden mountain, we only join two conſiſtent ideas,
<hi>gold,</hi> and <hi>mountain,</hi> with which we were formerly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted.
A virtuous horſe we can conceive; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe,
from our own feeling, we can conceive virtue,
and this we may unite to the figure and ſhape of a
horſe, which is an animal familiar to us. In ſhort,
all the materials of thinking are derived either from
our outward or inward ſentiment: The mixture and
compoſition of theſe belongs alone to the mind and
will. Or, to expreſs myſelf in philoſophical lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
all our ideas or more feeble perceptions are
copies of our impreſſions or more lively ones.</p>
            <p>To prove this, the two following arguments will,
I hope, be ſufficient. Firſt, When we analyſe our
thoughts or ideas, however compounded or ſublime,
we always find, that they reſolve themſelves into ſuch
ſimple ideas as were copied from a precedent feeling
or ſentiment. Even thoſe ideas, which, at firſt view,
ſeem the moſt wide of this origin, are found, upon
a narrower ſcrutiny, to be derived from it. The idea
of God, as meaning an infinitely intelligent, wiſe,
and good Being, ariſes from reflecting on the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of our own mind, and augmenting, without li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit,
thoſe qualities of goodneſs and wiſdom. We
may proſecute this enquiry to what length we pleaſe;
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0050800103:26"/>
where we ſhall always find, that every idea we exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
is copied from a ſimilar impreſſion. Thoſe who
would aſſert, that this poſition is not abſolutely uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
and without exception, have only one, and that
an eaſy method of refuting it; by producing that idea,
which, in their opinion, is not derived from this
ſource. It will then be incumbent on us, if we would
maintain our doctrine, to produce the impreſſion or
lively perception, which correſponds to it.</p>
            <p>SECONDLY. If it happen, from a defect of the
organ, that a man is not ſuſceptible of any ſpecies
of ſenſation, we always find, that he is as little ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible
of the correſpondent ideas. A blind man
can form no notion of colours; a deaf man of ſounds.
Reſtore either of them that ſenſe, in which he is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient;
by opening this new inlet for his ſenſations,
you alſo open an inlet for the ideas, and he finds no
difficulty of conceiving theſe objects. The caſe is the
fame, if the object, proper for exciting any ſenſation,
has never been applied to the organ. A LAPLANDER
or NEGROE has no notion of the reliſh of wine.
And tho' there are few or no inſtances of a like defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency
in the mind, where a perſon has never felt or
is wholly incapable of a ſentiment or paſſion, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
to his ſpecies; yet we find the ſame obſervation
to take place in a leſs degree. A man of mild man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
can form no notion of inveterate revenge or
cruelty; nor can a ſelfiſh heart eaſily conceive the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0050800103:27"/>
heights of friendſhip and generoſity. 'Tis readily al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed,
that other beings may poſſeſs many ſenſes, of
which we can have no conception: becauſe the ideas
of them have never been introduced to us in the only
manner by which an idea can have acceſs to the mind,
<hi>viz.</hi> by the actual feeling and ſenſation.</p>
            <p>THERE is, however, one contradictory phaenome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,
which may prove, that 'tis not abſolutely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
for ideas to go before their correſpondent im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions.
I believe it will readily be allowed, that
the ſeveral diſtinct ideas of colours, which enter by
the eyes, or thoſe of ſounds, which are conveyed by
the hearing, are really different from each other; tho',
at the ſame time, reſembling. Now if this be true
of different colours, it muſt be no leſs ſo, of the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
ſhades of the ſame colour; and each ſhade pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces
a diſtinct idea, independent of the reſt. For if
this ſhould be denied, 'tis poſſible, by the continual
gradation of ſhades, to run a colour inſenſibly into
what is moſt remote from it; and if you will not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
any of the means to be different, you cannot,
without abſurdity, deny the extremes to be the ſame.
Suppoſe, therefore, a perſon to have enjoyed his ſight
for thirty years, and to have become perfectly well
acquainted with colours of all kinds, except one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
ſhade of blue, for inſtance, which it never has
been his fortune to meet with. Let all the different
ſhades of that colour, except that ſingle one, be
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0050800103:28"/>
placed before him, deſcending gradually from the
deepeſt to the lighteſt; 'tis plain, that he will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
a blank, where that ſhade is wanting, and will
be ſenſible, that there is a greater diſtance in that
place betwixt the contiguous colours than in any other. Now
I aſk, whether 'tis poſſible for him, from his own
imagination, to ſupply this deficiency, and raiſe up
to himſelf the idea of that particular ſhade, tho' it
had never been conveyed to him by his ſenſes? I
believe there are few but will be of opinion that he
can; and this may ſerve as a proof, that the ſimple
ideas are not always, in every inſtance, derived from
the correſpondent impreſſions; tho' this inſtance is
ſo ſingular, that 'tis ſcarce worth our obſerving, and
does not merit, that for it alone, we ſhould alter our
general maxim.</p>
            <p>HERE, therefore, is a propoſition, which not only
ſeems, in itſelf, ſimple and intelligible; but if a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
uſe were made of it, might render every diſpute
equally intelligible, and baniſh all that jargon, which
has ſo long taken poſſeſſion of metaphyſical reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
and drawn ſuch diſgrace upon them. All ideas,
eſpecially abſtract ones, are naturally faint and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure;
the mind has but a ſlender hold of them:
They are apt to be confounded with other reſembling
ideas; and when we have often employed any term,
tho' without a diſtinct meaning, we are apt to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
that it has a determinate idea, annexed to it.
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0050800103:29"/>
On the contrary, all impreſſions, that is, all ſenſations,
either outward or inward, are ſtrong and ſenſible:
The limits between them are more exactly deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined:
Nor is it eaſy to fall into any error or miſtake
with regard to them. When we entertain therefore
any ſuſpicion, that a philoſophical term is employed
without any meaning or idea (as is but too frequent)
we need but enquire, <hi>from what impreſſion is that
ſuppoſed idea derived?</hi> And if it be impoſſible to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
any, this will ſerve to confirm our ſuſpicion.
By bringing ideas into ſo clear a light, we may rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably
hope to remove all diſpute, which may ariſe,
concerning their nature and reality<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>'Tis probable, that no more was meant by thoſe, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied innate ideas, than that all ideas were copies of our impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; tho' it muſt be confeſſed, that the terms which they em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed were not choſen with ſuch caution, nor ſo exactly defined as to prevent all miſtakes about their doctrine. For what is meant by <hi>innate?</hi> If innate be equivalent to natural, then all the perceptions and ideas of the mind muſt be allowed to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate or natural, in whatever ſenſe we take the latter word, whether in oppoſition to what is uncommon, artificial, or mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous. If by innate be meant, cotemporary to our birth, the diſpute ſeems to be frivolous; nor is it worth while to enquire at what time thinking begins, whether before, at, or after our birth. Again, the word, <hi>idea,</hi> ſeems to be commonly taken in a very looſe ſenſe, even by Mr. LOCKE himſelf, as ſtanding for any of our perceptions, our ſenſations and paſſions, as well as thoughts. Now in this ſenſe, I ſhould deſire to know, what can be meant by aſſerting, that ſelf-love, or reſentment of injuries, or the paſſion between the ſexes is, not innate?</p>
                  <p>But admitting theſe terms, <hi>impreſſions</hi> and <hi>ideas,</hi> in the ſenſe above explained, and underſtanding by <hi>innate</hi> what is original or copied from no precedent perception, then may we aſſert, that all our impreſſions are innate, and our ideas not innate.</p>
                  <p>To be ingenuous, I muſt own it to be my opinion, that Mr. LOCKE was betrayed into this queſtion by the ſchoolmen, who making uſe of undefined terms, draw out their diſputes to a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious length, without ever touching the point in queſtion. A like ambiguity and circumlocution ſeem to run thro' all that great philoſopher's reaſonings on this ſubject.</p>

            <p>'TIS evident, that there is a principle of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion
between the different thoughts or ideas
of the mind, and that in their appearance to the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
or imagination, they introduce each other with
a certain degree of method and regularity. In our
more ſerious thinking or diſcourſe, this is ſo obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
that any particular thought, which breaks in
upon this regular tract or chain of ideas, is immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
remarked and rejected. And even in our wildeſt
and moſt wandering reveries, nay in our very dreams,
we ſhall find, if we reflect, that the imagination ran
not altogether at adventures, but that there was ſtill a
connexion upheld among the different ideas, which
ſucceeded each other. Were the looſeſt and freeſt
converſation to be tranſcribed, there would immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately

all its tranſitions. Or where this is wanting, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
who broke the thread of diſcourſe, might ſtill
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0050800103:32"/>
inform you, that there had ſecretly revolved in his
mind a ſucceſſion of thought, which had gradually led
him away from the ſubject of converſation. Among
the languages of different nations, even where we
cannot ſuſpect the leaſt connexion or communication,
'tis found, that the words, expreſſive of ideas, the
moſt compounded, do yet nearly correſpond to each
other: A certain proof, that the ſimple ideas, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
in the compound ones, were bound toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by ſome univerſal principle, which had an equal
influence on all mankind.</p>
            <p>THO' it be too obvious to eſcape obſervation, that
different ideas are connected together; I do not find,
that any philoſopher has attempted to enumerate or
claſs all the principles of aſſociation; a ſubject, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
that ſeems very worthy of curioſity. To me,
there appear to be only three principles of connexion
among ideas, <hi>viz. Reſemblance, Contiguity</hi> in time or
place, and <hi>Cauſe</hi> or <hi>Effect.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THAT theſe principles ſerve to connect ideas will
not, I believe, be much doubted. A picture natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
leads our thoughts to the original<note n="*" place="bottom">Reſemblance.</note>: The men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of one apartment in a building naturally intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces
an enquiry or diſcourſe concerning the others<note n="†" place="bottom">Contiguity.</note>:
And if we think of a wound, we can ſcarce forbear
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0050800103:33"/>
reflecting on the pain which follows it<note n="*" place="bottom">Cauſe and Effect.</note>. But that
this enumeration is compleat, and that there are no
other principles of aſſociation, except theſe, may be
difficult to prove to the ſatisfaction of the reader, or
even to a man's own ſatisfaction. All we can do, in
ſuch caſes, is to run over ſeveral inſtances, and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
carefully the principle, which binds the different
thoughts to each other, never ſtopping till we render
the principle as general as poſſible. The more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
we examine, and the more care we employ,
the more aſſurance ſhall we acquire, that the enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
which we form from the whole, is compleat
and entire. Inſtead of entering into a detail of this
kind, which would lead into many uſeleſs ſubtilties,
we ſhall conſider ſome of the effects of this connexion
upon the paſſions and imagination; where we may
open a field of ſpeculation more entertaining, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
more inſtructive, than the other.</p>
            <p>As man is reaſonable being, and is continually in
purſuit of happineſs, which he hopes to attain by
the gratification of ſome paſſion or affection, he ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
acts or ſpeaks or thinks without a purpoſe and
intention. He has ſtill ſome object in view; and
however improper the means may ſometimes be,
which he chuſes for the attainment of his end, he
never loſes view of an end, nor will he ſo much as
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0050800103:34"/>
throw away his thoughts or reflections, where he hopes
not to reap any ſatisfaction from them.</p>
            <p>IN all compoſitions of genius, therefore, 'tis requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
that the writer have ſome plan or object; and
tho' he may be hurried from this plan by the vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence
of thought, as in an ode, or drop it careleſly,
as in an epiſtle or eſſay, there muſt appear ſome aim
or intention, in his firſt ſetting out, if not in the
compoſition of the whole work. A production with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a deſign would reſemble more the raving of a
madman, than the ſober efforts of genius and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>As
this rule admits of no exception, it follows,
that in narrative compoſitions, the events or actions,
which the writer relates, muſt be connected together,
by ſome bond or tye: They muſt be related to each
other in the imagination, and form a kind of <hi>Unity,</hi>
which may bring them under one plan or view, and
which may be the object or end of the writer in his
firſt undertaking.</p>
            <p>THIS connecting principle among the ſeveral events,
which form the ſubject of a poem or hiſtory, may by
very different, according to the different deſigns of
the poet or hiſtorian. OVID has formed his plan up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the connecting principle or reſemblance. Every
ſabulous transformation, produced by the miraculous
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0050800103:35"/>
power of the gods, falls within the compaſs of his
work. There needs but this one circumſtance in any
event to bring it under his original plan or intention.</p>
            <p>AN annaliſt or hiſtorian, who ſhould undertake to
write the hiſtory of EUROPE during any century,
would be influenced by the connexion of contiguity
in time and place. All events, which happen in that
portion of ſpace, and period of time, are compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
in his deſign, tho' in other reſpects different
and unconnected. They have ſtill a ſpecies of unity,
amidſt all their diverſity.</p>
            <p>BUT the moſt uſual ſpecies of connexion among
the different events, which enter into any narrative
compoſition, is that of cauſe and effect: while the
hiſtorian traces the ſeries of actions according to their
natural order, remounts to their ſecret ſprings and
principles, and delineates their moſt remote conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences.
He chuſes for his ſubject a certain portion
of that great chain of events, which compoſe the hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
of mankind: Each link in this chain he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
to touch in his narration: Sometimes unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
ignorance renders all his attempts fruitleſs: Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
he ſupplies by conjecture what is wanting in
knowledge: And always, he is ſenſible, that the more
unbroken the chain is, which he preſents to his read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
the more perfect is his production. He ſees,
that the knowledge of cauſes is not only the moſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory;
this relation or connexion being the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0050800103:36"/>
of all others; but alſo the moſt inſtructive; ſince
it is by this knowlege alone, we are enabled to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul
events, and govern futurity.</p>
            <p>HERE therefore we may attain ſome notion of that
<hi>Unity</hi> of <hi>Action,</hi> about which all critics, after ARI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STOTLE,
have talked ſo much: Perhaps, to little
purpoſe, while they directed not their taſte or ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
by the accuracy of philoſophy. It appears,
that in all productions, as well as in the epic and
tragic, there is a certain unity required, and that, on
no occaſion, can our thoughts be allowed to run at
adventures, if we would produce a work, which will
give any laſting entertainment to mankind. It ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
alſo, that even a biographer, who ſhould write
the life of ACHILLES, would connect the events, by
ſhewing their mutual dependence and relation, as
much as a poet, who ſhould make the anger of that
hero, the ſubject of his narration<note n="*" place="bottom">Contrary to ARISTOTLE, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note>. Not only in any
limited portion of life, a man's actions have a depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
on each other, but alſo during the whole pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod
of his duration, from the cradle to the grave;
nor is it poſſible to ſtrike off one link, however mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute,
in this regular chain, without affecting the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0050800103:37"/>
whole ſeries of events, which follow. The unity of
action, therefore, which is to be found in biography
or hiſtory, differs from that of epic poetry, not in
kind, but in degree. In epic poetry, the connexion
among the events is more cloſe and ſenſible: The
narration is not carried on thro' ſuch a length of
time: And the actors haſten to ſome remarkable pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod,
which ſatisfies the curioſity of the reader. This
conduct of the epic poet depends on that particular
ſituation of the <hi>Imagination</hi> and of the <hi>Paſſions,</hi> which
is ſuppoſed in that production. The imagination,
both of writer and reader, is more enlivened, and the
paſſions more enflamed than in hiſtory, biography,
or any ſpecies of narration, which confine themſelves
to ſtrict truth and reality. Let us conſider the effect
of theſe two circumſtances, an enlivened imagination
and enflamed paſſions, circumſtances, which belong
to poetry, eſpecially the epic kind, above any other
ſpecies of compoſition; and let us examine the reaſon
why they require a ſtricter and cloſer unity in the
fable.</p>
            <p>FIRST. All poetry, being a ſpecies of painting,
approaches us nearer to the objects than any other
ſpecies of narration, throws a ſtronger light upon
them, and delineates more diſtinctly thoſe minute
circumſtances, which, tho' to the hiſtorian they ſeem
ſuperſluous, ſerve mightily to enliven the imagery,
and gratify the fancy. If it be not neceſſary, as in
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0050800103:38"/>
the <hi>Iliad,</hi> to inform us each time the hero buckles his
ſhoes, and ties his garters, it will be requiſite, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
to enter into a greater detail than in the HEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIADE;
where the events are run over with ſuch ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity,
that we ſcarce have leiſure to become acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with the ſcene or action. Were a poet, therefore,
to comprehend in his ſubject any great compaſs of
time or ſeries of events, and trace up the death of
HECTOR to its remote cauſes, in the rape of HELEN,
or the judgment of PARIS, he muſt draw out his
poem to an immeaſurable length, in order to fill this
large canvas with juſt painting and imagery. The
reader's imagination, enflamed with ſuch a ſeries of
poetical deſcriptions, and his paſſions, agitated by a
continual ſympathy with the actors, muſt flag long
before the period of the narration, and muſt ſink into
laſſitude and diſguſt, from the repeated violence of
the ſame movements.</p>
            <p>SECONDLY. That an epic poet muſt not trace the
cauſes to any great diſtance, will farther appear, if
we conſider another reaſon, which is drawn from a
property of the paſſions ſtill more remarkable and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular.
'Tis evident, that in a juſt compoſition, all
the affections, excited by the different events, deſcribed
and repreſented, add mutual force to each other; and
that while the heroes are all engaged in one common
ſcene, and each action is ſtrongly connected with the
whole, the concern is continually awake, and the paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0050800103:39"/>
make an eaſy tranſition from one object to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
The ſtrong connection of the events, as it fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitates
the paſſage of the thought or imagination
from one to another, facilitates alſo the transfuſion of
the paſſions, and preſerves the affections ſtill in the
ſame channel and direction. Our ſympathy and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
for EVE prepares the way for a like ſympathy
with ADAM: The affection is preſerved almoſt entire
in the tranſition; and the mind ſeizes immediately
the new object as ſtrongly related to that which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
engaged its attention. But were the poet to
make a total digreſſion from his ſubject, and intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
a new actor, no way connected with the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonages,
the imagination, feeling a breach in the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition,
would enter coldly into the new ſcene; would
kindle by flow degrees; and in returning to the main
ſubject of the poem, would paſs, as it were, upon
foreign ground, and have its concern to excite anew,
in order to take party with the principal actors. The
ſame inconvenience follows in a leſs degree, where
the poet traces his events to too great a diſtance, and
binds together actions, which tho' not entirely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined,
have not ſo ſtrong a connexion as is requiſite
to forward the tranſition of the paſſions. Hence ariſes
the artifice of the oblique narration, employed in the
<hi>Odyſſey</hi> AND <hi>Aeneid;</hi> where the hero is introduced, at
firſt, near the period of his deſigns, and afterwards
ſhows us, as it were in perſpective, the more diſtant
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0050800103:40"/>
events and cauſes. By this means, the reader's curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity
is immediately excited: The events follow with
rapidity, and in a very cloſe connexion: And the
concern is preſerved alive, and, by means of the near
relation of the objects, continually increaſes, from the
beginning to the end of the narration.</p>
            <p>THE ſame rule takes place in dramatic poetry;
nor is it ever permitted, in a regular compoſition, to
introduce an actor, who has no connexion, or but a
ſmall one, with the principal perſonages of the fable.
The ſpectator's concern muſt not be diverted by any
ſcenes, diſjoined and ſeparated from the reſt. This
breaks the courſe of the paſſions, and prevents that
communication of the ſeveral emotions, by which one
ſcene adds force to another, and transfuſes the pity
and terror, which it excites, upon each ſucceeding
ſcene, 'till the whole produces that rapidity of move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which is peculiar to the theatre. How muſt
it extinguiſh this warmth of affection to be enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
on a ſudden, with a new action and new per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonages,
no way related to the former; to find ſo
ſenſible a breach or vacuity in the courſe of the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
by means of this breach in the connexion of
ideas; and inſtead of carrying the ſympathy of one
ſcene into the following, to be obliged every moment,
to excite a new concern, and take party in a new
ſcene of action?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:0050800103:41"/>
BUT tho' this rule of unity of action be common
to dramatic and epic poetry; we may ſtill obſerve a
difference between them, which may, perhaps, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
our attention. In both theſe ſpecies of compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition,
'tis requiſite that the action be one and ſimple,
in order to preſerve the concern or ſympathy entire
and undiverted: But in epic or narrative poetry, this
rule is alſo eſtabliſhed upon another foundation, <hi>viz.</hi>
the neceſſity, that is incumbent on every writer, to
form ſome plan or deſign, before he enter on any
diſcourſe or narration, and to comprehend his ſubject
in ſome general aſpect or united view, which may
be the conſtant object of his attention. As the author
is entirely loſt in dramatic compoſitions, and the ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tator
ſuppoſes himſelf to be really preſent at the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
repreſented; this reaſon has no place with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
to the ſtage; but any dialogue or converſation
may be introduced, which, without improbability,
might have paſſed in that determinate portion of ſpace,
repreſented by the theatre. Hence in all our ENG<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LISH
comedies, even thoſe of CONGREVE, the unity
of action is never ſtrictly obſerved; but the poet
thinks is ſufficient, if his perſonages be any way re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
to each other, by blood, or by living in the
ſame family; and he afterwards introduces them in
particular ſcenes, where they diſplay their humours and
characters, without much forwarding the main action.
The double plots of TERENCE are licences of the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0050800103:42"/>
ſame kind; but in a leſs degree. And tho' this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
be not perfectly regular, it is not wholly unſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to the nature of comedy, where the movements
and paſſions are not raiſed to ſuch a height as in tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy;
at the ſame time, that the fiction or repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
palliates, in ſome meaſure, ſuch licences. In
a narrative poem, the firſt propoſition or deſign con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines
the author to one ſubject; and any digreſſions
of this nature would, at firſt view, be rejected, as
abſurd and monſtrous. Neither BOCCACE, LA FON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TAINE,
nor any author of that kind, tho' pleaſantry
be their chief object, have ever indulged them.</p>
            <p>To return to the compariſon of hiſtory and epic
poetry, we may conclude, from the foregoing rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings,
that as a certain unity is requiſite in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions,
it cannot be wanting to hiſtory more than
to any other; that in hiſtory, the connexion among
the ſeveral events, which unites them into one body,
is the relation of cauſe and effect, the ſame which
takes place in epic poetry; and that in the latter com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
this connexion is only required to be cloſer
and more ſenſible, on account of the lively imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and ſtrong paſſions, which muſt be touched by
the poet in his narration. The PELEPONNESIAN
war is a proper ſubject for hiſtory, the ſiege of
ATHENS for an epic poem, and the death of ALCI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BIADES
for a tragedy.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:0050800103:43"/>
As the difference, therefore, between hiſtory and
epic poetry conſiſts only in the degrees of connexion,
which bind together thoſe ſeveral events, of which
their ſubject is compoſed, 'twill be difficult, if not
impoſſible, by words, to determine exactly the bounds
which ſeparate them from each other. That is a
matter of taſte more than of reaſoning; and perhaps,
this unity may often be diſcovered in a ſubject, where,
at firſt view, and from an abſtract conſideration, we
ſhould leaſt expect to find it.</p>
            <p>'TIS evident, that HOMER, in the courſe of his
narration, exceeds the firſt propoſition of his ſubject;
and that the anger of ACHILLES, which cauſed the
death of HECTOR, is not the ſame with that which
produced ſo many ills to the GREEKS. But the ſtrong
connexion between thoſe two movements, the quick
tranſition from one to another, the contraſt<note n="*" place="bottom">Contraſt of contrariety is a connexion among ideas, which may, perhaps, be conſidered as a mixture of cauſation and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance. Where two objects are contrary, the one deſtroys the other, i. e. is the cauſe of its annihilation, and the idea of the annihilation of an object implies the idea of its former ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence.</note> between
the effects of concord and diſcord among the princes,
and the natural curioſity which we have to ſee A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CHILLES
in action, after ſuch long repoſe; all theſe
cauſes carry on the reader, and produce a ſufficient
unity in the ſubject.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:0050800103:44"/>
IT may be objected to MILTON, that he has traced
up his cauſes to too great a diſtance, and that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion
of the angles produces the fall of man by a
train of events, which is both very long and very ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual.
Not to mention that the creation of the world,
which he has related at length, is no more the cauſe
of that cataſtrophe, than of the battle of PHARSALIA,
or any other event, that has ever happened. But if
we conſider, on the other hand, that all theſe events,
the rebellion of the angels, the creation of the world,
and the fall of man, <hi>reſemble</hi> each other, in being
miraculous and out of the common courſe of nature;
that they are ſuppoſed to be <hi>contiguous</hi> in time;
and that being detached from all other events, and
being the only original facts, which revelation diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers,
they ſtrike the eye at once, and naturally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
each other to the thought or imagination: If we
conſider all theſe circumſtances, I ſay, we ſhall find,
that theſe parts of the action have a ſufficient unity
to make them be comprehended in one fable or nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.
To which we may add, that the rebellion of
the angels and the fall of man have a peculiar re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance,
as being counterparts to each other, and
preſenting to the reader the ſame moral, of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to our Creator.</p>
            <p>THESE looſe hints I have thrown together, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to excite the curioſity of philoſophers, and beget
a ſuſpicion at leaſt, if not a full perſuaſion, that this
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0050800103:45"/>
ſubject is very copious, and that many operations of
the human mind depend on the connexion or aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of ideas, which is here explained. Particularly,
the ſympathy between the paſſions and imagination
will, perhaps, appear remarkable; while we obſerve
that the affections, excited by one object, paſs eaſily
to another connected with it; but transfuſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
with difficulty, or not at all, along different
objects, which have no manner of connexion toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
By introducing, into any compoſition, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonages
and actions, foreign to each other, an injudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
author loſes that communication of emotions,
by which alone he can intereſt the heart, and raiſe
the paſſions to their proper height and period. The
full explication of this principle and all its conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
would lead us into reaſonings too profound
and too copious for this enquiry. 'Tis ſufficient, at
preſent, to have eſtabliſhed this concluſion, that the
three connecting principles of all ideas are the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of <hi>Reſemblance, Contiguity,</hi> and <hi>Cauſation.</hi>

               <p>ALL the objects of human reaſon or enquiry may
naturally be divided into two kinds, <hi>viz. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
of Ideas</hi> and <hi>Matters of Fact.</hi> Of the firſt kind
are the ſciences of Geometry, Algebra, and Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metic;
and in ſhort, every affirmation, which is either
intuitively or demonſtratively certain. <hi>That the ſquare
of the hypothenuſe is equal to the ſquares of the two ſides,</hi>
is a propoſition, which expreſſes a relation between
theſe figures. <hi>That three times five is equal to the half
of thirty,</hi> expreſſes a relation between theſe numbers.
Propoſitions of this kind are diſcoverable by the mere
operation of thought, without dependence on what is
any where exiſtent in the univerſe. Tho' there never
were a circle or triangle in nature, the truths demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated
by EUCLID, would for ever retain their cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
and evidence.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:0050800103:47"/>
MATTERS of fact, which are the ſecond objects of
human reaſon, are not aſcertained int the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner;
nor is our evidence of their truth, however
great, of a like nature with the foregoing. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
of every matter of fact is ſtill poſſible; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it can never imply a contradiction, and is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
by the mind with equal facility and diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
as if ever ſo conformable to reality. <hi>That the
ſun will not riſe to-morrow</hi> is no leſs intelligible a
propoſition, and implies no more contradiction, than
the affirmation, <hi>that it will riſe.</hi> We ſhould in vain,
therefore, attempt to demonſtrate its falſhood. Were
it demonſtratively falſe, it would imply a contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and could never be diſtinctly conceived by the
mind.</p>
               <p>IT may, therefore, be a ſubject worthy curioſity,
to enquire what is the nature of that evidence, which
aſſures us of any real exiſtence and matter of fact,
beyond the preſent teſtimony of our ſenſes, or the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords
of our memory. This part of philoſophy, 'tis
obſervable, has been little cultivated, either by the
ancients or moderns; and therefore our doubts and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,
in the proſecution of ſo important an enquiry,
may be the more excuſable, while we march thro'
ſuch difficult paths, without any guide or direction.
They may even prove uſeful, by exciting curioſity,
and deſtroying that implicit faith and ſecurity, which
is the bane of all reaſoning and free enquiry. The
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0050800103:48"/>
diſcovery of defects in the common philoſophy, if
any ſuch there be, will not, I preſume, be a diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement,
but rather an incitement, as is uſual, to
attempt ſomething more full and ſatisfactory, than
has yet been propoſed to the public.</p>
               <p>ALL reaſonings concerning matter of fact ſeem to
be founded in the relation of <hi>Cauſe</hi> and <hi>Effect.</hi> By
means of that relation alone can we go beyond the
evidence of our memory and ſenſes. If you were to
aſk a man, why he believes any matter of fact, which
is abſent; for inſtance, that his friend is in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
or in FRANCE; he would give you a reaſon;
and this reaſon would be ſome other fact; as a letter
received from him, or the knowlege of his former
reſolutions and primiſes. A man, finding a watch
or any other machine in a deſart iſland, would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
that there had once been men in that iſland.
All our reaſonings concerning fact are of the ſame
nature. And here 'tis conſtantly ſuppoſed, that there
is a connexion between the preſent fact and that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
from it. Were there nothing to bind them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
the inference would be entirely precarious.
The hearing of an articulate voice and rational diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
in the dark aſſures us of the preſence of ſome
perſon: Why? becauſe theſe are the effects of the
human make and fabric, and cloſely connected with
it. If we anatomize all the other reaſonings of this
nature, we ſhall find, that they are founded in the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0050800103:49"/>
relation of cauſe and effect, and that this relation is
either near or remote, direct or collateral. Heat and
light are collateral effects of fire, and the one effect
may juſtly be inferred from the other.</p>
               <p>IF we would ſatisfy ourſelves, therefore, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the nature of that evidence, which aſſures us of
all matters of fact, we muſt enquire how we arrive at
the knowlege of cauſe and effect.</p>
               <p>I SHALL venture to affirm, as a general propoſition,
which admits of no exception, that the knowlege of this
relation is not, in any inſtance, attained by reaſonings
<hi>à priori;</hi> but ariſes entirely from experience, when we
find, that any particular objects are conſtantly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined
with each other. Let an object be preſented
to a man of ever ſo ſtrong natural reaſon and abilities;
if that object be entirely new to him, he will not be
able, by the moſt accurate examination of its ſenſible
qualities, to diſcover any of its cauſes or effects.
ADAM, tho' his rational faculties be ſuppoſed, at the
very firſt, entirely perfect, could not have inferred
from the fluidity and tranſparency of water, that it
would ſuffocate him, or from the light and warmth of
fire, that it would conſume him. No object ever diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers,
by the qualities which appear to the ſenſes,
either the cauſes, which produced it, or the effects,
which will ariſe from it; nor can our reaſon, unaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0050800103:50"/>
by experience, ever draw any inferences con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
real exiſtence and matter of fact.</p>
               <p>THIS propoſition, <hi>that cauſe and effects are diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
not by reaſon but by experience,</hi> will readily be
admitted with regard to ſuch objects, as we remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
to have been once altogether unknown to us;
ſince we muſt be conſcious of the utter inability which
we then lay under of foretelling what would ariſe
from them. Preſent two ſmooth pieces of marble to
a man, who has no tincture of natural philoſophy;
he will never diſcover, that they will adhere together,
in ſuch a manner as to require great force to ſeparate
them in a direct line, while they make ſo ſmall a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance
to a lateral preſſure. Such events, as bear
little analogy to the common courſe of nature, are alſo
readily confeſſed to be known only by experience; nor
does any man imagine that the exploſion of gunpowder,
or the attraction of a loadſtone could ever be diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
by arguments <hi>à priori.</hi> In like manner, when
an effect is ſuppoſed to depend upon an intricate ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinery
or ſecret ſtructure of parts, we make no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty
to attribute all our knowlege of it to experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
Who will aſſert, that he can give the ultimate
reaſon, why milk or bread is proper nouriſhment for
a man, not for a lion or a tyger?</p>
               <p>BUT the ſame truth may not appear, at firſt ſight,
to have the ſame evidence with regard to events,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0050800103:51"/>
which have become familiar to us from our firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
in the world, which bear a cloſe analogy to
the whole courſe of nature, and which are ſuppoſed
to depend on the ſimple qualities of objects, without
any ſecret ſtructure of parts. We are apt to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine,
that we could diſcover theſe effects, by the mere
operations of our reaſon, without experience. We
fancy, that, were we brought, on a ſudden, into this
world, we could at firſt have inferred, that one Bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liard-ball
would communicate motion to another up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
impulſe; and that we needed not to have waited
for the event, in order to pronounce with certainty
concerning it. Such is the influence of cuſtom, that,
where it is ſtrongeſt, it not only covers our natural
ignorance, but even conceals itſelf, and ſeems not to
take place, merely becauſe it is found in the higheſt
degree.</p>
               <p>BUT to convince us, that all the laws of nature
and all the operations of bodies, without exception,
are known only by experience, the following reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
may, perhaps, ſuffice. Were any object pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
to us, and were we required to pronounce con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the effect, which will reſult from it, without
conſulting paſt obſervation; after what manner, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech
you, muſt the mind proceed in this operation?
It muſt invent or imagine ſome event, which it aſcribes
to the object as its effect; and 'tis plain that this
invention muſt be entirely arbitrary. The mind can
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0050800103:52"/>
never poſſibly find the effect in the ſuppoſed cauſe, by
the moſt accurate ſcrutiny and examination. For the
effect is totally different from the cauſe, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
can never be diſcovered in it. Motion in the
ſecond Billiard-ball is a quite diſtinct event from mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the firſt; nor is there any thing in the one to
ſuggeſt the ſmalleſt hint of the other. A ſtone or
piece of metal raiſed into the air, and left without
any ſupport, immediately falls: But to conſider the
matter <hi>à priori,</hi> is there any thing we diſcover in this
ſituation, which can beget the idea of a downward,
rather than an upward, or any other motion, in the
ſtone or metal?</p>
               <p>AND as the firſt imagination or invention of a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
effect, in all natural operations, is arbitrary,
where we conſult not experience; ſo muſt we alſo
eſteem the ſuppoſed tye or connexion between the
cauſe and effect, which binds them together, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
it impoſſible, that any other effect could reſult
from the operatioon of that cauſe. When I ſee, for
inſtance, a Billiard-ball moving in a ſtrait line towards
another; even ſuppoſe motion in the ſecond ball
ſhould by accident be ſuggeſted to me, as the reſult
of their contact or impulſe; may I not conceive, that
a hundred different events might as well follow from
that cauſe? May not both theſe balls remain at abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
reſt? May not the firſt ball return in a ſtrait line,
or leap off from the ſecond in any line or direction?
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0050800103:53"/>
All theſe ſuppoſitions are conſiſtent and conceivable.
Why then ſhould we give the preference to one,
which is no more conſiſtent nor conceivable than the
reſt? All our reaſonings <hi>à priori</hi> will never be able
to ſhew us any foundation for this preference.</p>
               <p>IN a word, then, every effect is a diſtinct event
from its cauſe. It could not, therefore, be diſcovered
In the cauſe, and the firſt invention or conception of
it, <hi>à priori,</hi> muſt be entirely arbitrary. And even
after it is ſuggeſted, the conjunction of it with the
cauſe muſt appear equally arbitrary; ſince there are
always many other effects, which, to reaſon, muſt
ſeem fully as conſiſtent and natural. In vain, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
ſhould we pretend to determine any ſingle event,
or infer any cauſe or effect, without the aſſiſtance of
obſervation and experience.</p>
               <p>HENCE we may diſcover the reaſon, why no philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher,
who is rational and modeſt, has ever pretended
to aſſign the ultimate cauſe of any natural operation,
or to ſhow diſtinctly the action of that power, which
produced any ſingle effect in the univerſe. 'Tis con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed,
that the utmoſt effort of human reaſon is, to
reduce the principles, productive of natural phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena,
to a greater ſimplicity, and to reſolve the
many particular effects into a few general cauſe, by
means of reaſonings from analogy, experience, and
obſervation. But as to the cauſes of theſe general
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0050800103:54"/>
cauſes, we ſhould in vain attempt their diſcovery;
nor ſhall we ever be able to ſatisfy ourſelves, by any
particular explication of them. Theſe ultimate ſprings
and principles are totally ſhut up from human curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity
and enquiry. Elaſticity, gravity, coheſion of
parts, communication of motion by impulſe; theſe
are probably the ultimate cauſes and principles which
we ſhall ever diſcover in nature; and we may eſteem
ourſelves ſufficiently happy, if, by accurate enquiry
and reaſoning, we can trace up the particular phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena
to, or near to, theſe general principles. The
moſt perfect philoſophy of the natural kind only
ſtaves off our ignorance a little longer: As perhaps
the moſt perfect philoſophy of the moral or metaphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical
kind ſerves only to diſcover larger portion of
our ignorance. Thus the obſervation of human
blindneſs and weakneſs is the reſult of all philoſophy,
and meets us, at every turn, in ſpight of our endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
to elude or avoid it.</p>
               <p>NOR is geometry, when taken into the aſſiſtance
of natural philoſophy, ever able to remedy this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
or lead us into the knowlege of ultimate cauſes,
by all that accuracy of reaſoning, for which it is ſo
juſtly celebrated. Every part of mixed mathematics
goes upon the ſuppoſition, that certain laws are eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed
by nature in her operations; and abſtract rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings
are employed, either to aſſiſt experience in
the diſcovery of theſe laws, or to determine their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0050800103:55"/>
in particular inſtances, where it depends upon
any preciſe degrees of diſtance and quantity. Thus
'tis a law of motion, diſcovered by experience, that
the moment or force of any body in motion is in the
compound ratio or proportion of its ſolid contents and
its velocity; and conſequently, that a ſmall ſorce may
remove the greateſt obſtacle or raiſe the greateſt weight,
if by any contrivance or machinery we can encreaſe
the velocity of that force, ſo as to make it an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>match
for its antagoniſt. Geometry aſſiſts us in the
application of this law, by giving us the juſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſions
of all the parts and figures, which can enter
into any ſpecies of machine; but ſtill the diſcovery
of the law itſelf is owing merely to experience, and
all the abſtract reaſonings in the world could never
lead us one ſtep towards the knowlege of it. When
we reaſon <hi>à priori,</hi> and conſider merely any object or
cauſe, as it appears to the mind, independent of all
obſervation, it never could ſuggeſt to us the notion
of any diſtinct object, ſuch as its effect; much leſs,
ſhew us the inſeparable and inviolable connection be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them. A man muſt be very ſagacious, who
could diſcover by reaſoning, that cryſtal is the effect
of heat, and ice of cold, without being previouſly
acquainted with the operations of theſe qualities.</p>

               <p>BUT we have not, as yet, attained any tolerable
ſatisfaction with regard to the queſtion firſt propoſed.
Each ſolution ſtill gives riſe to a new queſtion as dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult
as the foregoing, and leads us on to farther en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries.
When it is aſked, <hi>What is the nature of all
our reaſonings concerning matter of fact?</hi> The proper
anſwer ſeems to be, that they are founded on the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of cauſe and effect. When again it is aſked,
<hi>What is the foundation of all our reaſonings and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions
concerning that relation?</hi> it may be replied in
one word, EXPERIENCE. But if we ſtill carry on
our ſifting humour, and aſk, <hi>What is the foundation
of all our concluſions from experience?</hi> this implies a
new queſtion, which may be of more difficult ſolution
and explication. Philoſophers, that give themſelves
airs of ſuperior wiſdom and ſufficiency, have a hard
taſk, when they encounter perſons of inquiſitive diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions,
who puſh them from every corner, to which
they retreat, and who are ſure at laſt to bring them
to ſome dangerous dilemma. The beſt expedient to
prevent this confuſion, is to be modeſt in our preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions;
and even to diſcover the difficulty ourſelves
before it is objected to us. By this means, we may
make a kind of merit of our very ignorance.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:0050800103:57"/>
I SHALL content myſelf, in this ſection, with an
eaſy taſk, and ſhall pretend only to give a negative
anſwer to the queſtion here propoſed. I ſay then,
that even after we have experience of the operations
of cauſe and effect, our concluſions from that experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
are <hi>not</hi> founded on reaſoning, or any proceſs of
the underſtanding. This anſwer we muſt endeavour,
both to explain and to defend.</p>
               <p>IT muſt certainly be allowed, that nature has kept
us at a great diſtance from all her ſecrets, and has
aoffrded us only the knowlege of a few ſuperficial
qualities of objects, while ſhe conceals from us thoſe
powers and principles, on which the influence of theſe
objects entirely depends. Our ſenſes inform us of
the colour, weight, and conſiſtence of bread; but
neither ſenſes nor reaſon ever can inform us of thoſe
qualities, which fit it for the nouriſhment and ſupport
of a human body. Sight or feeling conveys an idea
of the actual motion of bodies; but as to that won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
force or power, which would carry on a mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
body for ever in a continued change of place,
and which bodies never loſe but by communicating it
to others; of this we cannot form the moſt diſtant
conception. But notwithanding this ignorance of
natural powers<note n="*" place="bottom">The word, Power, is here uſed in a looſe and popular ſenſe. The more accurate explication of it would give additional evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to this argument. See Sect. 7.</note> and principles, we always preſume,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0050800103:58"/>
where we ſee like ſenſible qualities, that they have
like ſecret powers, and lay our account, that effects,
ſimilar to thoſe, which we have experienced, will
follow from them. If a body of like colour and
conſiſtence with that bread, which we have formerly
eat, be preſented to us, we make no ſcruple of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating
the experiment, and expect, with certainty, like
nouriſhment and ſupport. Now this is a proceſs of
the mind or thought, of which I would willingly
know the foundation. 'Tis allowed on all hands, that
there is no known connection between the ſenſible
qualities and the ſecret powers; and conſequently,
that the mind is not led to form ſuch a concluſion
concerning their conſtant and regular conjunction, by
any thing which it knows of their nature. As to
paſt <hi>Experience,</hi> it can be allowed to give <hi>direct</hi> and
<hi>certain</hi> information only of thoſe preciſe objects, and
that preciſe period of time, which fell under its cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance:
But why this experience ſhould be extended
to future times, and to other objects, which, for
aught we know, may be only in appearance ſimilar;
this is the main queſtion on which I would inſiſt. The
bread, which I formerly eat, nouriſhed me; that is,
a body of ſuch ſenſible qualities, was, at that time,
endued with ſuch ſecret powers: But does it follow,
that other bread muſt alſo nouriſh me at another time,
and that like ſenſible qualities muſt always be attended
with like ſecret powers? The conſequence ſeems no
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0050800103:59"/>
way neceſſary. At leaſt, it muſt be acknowleged,
that there is here a conſequence drawn by the mind;
that there is a certain ſtep taken; a proceſs of thought,
and an inference, which wants to be explained. Theſe
two propoſitions are far from being the ſame, <hi>I have
found that ſuch an object has always been attended with
ſuch an effect,</hi> and <hi>I foreſee, that other objects, which
are, to appearance, ſimilar, will be attended with ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
effects.</hi> I ſhall allow, if you pleaſe, that the one
propoſition may juſtly be inferred from the other: I
know in fact, that it always is inferred. But if you
inſiſt, that the inference is made by a chain of reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
I deſire you to produce that reaſoning. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection
between theſe propoſitions is not intuitive.
There is required a medium, which may enable the
mind to draw ſuch an inference; if indeed it be drawn
by reaſoning and argument. What that medium is,
I muſt confeſs, paſſes my comprehenſion; and 'tis
incumbent on thoſe to produce it, who aſſert, that it
really exiſts, and is the origin of all our concluſions
concerning matter of fact.</p>
               <p>THIS negative argument muſt certainly, in proceſs
of time, become altogether convincing, if many pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrating
and able philoſophers ſhall turn their inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
this way; and no one be ever able to diſcover
any connecting propoſition or intermediate ſtep, which
ſupports the underſtanding in this concluſion. But as
the queſtion is yet new, every reader may not truſt ſo
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0050800103:60"/>
far to his own penetration, as to conclude, becauſe an
argument eſcapes his reſearch and enquiry, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it does not really exiſt. For this reaſon it may
be requiſite to venture upon a more difficult taſk;
and enumerating all the branches of human knowlege,
endeavour to ſhew, that none of them can afford ſuch
an argument.</p>
               <p>ALL reaſonings may be divided into two kinds,
<hi>viz.</hi> demonſtrative reaſonings, or thoſe concerning
relations of ideas, and moral reaſonings or thoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
matter of fact and exiſtence. That there are
no demonſtrative arguments in the caſe, ſeems evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent;
ſince it implies no contradiction, that the courſe
of nature may change, and that an object ſeemingly
like thoſe which we have experienced, may be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
with different or contrary effects. May I not
clearly and diſtinctly conceive, that a body falling
from the clouds, and which, in all other reſpects,
reſembles ſnow, has yet the taſte of ſalt or feeling of
fire? Is there any more intelligible propoſition than
to affirm, that all the trees will flouriſh in DE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CEMBER
and JANUARY, and decay in MAY and
JUNE? Now whatever is intelligible, and can be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctly
conceived, implies no contradiction, and can
never be proved falſe by any demonſtrative argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
or abſtract reaſonings <hi>à priori.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:0050800103:61"/>
IF we be, therefore, engaged by arguments to put
truſt in paſt experience, and make it the ſtandard of
our future judgment, theſe arguments muſt be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
only, or ſuch as regard matter of fact and real
exiſtence, according to the diviſion above-mentioned.
But that there are no arguments of this kind, muſt
appear, if our explication of that ſpecies of reaſoning be
admitted as ſolid and ſatisfactory. We have ſaid, that
all arguments concerning exiſtence are founded on the
relation of cauſe and effect; that our knowlege of
that relation is derived entirely from experience, and
that all our experimental concluſions proceed upon
the ſuppoſition that the future will be conformable to
the paſt. To endeavour, therefore, the proof of this
laſt ſuppoſition by probable arguments, or arguments
regarding exiſtence, muſt be evidently going in a
circle, and taking that for granted, which is the very
point in queſtion.</p>
               <p>IN reality, all arguments from experience are
founded on the ſimilarity, which we diſcover among
natural objects, and by which we are induced to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
effects ſimilar to thoſe, which we have found to
follow from ſuch objects. And tho' none but a fool
or madman will ever pretend to diſpute the authority
of experience, or to reject that great guide of human
life; it may ſurely be allowed a philoſopher to have
ſo much curioſity at leaſt, as to examine the principle
of human nature which gives this mighty authority to
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0050800103:62"/>
experience, and makes us draw advantage from that
ſimilarity, which nature has placed among different
objects. From cauſes, which appear <hi>ſimilar,</hi> we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
ſimilar effects. This is the ſum of all our expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimental
concluſions. Now it ſeems evident, that if
this concluſion were formed by reaſon, it would be
as perfect at firſt, and upon one inſtance, as after ever
ſo long a courſe of experience. But the caſe is far
otherwiſe. Nothing ſo like as eggs; yet no one, on
account of this apparent ſimilarity, expects the ſame
taſte and reliſh in all of them. 'Tis only after a long
courſe of uniform experiments in any kind, that we
attain a firm reliance and ſecurity with regard to a
particular event. Now where is that proceſs of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning,
which from one inſtance draws a concluſion,
ſo different from that which it infers from an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
inſtances, that are no way different from that
ſingle inſtance? This queſtion I propoſe as much for
the ſake of information, as with an intention of raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
difficulties. I cannot find, I cannot imagine any
ſuch reaſoning. But I keep my mind ſtill open to
inſtruction, if any one will vouchſafe to beſtow it
on me.</p>
               <p>SHOULD it be ſaid, that from a number of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
experiments, we <hi>infer</hi> a connection between the
ſenſible qualities and the ſecret powers; this, I muſt
confeſs, ſeems the ſame difficulty, couched in diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0050800103:63"/>
terms. The queſtion ſtill recurs, On what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
of argument this <hi>inference</hi> is founded? Where
is the medium, the interpoſing ideas, which join pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>popoſitions
ſo very wide of each other? 'Tis con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed,
that the colour, conſiſtence and other ſenſible
qualities of bread appear not, of themſelves, to have
any connexion with the ſecret powers of nouriſhment
and ſupport. For otherwiſe we could infer theſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
powers from the firſt appearance of theſe ſenſible
qualities, without the aid of experience; contrary to
the ſentiment of all philoſophers, and contrary to
plain matter of fact. Here then is our natural ſtate
of ignorance with regard to the powers and influence
of all objects. How is this remedied by experience?
It only ſhews us a number of uniform effects, reſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from certain objects, and teaches us, that thoſe
particular objects, at that particular time, were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed
with ſuch powers and forces. When a new
object, endowed with ſimilar ſenſible qualities is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced,
we expect ſimilar powers and forces, and lay
our account with a like effect. From a body of like
colour and conſiſtence with bread, we look for like
nouriſhment and ſupport. But this furely is a ſtep or
progreſs of the mind, which wants to be explained.
When a man ſays, <hi>I have found, in all paſt inſtances,
ſuch ſenſible qualities, conjoined with ſuch ſecret powers:</hi>
And when he ſays, <hi>ſimilar ſenſible qualities will always
be conjoined with ſimilar ſecret powers;</hi> he is not guilty
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:0050800103:64"/>
of a tautology, nor are theſe propoſitions in any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
the ſame: You ſay that the one propoſition is
an inference from another. But you muſt confeſs,
that the inference is not intuitive; neither is it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrative:
Of what nature is it then? To ſay it
is experimental is begging the queſtion. For all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
from experience ſuppoſe, as their foundation,
that the future will reſemble the paſt, and that ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
powers will be conjoined with ſimilar ſenſible qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities.
If there be any ſuſpicion, that the courſe of
nature may change, and that the paſt may be no rule
for the future, all experience becomes uſeleſs, and
can give riſe to no inference or concluſion. 'Tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible,
therefore, that any arguments from experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
can prove this reſemblance of the paſt to the
future; ſince all theſe arguments are founded on the
ſuppoſition of that reſemblance. Let the courſe of
things be allowed hitherto ever ſo regular; that alone,
without ſome new argument or inference, proves not,
that, for the future, it will continue ſo. In vain do
you pretend to have learnt the nature of bodies from
your paſt experience. Their ſecret nature, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently,
all their effects and influence may change,
without any change in their ſenſible qualities. This
happens ſometimes, and with regard to ſome objects:
Why may it not happen always, and with regard to
all objects? What logic, what proceſs of argument
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0050800103:65"/>
ſecures you againſt this ſuppoſition? My Practice, you
ſay, refutes my doubts. But you miſtake the purport
of my queſtion. As an agent, I am quite ſatisfied in
the point; but as a philoſopher, who has ſome ſhare
of curioſity, I will not ſay ſcepticiſm, I want to learn
the foundation of this inference. No reading, no
enquiry has yet been able to remove my difficulty,
or give me ſatisfaction in a matter of ſuch vaſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance.
Can I do better than propoſe the difficulty
to the public, even tho', perhaps, I have ſmall hopes
of obtaining a ſolution? We ſhall at leaſt, by this
means, be ſenſible of our ignorance, if we do not
augment our knowlege.</p>
               <p>I MUST confeſs, that a man is guilty of unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable
arrogance, who concludes, becauſe an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
has eſcaped his own inveſtigation, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it does not really exiſt. I muſt alſo confeſs,
that tho' all the learned, for ſeveral ages, ſhould have
employed their time in fruitleſs ſearch upon any ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
it may ſtill, perhaps, be raſh to conclude poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively,
that the ſubject muſt, therefore, paſs all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
comprehenſion. Even tho' we examine all the
ſources of our knowlege, and conclude them unfit
for ſuch a ſubject, there may ſtill remain a ſuſpicion,
that the enumeration is not compleat, or the exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
not accurate. But with regard to the preſent
ſubject, there are ſome conſiderations, which ſeem to
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0050800103:66"/>
remove all this accuſation of arrogance or ſuſpicion
of miſtake.</p>
               <p>'TIS certain, that the moſt ignorant and ſtupid pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants, nay infants, nay even brute beaſts improve by
experience, and learn the qualities of natural objects,
by obſerving the effects, which reſult from them.
When a child has felt the ſenſation of pain from
touching the flame of a candle, he will be careful not
to put his hand near any candle; but will expect a
ſimilar effect from a cauſe, which is ſimilar in its
ſenſible qualities and appearance. If you aſſert, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
that the underſtanding of the child is led into
this concluſion by any proceſs of argument or ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cination,
I may juſtly require you to produce that
argument; nor have you any pretext to refuſe ſo
equitable a demand. You cannot ſay, that the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
is abſtruſe, and may poſſibly eſcape your
enquiry; ſince you confeſs, that it is obvious to the
capacity of a mere infant. If you heſitate, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
a moment, or if, after reflection, you produce
any intricate or profound argument, you, in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
give up the queſtion, and confeſs, that it is
not reaſoning which engages us to ſuppoſe the paſt
reſembling the future, and to expect ſimilar effects
from cauſes, which are, to appearance, ſimilar. This
is the propoſition, which I intended to enforce in
the preſent ſection. If I be right, I pretend to have
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0050800103:67"/>
made no mighty diſcovery. And if I be wrong, I
muſt acknowlege myſelf to be indeed a very back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
ſcholar: ſince I cannot now diſcover an argument,
which, it ſeems, was perfectly familiar to me, long
before I was out of my cradle.</p>

               <p>THE paſſion for philoſophy, like that for religion,
ſeems liable to this inconvenience, that, tho' it
aims at the correction of our manners, and extirpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of our vices, it may only ſerve, by imprudent
management, to foſter a predominant inclination, and
puſh the mind, with more determined reſolution, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
that ſide, which already <hi>draws</hi> too much, by
the byaſs and propenſity of the natural temper.
'Tis certain, that, while we aſpire to the magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
firmneſs of the philoſophic ſage, and endeavour
to confine our pleaſures altogether within our own
minds, we may, at laſt, render our philoſophy, like
that of EPICTETUS, and other <hi>Stoics,</hi> only a more
refined ſyſtem of ſelfiſhneſs, and reaſon ourſelves out
of all virtue, as well as ſocial enjoyment. While we
ſtudy with attention the vanity of human life, and
turn all our thoughts on the empty and tranſitory
nature of riches and honors, we are, perhaps, all the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0050800103:69"/>
while flattering our natural indolence, which, hating
the buſtle of the world and drudgery of buſineſs,
ſeeks a pretext of reaſon, to give itſelf a full and
uncontroled indulgence. There is, however, one
ſpecies of philoſophy, which ſeems little liable to
this inconvenience, and that becauſe it ſtrikes in with
no diſorderly paſſion of the human mind, nor can
mingle itſelf with any natural affection or propenſity;
and that is the ACADEMIC or SCEPTICAL philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy.
The academics talk always of doubts, and
ſuſpenſe of judgment, of danger in haſty determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
of confining to very narrow bounds the enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of the underſtanding, and of renouncing all ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations
which lie not within the limits of common
life and practice. Nothing, therefore, can be more
contrary than ſuch a philoſophy to the ſupine indo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of the mind, its raſh arrogance, its lofty pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions,
and its ſuperſtitious credulity. Every paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
is mortfied by it, except the love of truth; and
that paſſion never is, nor can be carried to too high
a degree. 'Tis ſurprizing, therefore, that this philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy,
which, in almoſt every inſtance, muſt be
harmleſs and innocent, ſhould be the ſubject of ſo
much groundleſs reproach and obloquy. But, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
the very circumſtance which renders it ſo inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,
is what chiefly expoſes it to the public hatred,
and reſentment. By flattering no irregular paſſion, it
gains few partizans: By oppoſing ſo many vices and
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0050800103:70"/>
follies, it raiſes to itſelf abundance of enemies, who
ſtigmatize it as libertine, profane, and irreligious.</p>
               <p>NOR need we fear, that this philoſophy, while
it endeavours to limit our enquiries to common life,
ſhould ever undermine the reaſonings of common
life, and carry its doubts ſo far as to deſtroy all action,
as well as ſpeculation. Nature will always maintain
her rights, and prevail in the end over any abſtract
reaſoning whatſoever. Tho' we ſhould conclude,
for inſtance, as in the foregoing ſection, that, in all
reaſonings from experience, there is a ſtep taken by
the mind, which is not ſupported by any argument
or proceſs of the underſtanding; there is no danger,
that theſe reaſonings, on which almoſt all knowledge
depends, will ever be affected by ſuch a diſcovery.
If the mind be not engaged by argument to make
this ſtep, it muſt be induced by ſome other principle
of equal weight and authority; and that principle
will preſerve its influence as long as human nature re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
the ſame. What that principle is, may well
be worth the pains of enquiry.</p>
               <p>SUPPOSE a perſon, tho' endowed with the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
faculties of reaſon and reflection, to be brought
on a ſudden into this world; he would, indeed, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
obſerve a continual ſucceſſion of objects,
and one event following another; but he would not
be able to diſcover any thing farther. He would
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:0050800103:71"/>
not, at firſt, by any reaſoning, be able to reach the
idea of cauſe and effect; ſince the particular powers,
by which all natural operations are performed, never
appear to the ſenſes; nor is it reaſonable to conclude,
merely becauſe one event, in one inſtance, precedes
another, that therefore the one is the cauſe, and the
other the effect. Their conjunction may be arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and caſual. There may be no reaſon to infer the
exiſtence of the one from the appearance of the
other. And in a word, ſuch a perſon without more
experience, could never employ his conjecture or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning
concerning any matter or fact, or be aſſured
of any thing beyond what was immediately preſent
to his memory and ſenſes.</p>
               <p>SUPPOSE again, that he has acquired more expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience,
and has lived ſo long in the world as to have
obſerved ſimilar objects or events to be conſtantly
conjoined together; what is the conſequence of this
experience? He immediately inſers the exiſtence of
the one object from the appearance of the other.
Yet he has not, by all his experience, acquired any
idea or knowlege of the ſecret power, by which the
one object produces the other; nor is it, by any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
of reaſoning, he is engaged to draw this infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.
But ſtill he finds himſelf determined to draw
it: And tho' he ſhould be convinced, that his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
has no part in the operation, he would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs
continue in the ſame courſe of thinking.
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:0050800103:72"/>
There is ſome other principle, which determines him
to form ſuch a concluſion.</p>
               <p>THIS principle is CUSTOM or HABIT. For where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
the repetition of any particular act or operation
produces a propenſity to renew the ſame act or ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
without being impelled by any reaſoning or
proceſs of the underſtanding; we always ſay, that
this propenſity is the effect of <hi>Cuſtom.</hi> By employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that word, we pretend not to have given the ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
reaſon of ſuch a propenſity. We only point out
a principle of human nature, which is univerſally ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged,
and which is well known by its effects.
Perhaps, we can puſh our enquiries no farther, or
pretend to give the cauſe of this cauſe; but muſt reſt
contented with it as the ultimate principle, which
we can aſſign of all our concluſions from experience.
'Tis ſufficient ſatisfaction, that we can go ſo far;
without repining at the narrowneſs of our faculties,
becauſe they will carry us no farther. And 'tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
we here advance a very intelligible propoſition at
leaſt, if not a true one, when we aſſert, that, after
the conſtant conjunction of two objects, heat and
flame, for inſtance, weight and ſolidity, we are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
by cuſtom alone to expect the one from
the appearance of the other. This hypotheſis ſeems
even the only one, which explains the difficulty,
why we draw, from a thouſand inſtances, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,
which we are not able to draw from
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:0050800103:73"/>
one inſtance, that is, in no reſpect, different from
them. Reaſon is incapable of any ſuch varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
The concluſions, which it draws from conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
one circle, are the ſame which it would form
upon ſurveying all the circles in the univerſe. But no
man, having ſeen only one body move after being
impelled by another, could infer, that every other
body will move after a like impulſe. All inferences
from experience, therefore, are effects of cuſtom, not
of reaſoning<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>Nothing is more uſual than for writers even on <hi>moral, poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical,</hi> or <hi>phyſical</hi> ſubjects, to diſtinguiſh between <hi>reaſon</hi> and <hi>experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> and to ſuppoſe, that theſe ſpecies of argumentation are entirely different from each other. The former are taken for the mere reſult of our intellectual faculties, which, by conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>à priori</hi> the nature of things, and examining the effects, that muſt follow from their operation, eſtabliſh particular principles of ſcience and philoſophy. The latter are ſuppoſed to be derived entirely from ſenſe and obſervation, by which we learn what has actually reſulted from the operation of particular objects, and are thence able to infer, what will, for the future, reſult from them. Thus, for inſtance, the limitations and reſtraints of civil government, and a legal conſtitution may be deſended, either from <hi>reaſon,</hi> which, reflecting on the great frailty and corruption of human nature, teaches, that no man can ſafely be truſted with unlimited authority; or from <hi>experience</hi> and hiſtory, which inform us of the enormous abuſes, that ambition, in every age and country, has been found to make of ſo imprudent a confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
                     <p>The ſame diſtinction betwixt reaſon and experience is main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in all our deliberations concerning the conduct of life; while the experienced ſtateſman, general, phyſician or merchant is truſted and followed; and the unpractiſed novice, with what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever natural talents endowed, neglected and deſpiſed. Tho' it be allowed, that reaſon may form very plauſible conjectures with regard to the conſequences of ſuch a particular conduct in ſuch particular circumſtances; 'tis ſtill ſuppoſed imperfect, without the aſſiſtance of experience, which is alone able to give ſtability and certainty to the maxims, derived from ſtudy and reflection.</p>
                     <p>But notwithſtanding that this diſtinction be thus univerſally received, both in the active and ſpeculative ſcenes of life, I ſhall not ſcruple to pronounce, that it is, at bottom, erroneous, or at leaſt, ſuperficial.</p>
                     <p>If we examine thoſe arguments, which, in any of the ſciences above-mentioned, are ſuppoſed to be the mere effects of reaſoning and reflection, they will all be found to terminate, at laſt, in ſome general principle or concluſion, for which we can aſſign no reaſon but obſervation and experience. The only difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them and thoſe maxims, which are vulgarly eſteemed the reſult of pure experience, is, that the former cannot be eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed without ſome proceſs of thought, and ſome reflection on what we have obſerved, in order to diſtinguiſh its circumſtances, and trace its conſequences: Whereas in the latter, the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced event is exactly and fully ſimilar to that which we infer as the reſult of any particular ſituation. The hiſtory of a TIBE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIUS or a NERO makes us dread a like tyranny were our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs freed from the reſtraints of laws and ſenates: But the obſervation of any fraud or cruelty in private life is ſufficient, with the aid of a little thought, to give us the ſame apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; while it ſerves as an inſtance of the general corruption of human nature, and ſhews us the danger which we muſt incur by repoſing an entire confidence in mankind. In both caſes, 'tis experience which is ultimately the foundation of our inference and concluſion.</p>
                     <p>There is no man ſo young and unexperienced, as not to have formed from obſervation, many general and juſt maxims con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning human affairs and the conduct of life; but it muſt be confeſſed, that, when a man comes to put theſe in practice, he will be extremely liable to error, till time and farther experience, both enlarge theſe maxims, and teach him their proper uſe and application. In every ſituation or incident, there are many par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular and ſeemingly minute circumſtances, which the man of greateſt talents is, at firſt, apt to overlook, tho' on them the juſtneſs of his concluſions, and conſequently the prudence of his conduct, entirely depend. Not to mention, that, to a young beginner, the general obſervations and maxims occur not always on the proper occaſions, nor can be immediately applied with due calmneſs and diſtinction. The truth is, an unexperienced reaſoner could be no reaſoner at all, were he abſolutely unexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced; and when we aſſign that character to any one, we mean it only in a comparative ſenſe, and ſuppoſe him poſſeſſed of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, in a ſmaller and more imperfect degree.</p>
                  </note>.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:0050800103:74"/>
CUSTOM, then, is the great guide of human life.
'Tis that principle alone, which renders our expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:0050800103:75"/>
uſeful to us, and makes us expect for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
a ſimilar train of events with thoſe which have
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:0050800103:76"/>
appeared in the paſt. Without the influence of cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom,
we ſhould be entirely ignorant of every matter
of fact, beyond what is immediately preſent to the
memory and ſenſes. We ſhould never know how to
adjuſt means to ends, or to employ our natural powers
in the production of any effect. There would be an
end at once of all action, as well as of the chief part
of ſpeculation.</p>
               <p>BUT here it may be proper to remark, that tho'
our concluſions from experience carry us beyond our
memory and ſenſes, and aſſure us of matters of fact,
which happened in the moſt diſtant places and moſt
remote ages; yet ſome fact muſt always be preſent
to the ſenſes or memory, from which we may firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
in drawing theſe concluſions. A man, who
ſhould find in a deſert country the remains of pomp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
buildings, would conclude, that the country had,
in antient times, been cultivated by civilized inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants;
but did nothing of this nature occur to him,
he could never form ſuch an inference. We learn the
events of former ages from hiſtory; but then we muſt
peruſe the volumes, in which this inſtruction is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
and thence carry up our inferences from one
teſtimony to another, till we arrive at the eye-witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
and ſpectators of theſe diſtant events. In a word,
if we proceed not upon ſome fact, preſent to the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
or ſenſes, our reaſonings would be merely hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothetical;
and however the particular links might
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:0050800103:77"/>
be connected with each other, the whole chain of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
would have nothing to ſupport it, nor could
we ever, by its means, arrive at the knowlege of
any real exiſtence. If I aſk, why you believe any
particular matter of fact, which you relate, you muſt
tell me ſome reaſon; and this reaſon will be ſome
other fact, connected with it: But as you cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
after this manner, <hi>in infinitum,</hi> you muſt at laſt
terminate in ſome fact, which is preſent to your me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
or ſenſes; or muſt allow, that your belief is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
without foundation.</p>
               <p>WHAT then is the concluſion of the whole matter?
A ſimple one; tho' it muſt be confeſſed, pretty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
from the common theories of philoſophy. All
belief of matter of fact or real exiſtence is derived
merely from ſome object, preſent to the memory or
ſenſes, and a cuſtomary conjunction betwixt that and
any other object. Or in other words; having found,
in many inſtances, that any two kinds of objects,
flame and heat, ſnow and cold, have always been
conjoined together; if flame or ſnow be preſented
anew to our ſenſes; the mind is carried by cuſtom to
expect heat or cold, and to <hi>believe,</hi> that ſuch a qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
does exiſt, and will diſcover itſelf upon a nearer
approach. This belief is the neceſſary reſult of plac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the mind in ſuch circumſtances. 'Tis an opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the ſoul, when we are ſo ſituated, as unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
as to feel the paſſion of love, when we receive
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:0050800103:78"/>
benefits, or hatred, when we meet with injuries.
All theſe operations are a ſpecies of natural inſtincts,
which no reaſoning or proceſs of the thought and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
is able, either to produce, or to prevent.</p>
               <p>AT this point, it would be very allowable for us
to ſtop our philoſophical reſearches. In moſt queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
we can never make a ſingle ſtep farther; and
in all queſtions, we muſt terminate here at laſt, after
our moſt reſtleſs and curious enquiries. But ſtill our
curioſity will be pardonable, perhaps commendable,
if it carry us on to ſtill farther reſearches, and make
us examine more accurately the nature of this <hi>belief,</hi>
and of the <hi>cuſtomary conjunction,</hi> whence it is derived.
By this means we may meet ſome explications and
analogies, that will give ſatisfaction; at leaſt to ſuch
as love the abſtract ſciences, and can be entertained
with ſpeculations, which, however accurate, may
ſtill retain a degree of doubt and uncertainty. As to
readers of a different taſte; the remaining part of
this ſection is not calculated for them, and the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
enquiries may well be underſtood, tho' it be
neglected.</p>

               <p>THERE is nothing more free than the imagination
of man; and tho' it cannot exceed that original ſtock
of ideas, which is furniſhed by the internal and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:0050800103:79"/>
ſenſes, it has unlimited power of mixing, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding,
ſeparating, and dividing theſe ideas, to
all the varieties of fiction and viſion. It can feign a
train of events, with all the appearance of reali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
aſcribe to them a particular time and place, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
them as exiſtent, and paint them out to itſelf
with every circumſtance, that belongs to any hiſtorical
fact, which it believes with the greateſt certainty.
Wherein, therefore, conſiſts the difference between
ſuch a fiction and belief? It lies not merely in any
peculiar idea, which is annexed to ſuch a conception,
as commands our aſſent, and which is wanting to every
known fiction. For as the mind has authority over
all its ideas, it could voluntarily annex this particular
idea to any fiction, and conſequently be able to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
whatever it pleaſes; contrary to what we find
by daily experience. We can, in our conception,
join the head of a man to the body of a horſe; but
it is not in our power to believe, that ſuch an animal
has ever really exiſted.</p>
               <p>IT follows, therefore, that the difference between
<hi>fiction</hi> and <hi>belief</hi> lies in ſome ſentiment or feeling,
which is annexed to the latter, not to the former, and
which depends not on the will, nor can be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
at pleaſure. It muſt be excited by nature,
like all other ſentiments; and muſt ariſe from the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
ſituation, in which the mind is placed at any
particular juncture. Whenever any object is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:0050800103:80"/>
to the memory or ſenſes, it immediately, by
the force of cuſtom, carries the imagination to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
that object, which is uſually conjoined to it;
and this conception is attended with a feeling or ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent,
different from the looſe reveries of the fancy.
In this conſiſts the whole nature of belief. For as
there is no matter of fact which we believe ſo firmly,
that we cannot conceive the contrary, there would
be no difference between the conception aſſented to,
and that which is rejected, were it not for ſome ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent,
which diſtinguiſhes the one from the other.
If I ſee a billiard-ball moving towards another, on a
ſmooth table, I can eaſily conceive it to ſtop upon
contact. This conception implies no contradiction;
but ſtill it feels very differently from that conception,
by which I repreſent to myſelf the impulſe, and the
communication of motion from one ball to another.</p>
               <p>WERE we to attempt a <hi>definition</hi> of this ſentiment,
we ſhould, perhaps, find it a very difficult, if not an
impoſſible taſk; in the ſame manner as if we ſhould
endeavour to define the feeling of cold or paſſion of
anger, to a creature who never had an experience of
theſe ſentiments. BELIEF is the true and proper
name of this feeling; and no one is ever at a loſs to
know the meaning of that term; becauſe every man
is every moment conſcious of the ſentiment, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
by it. It may not, however, be improper to
attempt a <hi>deſcription</hi> of this ſentiment; in hopes we
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:0050800103:81"/>
may, by that means, arrive at ſome analogies, which
may afford a more perfect explication of it. I ſay
then, that belief is nothing but a more vivid, lively,
forcible, firm, ſteady conception of an object, than
what the imagination alone is ever able to attain.
This variety of terms, which may ſeem ſo unphilo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophical,
is intended only to expreſs that act of the
mind, which renders realities, or what is taken for
ſuch, more preſent to us than fictions, cauſes them to
weigh more in the thought, and gives them a ſuperior
influence on the paſſions and imagination. Provided
we agree about the thing, 'tis needleſs to diſpute
about the terms. The imagination has the command
over all its ideas, and can join and mix and vary
them, in all the ways poſſible. It may conceive ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
objects with all the circumſtances of place and
time. It may ſet them, in a manner, before our eyes,
in their true colors, juſt as they might have exiſted.
But as it is impoſſible, that that faculty of imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
can ever, of itſelf, reach belief, 'tis evident,
that belief conſiſts not in the peculiar nature or order
of ideas, but in the <hi>manner</hi> of their conception, and
in their <hi>feeling</hi> to the mind. I confeſs, that 'tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
perfectly to explain this feeling or manner of
conception. We may make uſe of words, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
ſomething near it. But its true and proper
name, as we obſerved before, is <hi>belief;</hi> which is a
term, that every one ſufficiently underſtands in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
life. And in philoſophy, we can go no farther
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:0050800103:82"/>
than aſſert, that <hi>belief</hi> is ſomething felt by the mind,
which diſtinguiſhes the ideas of the judgment from
the fictions of the imagination. It gives them more
force and influence; makes them appear of greater
importance; inforces them in the mind; and renders
them the governing principle of all our actions. I
hear at preſent, for inſtance, a perſon's voice, with
whom I am acquainted; and the ſound comes as from
the next room. This impreſſion of my ſenſes imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
conveys my thought to the perſon, together
with all the ſurrounding objects. I paint them out to
myſelf as exiſting at preſent, with the ſame qualities
and relations, of which I formerly knew them poſſeſt.
Theſe ideas take faſter hold of my mind, than ideas
of an inchanted caſtle. They are very different to
the feeling, and have a much greater influence of
every kind, either to give pleaſure or pain, joy or ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.</p>
               <p>LET
us, then, take in the whole compaſs of this
doctrine, and allow, that the ſentiment of belief is
nothing but a conception of an object more intenſe
and ſteady than what attends the mere fictions of the
imagination, and that this <hi>manner</hi> of conception ariſes
from a cuſtomary conjunction of the object with
ſomething preſent to the memory or ſenſes: I believe
that it will not be difficult, upon theſe ſuppoſitions,
to find other operations of the mind analogous to it,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:0050800103:83"/>
and to trace up theſe phaenomena to principles ſtill
more general.</p>
               <p>WE have already obſerved, that nature has eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed
connexions among particular ideas, and that
no ſooner one idea occurs to our thoughts than it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduces
its correlative, and carries our attention to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
it, by a gentle and inſenſible movement. Theſe
principles of connexion or aſſociation we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to three, <hi>viz. Reſemblance, Contiguity,</hi> and
<hi>Cauſation;</hi> which are the only bonds, that unite our
thoughts together, and beget that regular train of
reflection or diſcourſe, which, in a greater or leſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
takes place among all mankind. Now here
ariſes a queſtion, on which the ſolution of the preſent
difficulty will depend. Does it happen, in all theſe
relations, that, when one of the objects is preſented
to the ſenſes or memory, the mind is not only carried
to the conception of the correlative, but reaches a
ſteadier and ſtronger conception of it than what other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
it would have been able to attain? This ſeems
to be the caſe with that belief, which ariſes from the
relation of cauſe and effect. And if the caſe be the
ſame with the other relations or principles of aſſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,
we may eſtabliſh this as a general law, which
takes place in all the operations of the mind.</p>
               <p>WE may, therefore, obſerve, as the firſt experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to our preſent purpoſe, that, upon the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:0050800103:84"/>
of the picture of an abſent friend, our idea of
him is evidently enlivened by the <hi>reſemblance,</hi> and
that every paſſion, which that idea occaſions, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of joy or ſorrow, acquires new force and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor.
In producing this effect, there concur both a
relation and a preſent impreſſion. Where the picture
bears him no reſemblance, or at leaſt was not intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for him, it never ſo much as conveys our thought
to him: And where it is abſent, as well as the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;
though the mind may paſs from the thought of
the one to that of the other; it feels its idea to be
rather weakened than enlivened by that tranſition.
We take a pleaſure in viewing the picture of a friend,
when 'tis ſet before us; but when 'tis removed, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
chuſe to conſider him directly, than by reflection
in an image, which is equally diſtant and obſcure.</p>
               <p>THE ceremonies of the ROMAN CATHOLIC reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
may be conſidered as experiments of the ſame
nature. The devotees of that ſuperſtition uſually
plead in excuſe of the mummeries, with which they
are upbraided, that they feel the good effect of thoſe
external motions, and poſtures, and actions, in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livening
their devotion and quickening their ſervor,
which otherwiſe would decay, if directed intirely to
diſtant and immaterial objects. We ſhadow out the
objects of our faith, ſay they, in ſenſible types and
images, and render them more preſent to us by the
immediate preſence of theſe types, than 'tis poſſible
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:0050800103:85"/>
for us to do, merely by an intellectual view and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation.
Senſible objects have always a greater
influence on the fancy than any other; and this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
they readily convey to thoſe ideas, to which
they are related, and which they reſemble. I ſhall
only infer from theſe practices, and this reaſoning,
that the effect of reſemblance in enlivening the ideas
is very common; and as in every caſe a reſemblance
and a preſent impreſſion muſt concur, we are abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
ſupplied with experiments to prove the reality
of the foregoing principle.</p>
               <p>WE may add force to theſe experiments by others
of a different kind, in conſidering the effects of <hi>conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guity</hi>
as well as of <hi>reſemblance.</hi> 'Tis certain that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
diminiſhes the force of every idea, and that
upon our approach to any object; tho' it does not
diſcover itſelf to our ſenſes; it operates upon the
mind with an influence, which imitates an immediate
impreſſion. The thinking on any object readily
tranſports the mind to what is contiguous; but
'tis only the actual preſence of an object, that tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
it with a ſuperior vivacity. When I am a
few miles from home, whatever relates to it touches
me more nearly than when I am two hundred leagues
diſtant; tho' even at that diſtance the reflecting on
any thing in the neighbourhood of my friends or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
naturally produces an idea of them. But as in
this latter caſe, both the objects of the mind are
ideas; notwithſtanding there is an eaſy tranſition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:0050800103:86"/>
them; that tranſition alone is not able to give
a ſuperior vivacity to any of the ideas, for want of
ſome immediate impreſſion<note n="*" place="bottom">

               <p>NO one can doubt but cauſation has the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
as the other two relations of reſemblance and
contiguity. Superſtitious people are fond of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licts
of ſaints and holy men, for the ſame reaſon,
that they ſeek after types or images, in order to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liven
their devotion, and give them a more intimate
and ſtrong conception of thoſe exemplary lives, which
they deſire to imitate. Now 'tis evident, that one
of the beſt relicts, which a devotee could procure,
would be the handywork of a ſaint; and if his cloaths
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:0050800103:87"/>
and furniture are ever to be conſidered in this light,
'tis becauſe they were once at his diſpoſal, and were
moved and affected by him; in which reſpect they
are to be conſidered as imperfect effects, and as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected
with him by a ſhorter chain of conſequences
than any of thoſe, by which we learn the reality of
his exiſtence.</p>
               <p>SUPPOSE, that the ſon of a friend, who had been
long dead or abſent, were preſented to us; 'tis evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
that this object would inſtantly revive its corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative
idea, and recal to our thoughts all paſt intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
and familiarities in more lively colors than they
would otherwiſe have appeared to us. This is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
phaenomenon, which ſeems to prove the principle
above-mentioned.</p>
               <p>WE may obſerve, that in theſe phaenomena the
belief of the correlative object is always pre-ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed;
without which the relation could have no ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
in enlivening the idea. The influence of the
picture ſuppoſes, that we <hi>believe</hi> our friend to have
once exiſted. Contiguity to home can never excite
our ideas of home, unleſs we <hi>believe</hi> that it really ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts.
Now I aſſert, that this belief, where it reaches
beyond the memory or ſenſes, is of a ſimilar nature,
and ariſes from ſimilar cauſes, with the tranſition of
thought and vivacity of conception here explained.
When I throw a piece of dry wood into a fire, my
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:0050800103:88"/>
mind is immediately carried to conceive, that it aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
not extinguiſhes the flame. This tranſition of
thought from the cauſe to the effect proceeds not from
reaſon. It derives its origin altogether from cuſtom
and experience. And as it firſt begins from an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
preſent to the ſenſes, it renders the idea or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
of flame more ſtrong and lively than any
looſe, floating reverie of the imagination. That idea
ariſes immediately. The thought moves inſtantly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
it, and conveys to it all that force of concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which is derived from the impreſſion preſent to
the ſenſes. When a ſword is levelled at my breaſt,
does not the idea of wound and pain ſtrike me more
ſtrongly, than when a glaſs of wine is preſented to
me, even tho' by accident this idea ſhould occur after
the appearance of the latter object? But what is there
in this whole matter to cauſe ſuch a ſtrong concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
except only a preſent object and cuſtomary tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
to the idea of another object, which we have
been accuſtomed to conjoin with the former? This is
the whole operation of the mind in all our concluſions
concerning matter of fact and exiſtence; and 'tis a
ſatisfaction to find ſome analogies, by which it may
be explained. The tranſition from a preſent object
does in all caſes give ſtrength and ſolidity to the related
idea.</p>
               <p>HERE is a kind of pre-eſtabliſhed harmony be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the courſe of nature and the ſucceſſion of our
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:0050800103:89"/>
ideas; and tho' the powers and forces, by which the
former is governed, be wholly unknown to us; yet
our thoughts and conceptions have ſtill, we find, gone
on in the ſame train with the other works of nature.
Cuſtom is that admirable principle, by which this
correſpondence has been effected; ſo neceſſary to the
ſubſiſtence of our ſpecies, and the regulation of our
conduct, in every circumſtance and occurrence of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
life. Had not the preſence of an object inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
excited the idea of thoſe objects, commonly
conjoined with it, all our knowledge muſt have been
limited to the narrow ſphere of our memory and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes;
and we ſhould never have been able to adjuſt
means to ends, nor employ our natural powers, either
to the producing of good, or avoiding of evil. Thoſe,
who delight in the diſcovery and contemplation of <hi>fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
cauſes,</hi> have here ample ſubject to employ their
wonder and admiration.</p>
               <p>I SHALL add, for a further confirmation of the
foregoing theory, that as this operation of the mind,
by which we infer like effects from like cauſes, and
<hi>vice verſa,</hi> is ſo eſſential to the ſubſiſtence of all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
creatures, it is not probable that it could be
truſted to the fallacious deductions of our reaſon,
which is ſlow in its operations; appears not, in any
degree, during the firſt years of infancy; and at beſt
is, in every age and period of human life, extremely
liable to error and miſtake. 'Tis more conformable
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:0050800103:90"/>
to the ordinary wiſdom of nature of ſecure ſo neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
an act of the mind, by ſome inſtinct or mechanical
tendency, which may be infallible in its operations,
may diſcover itſelf at the firſt appearance of life and
thought, and may be independent of all the labored
deductions of the underſtanding. As nature has
taught us the uſe of our limbs, without giving us the
knowledge of the muſcles and nerves, by which they
are actuated; ſo has ſhe implanted in us an inſtinct,
which carries forward the thought in a correſpondent
courſe to that which ſhe has eſtabliſhed among exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
objects; tho' we are ignorant of thoſe powers
and forces, on which this regular courſe and ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of objects totally depends.</p>

and begets a like ſpecies of belief or opinion.</p>
            <p>THERE is certainly a probability, which ariſes from
a ſuperiority of chances on any ſide; and according
as this ſuperiority encreaſes, and ſurpaſſes the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
chances, the probability receives a proportionable
encreaſe, and begets ſtill a higher degree of belief or
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:0050800103:92"/>
aſſent to that ſide, in which we diſcover the ſuperio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.
If a dye were marked with one figure or num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of ſpots on four ſides, and with another figure
or number of ſpots on the two remaining ſides, it
would be more probable, that the former ſhould turn
up than the latter; tho' if it had a thouſand ſides
marked in the ſame manner, and only one ſide diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
the probability would be much higher, and
our belief or expectation of the event more ſteady
and ſecure. This proceſs of the thought or reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
may ſeem trivial and obvious; but to thoſe, who
conſider it more narrowly, it may, perhaps, afford
matter for very curious ſpeculations.</p>
            <p>IT ſeems evident, that when the mind looks for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
to diſcover the event, which may reſult from the
throw of ſuch a dye, it conſiders the turning up of
each particular ſide as alike probable; and this is the
very nature of chance, to render all the particular
events, comprehended in it, entirely equal. But
finding a greater number of ſides concur in the one
event than in the other, the mind is carried more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
to that event, and meets it oftener, in revolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the various poſſibilities or chances, on which the
ultimate reſult depends. This concurrence of ſeveral
views in one particular event begets immediately, by
an inexplicable contrivance of nature, the ſentiment
of belief, and gives that event the advantage over its
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:0050800103:93"/>
antagoniſt, which is ſupported by a ſmaller number
of views, and recurs leſs frequently to the mind. If
we allow, that belief is nothing but a firmer and
ſtronger conception of an object than what attends
the mere fictions of the imagination, this operation
may, perhaps, in ſome meaſure, be accounted for.
The concurrence of theſe ſeveral views or glimpſes
imprints its idea more ſtrongly on the imagination;
gives it ſuperior force and vigor; renders its influence
on the paſſions and affections more ſenſible; and in
a word, begets that reliance or ſecurity, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutes
the nature of belief and opinion.</p>
            <p>THE caſe is the ſame with the probability of cauſes,
as with that of chance. There are ſome cauſes,
which are entirely uniform and conſtant in producing
a particular effect; and no inſtance has ever yet been
found of any failure or irregularity in their operation.
Fire has always burnt, and water ſuffocated every hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
creature: The production of motion by impulſe
and gravity is an univerſal law, which has hitherto
admitted of no exception. But there are other cauſes
which have been found more irregular and uncertain;
nor has rhubarb proved always a purge, or opium a
ſoporific to every one, who has taken theſe medicines.
'Tis true, when any cauſe fails of producing its uſual
effect, philoſophers aſcribe not this to any irregularity
in nature; but ſuppoſe, that ſome ſecret cauſes, in
the particular ſtructure of parts, have prevented the
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:0050800103:94"/>
operation. Our reaſonings, however, and conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
concerning the event are the ſame as if this prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
had no place. Being determined by cuſtom to
transfer the paſt to the future, in all our inferences;
where the paſt has been entirely regular and uniform,
we expect the event with the greateſt aſſurance, and
leave no room for any contrary ſuppoſition. But
where different effects have been found to follow from
cauſes, which are <hi>to appearance</hi> exactly ſimilar, all
theſe various effects muſt occur to the mind in tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
the paſt to the future, and enter into our conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,
when we determine the probability of the
event. Tho' we give the preference to that which
has been found moſt uſual, and believe that this effect
will exiſt, we muſt not overlook the other effects, but
muſt give each of them a particular weight and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
in proportion as we have found it to be more
or leſs frequent. 'Tis more probable, in every place
of EUROPE, that there will be froſt ſometime in JA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NUARY,
than that the weather will continue open
throughout that whole month; who' this probability
varies according to the different climates, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
to a certainty in the more northern king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms.
Here then it ſeems evident, that when we
transfer the paſt to the future, in order to determine
the effect, which will reſult from any cauſe, we tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
all the different events, in the ſame proportion as
they have appeared in the paſt, and conceive one to
have exiſted a hundred times, for inſtance, another
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:0050800103:95"/>
ten times, and another once. As a great number of
views do here concur in one event, they fortify and
confirm it to the imagination, beget that ſentiment
which we call <hi>belief,</hi> and give it the preference above
its antagoniſt, which is not ſupported by an equal
number of experiments, and occurs not ſo frequently
to the thought in transferring the paſt to the future.
Let any one try to account for this operation of the
mind upon any of the received ſyſtems of philoſophy,
and he will be ſenſible of the difficulty. For my part,
I ſhall think it ſufficient, if the preſent hints excite
the curioſity of philoſophers, and make them ſenſible
how extremely defective all common theories are, in
treating of ſuch curious and ſuch ſublime ſubjects.</p>

               <p>THE great advantage of the mathematical ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
above the moral conſiſts in this, that the
ideas of the former, being ſenſible, are always clear
and determinate, the ſmalleſt diſtinction between
them is immediately perceptible, and the ſame terms
are ſtill expreſſive of the ſame ideas, without ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guity
or variation. An oval is never miſtaken for a
circle, nor an hyperbola for an ellipſis. The iſoſceles
and ſcalenum are diſtinguiſhed by boundaries more
exact than vice and virtue, right and wrong. If any
term be deſined in geometry, the mind readily, of it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
ſubſtitutes, on all occaſions, the definition for the
term defined; Or even when no definition is employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
the object itſelf may be preſented to the ſenſes,
and by that means be ſteadily and clearly apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
But the finer ſentiments of the mind, the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the underſtanding, the various agitations of
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:0050800103:97"/>
the paſſions, tho' really in themſelves diſtinct, eaſily
eſcape us, when ſurveyed by reflection; nor is it in
our power to recall the original object, as often as we
have occaſion to contemplate it. Ambiguity, by this
means, is gradually introduced into our reaſonings:
Similar objects are readily taken to be the ſame: And
the concluſion becomes at laſt very wide of the premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</p>
               <p>ONE
may ſafely, however, affirm, that, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
theſe ſciences in a proper light, their advantages
and diſadvantages very nearly compenſate each other,
and reduce both of them to a ſtate of equality. If
the mind with greater facility retains the ideas of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ometry
clear and determinate, it muſt carry on a
much longer and more intricate chain of reaſoning,
and compare ideas much wider of each other, in order
to reach the abſtruſer truths of that ſcience. And if
moral ideas are apt, without extreme care, to fall into
obſcurity and confuſion, the inferences are always
much ſhorter in theſe diſquiſitions, and the interme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
ſteps, which lead to the concluſion, much fewer
than in the ſciences which treat of quantity and num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.
In reality, there is ſcarce a propoſition in EU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CLID
ſo ſimple, as not to conſiſt of more parts, than
are to be found in any moral reaſoning which runs
not into chimera and conceit. Where we trace the
principles of the human mind thro' a few ſteps, we
may be very well ſatisfied with our progreſs; conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:0050800103:98"/>
how ſoon nature throws a bar to all our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries
concerning cauſes, and reduces us to an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment
of our ignorance. The chief obſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
therefore, to our improvement in the moral or
metaphyſical ſciences is the obſcurity of the ideas, and
ambiguity of the terms. The principal difficulty in
the mathematics is the length of inferences and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs
of thought, requiſite to the forming any conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.
And perhaps, our progreſs in natural philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy
is chiefly retarded by the want of proper expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments
and phaenomena, which often are diſcovered
by chance, and cannot always be found, when requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite,
even by the moſt diligent and prudent inquiry.
As moral philoſophy ſeems hitherto to have received
leſs improvements than either geometry or phyſics,
we may conclude, that, if there be any difference in
this reſpect among theſe ſciences, the difficulties,
which obſtruct the progreſs of the former, require ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior
care and capacity to be ſurmounted.</p>
               <p>THERE are no ideas, which occur in metaphyſics,
more obſcure and uncertain, than thoſe of <hi>power<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
force, energy,</hi> or <hi>neceſſary connexion,</hi> of which it is every
moment neceſſary for us to treat in all our diſquiſitions.
We ſhall, therefore, endeavour, in this ſection, to fix,
if poſſible, the preciſe meaning of theſe terms, and
thereby remove ſome part of that obſcurity, which is
ſo much complained of in this ſpecies of philoſophy.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="100" facs="tcp:0050800103:99"/>
IT ſeems a propoſition, which will not admit of
much diſpute, that all our ideas are nothing but co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies
of our impreſſions, or, in other words, that 'tis
impoſſible for us to <hi>think</hi> of any thing, which we have
not antecedently <hi>felt,</hi> either by our external or internal
ſenſes. I have endeavoured<note n="*" place="bottom">Section II.</note> to explain and prove
this propoſition, and have expreſſed my hopes, that,
by a proper application of it, men may reach a greater
clearneſs and preciſion in philoſophical reaſonings,
than what they have hitherto been ever able to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.
Complex ideas may, perhaps, be well known
by definition, which is nothing but an enumeration of
thoſe parts or ſimple ideas, that compoſe them. But
when we have puſhed up definitions to the moſt ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
ideas, and find ſtill ſome ambiguity and obſcurity;
what reſource are we then poſſeſſed of? By what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention
can we throw light upon theſe ideas, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
them altogether preciſe and determinate to our
intellectual view? Produce the impreſſions or original
ſentiments, from which the ideas are copied. Theſe
impreſſions are all ſtrong and ſenſible. They admit
not of ambiguity. They are not only placed in a
full light themſelves, but may throw light on their
correſpondent ideas, which lie in obſcurity. And by
this means, we may, perhaps, attain a new microſcope
or ſpecies of optics, by which, in the moral ſciences,
the moſt minute, and moſt ſimple ideas may be ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:0050800103:100"/>
as to fall readily under our apprehenſion, and
be equally known with the groſſeſt and moſt ſenſible
ideas, which can be the object of our inquiry.</p>
               <p>To be fully acquainted, therefore, with the idea of
power or neceſſary connexion, let us examine its im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion;
and in order to find the impreſſion with
greater certainty, let us ſearch for it in all the ſources,
from which it may poſſibly be derived.</p>
               <p>WHEN we look about us towards external objects,
and conſider the operation of cauſes, we are never
able, in a ſingle inſtance, to diſcover any power or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
connexion; any quality, which binds the effect
to the cauſe, and renders the one an infallible conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
of the other. We only find, that the one
does actually, in fact, follow the other. The impulſe
of one billiard-ball is attended with motion in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond.
This is the whole that appears to the <hi>outward</hi>
ſenſes. The mind feels no ſentiment or <hi>inward</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
from this ſucceſſion of objects: Conſequently,
there is not, in any ſingle, particular inſtance of cauſe
and effect, any thing which can ſuggeſt the idea of
power or neceſſary connexion.</p>
               <p>FROM the firſt appearance of an object, we never
can conjecture what effect will reſult from it. But
were the power or energy of any cauſe diſcoverable by
the mind, we could foreſee the effect, even without
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:0050800103:101"/>
experience, and might, at firſt, pronounce with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
concerning it, by the mere dint of thought and
reaſoning.</p>
               <p>IN reality, there is no part of matter, that does ever,
by its ſenſible qualities, diſcover any power or energy,
or give us ground to imagine, that it could produce
any thing, or be followed by any other object, which
we could denominate its effect. Solidity, extenſion,
motion; theſe qualities are all complete in themſelves,
and never point out any other event which may reſult
from them. The ſcenes of the univerſe are continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſhifting, and one object follows another in an unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted
ſucceſſion; but the power or force, which
actuates the whole machine, is intirely concealed from
us, and never diſcovers itſelf in any of the ſenſible qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
of body. We know, that, in fact, heat is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
attendant of flame; but what is the connexion
between them, we have no room ſo much as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture
or imagine. 'Tis impoſſible, therefore, that
the idea of power can be derived from the contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation
of bodies, in ſingle inſtances of their operation;
becauſe no bodies ever diſcover any power, which can
be the original of this idea<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. LOCKE, in his chapter of power, ſays that finding from experience, that there are ſeveral new productions in matter, and concluding that there muſt ſomewhere be a power capable of producing them, we arrive at laſt by this reaſoning at the idea of power. But no reaſoning can ever give us a new, original, ſimple idea; as this philoſopher himſelf confeſſes. This, therefore, can never be the origin of that idea.</note>.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="103" facs="tcp:0050800103:102"/>
SINCE, therefore, external objects, as they appear
to the ſenſes, give us no idea of power or neceſſary
connexion, by their operations in particular inſtances,
let us ſee, whether this idea be derived from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection
on the operations of our own minds, and be
copied from any internal impreſſion. It may be ſaid,
that we are every moment conſcious of power in our
own minds; while we feel, that, by the ſimple com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of our will, we can move the organs of our
body, or direct the faculties of our minds, in their
operation. An act of volition produces motion in our
limbs, or raiſes a new idea in our imagination. This
influence of the will we know by conſciouſneſs.
Hence we acquire the idea of power or energy; and
are certain, that we ourſelves and all other intelligent
beings are poſſeſſed of power. This idea, then, is an
idea of reflection, ſince it ariſes from reflecting on the
operations of our own minds, and on the command
which is exerciſed by will, both over the organs of
the body and faculties of the mind.</p>
               <p>WE ſhall proceed to examine this pretenſion; and
firſt with regard to the influence of volition over the
organs of the body. This influence, we may obſerve,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:0050800103:103"/>
is a fact, which, like all other natural operations, can
be known only by experience, and can never be
foreſeen from any apparent energy or power in
the cauſe, which connects it with the effect, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
the one an inſallible conſequence of the other.
The motion of our body follows upon the command
of our will. Of this we are every moment con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious:
But the means, by which this is effected; the
energy, by which the will performs ſo extraordinary
an operation; of this we are ſo far from being imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
conſcious, that it muſt for ever eſcape our moſt
diligent inquiry.</p>
               <p>FOR <hi>firſt;</hi> is there any principle in all nature more
myſterious than the union of ſoul with body; by
which a ſuppoſed ſpiritual ſubſtance acquires ſuch an
influence over a material one, that the moſt refined
thought is able to actuate the groſſeſt matter? Were
we empowered, by a ſecret wiſh, to remove moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
or control the planets in their orbit; this exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
authority would not be more extraordinary, nor
more beyond our comprehenſion. But if by conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs
we perceived any power or energy in the will,
we muſt know this power; we muſt know its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion
with the effect; we muſt know the ſecret
union of ſoul and body, and the nature of both theſe
ſubſtances: by which the one is able to operate, in ſo
many inſtances, upon the other.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="105" facs="tcp:0050800103:104"/>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> We are not able to move all the organs
of the body with a like authority; tho' we cannot aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
any other reaſon, beſides experience, for ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
a difference betwixt one and the other.
Why has the will an influence over the tongue and
fingers, and not over the heart or liver? This queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
would never embarraſs us, were we conſcious of a
power in the former caſe, and not in the latter. We
ſhould then perceive, independent of experience, why
the authority of will over the organs of the body is
circumſcribed within ſuch particular limits. Being in
that caſe fully acquainted with the power or force, by
which it operates, we ſhould alſo know, why its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
reaches preciſely to ſuch boundaries, and no
farther.</p>
               <p>A MAN, ſtruck ſuddenly with a palſy in the leg or
arm, or who had newly loſt thoſe members, frequently
endeavours, at firſt to move them, and employ them
in their uſual offices. Here he is as much conſcious
of power to command ſuch limbs, as a man in perfect
health is conſcious of power to actuate any member
which remains in its natural ſtate and condition. But
conſciouſneſs never deceives. Conſequently, neither
in the one caſe nor in the other, are we ever conſcious
of any power. We learn the influence of our will
from experience alone. And experience only teaches
us, how one event conſtantly follows another, without
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:0050800103:105"/>
inſtructing us in the ſecret connexion, which binds
them together, and renders them inſeparable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> WE learn from anatomy, that the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
object of power in voluntary motion, is not the
member itſelf which is moved, but certain muſcles,
and nerves, and animal ſpirits, and perhaps, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
ſtill more minute and more unknown, thro'
which the motion is ſucceſſively propagated, ere it
reach the member itſelf whoſe motion is the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
object of volition. Can there be a more certain
proof, that the power, by which this whole operation
is performed, ſo far from being directly and fully
known by an inward ſentiment or conſciouſneſs, is, to
the laſt degree, myſterious and unintelligible? Here
the mind wills a certain event: Immediately, another
event, unknown to ourſelves, and totally different
from that intended, is produced: This event produces
another, equally unknown: Till at laſt, thro' a long
ſucceſſion, the deſired event is produced. But if the
original power were felt, it muſt be known: Were it
known, its effect muſt alſo be known; ſince all power
is relative to its effect. And <hi>vice verſa,</hi> if the effect be
not known, the power cannot be known or felt. How
indeed can we be conſcious of a power to move our
limbs, when we have no ſuch power; but only that to
move certain animal ſpirits, which, tho' they produce
at laſt the motion of our limbs, yet operate in ſuch a
manner as is wholly beyond our comprehenſion?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:0050800103:106"/>
WE may, therefore, conclude from the whole, I
hope, without any temerity, tho' with aſſurance; that
our idea of power is not copied from any ſentiment or
conſciouſneſs of power within ourſelves, when we give
riſe to animal motion, or apply our limbs to their
proper uſe and office. That their motion follows the
command of the will is a matter of common expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience,
like other natural events: But the power or
energy, by which this is effected, like that in other
natural events, is unknown and inconceivable<note n="*" place="bottom">It may be pretended, that the reſiſtance which we meet with in bodies, obliging us frequently to exert our force, and call up all our power, this gives us the idea of force and power. 'Tis this <hi>niſus</hi> or ſtrong endeavour, of which we are conſcious, that is the original impreſſion from which this idea is copied. But, <hi>firſt,</hi> we attribute power to a vaſt number of objects, where we never can ſuppoſe this reſiſtance or exertion of force to take place; to the Supreme Being, who never meets with any reſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; to the mind in its command over its ideas and limbs, in common thinking and motion, where the effect follows imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately upon the will, without any exertion or ſummoning up of force; to inanimate matter, which is not capable of this ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <hi>Secondly,</hi> This ſentiment of an endeavour to overcome reſiſtance has no known connexion with any event: What fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows it, we know by experience; but could not know it <hi>à priori.</hi> It muſt, however, be confeſſed, that the animal <hi>niſus,</hi> which we experience, tho' it can afford no accurate preciſe idea of power, enters very much into that vulgar, inaccurate idea, which is formed of it. See p. 121.</note>.</p>
               <p>SHALL We then aſſert, that we are conſcious of a
power or energy in our own minds, when, by an act
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:0050800103:107"/>
or command of our will, we raiſe up a new idea, fix
the mind to a contemplation of it, turn it on all ſides,
and at laſt diſmiſs it for ſome other idea, when we
think, that we have ſurveyed it with ſufficient accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy?
I believe the ſame arguments will prove, that
even this command of the will gives us no real idea of
force or energy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> IT muſt be allowed, that when we know a
power, we know that very circumſtance in the cauſe,
by which it is enabled to produce the effect: For
theſe are ſuppoſed to be ſynonimous. We muſt,
therefore, know both the cauſe and effect, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
between them. But do we pretend to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with the nature of the human ſoul and the
nature of an idea, or the aptitude of the one to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
the other? This is a real creation; a production
of ſomething out of nothing: Which implies a power
ſo great, that it may ſeem, at firſt ſight, beyond the
reach of any being, leſs than infinite. At leaſt it muſt
be owned, that ſuch a power is not felt, nor known,
nor even conceivable by the mind. We only feel the
event, <hi>viz.</hi> The exiſtence of an idea, confequent to a
command of the will: But the manner, in which this
operation is performed; the power, by which it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced;
is intirely beyond our comprehenſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> THE command of the mind over itſelf is
limited, as well as its command over the body; and
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:0050800103:108"/>
theſe limits are not known by reaſon, or any acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
with the nature of the cauſe and effect; but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by experience and obſervation, as in all other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
events and in the operation of external objects.
Our authority over our ſentiments and paſſions is
much weaker than that over our ideas; and even the
latter authority is circumſcribed within very narrow
boundaries. Will any one pretend to aſſign the ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
reaſon of theſe boundaries, or ſhow why the
power is deficient in one caſe and not in another?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> THIS ſelf-command is very different at
different times. A man in health poſſeſſes more of
it, than one languiſhing with ſickneſs. We are more
maſter of our thoughts in the morning than in the
evening: Faſting, than after a full meal. Can we
give any reaſon for theſe variations, except experience?
Where then is the power, of which we pretend to be
conſcious? Is there not here, either in a ſpiritual or
material ſubſtance, or both, ſome ſecret mechaniſm or
ſtructure of parts, upon which the effect depends, and
which being intirely unknown to us, renders the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
or energy of the will equally unknown and incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible?</p>
               <p>VOLITION
is ſurely an act of the mind, with which
we are ſufficiently acquainted. Reflect upon it. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
it on all ſides. Do you find any thing in it like
this creative power, by which it raiſes from nothing a
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:0050800103:109"/>
new idea, and with a kind of FIAT, imitates the omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potence
of its Maker, if I may be allowed ſo to ſpeak,
who called forth into exiſtence all the various ſcenes
of nature? So far from being conſcious of this energy
in the will, it requires as certain experience, as that of
which we are poſſeſſed, to convince us, that ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
effects do ever reſult from a ſimple act of
volition.</p>
               <p>THE generality of mankind never find any diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
in accounting for the more common and familiar
operations of nature; ſuch as the deſcent of heavy
bodies, the growth of plants, the generation of ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals,
or the nouriſhment of bodies by food: But ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
that, in all theſe caſes, they perceive the very
force or energy of the cauſe, by which it is connected
with its effect, and is for ever infallible in its opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
They acquire, by long habit, ſuch a turn of
mind, that, upon the appearance of the cauſe, they
immediately expect with aſſurance its uſual attendant,
and hardly conceive it poſſible, that any other event
could reſult from it. 'Tis only on the diſcovery of
extraordinary phaenomena, ſuch as earthquakes, peſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilence,
and prodigies of any kind, that they find
themſelves at a loſs to aſſign a proper cauſe, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
the manner in which the effect is produced by
it. 'Tis uſual for men, in ſuch difficulties, to have
recourſe to ſome inviſible, intelligent principle<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</note>, as
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:0050800103:110"/>
the immediate cauſe of that event, which ſurpriſes
them, and which, they think, cannot be accounted
for from the common powers of nature. But philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers,
who carry their ſcrutiny a little farther, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
perceive, that, even in the moſt familiar
events, the energy of the cauſe is as unintelligible as
in the moſt unuſual, and that we only learn by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
the frequent CONJUNCTION of objects, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
being ever able to comprehend any thing like
CONNEXION between them. Here then, many philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers
think themſelves obliged by reaſon to have
recourſe, on all occaſions, to the ſame principle, which
the vulgar never appeal to but in caſes, that appear
miraculous and ſupernatural. They acknowledge
mind and intelligence to be, not only the ultimate
and original cauſe of all things, but the immediate
and ſole cauſe of every event, which appears in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
They pretend, that thoſe objects, which are
commonly denominated <hi>cauſes,</hi> are in reality nothing
but <hi>occaſions;</hi> and that the true and direct principle of
every effect is not any power or force in nature, but a
volition of the Supreme Being, who wills, that ſuch
particular objects ſhould, for ever, be conjoined with
each other. Inſtead of ſaying, that one billiard-ball
moves another, by a force which it has derived from
the author of nature; 'tis the Deity himſelf, they ſay,
who, by a particular volition, moves the ſecond ball,
being determined to this operation by the impulſe of
the firſt ball; in conſequence of thoſe general laws,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:0050800103:111"/>
which he has laid down to himſelf in the government
of the univerſe. But philoſophers, advancing ſtill in
their inquiries, diſcover, that, as we are totally igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of the power on which depends the mutual ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of bodies, we are no leſs ignorant of that power,
on which depends the operation of mind on body, or
of body on mind; nor are we able, either from our
ſenſes or conſciouſneſs, to aſſign the ultimate principle
in one caſe, more than in the other. The ſame ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance,
therefore, reduces them to the ſame conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.
They aſſert, that the Deity is the immediate
cauſe of the union between ſoul and body, and that
they are not the organs of ſenſe, which, being agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by external objects, produce ſenſations in the
mind; but that 'tis a particular volition of our omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent
Maker, which excites ſuch a ſenſation, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
of ſuch a motion in the organ. In like
manner, it is not any energy in the will, that produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
local motion in our members: 'Tis God himſelf,
who is pleaſed to ſecond our will, in itſelf impotent,
and to command that motion, which we erroneouſly
attribute to our own power and efficacy. Nor do
philoſophers ſtop at this concluſion. They ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
extend the ſame inference to the mind itſelf, in
its internal operations. Our mental viſion or concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of ideas is nothing but a revelation made to us
by our Maker. When we voluntarily turn our
thoughts to any object, and raiſe up its image in the
fancy; it is not the will which creates that idea;
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:0050800103:112"/>
'Tis the univerſal Creator of all things, who diſcovers
it to the mind, and renders it preſent to us.</p>
               <p>THUS, according to theſe philoſophers, every thing
is full of God. Not contented with the principle,
that nothing exiſts but by his will, that nothing poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſes
any power but by his conceſſion: They rob na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and all created beings, of every power, in order
to render their dependance on the Deity ſtill more
ſenſible and immediate. They conſider not, that by
this theory they diminiſh, inſtead of magnifying, the
grandeur of thoſe attributes, which they affect ſo
much to celebrate. It argues ſurely more power in
the Deity to delegate a certain degree of power to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior
creatures, than to operate every thing by his
own immediate volition. It argues more wiſdom to
contrive at firſt the fabric of the world with ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
foreſight, that, of itſelf, and by its proper opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
it may ſerve all the purpoſes of providence, than
if the great Creator were obliged every moment to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt
its parts, and animate by his breath all the wheels
of that ſtupendous machine.</p>
               <p>BUT if we would have a more a philoſophical confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of this theory, perhaps the two following re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections
may ſuffice.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> IT ſeems to me, that this theory of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
energy and operation of the Supreme Being, is
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:0050800103:113"/>
too bold ever to carry conviction with it to a man who
is ſufficiently apprized of the weakneſs of human reaſon,
and the narrow limits, to which it is confined in all its
operations. Tho' the chain of arguments, which
conduct to it, were ever ſo logical, there muſt ariſe a
ſtrong ſuſpicion, if not an abſolute aſſurance, that it
has carried us quite beyond the reach of our faculties,
when it leads to concluſions ſo extraordinary, and ſo
remote from common life and experience. We are
got into fairy land, long ere we have reached the laſt
ſteps of our theory; and <hi>there</hi> we have no reaſon to
truſt our common methods of argument, or think that
our uſual analogies and probabilities have any autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.
Our line is too ſhort to fathom ſuch immenſe
abyſſes. And however we may flatter ourſelves, that
we are guided, in every ſtep which we take, by a kind
of veriſimilitude and experience; we may be aſſured,
that this fancied experience has no authority when we
thus apply it to ſubjects that lie intirely out of the
ſphere of experience. But on this we ſhall have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
to touch afterwards<note n="*" place="bottom">Section XII.</note>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> I cannot perceive any force in the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
on which this theory is founded. We are ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant,
tis true, of the manner in which bodies ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
on each other: Their force or energy is intirely
incomprehenſible. But are we not equally ignorant
of the manner or force, by which a mind, even the
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:0050800103:114"/>
ſupreme mind, operates either on itſelf or on body?
Whence, I beſeech you, do we acquire any idea of it?
We have no ſentiment or conſciouſneſs of this power
in ourſelves. We have no idea of the Supreme Being
but what we learn from reflection on our own facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
Were our ignorance, therefore, a good reaſon
for rejecting any thing, we ſhould be led into that
principle of denying all energy in the Supreme Being
as much as in the groſſeſt matter. We ſurely com
prehend as little the operations of one as of the other.
Is it more difficult to conceive, that motion may
ariſe from impulſe, than that it may ariſe from voli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
All we know is our profound ignorance in both
caſes<note n="*" place="bottom">I need not examine at length the <hi>vis inertiae</hi> which is ſo much talked of in the new philoſophy, and which is aſcribed to matter. We find by experience, that a body at reſt or in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion continues for ever in its preſent ſtate, till put from it by ſome new cauſe: And that a body impelled takes as much motion from the impelling body as it acquires itſelf. Theſe are facts. When we call this a <hi>vis inertiae,</hi> we only mark theſe facts, without pretending to have any idea of the inert power; in the ſame manner as, when we talk of gravity, we mean certain effects, without comprehending that active power. It was never the meaning of Sir ISAAC NEWTON to rob ſecond cauſes of all force or energy; tho' ſome of his followers have endeavoured to eſtabliſh that theory upon his authority. On the contrary, that great philoſopher had recourſe to an etherial ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive fluid to explain his univerſal attraction; tho' he was ſo cautious and modeſt as to allow, that it was a mere hypotheſis, not to be inſiſted on, without more experiments. I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, that there is ſomething in the fate of opinions a little ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary. DES-CARTES inſinuated that doctrine of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal and ſole efficacy of the Deity, without inſiſting on it. MALEERANCHE and other CARTESIANS made it the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of all their philoſophy. It had, however, no authority in ENGLAND. LOCKE, CLARKE, and CUDWORTH, never ſo much as take notice of it, but ſuppoſed all along, that matter has a real, tho' ſubordinate and derived power. By what means has it become ſo prevalent among our modern metaphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians?</note>.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:0050800103:115"/>
BUT to haſten to a concluſion of this argument,
which is already drawn out to too great a length:
We have ſought in vain for an idea of power or neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
connexion, in all the ſources from which we could
ſuppoſe it to be derived. It appears, that, in ſingle
inſtances of the operation of bodies, we never can, by
our utmoſt ſcrutiny, diſcover any thing but one event
following another; without being able to comprehend
any force or power, by which the cauſe operates, or
any connexion between it and its ſuppoſed effect.
The ſame difficulty occurs in contemplating the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
of mind on body; where we obſerve the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the latter to follow upon the volition of the
former; but are not able to obſerve nor conceive the
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:0050800103:116"/>
tye, which binds together the motion and volition, or
the energy by which the mind produces this effect.
The authority of the will over its own faculties and
ideas is not a whit more comprehenſible: So that,
upon the whole, there appears not, thro' all nature,
any one inſtance of connexion, which is conceivable
by us. All events ſeem intirely looſe and ſeparate.
One event follows another; but we never can obſerve
any tye between them. They ſeem <hi>conjoined,</hi> but
never <hi>connected.</hi> And as we can have no idea of any
thing, which never appeared to our outward ſenſe or
inward ſentiment, the neceſſary concluſion <hi>ſeems</hi> to be,
that we have no idea of connexion or power at all,
and that theſe words are abſolutely without any mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
when employed either in philoſophical reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
or common life.</p>
               <p>BUT there ſtill remains one method of avoiding this
concluſion, and one ſource which we have not yet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined.
When any natural object or event is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented,
'tis impoſſible for us, by any ſagacity or pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netration,
to diſcover, or even conjecture, without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
what event will reſult from it, or to carry
our foreſight beyond that object, which is immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
preſent to the memory and ſenſes. Even after one
inſtance or experiment, where we have obſerved a
particular event to follow upon another, we are not
intitled to form a general rule, or foretel what will
happen in like caſes; it being juſtly eſteemed an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonable
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:0050800103:117"/>
temerity to judge of the whole courſe of
nature from one ſingle experiment, however accurate
or certain. But when one particular ſpecies of event
has always, in all inſtances, been conjoined with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
we make no longer any ſcruple to foretel the
one upon the appearance of the other, and to employ
that reaſoning, which can alone aſſure us of any mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of fact or exiſtence. We then call the one object,
<hi>Cauſe;</hi> and the other, <hi>Effect.</hi> We ſuppoſe, that there
is ſome connexion between them; ſome power in the
one, by which it infallibly produces the other, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perates
with the greateſt certainty and ſtrongeſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity.</p>
               <p>IT
appears, then, that this idea of a neceſſary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion
from events ariſes from a number of ſimilar
inſtances, which occur, of the conſtant conjunction of
theſe events; nor can that idea ever be ſuggeſted by
any one of theſe inſtances, ſurveyed in all poſſible
lights and poſitions. But there is nothing in a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of inſtances, different from every ſingle inſtance,
which is ſuppoſed to be exactly ſimilar; except only,
that after a repetition of ſimilar inſtances, the mind is
carried by habit, upon the appearance of one event, to
expect its uſual attendant, and to believe, that it will
exiſt. This connexion, therefore, which we <hi>feel</hi> in
the mind, or cuſtomary tranſition of the imagination
from one object to its uſual attendant, is the ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
or impreſſion, from which we form the idea of
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:0050800103:118"/>
power or neceſſary connexion. Nothing farther is in
the caſe. Contemplate the ſubject on all ſides, you
will never find any other origin of this idea. This is
the ſole difference between one inſtance, from which
we never can receive the idea of connexion, and a
number of ſimilar inſtances, by which it is ſuggeſted.
The firſt time a man ſaw the communication of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by impulſe, as by the ſhock of two billiard balls,
he could not pronounce that the one event was <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected;</hi>
but only that it was <hi>conjoined</hi> with the other.
After he has obſerved ſeveral inſtances of this nature,
he then pronounces them to be <hi>connected.</hi> What al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration
has happened to give riſe to this new idea of
<hi>connexion?</hi> Nothing but that he now <hi>feels</hi> theſe events
to be <hi>connected</hi> in his imagination, and can readily
foretel the exiſtence of one from the appearance of
the other. When we ſay, therefore, that one object
is connected with another, we mean only, that they
have acquired a connexion in our thoughts, and give
riſe to this inference, by which they become proofs
of each other's exiſtence: A concluſion; which is
ſomewhat extraordinary; but which ſeems founded
on ſufficient evidence. Nor will its evidence be
weakned by any general diffidence of the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
or ſceptical ſuſpicion concerning every con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion,
which is new and extraordinary. No con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions
can be more agreeable to ſcepticiſm than ſuch
as make diſcoveries concerning the weakneſs and nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
limits of human reaſon and capacity.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="120" facs="tcp:0050800103:119"/>
AND what ſtronger inſtance can be produced of the
ſurpriſing ignorance and weakneſs of the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
than the preſent? For ſurely, if there be any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
among objects, which it imports us to know
perfectly, 'tis that of cauſe and effect. On this are
founded all our reaſonings concerning matter of fact
or exiſtence. By means of it alone we attain any aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance
concerning objects which are removed from
the preſent teſtimony of our memory and ſenſes.
The only immediate utility of all ſciences, is to teach
us, how to control and regulate future events by their
cauſes. Our thoughts and inquiries are, therefore,
every moment, employed about this relation. And
yet ſo imperfect are the ideas which we form concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it, that 'tis impoſſible to give any juſt definition
of cauſe, except what is drawn from ſomething extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous
and foreign to it. Similar objects are always
conjoined with ſimilar. Of this we have experience.
Suitable to this experience, therefore, we may define a
cauſe to be <hi>an object, followed by another, and where
all the objects, ſimilar to the firſt, are followed by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
ſimilar to the ſecond.</hi> Or in other words, <hi>where,
if the firſt object had not been, the ſecond never had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſted.</hi>
The appearance of a cauſe always conveys the
mind, by a cuſtomary tranſition, to the idea of the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.
Of this alſo we have experience. We may,
therefore, ſuitable to this experience, form another de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition
of cauſe, and call it, <hi>an object followed by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
and whoſe appearance always conveys the thought
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:0050800103:120"/>
to that other.</hi> But tho' both theſe definitions be
drawn from circumſtances foreign to the cauſe, we
cannot remedy this inconvenience, or attain any
more perfect definition, which may point out that
circumſtance in the cauſe, which gives it a connexion
with its effect. We have no idea of this connexion;
nor even any diſtinct notion what it is we deſire to
know, when we endeavour at a conception of it. We
ſay, for inſtance, that the vibration of this ſtring is the
cauſe of this particular ſound. But what do we mean
by that affirmation? We either mean, <hi>that this vibra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is followed by this ſound, and that all ſimilar vibra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
have been followed by ſimilar ſounds: Or, that
this vibration is followed by this ſound, and that upon
the appearance of one, the mind anticipates the ſenſes,
and forms immediately an idea of the other.</hi> We may
conſider the relation of cauſe and effect in either of
theſe two lights; but beyond theſe, we have no idea
of it<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>According to theſe explications and definitions, the idea of <hi>power</hi> is relative as much as that of <hi>cauſe;</hi> and both have a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to an effect, or ſome other event conſtantly conjoined with the former. When we conſider the <hi>unknown</hi> circumſtance of an object, by which the degree or quantity of its effect is fixed and determined, we call that its power: And accordingly, 'tis allowed by all philoſophers, that the effect is the meaſure of the power. But if they had any idea of power, as it is in it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, why could not they meaſure it in itſelf? The diſpute whether the force of a body in motion be as its velocity, or the ſquare of its velocity; this diſpute, I ſay, needed not be decided by comparing its effects in equal or unequal times; but by a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect menſuration and compariſon.</p>
                     <p>As to the frequent uſe of the words, Force, Power, Energy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which every where occur in common converſation, as well as in philoſophy; that is no proof, that we are acquainted, in any inſtance, with the connecting principle between cauſe and effect, or can account ultimately for the production of one thing by another. Theſe words, as commonly uſed, have very looſe meanings annexed to them; and their ideas are very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain and confuſed. No animal can put external bodies in motion without the ſentiment of a <hi>niſus</hi> or endeavour; and every animal has a ſentiment or feeling from the ſtroke or blow of an external object, that is in motion. Theſe ſenſations, which are merely animal, and from which we can <hi>à priori</hi> draw no inference, we are apt to transfer to inanimate objects, and to ſuppoſe, that they have ſome ſuch feelings, whenever they transfer or receive motion. With regard to energies, which are exerted, without our annexing to them any idea of commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated motion, we conſider only the conſtant experienced con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of the events; and as we <hi>feel</hi> a cuſtomary connexion between the ideas, we transfer that feeling to the objects; as nothing is more uſual than to apply to external bodies every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal ſenſation, which they occaſion.</p>
                  </note>.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="122" facs="tcp:0050800103:121"/>
To recapitulate, therefore, the reaſonings of this
ſection: Every idea is copied from ſome preceding
impreſſion or ſentiment; and where we cannot find
any impreſſion, we may be certain that there is no
idea. In all ſingle inſtances of the operation of bodies
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:0050800103:122"/>
or minds, there is nothing that produces any impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
nor conſequently can ſuggeſt any idea of power
or neceſſary connexion. But when many uniform in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
appear, and the ſame object is always follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the ſame event; we then begin to entertain the
notion of cauſe and connexion. We then <hi>feel</hi> a new
ſentiment or impreſſion, <hi>viz.</hi> a cuſtomary connexion
in the thought or imagination between one object and
its uſual attendant; and this ſentiment is the original
of that idea which we ſeek for. For as this idea ariſes
from a number of ſimilar inſtances, and not from any
ſingle inſtance; it muſt ariſe from that circumſtance,
in which the number of inſtances differ from every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual
inſtance. But this cuſtomary connexion or
tranſition of the imagination is the only circumſtance,
in which they differ. In every other particular they
are alike. The firſt inſtance which we ſaw of motion,
communicated by the ſhock of two billiard-balls (to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to this obvious inſtance) is exactly ſimilar to any
inſtance that may, at preſent, occur to us; except on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that we could not, at firſt, <hi>infer</hi> one event from the
other; which we are enabled to do at preſent, after ſo
long a courſe of uniform experience. I know not, if
the reader will readily apprehend this reaſoning. I
am afraid, that, ſhould I multiply words about it, or
throw it into a greater variety of lights, it would only
become more obſcure and intricate. In all abſtract
reaſonings, there is one point of view, which, if we
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:0050800103:123"/>
can happily hit, we ſhall go farther towards illuſtrating
the ſubject, than by all the eloquence and copious
expreſſion in the world. This we ſhould endeavour
to attain, and reſerve the flowers of rhetoric for ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
which are more adapted to them.</p>

               <p>IT might reaſonably be expected, in queſtions,
which have been canvaſſed and diſputed with great
eagerneſs ſince the firſt origin of ſcience and philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,
that the meaning of all the terms, at leaſt,
ſhould have been agreed upon among the diſputants;
and our enquiries, in the courſe of two thouſand years,
been able to paſs from words to the true and real ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of the controverſy. For how eaſy may it ſeem to
give exact definitions of the terms employed in reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and make theſe definitions, not the mere ſound of
words, the object of future ſcrutiny and examination?
But if we conſider the matter more narrowly, we ſhall
be apt to draw a quite oppoſite concluſion. From
that circumſtance alone, that a controverſy has been
long kept on foot, and remains ſtill undecided, we
may preſume, that there is ſome ambiguity in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion,
and that the diſputants affix different ideas
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:0050800103:125"/>
to the terms employed in the controverſy. For as the
faculties of the ſoul are ſuppoſed to be naturally alike
in every individual; otherwiſe nothing could be more
fruitleſs than to reaſon or diſpute together; it were
impoſſible, if men affix the ſame ideas to their terms,
that they could ſo long form different opinions of the
ſame ſubject; eſpecially when they communicate their
views, and each party turn themſelves on all ſides, in
ſearch of arguments, which may give them the vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
over their antagoniſts. 'Tis ture; if men at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
the diſcuſſion of queſtions, which lie entirely
beyond the reach of human capacity, ſuch as thoſe
concerning the origin of worlds, or the oeconomy of
the intellectual ſyſtem or region of ſpirits, they may
long beat the air in their fruitleſs conteſts, and never
arrive at any determinate concluſion. But if the
queſtion regard any ſubject of common life and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience;
nothing, one would think, could preſerve
the diſpute ſo long undecided, but ſome ambiguous
expreſſions, which keep the antagoniſts ſtill at a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
and hinder them from grappling with each
other.</p>
               <p>THIS has been the caſe in the long diſputed queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
concerning liberty and neceſſity; and to ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
a degree, that, if I be not much miſtaken,
we ſhall find all mankind, both learned and ignorant,
to have been always of the ſame opinion with regard
to that ſubject, and that a few intelligible definitions
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:0050800103:126"/>
would immediately have put an end to the whole
controverſy. I own, that this diſpute has been ſo
much canvaſſed, on all hands, and has led philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
into ſuch a labyrinth of obſcure ſophiſtry, that
'tis no wonder if a ſenſible and polite reader indulge
his eaſe ſo far as to turn a deaf ear to the propoſal
of ſuch a queſtion, from which he can expect neither
inſtruction nor entertainment. But the ſtate of the
argument here propoſed may, perhaps, ſerve to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new
his attention; as it has more novelty, promiſes
at leaſt ſome deciſion of the controverſy, and will not
much diſturb his eaſe, by any intricate or obſcure
reaſoning.</p>
               <p>I HOPE, therefore, to make it appear, that all men
have ever agreed in the doctrines both of neceſſity and
of liberty, according to any reaſonable ſenſe, which
can be put on theſe terms; and that the whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy
has hitherto turned merely upon words. We
ſhall begin with examining the doctrine of neceſſity.</p>
               <p>'TIS univerſally allowed, that matter, in all its
operations, is actuated by a neceſſary force, and that
every natural effect is ſo preciſely determined by the
energy of its cauſe, that no other effect, in ſuch
particular circumſtances, could poſſibly have reſulted
from the operation of that cauſe. The degree and
direction of every motion is, by the laws of nature,
preſcribed with ſuch exactneſs, that a living creature
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:0050800103:127"/>
may as ſoon ariſe from the ſhock of two bodies, as
motion in any other degree or direction, than what is
actually produced by it Would we, therefore, form
a juſt and preciſe idea of <hi>neceſſity,</hi> we muſt conſider,
whence that idea ariſes, when we apply it to the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of bodies.</p>
               <p>IT ſeems evident, that, if all the ſcenes of nature
were ſhifted continually in ſuch a manner, that no
two events bore any reſemblance to each other, but
every object was entirely new, without any ſimilitude
to whatever had been ſeen before, we ſhould never,
in that caſe, have attained the leaſt idea of neceſſity,
or of a connexion among theſe objects. We might
ſay, upon ſuch a ſuppoſition, that one object or event
has followed another; not that one was produced by
the other. The relation of cauſe and effect muſt be
utterly unknown to mankind. Inference and reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
concerning the operations of nature would, from
that moment, be at an end; and the memory and
ſenſes remain the only canals, by which the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege
of any real exiſtence could poſſibly have acceſs to
the mind. Our idea, therefore, of neceſſity and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
ariſes entirely from that uniformity, obſervable
in the operations of nature; where ſimilar objects are
conſtantly conjoined together, and the mind is deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
by cuſtom to infer the one from the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of the other. Theſe two circumſtances form
the whole of that neceſſity, which we aſcribe to mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:0050800103:128"/>
Beyond the conſtant <hi>conjunction</hi> of ſimilar ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
and the conſequent <hi>inference</hi> from one to the
other, we have no notion of any neceſſity, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion.</p>
               <p>IF
it appear, therefore, that all mankind have ever
allowed, without any doubt or heſitation, that theſe
two circumſtances take place in the voluntary actions
of men, and in the operations of the mind; it muſt
follow, that all mankind have ever agreed in the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine
of neceſſity, and that they have hitherto diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted,
merely for not underſtanding each other.</p>
               <p>As to the firſt circumſtance, the conſtant and regular
conjunction of ſimilar events; we may poſſibly ſatisfy
ourſelves by the following conſiderations. It is uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally
acknowledged, that there is a great uniformity
among the actions of men, in all nations and ages,
and that human nature remains ſtill the ſame, in its
principles and operations. The ſame motives produce
always the ſame actions: The ſame events follow
from the ſame cauſes. Ambition, avarice, ſelf love,
vanity, friendſhip, generoſity, public ſpirit; theſe
paſſions, mixed in various degrees, and diſtributed
thro' ſociety, have been, from the beginning of the
world, and ſtill are, the ſources of all the actions and
enterprizes, which have ever been obſerved among
mankind. Would you know the ſentiments, incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations,
and courſe of life of the GREEKS and RO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MANS?
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:0050800103:129"/>
Study well the temper and actions of the
FRENCH and ENGLISH. You cannot be much miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
in transferring to the former <hi>moſt</hi> of the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations,
which you have made with regard to the
latter. Mankind are ſo much the ſame, in all times
and places, that hiſtory informs us of nothing new or
ſtrange in this particular. Its chief uſe if only to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
the conſtant and univerſal principles of human
nature, by ſhewing men in all varieties of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
and ſituations, and furniſhing us with mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials,
from which we may form our obſervations, and
become acquainted with the regular ſprings of human
action and behaviour. Theſe records of wars, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues,
factions, and revolutions, are ſo many col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections
of experiments, by which the politician or
moral philoſopher fixes the principles of his ſcience;
in the ſame manner as the phyſician or natural philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher
becomes acquainted with the nature of plants,
minerals, and other external objects, by the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
which he forms concerning them. Nor are
the earth, water, and other elements, examined by
ARISTOTLE, and HIPPOCRATES, more like to thoſe,
which at preſent lie under our obſervation, than the
men, deſcribed by POLYBIUS and TACITUS, are to
thoſe who now govern the world.</p>
               <p>SHOULD a traveller, returning from a far country,
bring us an account of men, entirely different from
any, with whom we were ever acquainted; men, who
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:0050800103:130"/>
were entirely diveſted of avarice, ambition, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge;
who knew no pleaſure but friendſhip, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity,
and publick ſpirit; we ſhould immediately,
from theſe circumſtances, detect the falſhood, and
prove him a liar, with the ſame certainty as if he
had ſtuffed his narration with ſtories of centaurs and
dragons, miracles and prodigies. And if we would
explode any forgery in hiſtory, we cannot make uſe
of a more convincing argument; than to prove, that
the actions, aſcribed to any perſon, are directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the courſe of nature, and that no human mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,
in ſuch circumſtances, could ever induce him
to ſuch a conduct. The veracity of QUINTUS CUR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIUS
is as ſuſpicious, when he deſcribes the ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
courage of ALEXANDER, by which he was hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
on ſingly to attack multitudes, as when he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes
his ſupernatural force and activity, by which
he was able to reſiſt them. So readily and univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally
do we acknowlege an uniformity in human mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
and actions as well as in the operations of
body.</p>
               <p>HENCE likewiſe the benefit of that experience, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
by long life and a variety of buſineſs and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
in order to inſtruct us in the principles of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
nature, and regulate our future conduct, as well
as ſpeculation. By means of this guide, we mount
up to the knowlege of mens inclinations and motives,
from their actions, expreſſions, and even geſtures;
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:0050800103:131"/>
and again, deſcend to the interpretation of their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
from our knowlege of their motives and inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
The general obſervations, treaſured up by a
courſe of experience, give us the clue of human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and teaches us to unravel all its intricacies. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texts
and appearances no longer deceive us. Public
declarations paſs for the ſpecious colouring of a cauſe.
And tho' virtue and honour be allowed their proper
weight and authority, that perfect diſintereſtedneſs, ſo
often pretended, is never expected in multitudes and
parties; ſeldom in their leaders; and ſcarcely even in
individuals of any rank or ſtation. But were there no
uniformity in human actions, and were every experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which we could form of this kind irregular and
anomolous, it were impoſſible to collect any general
obſervations concerning mankind; and no experience,
however accurately digeſted by reflection, would ever
ſerve to any purpoſe. Why is the antient huſband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
more ſkilful in his calling than the young be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginner,
but becauſe there is a certain uniformity in
the operation of the ſun, rain, and earth, towards
the production of vegetables; and experience teaches
the old practitioner the rules, by which this operation
is governed and directed?</p>
               <p>WE muſt not, however, expect, that this unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
of human actions ſhould be carried to ſuch a
length, as that all men in the ſame circumſtances,
ſhould always act preciſely in the ſame manner, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:0050800103:132"/>
any allowance for the diverſity of characters, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices,
and opinions. Such a uniformity, in every
particular is found in no part of nature. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
from obſerving the variety of conduct in diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
men, we are enabled to form a greater variety of
maxims, which ſtill ſuppoſe a degree of uniformity
and regularity.</p>
               <p>ARE the manners of men different in different ages
and countries? We learn thence the great force of
cuſtom and education, which mould the human mind
from its infancy, and form it into a fixed and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed
character. Is the behaviour and conduct of
the one ſex very unlike that of the other? 'Tis from
thence we become acquainted with the different cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters,
which nature has impreſſed upon the ſexes,
and which ſhe preſerves with conſtancy and regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.
Are the actions of the ſame perſon much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſified
in the different periods of his life, from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy
to old age? This affords room for many gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
obſervations concerning the gradual change of our
ſentiments and inclinations, and the different maxims,
which prevail in the different ages of human crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
Even the characters which are peculiar to each
individual, have an uniformity in their influence, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
our acquaintance with the perſons, and our ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
of their conduct could never teach us their
diſpoſitions, nor ſerve to direct our behaviour with
regard to them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="134" facs="tcp:0050800103:133"/>
I GRANT it poſſible to find ſome actions, which
ſeem to have no regular connexion with any known
motives, and are exceptions to all the meaſures of
conduct, which have ever been eſtabliſhed for the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of men. But if we would willingly know,
what judgment ſhould be formed of ſuch irregular
and extraordinary actions; we may conſider the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents
that are commonly entertained with regard to
thoſe irregular events, which appear in the courſe of
nature, and the operations of external objects. All
cauſes are not conjoined to their uſual effects, with
like uniformity. An artificer, who handles only dead
matter, may be diſappointed of his aim as well as
the politician, who directs the conduct of ſenſible and
intelligent agents.</p>
               <p>THE vulgar, who take things according to their
firſt appearance, attribute the uncertainty of events to
ſuch an uncertainty in the cauſes as makes the latter
often fail of their uſual influence; tho' they meet
with no impediment in their operation. But philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,
obſerving, that almoſt in every part of nature
there is contained a vaſt variety of ſprings and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
which are hid, by reaſon of their minuteneſs
or remoteneſs, find, that 'tis at leaſt poſſible the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety
of events may not proceed from any contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency
in the cauſe, but from the ſecret operation of
contrary cauſes. This poſſibility is converted into cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
by farther obſervation, when they remark,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:0050800103:134"/>
that, upon an exact ſcrutiny, a contrariety of effects
always betrays a contrariety of cauſes, and proceeds
from their mutual oppoſition. A peaſant can give
no better reaſon for the ſtopping of any clock or
watch than to ſay that it commonly does not not go
right: But an artizan eaſily perceives, that the ſame
force in the ſpring or pendulum has always the ſame
influence on the wheels; but fails of its uſual effect,
perhaps by reaſon of a grain of duſt, which puts a
ſtop to the whole movement. From the obſervation
of ſeveral parallel inſtances, philoſophers form a
maxim, that the connexion between all cauſes and
effects is equally neceſſary, and that its ſeeming un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty
in ſome inſtances proceeds from the ſecret
oppoſition of contrary cauſes.</p>
               <p>THUS for inſtance, in the human body, when the
uſual ſymptoms of health or ſickneſs diſappoint our
expectation; when medicines operate not with their
wonted powers; when irregular events follow from
any particular cauſes; the philoſopher and phyſician
are not ſurprized at the matter, nor are ever tempted
to deny, in general, the neceſſity and uniformity of
thoſe principles, by which the animal oeconomy is
conducted. They know, that a human body is a
mighty complicated machine: That many ſecret pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
lurk in it, which are altogether beyond our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion:
That to us it muſt often appear very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain
in its operations: And that therefore the irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:0050800103:135"/>
events, which outwardly diſcover themſelves,
can be no proof, that the laws of nature are not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
with the greateſt regularity in its internal ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
and government.</p>
               <p>THE philoſopher, if he be conſiſtent, muſt apply
the ſame reaſonings to the actions and volitions of
intelligent agents. The moſt irregular and unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
reſolutions of men may frequently be accounted
for by thoſe who know every particular circumſtance
of their character and ſituation. A perſon of an
obliging diſpoſition gives a peeviſh anſwer: But he
has the tooth-ake, or has not dined. A ſtupid fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
diſcovers an uncommon alacrity in his carriage:
But he has met with a ſudden piece of good fortune.
Or even when an action, as ſometimes happens, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be particularly accounted for, either by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
himſelf or by others; we know, in general, that
the characters of men are, to a certain degree, incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
and irregular. This is, in a manner, the conſtant
character of human nature; tho' it be applicable, in
a more particular manner, to ſome perſons, who have
no fixed rule for their conduct, but proceed in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
courſ of caprice and inconſtancy. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
principles and motives may operate in an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
manner, notwithſtanding theſe ſeeming irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larities;
in the ſame manner as the winds, rain,
clouds, and other variations of the weather are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:0050800103:136"/>
to be governed by ſteady principles; tho' not
eaſily diſcoverable by human ſagacity and enquiry.</p>
               <p>THUS it appears, not only that the conjunction
between motives and voluntary actions is as regular
and uniform, as that between the cauſe and effect in
any part of nature; but alſo that this regular conjunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
has been univerſally acknowleged among man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
and has never been the ſubject of diſpute, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in philoſophy or common life. Now as it is
from paſt experience, that we draw all inferences con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the future, and as we conclude, that objects
will always be conjoined together, which we find al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
to have been conjoined; it may ſeem ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to prove, that this experienced uniformity in
human actions is the ſource of all the <hi>inferences,</hi>
which we form concerning them. But in order to
throw the argument into a greater variety of lights,
we ſhall alſo inſiſt, tho' briefly, on this latter topic.</p>
               <p>THE mutual dependance of men is ſo great, in all
ſocieties, that ſcarce any human action is entirely
compleat in itſelf, or is performed without ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
to the actions of others, which are requiſite
to make it anſwer fully the intention of the agent.
The pooreſt artificer, who labours alone, expects at
leaſt the protection of the magiſtrate, to enſure the
enjoyment of the fruits of his labour. He alſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects,
that, when he carries his goods to market, and
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:0050800103:137"/>
offers them at a reaſonable price, he ſhall find buyers;
and ſhall be able, by the money he acquires, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
others to ſupply him with thoſe commodities,
which are requiſite for his ſubſiſtence. In propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
as men extend their dealings, and render their
intercourſe with others more complicated, they always
comprehend, in their ſchemes of life, a greater va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
of voluntary actions, which they expect, from
their proper motives, to co-operate with their own.
In all theſe concluſions, they take their meaſures from
paſt experience, in the ſame manner as in their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings
concerning external objects: and firmly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
that men, as well as all the elements, are to
continue, in their operations, the ſame, which they
have ever found them. A manufacturer reckons up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the labour of his ſervants, for the execution of
any work, as much as upon the tools, which he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploys,
and would be equally ſurprized, were his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations
diſappointed. In ſhort, this experimental
inference and reaſoning concerning the actions of
others enters ſo much into human life, that no man,
while awake, is ever a moment without employing
it. Have we not reaſon, therefore, to affirm, that all
mankind have always agreed in the doctrine of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity,
according to the foregoing definition and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
of it?</p>
               <p>NOR have philoſophers ever entertained a different
opinion from the people in this particular. For not
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:0050800103:138"/>
to mention, that almoſt every action of their life ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes
that opinion; there are even few of the ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative
parts of learning, to which it is not eſſential.
What would become of <hi>hiſtory,</hi> had we not a depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
on the veracity of the hiſtorian, according to
the experience, which we have had of mankind? How
could <hi>politics</hi> be a ſcience, if laws and forms of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
had not an uniform influence upon ſociety?
Where would be the foundation of <hi>morals,</hi> if particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
characters had no certain nor determinate power
to produce particular ſentiments, and if theſe ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
had no conſtant operations on actions? And
with what pretext could we employ our <hi>criticiſm</hi> upon
any poet or polite author, if we could not pronounce
the conduct and ſentiments of his actors, either natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
or unnatural, to ſuch characters, and in ſuch cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances?
It ſeems almoſt impoſſible, therefore,
to engage, either in ſcience or action of any kind,
without acknowleging the doctrine of neceſſity, and
this <hi>inference</hi> from motives to voluntary actions; from
characters to conduct.</p>
               <p>AND indeed, when we conſider how aptly <hi>natural</hi>
and <hi>moral</hi> evidence link together, and form only one
chain of argument, we ſhall make no ſcruple to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
that they are of the ſame nature, and derived
from the ſame principles. A priſoner, who has nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
money nor intereſt, diſcovers the impoſſibility of
his eſcape, as well from the obſtinacy of the gaoler,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:0050800103:139"/>
as from the walls and bars, with which he is ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded;
and in all attempts for his freedom, chuſes
rather to work upon the ſtone and iron of the one,
than upon the inflexible nature of the other. The
ſame priſoner, when conducted to the ſcaffold, foreſees
his death as certainly from the conſtancy and fidelity
of his guards, as from the operation of the ax or
wheel. His mind runs along a certain train of ideas:
The refuſal of the ſoldiers to conſent to his eſcape;
the action of the executioner; the ſeparation of the
head and body; bleeding, convulſive motions, and
death. Here is a connected chain of natural cauſes
and voluntary actions; but the mind feels no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between them, in paſſing from one link to
another: Nor is leſs certain of the future event than
if it were connected with the objects preſent to the
memory or ſenſes, by a train of cauſes, cemented to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
by what we are pleaſed to call a <hi>phyſical</hi> neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity.
The ſame experienced union has the ſame effect
on the mind, whether the united objects be motives,
volitions, and actions; or figure and motion. We
may change the names of things; but their nature
and their operation on the underſtanding never
change.</p>
               <p>I HAVE frequently conſidered, what could poſſibly
be the reaſon, why all mankind, tho' they have ever
without heſitation, acknowleged the doctrine of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity,
in their whole practice and reaſoning, have
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:0050800103:140"/>
yet diſcovered ſuch a reluctance to acknowlege it in
words, and have rather ſhewn a propenſity, in all
ages, to profeſs the contrary opinion. The matter,
I think, may be accounted for, after the following
manner. If we examine the operations of bodies and
the production of effects from their cauſes, we ſhall
find, that all our faculties can never carry us farther
in our knowlege of this relation, than barely to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,
that particular objects are <hi>conſtantly conjoined</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
and that the mind is carried, by a <hi>cuſtomary
tranſition,</hi> from the appearance of one to the belief
of the other. But tho' this concluſion concerning
human ignorance be the reſult of the ſtricteſt ſcrutiny
of this ſubject, men ſtill entertain a ſtrong propenſity
to believe, that they penetrate farther into the powers
of nature, and perceive ſomething like a neceſſary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion
between the cauſe and the effect. When again
they turn their reflections towards the operations of
their own minds, and <hi>feel</hi> no ſuch connexion of the
motive and the action; they are apt, from thence, to
ſuppoſe, that there is a difference between the effects,
reſulting from material force, and thoſe which ariſe
from thought and intelligence. But being once con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced,
that we know nothing farther of cauſation of
any kind, than merely the <hi>conſtant conjunction</hi> of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
and the conſequent <hi>inference</hi> of the mind from
one to another, and finding, that theſe two circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
are univerſally acknowleged to have place in
voluntary actions; we may thence be more eaſily led
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:0050800103:141"/>
to own the ſame neceſſity common to all cauſes. And
tho' this reaſoning may contradict the ſyſtems of many
philoſophers, in aſcribing neceſſity to the determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the will, we ſhall find, upon reflection, that they
diſſent from it in words only, not in their real ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
Neceſſity, according to the ſenſe, in which
it is here taken, has never yet been rejected, nor can
ever, I think, be rejected by any philoſopher. It may
only, perhaps, be pretended, that the mind can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
in the operations of matter, ſome farther con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion
between the cauſe and effect; and a connexion
which has not place in the voluntary actions of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent
beings. Now whether it be ſo or not, can
only appear upon examination; and it is incumbent
on theſe philoſophers to make good their aſſertion, by
defining or deſcribing that neceſſity, and pointing it
out to us, in the operations of material cauſes.</p>
               <p>IT would ſeem, indeed, that men begin at the
wrong end of this queſtion concerning liberty and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity,
when they enter upon it by examining the
faculties of the ſoul, the influence of the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and the operations of the will. Let them firſt
diſcuſs a more ſimple queſtion, <hi>viz.</hi> the operations of
body and of brute unintelligent matter; and try whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they can there form any idea of cauſation and
neceſſity, except that of a conſtant conjunction of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
and ſubſequent inference of the mind from one
to another. If theſe circumſtances form, in reality,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:0050800103:142"/>
the whole of that neceſſity, which we can conceive
in matter, and if theſe circumſtances be alſo univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally
acknowleged to take place in the operations of
the mind, the diſpute is at an end; or, at leaſt, muſt
be owned to be thenceforth merely verbal. But as
long as we will raſhly ſuppoſe, that we have ſome far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
idea of neceſſity and cauſation in the operations
of external objects; at the ſame time, that we can
find nothing farther, in the voluntary actions of the
mind; there is no poſſibility of bringing the diſpute
to any determinate iſſue, while we proceed upon ſo
erroneous a ſuppoſition. The only method of unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
us, is, to mount up higher; to examine the
narrow extent of ſcience, when applied to mateiral
cauſes; and to convince ourſelves, that all we know
of them, is, the conſtant conjunction and inference
above-mentioned. We may, perhaps, find, that 'tis
with difficulty we are induced to fix ſuch narrow li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
to human underſtanding: But we can afterwards
find no difficulty, when we come to apply this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine
to the actions of the will. For as 'tis evident,
that theſe have a regular conjunction with motives
and circumſtances and characters, and as we always
draw inferences from the one to the other, we
muſt be obliged to acknowlege, in words, that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity,
which we have already avowed, in every
deliberation of our lives, and in every ſtep of our
conduct and behaviour<note n="*" place="bottom">The prevalence of the doctrine of liberty may be accounted for, from another cauſe, viz. a falſe ſenſation or ſeeming expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience which we have, or may have, of liberty or indifference, in many of our actions. The neceſſity of any action, whether of matter or of mind, is not, properly ſpeaking, a quality in the agent, but in any thinking or intelligent being, who may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the action; and it conſiſts chiefly in the determination of his thoughts to infer the exiſtence of that action from ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding objects; as liberty, when oppoſed to neceſſity, is nothing but the want of that determination, and a certain looſeneſs or indifference, which we feel, in paſſing, or not paſſing, from the idea of one object to that of any ſucceeding one. Now we may obſerve, that, tho' in <hi>reflecting</hi> on human actions we ſeldom feel ſuch a looſeneſs or indifference, but are commonly able to infer them with conſiderable certainty from their motives, and from the diſpoſitions of the agent; yet it frequently happens, that, in <hi>performing</hi> the actions themſelves, we are ſenſible of ſomething like it: And as all reſembling objects are readily taken for each other, this has been employed as a demonſtrative and even an intuitive proof of human liberty. We feel, that our actions are ſubject to our will, on moſt occaſions; and imagine we feel, that the will itſelf is ſubject to nothing, becauſe, when by a denial of it we are provoked to try, we feel that it moves eaſily every way, and produces an image of itſelf, (or a <hi>Velleity,</hi> as it is called in the ſchools) even on that ſide, on which it did not ſettle. This image, or faint motion, we perſuade ourſelves, could, at that time, have been compleated into the thing itſelf; becauſe, ſhould that be denied, we find, upon a ſecond trial, that, at preſent, it can. We conſider not, that the fantaſtical deſire of ſhewing liberty, is here the motive of our actions. And it ſeems certain, that however we may imagine we feel a liberty within ourſelves, a ſpectator can commonly infer our actions from our motives and character; and even where he cannot, he concludes in general, that he might, were he perfectly acquainted with every circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of our ſituation and temper, and the moſt ſecret ſprings of our complexion and diſpoſition. Now this is the very eſſence of neceſſity, according to the foregoing doctrine.</note>.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="144" facs="tcp:0050800103:143"/>
BUT to proceed in this reconciling project with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
to the queſtion of liberty and neceſſity; the
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:0050800103:144"/>
moſt contentious queſtion, of metaphyſics, the moſt
contentious ſcience; it will not require many words to
prove, that all mankind have ever agreed in the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine
of liberty as well as in that of neceſſity, and
that the whole diſpute, in this reſpect alſo, has been
hitherto merely verbal. For what is meant by liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
when applied to voluntary actions? We cannot
ſurely mean, that actions have ſo little connexion
with motives, inclinations, and circumſtances, that
the one does not follow with a certain degree of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
from the other, and that the one affords no
inference, from which we can conclude the exiſtence
of the other. For theſe are plain and acknowleged
matters of fact. By liberty, then, we can only mean
<hi>a power of acting or not acting, according to the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations
of the will;</hi> that is, if we chuſe to remain
at reſt, we may; if we chuſe to move, we alſo may.
Now this hypothetical liberty is univerſally allowed to
belong to every body, who is not a priſoner and in
chains. Here then is no ſubject of diſpute.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="146" facs="tcp:0050800103:145"/>
WHATEVER definition we may give of liberty, we
ſhould be careful to obſerve two requiſite circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances;
<hi>firſt,</hi> that it be conſiſtent with plain matter
of fact; <hi>ſecondly,</hi> that it be conſiſtent with itſelf. If
we obſerve theſe circumſtances, and render our defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition
intelligible, I am perſuaded that all mankind
will be found of one opinion with regard to it.</p>
               <p>'TIS univerſally allowed, that nothing exiſts with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a cauſe of its exiſtence, and that chance, when
ſtrictly examined, is a mere negative word, and means
not any real power, which has, any where, a being
in nature. But 'tis pretended that ſome cauſes are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary,
and ſome are not neceſſary. Here then is
the admirable advantage of definitions. Let any one
<hi>define</hi> a cauſe, without comprehending, as a part of
the definition, a <hi>neceſſary connexion</hi> with its effect;
and let him ſhew diſtinctly the origin of the idea, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
by the definition; and I ſhall frankly give up
the whole controverſy. But if the foregoing explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the matter be received, this muſt be abſolutely
impracticable. Had not objects a regular conjunction
with each other, we ſhould never have entertained any
notion of cauſe and effect; and this regular conjunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
produces that inference of the underſtanding,
which is the only connexion, that we can have any
comprehenſion of. Whoever attempts a definition of
cauſe, excluſive of theſe circumſtances, will be obliged,

               <p>THERE is no method of reaſoning more common,
and yet none more blameable, than in philoſophical
debates, to endeavour the refutation of any hypotheſis,
by a pretext of its dangerous conſequences to religion
and morality. When any opinion leads into abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
'tis certainly falſe; but 'tis not certain that an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
is falſe, becauſe 'tis of dangerous conſequence.
Such topics, therefore, ought entirely to be forborne;
as ſerving nothing to the diſcovery of truth, but only to
make the perſon of an antagoniſt odious. This I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:0050800103:147"/>
in general, without pretending to draw any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
from it. I ſubmit frankly to an examination
of this kind, and ſhall venture to affirm, that the
doctrines, both of neceſſity and of liberty, as above
explained, are not only conſiſtent with morality and
religion, but are abſolutely eſſential to the ſupport of
them.</p>
               <p>NECESSITY may be defined two ways, conformable
to the two definitions of <hi>cauſe,</hi> of which it makes an
eſſential part. It conſiſts either in the conſtant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
of like objects, or in the inference of the
underſtanding from one object to another. Now ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity,
in both theſe ſenſes, (which, indeed, are, at
bottom, the ſame) has univerſally, tho' tacitly, in
the ſchools, in the pulpit, and in common life, been
allowed to belong to the will of man; and no man
has ever pretended to deny, that we can draw infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
concerning human actions, and that thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
are founded in the experienced union of like
actions, with like motives, inclinations, and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.
The only particular, in which any one can
differ, is, that either, perhaps, he will refuſe to give
the name of neceſſity to this property of human ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:
But as long as the meaning is underſtood, I
hope the word can do no harm: Or that he will
maintain it poſſible to diſcover ſomething farther in
the operations of matter. But this, it muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowleged,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:0050800103:148"/>
can be of no conſequence to morality or
religion, whatever it may be to natural philoſophy or
metaphyſics. We may here be miſtaken in aſſerting,
that there is no idea of any other neceſſity or connexion
in the actions of body: But ſurely we aſcribe nothing
to the actions of the mind, but what every one does,
and muſt readily allow of. We change no circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
in the received orthodox ſyſtem with regard to
the will, but only in that with regard to material ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
and cauſes. Nothing therefore can be more
innocent, at leaſt, than this doctrine.</p>
               <p>ALL laws being founded on rewards and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
'tis ſuppoſed as a fundamental principle, that
theſe motives have a regular and uniform influence on
the mind, and both produce the good and prevent
the evil actions. We may give to this influence, what
name we pleaſe; but as 'tis uſually conjoined with
the action, it muſt be eſteemed a <hi>cauſe,</hi> and be looked
upon as an inſtance of that neceſſity, which we would
here eſtabliſh.</p>
               <p>THE only proper object of hatred or vengeance,
is a perſon or creature, endowed with thought and
conſciouſneſs; and when any criminal or injurious
actions excite that paſſion, 'tis only by their relation
to the perſon, or connexion with him. Actions are,
by their very nature, temporary and periſhing; and
where they proceed not from ſome <hi>cauſe</hi> in the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters
and diſpoſition of the perſon who performed
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:0050800103:149"/>
them, they can neither redound to his honour, if good,
nor infamy, if evil. The actions themſelves may be
blameable; they may be contrary to all the rules of
morality and religion: But the perſon is not anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
for them; and as they proceeded from nothing
in him, that is durable and conſtant, and leave no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of that nature behind them, 'tis impoſſible he
can, upon their account, become the object of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
or vengeance. According to the principle,
therefore, which denies neceſſity, and conſequently
cauſes, a man is as pure and untainted, after having
committed the moſt horrid crime, as at the firſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his birth, nor is his charracter any way con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
in his actions; ſince they are not derived from
it, and the wickedneſs of the one can never be uſed
as a proof of the depravity of the other.</p>
               <p>MEN are not blamed for ſuch actions, as they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
ignorantly and caſually, whatever may be the
conſequences. Why? but becauſe the principles of
theſe actions are only momentary, and terminate in
them alone. Men are leſs blamed for ſuch actions as
they perform haſtily and unpremeditately, than for
ſuch as proceed from deliberation. For what reaſon?
but becauſe a haſty temper, tho' a conſtant cauſe or
principle in the mind, operates only by intervals, and
infects not the whole character. Again, repentance
wipes off every crime, if attended with a reformation
of life and manners. How is this to be accounted
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:0050800103:150"/>
for? but by aſſerting, that actions render a perſon
criminal, merely as they are proofs of criminal prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
in the mind; and when, by any alteration of
theſe principles, they ceaſe to be juſt proofs, they like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
ceaſe to be criminal. But except upon the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine
of neceſſity, they never were juſt proofs, and
conſequently never were criminal.</p>
               <p>IT will be equally eaſy to prove, and from the ſame
arguments, that <hi>liberty,</hi> according to that definition
above mentioned, in which all men agree, is alſo eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential
to morality, and that no human actions, where
it is wanting, are ſuſceptible of any moral qualities,
or can be the objects either of approbation or diſlike.
For as actions are objects of our moral ſentiments, ſo
far only as they are indications of the internal cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter,
paſſions, and affections; 'tis impoſſible that
they can give riſe either to praiſe or blame, where
they proceed not from theſe principles, but are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
altogether from external violence.</p>
               <p>I PRETEND not to have obviated or removed all
objections to this theory, with regard to neceſſity and
liberty. I can foreſee other objections, derived from
topics, which have not here been treated of. It may
be ſaid, for inſtance, that if voluntary actions be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
to the ſame laws of neceſſity with the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of matter, there is a continued chain of neceſſary
cauſes, pre-ordained and pre-determined, reaching
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:0050800103:151"/>
from the original cauſe of all, to every ſingle volition
of every human creature. No contingency any where
in the univerſe; no indifference; no liberty. While
we act, we are, at the ſame time, acted upon. The
ultimate Author of all our volitions is the Creator of
the world, who firſt beſtowed motion on this immenſe
machine, and placed all beings in that particular po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition,
whence every ſubſequent event, by an inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
neceſſity, muſt reſult. Human actions, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
either can have no moral turpitude at all, as
proceeding from ſo good a cauſe; or if they have any
turpitude, they muſt involve our Creator in the ſame
guilt, while he is acknowleged to be their ultimate
cauſe and author. For as a man, who fired a mine,
is anſwerable for all the conſequences, whether the
train he employed be long or ſhort: ſo wherever a
continued chain of neceſſary cauſes are fixed, that Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
either finite or infinite, who produces the firſt,
is likewiſe the author of all the reſt, and muſt both
bear the blame and acquire the praiſe, which belong
to them. Our cleareſt and moſt unalterable ideas of
morality eſtabliſh this rule, upon unqueſtionable rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
when we examine the conſequences of any hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
action; and theſe reaſons muſt ſtill have greater
force, when applied to the volitions and intentions of
a Being, infinitely wiſe and powerful. Ignorance or
impotence may be pleaded for ſo limited a creature as
man; but thoſe imperfections have no place in our
Creator. He foreſaw, he ordained, he intended all
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:0050800103:152"/>
thoſe actions of men, which we ſo raſhly pronounce
criminal. And we muſt conclude, therefore, either
that they are not criminal, or that the Deity, not
man, is accountable for them. But as either of theſe
poſitions is abſurd and impious, it follows, that the
doctrine from which they are deduced, cannot poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
be true, as being liable to all the ſame objections.
An abſurd conſequence, if neceſſary, proves the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
doctrine to be abſurd; in the ſame manner that
criminal actions render criminal the original cauſe, if
the connexion between them be neceſſary and ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitable.</p>
               <p>THIS
objection conſiſts of two parts, which we ſhall
examine ſeparately; <hi>Firſt,</hi> that if human actions can
be traced up, by a neceſſary chain, to the Deity, they
can never be criminal; on account of the infinite per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of that Being, from whom they are derived,
and who can intend nothing but what is altogether
good and laudable. Or <hi>Secondly,</hi> if they be criminal,
we muſt retract the attribute of perfection, which we
aſcribe to the Deity, and muſt acknowlege him to be
the ultimate author of guilt and moral trupitude in
all his creatures.</p>
               <p>THE anſwer to the firſt objection ſeems obvious and
convincing. There are many philoſophers, who, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
an exact ſcrutiny of all the phaenomena of nature,
conclude, that the WHOLE, conſidered as one ſyſtem,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:0050800103:153"/>
is, in every period of its exiſtence, ordered with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
benevolence; and that the utmoſt poſſible hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs
will, in the end, reſult to every created being,
without any mixture of poſitive or abſolute ill and
miſery. Every phyſical ill, ſay they, makes an eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential
part of this benevolent ſyſtem, and could not
poſſibly be removed, even by the Deity himſelf, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered
as a wiſe agent, without giving entrance to
greater ill, or excluding greater good, which will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult
from it. From this theory, ſome philoſophers,
and the antient <hi>Stoics</hi> among the reſt, derived a topic
of conſolation, under all afflictions, while they taught
their pupils, that thoſe ills, under which they laboured,
were, in reality, goods to the univerſe; and that to
an enlarged view, which could comprehend the whole
ſyſtem of nature, every event became an object of joy
and exultation. But tho' this topic be ſpecious and
ſublime, it was ſoon found in practice weak and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual.
You would ſurely more irritate, than ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe
a man, lying under the racking pains of the
gout, by preaching up to him the rectitude of thoſe
general laws, which produced the malignant humours
in his body, and led them, thro' the proper canals,
to the nerves and ſinews, where they now excite ſuch
acute torments. Theſe enlarged views may, for a
moment, pleaſe the imagination of a ſpeculative man,
who is placed in eaſe and ſecurity; but neither can
they dwell with conſtancy on his mind, even tho' un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſturbed
by the emotions of pain or paſſion; much
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:0050800103:154"/>
leſs can they maintain their ground, when attacked
by ſuch powerful antagoniſts. The affections take a
narrower and more natural ſurvey of their objects, and
by an oeconomy, more ſuitable to the infirmity of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
minds, regard alone the beings around us, and are
actuated by ſuch events as appear good or ill to the
private ſyſtem. The caſe is the ſame with <hi>moral</hi> as
with <hi>phyſical</hi> ill. It cannot reaſonably be ſuppoſed,
that thoſe remote conſiderations, which are found of
ſo little efficacy with regard to one, will have a more
powerful influence with regard to the other. The
mind of man is ſo formed by nature, that, upon the
appearance of certain characters, diſpoſitions, and
actions, it immediately feels the ſentiment of appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation
or blame; nor are there any emotions more
eſſential to its frame and conſtitution.</p>
               <p>THE characters, which engage its approbation, are
chiefly ſuch as contribute to the peace and ſecurity of
human ſociety; as the characters, which excite blame,
are chiefly ſuch as tend to public detriment and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbance:
Whence we may reaſonably preſume, that
the moral ſentiments ariſe, either mediately or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately,
from a reflection on theſe oppoſite intereſts.
What tho' philoſophical meditations eſtabliſh a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
opinion or conjecture; that every thing is right
with regard to the WHOLE, and that the qualities,
which diſturb ſociety, are, in the main, as beneficial,
and are as ſuitable to the primary intention of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:0050800103:155"/>
as thoſe which more directly promote its hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs
and welfare? Are ſuch remote and uncertain
ſpeculations able to counter-balance the ſentiments,
which ariſe from the natural and immediate view of
the objects? A man, who is robbed of a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
ſum; does he find his vexation for the loſs any
way diminiſhed by theſe ſublime reflections? Why
then ſhould his moral reſentment againſt the crime be
ſuppoſed incompatible with them? Or why ſhould
not the acknowlegement of a real diſtinction between
vice and virtue be reconcileable to all ſpeculative
ſyſtems of philoſophy, as well as that of a real diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction
between perſonal beauty and deformity?
Both theſe diſtinctions are founded in the natural
ſentiments of the human mind: And theſe ſentiments
are not to be controled nor altered by any philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical
theory or ſpeculation whatſoever.</p>
               <p>THE <hi>ſecond</hi> objection admits not of ſo eaſy and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory
an anſwer; nor is it poſſible to explain diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctly,
how the Deity can be the mediate cauſe of
all the actions of men, without being the author of
ſin and moral turpitude. Theſe are myſteries, which
mere natural and unaſſiſted reaſon is very unfit to
handle; and whatever ſyſtem it embraces, it muſt find
itſelf involved in inextricable difficulties, and even
contradictions, at every ſtep which it takes with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
to ſuch ſubjects. To reconcile the indifference
and contingency of human actions with preſcience;
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:0050800103:156"/>
or to defend abſolute decrees, and yet free the Deity
from being the author of ſin, has been found hitherto
to exceed all the ſkill of philoſophy. Happy, if ſhe
be thence ſenſible of her temerity, when ſhe pries
into theſe ſublime myſteries; and leaving a ſcene ſo
full of obſcurities and perplexities, return, with ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
modeſty, to her true and proper province, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination
of common life; where ſhe will find diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
enow to employ her enquiries, without launch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into ſo boundleſs an ocean of doubt, uncertainty,
and contradiction!</p>

            <head>SECTION IX.</head>
            <head type="sub">Of the REASON of ANIMALS.</head>
            <p>ALL our reaſonings concerning matter of fact
are founded on a ſpecies of ANALOGY, which
leads us to expect from any cauſe the ſame events,
which we have obſerved to reſult from ſimilar cauſes.
Where the cauſes are entirely ſimilar, the analogy is
perfect, and the inference, drawn from it, is regarded
as certain and concluſive: Nor does any man ever
entertain a doubt, where he ſees a piece of iron, that
it will have weight and coheſion of parts; as in all
other inſtances, which have ever fallen under his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation.
But where the objects have not ſo exact a
ſimilarity, the analogy is leſs perfect, and the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
is leſs concluſive; tho' ſtill it has ſome force,
in proportion to the degrees of ſimilarity and reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance.
The anatomical obſervations, formed upon
one animal, are by this ſpecies of reaſoning ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to all animals; and 'tis certain, that when the
circulation of the blood, for inſtance, is proved clearly
to have place in one creature, as a frog or fiſh, it
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:0050800103:158"/>
forms a ſtrong preſumption, that the ſame principle
has place in all. Theſe analogical obſervations may
be carried farther, even to this ſcience, of which we
are now treating; and any theory, by which we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
the operations of the underſtanding, or the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
and connexion of the paſſions in man, will acquire
additional authority, if we find, that the ſame theory
is requiſite to explain the ſame phaenomena in all
other animals. We ſhall make trial of this, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
to the hypotheſis, by which, in the foregoing
diſcourſe, we have endeavored to account for all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimental
reaſonings; and 'tis hoped, that this new
point of view will ſerve to confirm all our former ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi>
IT ſeems evident, that animals, as well as
men, learn many things from experience, and infer,
that the ſame events will always follow from the ſame
cauſes. By this principle, they become acquainted
with the more obvious properties of external objects,
and gradually, from their birth, treaſure up a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege
of the nature of fire, water, earth, ſtones, heights,
dephts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and of the effects, which reſult from their
operation. The ignorance and inexperience of the
young are here plainly diſtinguiſhable from the cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and ſagacity of the old, who have learned, by
long obſervation, to avoid what hurt them, and to
purſue what gave eaſe or pleaſure. A horſe, that
has been accuſtomed to the field, becomes acquainted
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:0050800103:159"/>
with the proper height, which he can leap, and will
never attempt what exceeds his force and ability. An
old greyhound will truſt the more fatiguing part of
the chace to the younger, and will place himſelf ſo
as to meet the hare in her doubles; nor are the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures,
which he forms on this occaſion, founded in
any thing but his obſervation and experience.</p>
            <p>THIS is ſtill more evident from the effects of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline
and education on animals, who, by the porper
application of rewards and puniſhments, may be taught
any courſe of action, the moſt contrary to their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
inſtincts and propenſities. Is it not experience,
which renders a dog apprehenſive of pain, when you
menace him, or lift up the whip to beat him? Is it
not even experience, which makes him anſwer to his
name, and infer, from ſuch an arbitrary ſound, that
you mean him rather than any of his fellows, and
intend to call him, when you pronounce it in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
manner, and with a certain tone and accent?</p>
            <p>IN all theſe caſes, we may obſerve, that the animal
infers ſome fact beyond what immediately ſtrikes his
ſenſes; and that this inference is altogether founded
on paſt experience, while the creature expects from
the preſent object the ſame events, which it has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
found in its obſervation to reſult from ſimilar
objects.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="162" facs="tcp:0050800103:160"/>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> 'TIS impoſſible, that this inference of the
animal can be founded on any proceſs of argument
or reaſoning, by which he concludes, that like events
muſt follow like objects, and that the courſe of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
will always be regular in its operations. For if
there be in reality any arguments of this nature, they
ſurely lie too abſtruſe for the obſervation of ſuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect
underſtandings; ſince it may well employ the
utmoſt care and attention of a philoſophic genius to
diſcover and obſerve them. Animals, therefore, are not
guided in theſe inferences by reaſoning: Neither are
children: Neither are the generality of mankind, in
their ordinary actions and concluſions: Neither are phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers
themſelves, who, in all the active parts of life,
are, in the main, the ſame with the vulgar, and are go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned
by the ſame maxims. Nature muſt have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
ſome other principle, of more ready, and more
general uſe and application; nor can an operation of
ſuch immenſe conſequence in life, as that of inferring
effects from cauſes, be truſted to the uncertain pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
of reaſoning and argumentation. Were this doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
with regard to men, it ſeems to admit of no queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
with regard to the brute-creation; and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion
being once firmly eſtabliſhed in the one, we
have a ſtrong preſumption, from all the rules of ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy,
that it ought to be univerſally admitted, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any exception or reſerve. 'Tis cuſtom alone,
which engages animals, from every object, that ſtrikes
their ſenſes, to infer its uſual attendant, and carries
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:0050800103:161"/>
their imagination, from the appearance of the one,
to conceive the other, in that ſtrong and lively man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
which we denominate <hi>belief.</hi> No other explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
can be given of this operation, in all the higher,
as well as lower claſſes of ſenſitive beings, which
fall under our notice and obſervation<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>Since all reaſonings concerning facts or cauſes is derived merely from cuſtom, it may be aſked how it happens, that men ſo much ſurpaſs animals in reaſoning, and one man ſo much ſurpaſſes another? Has not the ſame cuſtom the ſame influence on all?</p>
                  <p>We ſhall here endeavour briefly to explain the great difference in human underſtandings: After which, the reaſon of the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between men and animals will eaſily be comprehended.</p>
                  <p>1. When we have lived any time, and have been accuſtomed to the uniformity of nature, we acquire a general habit, by which we always transfer the known to the unknown, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the latter to reſemble the former. By means of this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral habitual principle, we regard even one experiment as the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of reaſoning, and expect a ſimilar event with ſome degree of certainty, where the experiment has been made accurately, and free from all foreign circumſtances. 'Tis therefore conſidered as a matter of great importance to obſerve the conſequences of things; and as one man may very much ſurpaſs another in at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention and memory and obſervation, this will make a very great difference in their reaſoning.</p>
                  <p>2. Where there is a complication of cauſes to produce any effect, one mind may be much larger than another, and better able to comprehend the whole ſyſtem of objects, and to infer juſtly their conſequences.</p>
                  <p>3. One man is able to carry on a chain of conſequences to a greater length than another.</p>
                  <p>4. Few men can think long without running into a confuſion of ideas, and miſtaking one for another; and there are various degrees of this infirmity.</p>
                  <p>5. The circumſtance, on which the effect depends, is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently involved in other circumſtances, which are foreign and extrinſic. The ſeparation of it often requires great attention, accuracy, and ſubtilty.</p>
                  <p>6. The forming general maxims from particular obſervation is a very nice operation; and nothing is more uſual, from haſte or a narrowneſs of mind, which ſees not on all ſides, than to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit miſtakes in this particular.</p>
                  <p>7. When we reaſon from analogies, the man, who has the greater experience or the greater promptitude of ſuggeſting ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logies, will be the better reaſoner.</p>
                  <p>8. Byaſſes from prejudice, education, paſſion, party, &amp;c. hang more upon one mind than another.</p>
                  <p>9. After we have acquired a confidence in human teſtimony, books and converſation enlarge much more the ſphere of one man's experience and thought than thoſe of another.</p>

BUT tho' animals learn many parts of their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege
from obſervation, there are alſo many parts of
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:0050800103:163"/>
it, which they derive from the original hand of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
which much exceed the ſhare of capacity they
poſſeſs on ordinary occaſions; and in which they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove,
little or nothing, by the longeſt practice and
experience. Theſe we denominate INSTINCTS, and
are ſo apt to admire, as ſomething very extraordinary,
and inexplicable by all the diſquiſitions of human un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding.
But our wonder will, perhaps, ceaſe or

is nothing but a ſpecies of inſtinct or mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical

and in its chief operations, is not directed by any
ſuch relations or compariſons of ideas, as are the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per

which teaches a bird, with ſuch exactneſs, the art

               <p>THERE is in Dr. TILLOTSON's writings an
argument againſt the <hi>real preſence,</hi> which is as
conciſe, and elegant, and ſtrong as any argument can
poſſibly be ſuppoſed againſt a doctrine, that is ſo little
worthy of a ſerious refutation. 'Tis acknowleged on
all hands, ſays that learned prelate, that the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
either of the ſcripture or of tradition, is founded
merely in the teſtimony of the apoſtles, who were eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witneſſes
to thoſe miracles of our Saviour, by which
he proved his divine miſſion. Our evidence, then,
for the truth of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> religion is leſs than the
evidence for the truth of our ſenſes; becauſe, even
in the firſt authors of our religion, it was no greater;
and 'tis evident it muſt diminiſh in paſſing from them
to their diſciples; nor can any one be ſo certain of
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:0050800103:165"/>
the truth of their teſtimony, as of the immediate ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of his ſenſes. But a weaker evidence can never
deſtroy a ſtronger; and therefore, were the doctrine
of the real preſence ever ſo clearly revealed in ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
it were directly contrary to the rules of juſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning
to give our aſſent to it. It contradicts ſenſe,
tho' both the ſcripture and tradition, on which it is
ſuppoſed to be built, carry not ſuch evidence with
them as ſenſe; when they are conſidered merely as
external evidences, and are not brought home to every
one's breaſt, by the immediate operation of the Holy
Spirit.</p>
               <p>NOTHING is ſo convenient as a deciſive argument
of this kind, which muſt at leaſt <hi>ſilence</hi> the moſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogant
bigotry and ſuperſtition, and free us from their
impertinent ſollicitations. I flatter myſelf, that I have
diſcovered an argument of a like nature, which, if
juſt, will, with the wiſe and learned, be an everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
check to all kinds of ſuperſtitious deluſion, and
conſequently, will be uſeful as long as the world en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dures.
For ſo long, I preſume, will the accounts of
miracles and prodigies be found in all hiſtory, ſacred
and profane.</p>
               <p>THO' experience be our only guide in reaſoning
concerning matters of fact; it muſt be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leged,
that this guide is not altogether infallible,
but in ſome caſes is apt to lead us into errors and
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:0050800103:166"/>
miſtakes. One, who, in our climate, ſhould expect
better weather in any week of JUNE than in one of
DECEMBER, would reaſon juſtly and conformable to
experience; but 'tis certain, that he may happen,
in the event, to find himſelf miſtaken. However,
we may obſerve, that, in ſuch a caſe, he would have
no cauſe to complain of experience; becauſe it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
informs us beforehand of the uncertainty, by
that contrariety of events, which we may learn from
a diligent obſervation. All effects follow not with
like certainty from their ſuppoſed cauſes. Some events
are found, in all countries and all ages, to have been
conſtantly conjoined together: Others are found to
have been more variable, and ſometimes to diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point
our expectations; ſo that in our reaſonings con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
matter of fact, there are all imaginable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of aſſurance, from the higheſt certainty to the
loweſt ſpecies of moral evidence.</p>
               <p>A WISE man, therefore, proportions his belief to
the evidence. In ſuch concluſions as are founded on
an infallible experience, he expects the event with
the laſt degree of aſſurance, and regards his paſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
as a full <hi>proof</hi> of the future exiſtence of that
event. In other caſes, he proceeds with more cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
He weighs the oppoſite experiments: He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders
which ſide is ſupported by the greateſt number
of experiments: To that ſide he inclines, with doubt
and heſitation; and when at laſt he fixes his judgment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="170" facs="tcp:0050800103:167"/>
the evidence exceeds not what we properly call <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability.</hi>
All probability, then, ſuppoſes an oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of experiments and obſervations; where the one
ſide is found to over-balance the other, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
a degree of evidence, proportioned to the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority.
An hundred inſtances or experiments on
one ſide, and fifty on another, afford a very doubtful
expectation of any event; tho' a hundred uniform
experiments, with only one that is contradictory, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably
beget a pretty ſtrong degree of aſſurance.
In all caſes, we muſt balance the oppoſite experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
where they are oppoſite, and deduct the
ſmaller number from the greater, in order to know
the exact force of the ſuperior evidence.</p>
               <p>TO apply theſe principles to a particular inſtance;
we may obſerve, that there is no ſpecies of reaſoning
more common, more uſeful, and even neceſſary to
human life, than that derived from the teſtimony of
men, and the reports of eye-witneſſes and ſpectators.
This ſpecies of reaſoning, perhaps, one may deny
to be founded on the relation of cauſe and effect. I
ſhall not diſpute about a word. It will be ſufficient
to obſerve, that our aſſurance in any argument of
this kind is derived from no other principle than our
obſervation of the veracity of human teſtimony, and
of the uſual conformity of facts to the reports of wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes.
It being a general maxim, that no objects
have any diſcoverable connexion together, and that
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:0050800103:168"/>
all the inferences, which we can draw from one to
another, are founded merely on our experience of
their conſtant and regular conjunction; 'tis evident,
that we ought not to make an exception to this
maxim in favour of human teſtimony, whoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion
with any events ſeems, in itſelf, as little ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
as any other. Were not the memory tena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
to a certain degree; had not men commonly an
inclination to truth and a principle of probity; were
they not ſenſible to ſhame, when detected in a falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood:
Were not theſe, I ſay, diſcovered by <hi>experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi>
to be qualities, inherent in human nature, we
ſhould never repoſe the leaſt confidence in human
teſtimony. A man delirious, or noted for falſhood
and villainy, has no manner of authority with us.</p>
               <p>AND as the evidence, derived from witneſſes and
human teſtimony, is founded on paſt experience,
ſo it varies with the experience, and is regarded
either as a <hi>proof</hi> or a <hi>probability,</hi> according as the
conjunction between any particular kind of report
and any kind of objects, has been found to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
or variable. There are a number of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
to be taken into conſideration in all judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of this kind; and the ultimate ſtandard, by
which we determine all diſputes, that may ariſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
them, is always derived from experience and
obſervation. Where this experience is not entirely
uniform on any ſide, 'tis attended with an unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
contrariety in our judgments, and with the ſame
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:0050800103:169"/>
oppoſition and mutual deſtruction of arguments as in
every other kind of evidence. We frequently heſitate
concerning the reports of others. We balance the
oppoſite circumſtances, which cauſe any doubt or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty;
and when we diſcover a ſuperiority on any
ſide, we incline to it; but ſtill with a diminution of
aſſurance, in proportion to the forec of its anta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goniſt.</p>
               <p>THIS
contrariety of evidence, in the preſent caſe,
may be derived from ſeveral different cauſes; from
the oppoſition of contrary teſtimony; from the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
or number of the witneſſes; from the manner
of their delivering their teſtimony; or from the union
of all theſe circumſtances. We entertain a ſuſpicion
concerning any matter of fact, when the witneſſes
contradict each other; when they are but few, or of
a ſuſpicious character; when they have an intereſt in
what they affirm; when they deliver their teſtimony
with doubt and heſitation, or on the contrary, with
too violent aſſeverations. There are many other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
of the ſame kind, which may diminiſh or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
the force of any argument, derived from human
teſtimony.</p>
               <p>SUPPOSE, for inſtance, that the fact, which teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony
endeavours to eſtabliſh, partakes of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
and the marvellous; in that caſe, the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
reſulting from the teſtimony, admits a dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:0050800103:170"/>
greater or leſs, in proportion as the fact is
more or leſs unuſual. The reaſon, why we place any
credit in witneſſes and hiſtorians is not from any <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nex
on,</hi> which we perceive <hi>à priori</hi> between teſtimony
and reality, but becauſe we are accuſtomed to find a
conformity between them. But when the fact atteſted
is ſuch a one as has ſeldom fallen under our obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
here is a conteſt of two oppoſite experiences;
of which the one deſtroys the other as far as its force
goes, and the ſuperior can only operate on the mind
by the force, which remains. The very ſame prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
of experience, which gives us a certain degree
of aſſurance in the teſtimony of witneſſes, gives us
alſo, in this caſe, another degree of aſſurance againſt
the fact, which they endeavour to eſtabliſh; from
which contradiction there neceſſarily ariſe a counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poize,
and mutual deſtruction of belief and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I
ſhould not believe ſuch a ſtory were it told me by</hi>
CATO; was a proverbial ſaying in ROME, even du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the life-time of that philoſophical patriot<note n="*" place="bottom">PLUTARCH, in vita CATONIS.</note>. The
incredibility of a fact, it was allowed, might invalidate
ſo great an authority.</p>
               <p>THE INDIAN prince, who refuſed to believe the
firſt relations concerning the effects of froſt, reaſoned
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:0050800103:171"/>
juſtly; and it naturally required very ſtrong teſtimony
to engage his aſſent to facts, which aroſe from a ſtate
of nature, with which he was unacquainted, and bore
ſo little analogy to thoſe events, of which he had had
conſtant and uniform experience. Tho' they were
not contrary to his experience, they were not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable
to it<note n="*" place="bottom">No INDIAN, 'tis evident, could have experience that water did not freeze in cold climates. This is placing nature in a ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation quite unknown to him; and 'tis impoſſible for him to tell <hi>à priori</hi> what will reſult from it. 'Tis making a new experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the conſequence of which is always uncertain. One may ſometimes conjecture from analogy what will follow; but ſtill this is but conjecture. And it muſt be confeſt, that, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent caſe of freezing, the event follows contrary to the rules of analogy, and is ſuch as a rational INDIAN would not look for. The operations of cold upon water are not gradual, according to the degrees of cold; but whenever it comes to the freezing point, the water paſſes in a moment, from the utmoſt liquidity to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect hardneſs. Such an event, therefore, may be denominated <hi>extraordinary,</hi> and requires a pretty ſtrong teſtimony, to render it credible to people in a warm climate: But ſtill it is not <hi>mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calous,</hi> nor contrary to uniform experience of the courſe of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in caſes where all the circumſtances are the ſame. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of SUMATRA have always ſeen water liquid in their own climate, and the freezing of their rivers ought to be deemed a prodigy: But they never ſaw water in MUSCOVY during the winter; and therefore they cannot reaſonably be poſitive what would there be the conſequence.</note>.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="175" facs="tcp:0050800103:172"/>
BUT in order to increaſe the probability againſt the
teſtimony of witneſſes, let us ſuppoſe that the fact,
which they affirm, inſtead of being only marvellous,
is really miraculous; and ſuppoſe alſo, that the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
conſidered apart, and in itſelf, amounts to an
entire proof; in that caſe there is proof againſt proof,
of which the ſtrongeſt muſt prevail, but ſtill with a
diminution of its force, in proportion to that of its
antagoniſt.</p>
               <p>A MIRACLE is a violation of the laws of nature:
and as a firm and unalterable experience has eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed
theſe laws, the proof againſt a miracle, from
the very nature of the fact, is as entire as any argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
from experience can poſſibly be imagined. Why
is it more than probable, that all men muſt die; that
lead cannot, of itſelf, remain ſuſpended in the air;
that fire conſumes wood, and is extinguiſhed by wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
unleſs it be, that theſe events are found agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to the laws of nature, and there is required a
violation of theſe laws, or in other words, a miracle
to prevent them? Nothing is eſteemed a miracle if
it ever happen in the common courſe of nature. 'Tis
no miracle that a man in ſeeming good health ſhould
die on a ſudden; becauſe ſuch a kind of death, tho'
more unuſual than any other, has yet been frequently
obſerved to happen. But 'tis a miracle, that a dead
man ſhould come to life; becauſe that has never been
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:0050800103:173"/>
obſerved, in any age or country. There muſt, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
be an uniform experience againſt every miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
event, otherwiſe the event would not merit that
appellation. And as an uniform experience amounts
to a proof there is here a direct and full <hi>proof,</hi> from
the nature of the fact, againſt the exiſtence of any
miracle; nor can ſuch a proof be deſtroyed, or the
miracle rendered credible, but by an oppoſite proof,
which is ſuperior<note n="*" place="bottom">Sometimes an event may not, <hi>in itſelf, ſeem</hi> to be contrary to the laws of nature, and yet, if it were real, it might, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of ſome circumſtances, be denominated a miracle; becauſe, in <hi>fact,</hi> it is contrary to theſe laws. Thus if a perſon, claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a divine authority, ſhould command a ſick perſon to be well, a healthful man to fall down dead, the clouds to pour rain, the winds to blow, in ſhort, ſhould order many natural events, which immediately follow upon his command; theſe might juſtly be eſteemed miracles, becauſe they are really, in this caſe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the laws of nature. For if any ſuſpicion remain, that the event and command concurred by accident, there is no mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle and no tranſgreſſion of the laws of nature. If this ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion be removed, there is evidently a miracle, and a tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of theſe laws; becauſe nothing can be more contrary to nature than that the voice or command of a man ſhould have ſuch an influence. A miracle may be accurately defined, <hi>a t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

THE plain conſequence is (and 'tis a general max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im
worthy of our attention) <q rend="inline">"That no teſtimony is

to eſtabliſh: And even in that caſe, there
is a mutual deſtruction of arguments, and the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior
only gives us an aſſurance ſuitable to that
degree of force, which remains, after deducting
the inferior."</q> When any one tells me, that he
ſaw a dead man reſtored to life, I immediately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
with myſelf, whether it be more probable,
that this perſon ſhould either deceive or be deceived,
or that the fact which he relates, ſhould really have
happened. I weigh the one miracle againſt the other,
and according to the ſuperiority, which I diſcover, I
pronounce my deciſion, and always reject the greater
miracle. If the falſhood of his teſtimony would be
more miraculous, than the event which he relates;
then, and not till then, can he pretend to command
my belief or opinion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="178" facs="tcp:0050800103:175"/>
IN the foregoing reaſoning we have ſuppoſed, that
the teſtimony, upon which a miracle is founded, may
poſſibly amount to an intire proof, and that the falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
of that teſtimony would be a kind of prodigy.
But 'tis eaſy to ſhew, that we have been a great deal
too liberal in our conceſſions, and that there never
was a miraculous event eſtabliſhed on ſo full an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
               <p>FOR
<hi>firſt,</hi> there is not to be found, in all hiſtory,
any miracle atteſted by a ſufficient number of men, of
ſuch unqueſtioned good-ſenſe, education, and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
as to ſecure us againſt all deluſion in themſelves;
of ſuch undoubted integrity, as to place them beyond
all ſuſpicion of any deſign to deceive others; of ſuch
credit and reputation in the eyes of mankind, as to
have a great deal to loſe in caſe of being detected in
any falſhood; and at the ſame time atteſting facts,
performed in ſuch a public manner, and in ſo celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
a part of the world, as to render the detection un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable:
All which circumſtances are requiſite to
give us a full aſſurance in the teſtimony of men.</p>
               <p>SECONDLY. We may obſerve in human nature a
principle, which, if ſtrictly examined, will be found to
diminiſh extremely the aſſurance which we might
have, from human teſtimony, in any kind of prodigy.
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:0050800103:176"/>
The maxim, by which we commonly conduct our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in our reaſonings, is, that the objects, of which
we have no experience, reſemble thoſe, of which we
have: that what we have ſound to be moſt uſual is
always moſt probable; and that where there is an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
of arguments, we ought to give the prefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to ſuch of them as are founded on the greateſt
number of paſt obſervations. But tho' in proceeding
by this rule, we readily reject any fact which is unu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual
and incredible in an ordinary degree; yet in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing
farther, the mind obſerves not always the
ſame rule; but when any thing is affirmed utterly ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd
and miraculous, it rather the more readily admits
ſuch a fact, upon account of that very circumſtance
which ought to deſtroy all its authority. The paſſion
of <hi>ſurprize</hi> and <hi>wonder,</hi> ariſing from miracles, being
an agreeable emotion, gives a ſenſible tendency to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the belief of thoſe events from which it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived.
And this goes ſo far, that even thoſe who
cannot enjoy this pleaſure immediately, nor can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
thoſe miraculous events, of which they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
yet love to partake of the ſatisfaction at ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
hand or by rebound, and place a pride and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
in exciting the admiration of others.</p>
               <p>WITH what greedineſs are the miraculous accounts
of travellers received, their deſcriptions of ſea and
land monſters, their relations of wonderful adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
ſtrange men, and uncouth manners? But if
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:0050800103:177"/>
the ſpirit of religion join itſelf to the love of wonder,
there is an end of common ſenſe; and human teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
in theſe circumſtances, loſes all pretenſions to
authority. A religioniſt may be an enthuſiaſt, and
imagine he ſees what has no reality: He may know
his narration to be falſe, and yet perſevere in it, with
the beſt intentions in the world, for the ſake of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting
ſo holy a cauſe: Or even where this deluſion
has no place, vanity, excited by ſo ſtrong a tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
operates on him more powerfully than on the
reſt of mankind in any other circumſtances; and ſelf-intereſt
with equal force. His auditors may not have,
and commonly have not ſufficient judgment to canvaſs
his evidence: What judgment they have, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
by principle, in theſe ſublime and myſterious
ſubjects: Or if they were ever ſo willing to employ
it, paſſion and a heated imagination diſturb the regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity
of its operations. Their credulity increaſes his
impudence: And his impudence over-powers their
credulity.</p>
               <p>ELOQUENCE, when in its higheſt pitch, leaves
little room for reaſon or reflection; but addreſſing it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
intirely to the fancy or the affections, captivates
the willing hearers, and ſubdues their underſtanding.
Happily, this pitch it ſeldom attains. But what a
CICERO or a DEMOSTHENES could ſcarcely operate
over a ROMAN or ATHENIAN audience, every <hi>Capu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chin,</hi>
every itinerant or ſtationary teacher can perform
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:0050800103:178"/>
over the generality of mankind, and in a higher de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
by touching ſuch groſs and vulgar paſſions<note n="*" place="bottom">The many inſtances of forged miracles, and prophecies, and ſupernatural events, which, in all ages, have either been detect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by contrary evidence, or which detect themſelves by their ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity, mark ſufficiently the ſtrong propenſity of mankind to the extraordinary and the marvellous, and ought reaſonably to beget a ſuſpicion againſt all relations of this kind. This is our natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral way of thinking, even with regard to the moſt common and moſt credible events. For inſtance: There is no kind of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, which riſes ſo eaſily, and ſpreads ſo quickly, eſpecially in country places and provincial towns, as thoſe concerning mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages; inſomuch that two young perſons of equal condition never ſee each other twice, but the whole neighbourhood imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately join them together. The pleaſure of telling a piece of news ſo intereſting, of propagating it, and of being the firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porters of it, ſpreads the intelligence. And this is ſo well known, that no man of ſenſe gives attention to theſe reports, till he finds them confirmed by ſome greater evidence. Do not the ſame paſſions, and others ſtill ſtronger, incline the generality of mankind to the believing and reporting, with the greateſt ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemence and aſſurance, all religious miracles?</note>.</p>
               <p>THIRDLY. It forms a very ſtrong preſumption
againſt all ſupernatural and miraculous relations, that
they are obſerved chiefly to abound among ignorant
and barbarous nations; or if a civilized people has
ever given admiſſion to any of them, that people will
be found to have received them from ignorant and
barbarous anceſtors, who tranſmitted them with that
inviolable ſanction and authority, which always attend
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:0050800103:179"/>
received opinions. When we peruſe the firſt hiſtories
of all nations, we are apt to imagine ourſelves tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
into ſome new world, where the whole frame
of nature is disjointed, and every element performs its
operations in a different manner, from what it does
at preſent. Battles, revolutions, peſtilences, famines,
and death, are never the effects of thoſe natural cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
which we experience. Prodigies, omens, ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
judgments, quite obſcure the few natural events,
that are intermingled with them. But as the former
grow thinner every page, in proportion as we advance
nearer the enlightened ages of ſcience and knowlege,
we ſoon learn, that there is nothing myſterious or ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural
in the caſe, but that all proceeds from the
uſual propenſity of mankind towards the marvellous,
and that tho' this inclination may at intervals receive
a check from ſenſe and learning, it can never tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly
be extirpated from human nature.</p>
               <p>'<hi>Tis ſtrange,</hi> a judicious reader is apt to ſay, upon
the peruſal of theſe wonderful hiſtorians, <hi>that ſuch
prodigious events never happen in our days.</hi> But 'tis no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
ſtrange, I hope, that men ſhould lie in all
ages. You muſt ſurely have ſeen inſtances enow of
that frailty. You have yourſelf heard many ſuch
marvellous relations ſtarted, which being treated with
ſcorn by all the wiſe and judicious, have at laſt been
abandoned even by the vulgar. Be aſſured, that thoſe
renowned lies, which have ſpread and flouriſhed to ſuch
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:0050800103:180"/>
a monſtrous height, aroſe from like beginnings; but
being ſown in a more proper ſoil, ſhot up at laſt into
prodigies almoſt equal to thoſe which they relate.</p>
               <p>'TWAS a wiſe policy in that cunning impoſtor,
ALEXANDER, who, tho' now forgotten, was once ſo
famous, to lay the firſt ſcene of his impoſtures in PA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PHLAGONIA,
where, as LUCIAN tells us, the people
were extremely ignorant and ſtupid, and ready to
ſwallow even the groſſeſt deluſion. People at a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
who are weak enough to think the matter at
all worth inquiry, have no opportunity of receiving
better information. The ſtories come magnified to
them by a hundred circumſtances. Fools are induſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious
to propagate the deluſion; while the wiſe and
learned are contented, in general, to deride its ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity,
without informing themſelves of the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
facts by which it may be diſtinctly refuted. And
thus the impoſtor above-mentioned was enabled to
proceed, from his ignorant PAPHLAGONIANS, to the
inliſting of votaries, even among the GRECIAN phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers,
and men of the moſt eminent rank and
diſtinction in ROME: Nay, could engage the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of that ſage emperor MARCUS AURELIUS; ſo
far as to make him truſt the ſucceſs of a military ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition
to his deluſive prophecies.</p>
               <p>THE advantages are ſo great of ſtarting an impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
among an ignorant people, that even tho' the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:0050800103:181"/>
ſhould be too groſs to impoſe on the generality
of them <hi>(which, tho' ſeldom, is ſometimes the caſe)</hi> it
has a much better chance of ſucceeding in remote
countries, than if the firſt ſcene had been laid in a
city renowned for arts and knowlege. The moſt ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
and barbarous of theſe barbarians carry the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
abroad. None of their countrymen have large
enough correſpondence of ſufficient credit and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
to contradict and beat down the deluſion. Mens
inclination to the marvellous has full opportunity to
diſplay itſelf. And thus a ſtory, which is univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally
exploded in the place where it was firſt ſtarted,
ſhall paſs for certain at a thouſand miles diſtance.
But had ALEXANDER fixed his reſidence at ATHENS,
the philoſophers of that renowned mart of learning
had immediately ſpread, thro' the whole ROMAN
empire, their ſenſe of the matter, which, being ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
by ſo great authority, and diſplayed by all the
force of reaſon and eloquence, had intirely opened
the eyes of mankind. 'Tis true; LUCIAN paſſing by
chance thro' PAPHLAGONIA had an opportunity of
performing this good office. But, tho' much to be
wiſhed, it does not always happen, that every ALE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>XANDER
meets with a LUCIAN, ready to expoſe and
detect his impoſtures<note n="†" place="bottom">It may here, perhaps, be objected, that I proceed raſhly, and form my notions of ALEXANDER merely from the account given of him by LUCIAN, a profeſſed enemy. It were, indeed, to be wiſhed, that ſome of the accounts publiſhed by his follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and accomplices had remained. The oppoſition and contraſt between the character and conduct of the ſame man, as drawn by a friend or an enemy, is as ſtrong, even in common life, much more in theſe religious matters, as that betwixt any two men in the world, betwixt ALEXANDER and St. PAUL, for inſtance. See a letter to GILBERT WEST, Eſq. on the converſion and apoſtleſhip of St. PAUL.</note>.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="185" facs="tcp:0050800103:182"/>
I MAY add as a <hi>fourth</hi> reaſon, which diminiſhes
the authority of prodigies, that there is no teſtimony
for any, even thoſe which have not been expreſsly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected,
that is not oppoſed by an infinite number of
witneſſes; ſo that not only the miracle deſtroys the
credit of the teſtimony, but even the teſtimony de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys
itſelf. To make this the better underſtood, let
us conſider that, in matters of religion, whatever is
different is contrary, and that 'tis impoſſible the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions
of antient ROME, of TURKEY, of SIAM, and
of CHINA ſhould, all of them, be eſtabliſhed on any
ſolid foundation. Every miracle, therefore, pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to have been wrought in any of theſe religions
(and all of them abound in miracles) as its direct
ſcope is to eſtabliſh the particular ſyſtem to which it is
attributed; ſo has it the ſame force, tho' more indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly,
to overthrow every other ſyſtem. In deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a rival ſyſtem, it likewiſe deſtroys the credit of
thoſe miracles, on which that ſyſtem was eſtabliſhed;
ſo that all the prodigies of different religions are to
be regarded as contrary facts, and the evidences of
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:0050800103:183"/>
theſe prodigies, whether weak or ſtrong, as oppoſite
to each other. According to this method of reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
when we believe any miracle of MAHOMET or
any of his ſucceſſors, we have for our warrant the teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony
of a few barbarous ARABIANS: And on the
other hand, we are to regard the authority of TITUS
LIVIUS, PLUTARCH, TACITUS, and, in ſhort, of all
the authors and witneſſes, GRECIAN, CHINESE, and
ROMAN CATHOLIC, who have related any miracles
in their particular religion; I ſay, we are to regard
their teſtimony in the ſame light as if they had men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
that MAHOMETAN miracle, and had in expreſs
terms contradicted it, with the ſame certainty as they
have for the miracles they relate. This argument
may appear over ſubtile and refined; but is not in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality
different from the reaſoning of a judge, who ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes,
that the credit of two witneſſes, maintaining a
crime againſt any one, is deſtroyed by the teſtimony of
two others, who affirm him to have been two hundred
leagues diſtant, at the ſame inſtant when the crime is
ſaid to have been committed.</p>
               <p>ONE of the beſt atteſted miracles in all prophane
hiſtory, is that which TACITUS reports of VESPA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SIAN,
who cured a blind man in ALEXANDRIA, by
means of his ſpittle, and a lame man by the mere
touch of his foot; in obedience to a viſion of the god
SERAPIS, who had enjoined them to have recourſe to
the Emperor, for theſe miraculous and extraordinary
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:0050800103:184"/>
cures. The ſtory may be ſeen in that fine hiſtorian<note n="*" place="bottom">Hiſt. Lib. 5. Cap. 8. SUETONIUS gives the ſame ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count <hi>in vita</hi> VESP.</note>;
where every circumſtance ſeems to add weight to the
teſtimony, and might be diſplayed at large with all
the force of argument and eloquence, if any one were
now concerned to enforce the evidence of that explo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
and idolatrous ſuperſtition. The gravity, ſolidity,
age, and probity of ſo great an emperor, who, thro'
the whole courſe of his life, converſed in a familiar
way with his friends and courtiers, and never affected
thoſe extraordinary airs of divinity aſſumed by ALE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>XANDER
and DEMETRIUS. The hiſtorian, a cotem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary
writer, noted for candour and veracity, and
withal, the greateſt and moſt penetrating genius, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
of all antiquity; and ſo free from any tendency
to ſuperſtition and credulity, that he even lies under
the contrary imputation, of atheiſm and prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:
The perſons, from whoſe teſtimony he related
the miracle, of eſtabliſhed character for judgment and
veracity, as we may well preſume; eye-witneſſes of
the fact, and confirming their verdict, after the FLA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VIAN
family were deſpoiled of the empire, and could
no longer give any reward, as the price of a lie.
<hi>Utrumque, qui interfuere, nunc quoque memorant, poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam
nullum mendacio pretium.</hi> To which if we add
the public nature of the facts, as related, it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:0050800103:185"/>
that no evidence can well be ſuppoſed ſtronger
for ſo groſs and ſo palpable a falſhood.</p>
               <p>THERE is alſo a very memorable ſtory related by
Cardinal DE RETZ, and which may well deſerve our
conſideration. When that intriguing politician fled
into SPAIN, to avoid the perſecution of his enemies,
he paſſed thro' SARAGOSSA, the capital of ARRA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GON,
where he was ſhewn, in the cathedral, a man,
who had ſerved twenty years as a door-keeper, and
was well known to every body in town, that had ever
paid their devotions at that church. He had been
ſeen, for ſo long a time, wanting a leg; but recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that limb by the rubbing of holy oil upon the
ſtump; and the cardinal aſſures us that he ſaw him
with two legs. This miracle was vouched by all the
canons of the church; and the whole company in
town were appealed to for a confirmation of the fact;
whom the cardinal found, by their zealous devotion,
to be thorough believers of the miracle. Here the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>later
was alſo cotemporary to the ſuppoſed prodigy,
of an incredulous and libertine character, as well as of
great genius, the miracle of ſo <hi>ſingular</hi> a nature as
could ſcarce admit of a counterfeit, and the witneſſes
very numerous, and all of them, in a manner, ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
of the fact to which they gave their teſtimony.
And what adds mightily to the force of the evidence,
and may double our ſurprize on this occaſion, is, that
the cardinal himſelf, who relates the ſtory, ſeems not
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:0050800103:186"/>
to give any credit to it, and conſequently cannot be
ſuſpected of any concurrence in the holy fraud. He
conſidered juſtly, that it was not requiſite, in order to
reject a fact of this nature, to be able accurately to
diſprove the teſtimony, and to trace its falſhood,
thro' all the circumſtances of knavery and credulity
which produced it. He knew, that as this was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
altogether impoſſible at any ſmall diſtance of
time and place; ſo was it extremely difficult, even
where one was immediately preſent, by reaſon of the
bigotry, ignorance, cunning and roguery of a great
part of mankind. He therefore concluded, like a
juſt reaſoner, that ſuch an evidence carried falſhood
upon the very face of it, and that a miracle ſupported
by any human teſtimony, was more properly a ſubject
of deriſion than of argument.</p>
               <p>THERE ſurely never was ſo great a number of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
aſcribed to one perſon, as thoſe, which were
lately ſaid to have been wrought in FRANCE upon the
tomb of Abbé PARIS, the famous JANSENIST, with
whoſe ſanctity the people were ſo long deluded. The
curing of the ſick, giving hearing to the deaf, and
ſight to the blind, were every where talked of as the
uſual effects of that holy ſepulchre. But what is
more extraordinary; many of the miracles were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
proved, upon the ſpot, before judges of
unqueſtioned integrity, atteſted by witneſſes of credit
and diſtinction, in a learned age, and on the moſt
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:0050800103:187"/>
eminent theatre that is now in the world. Nor is
this all: A relation of them was publiſhed and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed
every where; nor were the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> tho' a
learned body, ſupported by the civil magiſtrate, and
determined enemies to thoſe opinions, in whoſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
the miracles were ſaid to have been wrought,
ever able diſtinctly to refute or detect them<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>This book was wrote by Monſ. de MONTGERON, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellor or judge of the parliament of PARIS, a man of figure and character, who was alſo a martyr to the cauſe, and is now ſaid to be ſomewhere in a dungeon on account of his book.</p>
                     <p>There is another book in three volumes (called <hi>Recueil des Miracles de l' Abbé</hi> PARIS) giving an account of many of theſe miracles, and accompanied with prefatory diſcourſes, which are very well wrote. There runs, however, thro' the whole of theſe a ridiculous compariſon between the miracles of our Saviour and thoſe of the Abbé; wherein 'tis aſſerted, that the evidence for the latter is equal to that for the former: As if the teſtimony of men could ever be put in the balance with that of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, who conducted the pen of the inſpired writers. If theſe writers, indeed, were to be conſidered merely as human teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, the FRENCH author is very moderate in his compariſon; ſince he might, with ſome appearance of reaſon, pretend, that the JANSENIST miracles much ſurpaſs the others in evidence and authority. The following circumſtances are drawn from au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentic papers, inſerted in the above-mentioned book.</p>
                     <p>Many of the miracles of Abbé PARIS were proved immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately by witneſſes before the officiality or biſhop's court of PARIS, under the eye of cardinal NOAILLES, whoſe character for integrity and capacity was never conteſted even by his enemies.</p>
                     <p>His ſucceſſor in the archbiſhopric was an enemy to the JAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SENISTS, and for that reaſon promoted to the ſee by the court. Yet 22 rectors or <hi>cures</hi> of PARIS, with infinite earneſtneſs, preſs him to examine thoſe miracles, which they aſſert to be known to the whole world, and indiſputably certain: But he wiſely forbore.</p>
                     <p>The MOLINIST party had tried to diſcredit theſe miracles in one inſtance, that of Madamoiſelle de FRANC. But, beſides that their proceedings were in many reſpects the moſt irregular in the world, particularly in citing only a few of the JANSE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NISTS witneſſes, whom they tampered with: Beſides this, I ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>y, they ſoon found themſelves overwhelmed by a cloud of new witneſſes, one hundred and twenty in number, moſt of them per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of credit and ſubſtance in PARIS, who gave oath for the miracle. This was accompanied with a ſolemn and earneſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to the parliament. But the parliament were forbid by au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to meddle in the affair. It was at laſt obſerved that where men are heated by zeal and enthuſiaſm, there is no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of human teſtimony ſo ſtrong as may not be procured for the greateſt abſurdity: And thoſe who will be ſo ſilly as to examine the affair by that medium, and ſeek particular flaws in the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, are almoſt ſure to be conſounded. It muſt be a miſerable impoſture, indeed, that does not prevail in that conteſt.</p>
                     <p>All who have been in FRANCE about that time have heard of the great reputation of Monſ, HERAUT, the <hi>lieutenant de Police,</hi> whoſe vigilance, penetration, activity, and extenſive intelligence have been much talked of. This magiſtrate, who by the nature of his office is almoſt abſolute, was inveſted with full powers, on purpoſe to ſuppreſs or diſcredit theſe miracles; and he frequently ſeized immediately, and examined the witneſſes and ſubjects of them: But never could reach any thing ſatisfactory againſt them.</p>
                     <p>In the caſe of Madamoiſelle THIBAUT he ſent the famous De SYLVA to examine her; whoſe evidence is very curious. The phyſician declares, that it was impoſſible ſhe could have been ſo ill as was proved by witneſſes; becauſe it was impoſſible ſhe could, in ſo ſhort a time, have recovered ſo perfectly as he found her. He reaſoned, like a man of ſenſe, from natural cauſes; but the oppoſite party told him, that the whole was a miracle, and that his evidence was the very beſt proof of it.</p>
                     <p>The MOLINISTS were in a ſad dilemma. They durſt not aſſert the abſolute inſufficiency of human evidence to prove a miracle. They were obliged to ſay, that theſe miracles were wrought by witchcraft and the devil. But they were told, that this was the reſource of the JEWS of old.</p>
                     <p>No JANSENIST was ever embarraſſed to account for the ceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of the miracles, when the church-yard was ſhut up by the king's edict. It was the touch of the tomb, which opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted theſe extraordinary effects; and when no one could approach the tomb, no effects could be expected. God, indeed, could have thrown down the walls in a moment; but he is maſter of his own graces and works, and it belongs not to us to account for them. He did not throw down the walls of every city like thoſe of JERICHO, on the ſounding of the rams horns, nor break up the priſon of every apoſtle, like that of St. PAUL.</p>
                     <p>No leſs a man, than the Duc de CHATILLON, a duke and peer of FRANCE of the higheſt rank and family, gives evidence of a miraculous cure, performed upon a ſervant of his, who had lived ſeveral years in his houſe with a viſible and palpable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall conclude with obſerving, that no clergy are more cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated for ſtrictneſs of life and manners than the ſecular clergy of FRANCE, particularly the rectors or curés of PARIS, who bear ſuch teſtimony to theſe impoſtures.</p>
                     <p>The learning, genius, and probity of the gentlemen, and the auſterity of the nuns of PORT-ROYAL, have been much cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated all over EUROPE. Yet they all give evidence for a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, wrought on the niece of the famous PASCHAL, whoſe ſanctity of life, as well as extraordinary capacity, is well known. The famous RACINE gives an account of this miracle in his famous hiſtory of PORT-ROYAL, and fortifies it with all the proofs, which a multitude of nuns, prieſts, phyſicians, and men of the world, all of them of undoubted credit, could beſtow up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it. Several men of letters, particularly the biſhop of TOUR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NAY, thought this miracle ſo certain, as to employ it in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation of atheiſts and free-thinkers. The queen-regent of FRANCE, who was extremely prejudiced againſt the PORT-ROYAL, ſent her own phyſician to examine the miracle, who returned an abſolute convert. In ſhort, the ſupernatural cure was ſo unconteſtable, that it ſaved, for a time, that famous mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery from the ruin with which it was threatened by the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits. Had it been a cheat, it had certainly been detected by ſuch ſagacious and powerful antagoniſts, and muſt have haſtened the ruin of the contrivers. Our divines, who can build up a formidable caſtle from ſuch deſpicable materials; what a prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious fabric could they have reared from theſe and many other circumſtances, which I have not mentioned! How oft would the great names of PASCHAL, RACINE, ARNAUD, NICOLE, have reſounded in our ears? But if they be wiſe, they had better ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opt the miracle, as being more worth, a thouſand times, than all the reſt of their collection. Beſides, it may ſerve very much to their purpoſe. For that miracle was really performed by the touch of an authentic holy prickle of the holy thorn, which compoſed the holy crown, which, &amp;c.</p>

than to appear a miſſionary, a prophet, an am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador
from heaven? Who would not encounter
many dangers and difficulties, in order to attain ſo
ſublime a character? Or if, by the help of vanity and
a heated imagination, a man has firſt made a convert
of himſelf and entered ſeriouſly into the deluſion;
who ever ſcruples to make uſe of pious frauds, in ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
of ſo holy and meritorious a cauſe?</p>
               <p>THE ſmalleſt ſpark may here kindle into the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
flame; becauſe the materials are always prepared
for it. The <hi>avidum genus auricularum</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">LUCRET.</note>, the gazing
populace receive greedily, without examination, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
ſooths ſuperſtition, and promotes wonder.</p>
               <p>HOW many ſtories of this nature have, in all ages,
been detected and exploded in their infancy? How
many more have been celebrated for a time, and have
afterwards ſunk into neglect and oblivion? Where
ſuch reports, therefore, fly about, the ſolution of the
phaenomenon is obvious; and we judge in confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:0050800103:193"/>
to regular experience and obſervation, when we
account for it by the known and natural principles of
credulity and deluſion. And ſhall we, rather than
have a recourſe to ſo natural a ſolution, allow of a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous
violation of the moſt eſtabliſhed laws of
nature?</p>
               <p>I NEED not mention the difficulty of detecting a
falſhood in any private or even public hiſtory, at the
time and place, where it is ſaid to happen; much
more where the ſcene is removed to ever ſo ſmall a
diſtance. Even a court of judicature, with all the
authority, accuracy, and judgment, which they can
employ, find themſelves often at a loſs to diſtinguiſh
between truth and falſhood in the moſt recent actions.
But the matter never comes to any iſſue, if truſted
to the common method of altercation and debate and
flying rumours; eſpecially when mens paſſions have
taken party on either ſide.</p>
               <p>IN the infancy of new religions, the wiſe and
learned commonly eſteem the matter too inconſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to deſerve their attention or regard. And when
afterwards they would willingly detect the cheat, in
order to undeceive the deluded multitude, the ſeaſon
is now gone, and the records and witneſſes, which
might clear up the matter, have periſhed beyond
recovery.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="197" facs="tcp:0050800103:194"/>
NO means of detection remain, but thoſe which
muſt be drawn from the very teſtimony itſelf of the
reporters: And theſe, tho' always ſufficient with the
judicious and knowing, are commonly too fine to
fall under the comprehenſion of the vulgar.</p>
               <p>UPON the whole, then, it appears, that no teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
for any kind of miracle has ever amounted to a
probability, much leſs to a proof; and that, even
ſuppoſing it amounted to a proof, it would be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
by another proof derived from the very nature
of the fact, which it would endeavour to eſtabliſh.
'Tis experience only, which gives authority to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
teſtimony; and 'tis the ſame experience, which
aſſures us of the laws of nature. When, therefore,
theſe two kinds of experience are contrary, we have
nothing to do but ſubſtract the one from the other,
and embrace an opinion, either on one ſide or the
other, with that aſſurance which ariſes from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder.
But according to the principle here ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained,
this ſubſtraction, with regard to all popular
religions, amounts to an intire annihilation; and
therefore we may eſtabliſh it as a maxim, that no
human teſtimony can have ſuch force as to prove a
miracle, and make it a juſt foundation for any ſuch
ſyſtem of religion<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>I beg the limitations here made may be remarked, when I ſay, that a miracle can never be proved, ſo as to be the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a ſyſtem of religion. For I own, that otherwiſe, there may poſſibly be miracles, or violations of the uſual courſe of nature, of ſuch a kind as to admit of proof from human teſtimony; tho', perhaps, it will be impoſſible to find any ſuch in all the records of hiſtory. Thus, ſuppoſe, all authors, in all languages, agree, that from the firſt of January, 1600, there was a total darkneſs over the whole earth for eight days: Suppoſe that the tradition of this extraordinary event is ſtill ſtrong and lively among the People: That all travellers, who return from foreign countries, bring us accounts of the ſame tradition, without the leaſt varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or contradiction: 'Tis evident, that our preſent philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, inſtead of doubting of that fact, ought to receive it for certain, and ought to ſearch for the cauſes whence it might be derived. The decay, corruption, and diſſolution of nature, is an event rendered probable by ſo many analogies, that any phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menon, which ſeems to have a tendency towards that cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrophe, comes within the reach of human teſtimony, if that teſtimony be very extenſive, and uniform.</p>
                     <p>But ſuppoſe, that all the hiſtorians, who treat of ENGLAND, ſhould agree, that on the firſt of JANUARY, 1600, Queen ELI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ZABETH died; that both before and after her death ſhe was ſeen by her phyſicians and the whole court, as is uſual with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of her rank; that her ſucceſſor was acknowleged and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed by the parliament; and that, after being interred a month, ſhe again appeared, took poſſeſſion of the throne, and governed ENGLAND for three years: I muſt confeſs, I ſhould be ſurprized at the concurrence of ſo many odd circumſtances, but ſhould not have the leaſt inclination to believe ſo miraculous an event. I ſhould not doubt of her pretended death, and of thoſe other public circumſtances that followed it: I ſhould only aſſert it to have been pretended, and that it neither was, nor poſſibly could be real. You would in vain object to me the difficulty, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt impoſſibility of deceiving the world in an affair of ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence; the wiſdom and integrity of that renowned queen; with the little or no advantage which ſhe could reap from ſo poor an artifice: All this might aſtoniſh me; but I would ſtill reply, that the knavery and folly of men are ſuch common phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena, that I ſhould rather believe the moſt extraordinary events to ariſe from their concurrence, than admit ſo ſignal a violation of the laws of nature.</p>
                     <p>But ſhould this miracle be aſcribed to any new ſyſtem of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; men, in all ages, have been ſo much impoſed on by ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous ſtories of that kind, that this very circumſtance would be a full proof of a cheat, and ſufficient, with all men of ſenſe, not only to make them reject the fact, but even reject it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out farther examination. Tho' the Being to whom the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle is aſcribed, be, in this caſe, Almighty, it does not, upon that account, become a whit more probable; ſince 'tis impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for us to know the attributes or actions of ſuch a being, otherwiſe than from the experience which we have of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions, in the uſual courſe of nature. This ſtill reduces us to paſt obſervation, and obliges us to compare the inſtances of the violations of truth in the teſtimony of men with thoſe of the violation of the laws of nature by miracles, in order to judge which of them is moſt likely and probable. As the violations of truth are more common in the teſtimony concerning religious miracles, than in that concerning any other matter of fact; this muſt diminiſh very much the authority of the former teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, and make us form a general reſolution, never to lend any attention to it, with whatever ſpecious pretext it may be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered.</p>

I AM the better pleaſed with this method of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning,

Religion,</hi> who have undertaken to defend it by
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:0050800103:197"/>
the principles of human reaſon. Our moſt holy reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
is founded on <hi>Faith,</hi> not on reaſon; and 'tis a
ſure method of expoſing it to put it to ſuch a trial as
it is, by no means, fitted to endure. To make this
more evident, let us examine thoſe miracles, related
in ſcripture; and not to loſe ourſelves in too wide a
field, let us confine ourſelves to ſuch as we find in the
<hi>Pentateuch,</hi> which we ſhall examine, according to the
principles of theſe pretended Chriſtians, not as the
word or teſtimony of God himſelf, but as the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
of a mere human writer and hiſtorian. Here
then we are firſt to conſider a book, preſented to us
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:0050800103:198"/>
by a barbarous and ignorant people, wrote in an age
when they were ſtill more barbarous, and in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability
long after the facts which it relates; corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borated
by no concurring teſtimony, and reſembling
thoſe fabulous accounts, which every nation gives of
its origin. Upon reading this book, we find it full
of prodigies and miracles. It gives an account of a
ſtate of the world and of human nature intirely dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
from the preſent: Of our fall from that ſtate:
Of the age of man, extended to near a thouſand
years: Of the deſtruction of the world by a deluge:
Of the arbitrary choice of one people, a the favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites
of heaven; and that people, the countrymen of
the author: Of their deliverance from bondage by
prodigies the moſt aſtoniſhing imaginable: I deſire
any one to lay his hand upon his heart, and after ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
conſideration declare, whether he thinks, that
the falſhood of ſuch a book, ſupported by ſuch a teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony,
would be more extraordinary and miraculous
than all the miracles it relates; which is, however,
neceſſary to make it be received, according to the
meaſures of probability above eſtabliſhed.</p>
               <p>WHAT we have ſaid of miracles may be applied,
without any variation, to prophecies; and indeed, all
prophecies are real miracles, and as ſuch only, can be
admitted as proofs of any revelation. If it did not
exceed the capacity of human nature to foretel future
events, it would be abſurd to employ any prophecy
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:0050800103:199"/>
as an argument for a divine miſſion or authority from
heaven. So that, upon the whole, we may conclude,
that the <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> not only was at firſt attended
with miracles, but even at this day cannot be believed
by any reaſonable perſon without one. Mere reaſon
is inſufficient to convince us of its veracity: And
whoever is moved by <hi>Faith</hi> to aſſent to it is conſcious
of a continued miracle in his own perſon, which ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts
all the principles of his underſtanding, and gives
him a determination to believe what is moſt contrary
to cuſtom and experience.</p>

            <p>I WAS lately engaged in converſation with a friend
who loves ſceptical paradoxes; where, tho' he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
many principles, of which I can by no means
approve, yet as they ſeem to be curious, and to bear
ſome relation to the chain of reaſoning carried on
thro' this enquiry, I ſhall here copy them from my
memory as accurately as I can, in order to ſubmit
them to the judgment of the reader.</p>
            <p>OUR converſation began with my admiring the
ſingular good fortune of philoſophy, which, as it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
intire liberty, above all other privileges, and
flouriſhes chiefly from the free oppoſition of ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and argumentation, received its firſt birth in an
age and country of freedom and toleration, and was
never cramped, even in its moſt extravagant prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
by any creeds, confeſſions, or penal ſtatutes.
For except the baniſhment of PROTAGORAS, and the
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:0050800103:201"/>
death of SOCRATES, which laſt event proceeded
partly from other motives, there are ſcarce any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
to be met with, in antient hiſtory, of this bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotted
jealouſy, with which the preſent age is ſo much
infeſted. EPICURUS lived at ATHENS to an advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
age, in peace and tranquillity: EPICUREANS
<note n="*" place="bottom">LUCIANI <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> were even admitted to receive the ſacerdotal charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and to officiate at the altar, in the moſt ſacred
rites of the eſtabliſhed religion: And the public en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement<note n="†" place="bottom">Id. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> of penſions and ſalaries was afforded
equally, by the wiſeſt of all the ROMAN emperors<note n="‡" place="bottom">Id. &amp; Dio.</note>,
to the profeſſors of every ſect of philoſophy. How re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite
ſuch kind of treatment was to philoſophy, in
its firſt origin, will eaſily be conceived, if we reflect,
that even at preſent, when it may be ſuppoſed more
hardy and robuſt, it bears with much difficulty the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clemency
of the ſeaſons, and thoſe harſh winds of ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny
and perſecution, which blow upon it.</p>
            <p>YOU admire, ſays my friend, as the ſingular good
fortune of philoſophy, what ſeems to reſult from the
natural courſe of things, and to be unavoidable in
every age and nation. This pertinacious bigotry, of
which you complain, as ſo fatal to philoſophy, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
her offspring, who, after allying with ſuperſtition,
ſeparates himſelf intirely from the intereſt of his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
and becomes her moſt inveterate enemy and
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:0050800103:202"/>
perſecutor. Speculative dogmas of religion, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
occaſions of ſuch furious diſpute, could not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
be conceived or admitted in the early ages of the
world; when mankind, being wholly illiterate,
formed an idea of religion, more ſuitable to their
weak apprehenſion, and compoſed their ſacred tenets
chiefly of ſuch tales as were the objects of traditional
belief, more than of argument or diſputation. After the
firſt alarm, therefore, was over, which aroſe from
the new paradoxes and principles of the philoſophers;
theſe teachers ſeem ever after, during the ages of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity,
to have lived in great harmony with the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed
ſuperſtitions, and to have made a fair partition
of mankind between them; the former claiming all
the learned and the wiſe, and the latter poſſeſſing all
the vulgar and illiterate.</p>
            <p>IT ſeems then, ſays I, that you leave politics intirely
out of the queſtion, and never ſuppoſe, that a wiſe
magiſtrate can juſtly be jealous of certain tenets of
philoſophy, ſuch as thoſe of EPICURUS, which deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a divine exiſtence, and conſequently a providence
and a future ſtate, ſeem to looſen, in a great meaſure,
the ties of morality, and may be ſuppoſed, for that
reaſon, pernicious to the peace of civil ſociety.</p>
            <p>I KNOW, replied he, that in fact theſe perſecutions
never, in any age, proceeded from calm reaſon, or
any experience of the pernicious conſequences of phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy;
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:0050800103:203"/>
but aroſe intirely from paſſion and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice.
But what if I ſhould advance farther, and
aſſert, that if EPICURUS had been accuſed before the
people, by any of the <hi>ſycophants</hi> or informers of thoſe
days, he could eaſily have defended his cauſe, and
proved his principles of philoſophy to be as ſalutary
as thoſe of his adverſaries, who endeavoured, with
ſuch zeal, to expoſe him to the public hatred and
jealouſy?</p>
            <p>I WISH, ſaid I, you would try your eloquence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſo extraordinary a topic, and make a ſpeech for
EPICURUS, which might ſatisfy, not the mob of
ATHENS, if you will allow that antient and polite
city to have contained any mob, but the more philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophical
part of his audience, ſuch as might be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
capable of comprehending his arguments.</p>
            <p>THE matter would not be difficult, upon ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,
replied he: And if you pleaſe, I ſhall ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
myſelf EPICURUS for a moment, and make you
ſtand for the ATHENIAN people, and ſhall deliver
you ſuch an harangue as will fill all the urn with white
beans, and leave not a black one to gratify and malice
of my adverſaries.</p>
            <p>VERY well: Pray proceed upon theſe ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="207" facs="tcp:0050800103:204"/>
I COME hither, O ye ATHENIANS, to juſtify in
your aſſembly what I maintained in my ſchool, and
find myſelf impeached by furious antagoniſts, inſtead
of reaſoning with calm and diſpaſſionate inquirers.
Your deliberations, which of right ſhould be directed
to queſtions of public good, and the intereſt of the
commonwealth, are diverted to the diſquiſitions of
ſpeculative philoſophy; and theſe magnificent, but
perhaps fruitleſs inquiries, take place of your more
familiar but more uſeful occupations. But ſo far as in
me lies, I will prevent this abuſe. We ſhall not herre
diſpute concerning the origin and government of
worlds. We ſhall only inquire how far ſuch queſtions
concern the public intereſt. And if I can perſuade
you, that they are intirely indifferent to the peace of
ſociety and ſecurity of government, I hope that you
will preſently ſend us back to our ſchools, there to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
at leiſure the queſtion the moſt ſublime, but, at
the ſame time, the moſt ſpeculative of all philoſophy.</p>
            <p>THE religious philoſophers, not ſatisfied with the
traditions of your forefathers, and doctrines of your
prieſts (in which I willingly acquieſce) indulge a raſh
curioſity, in trying how far they can eſtabliſh religion
upon the principles of reaſon; and they thereby ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite,
inſtead of ſatisfying, the doubts, which naturally
ariſe from a diligent and ſcrutinous inquiry. They
paint, in the moſt magnificent colours, the order,
beauty, and wiſe arrangement of the univerſe; and
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:0050800103:205"/>
then aſk, if ſuch a glorious diſplay of intelligence
could proceed from the fortuitous concourſe of atoms,
or if chance could produce what the higheſt genius
can never ſufficiently admire. I ſhall not examine
the juſtneſs of this argument. I ſhall allow it to be
as ſolid as my antagoniſts and accuſers can deſire.
'Tis ſufficient, if I can prove, from this very reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that the queſtion is intirely ſpeculative, and that
when, in my philoſophical diſquiſitions, I deny a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
and a future ſtate, I undermine not the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations
of ſociety, but advance principles, which
they themſelves, upon their own topics, if they argue
conſiſtently, muſt allow to be ſolid and ſatisfactory.</p>
            <p>YOU then, who are my accuſers, have acknowleged,
that the chief or ſole argument for a divine exiſtence
(which I never queſtioned) is derived from the order
of nature; where there appear ſuch marks of intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
and deſign, that you think it extravagant to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
for its cauſe, either chance, or the blind and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guided
force of matter. You allow, that this is an
argument drawn from effects to cauſes. From the
order of the work you infer, that there muſt have
been project and forethought in the workman. If
you cannot make out this point, you allow, that your
concluſion fails; and you pretend not to eſtabliſh the
concluſion in a greater latitude than the phaenomena of
nature will juſtify. Theſe are your conceſſions. I
deſire you to mark the conſequences.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="209" facs="tcp:0050800103:206"/>
WHEN we infer any particular cauſe from an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
we muſt proportion the one to the other, and
can never be allowed to aſcribe to the cauſe any qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,
but what are exactly ſufficient to produce the
effect. A body of ten ounces raiſed in any ſcale may
ſerve as a proof, that the counterbalancing weight ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
ten ounces; but can never afford a reaſon that
it exceeds a hundred. If the cauſe, aſſigned for any
effect, be not ſufficient to produce it, we muſt either
reject that cauſe, or add to it ſuch qualities as will
give it a juſt proportion to the effect. But if we
aſcribe to it farther qualities, or affirm it capable of
producing other effects, we can only indulge the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
of conjecture, and arbitrarily ſuppoſe the exiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of qualities and energies, without reaſon or au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</p>
            <p>THE
ſame rule holds, whether the cauſe aſſigned be
brute unconſcious matter, or a rational intelligent
being. If the cauſe be known only by the effect, we
never ought to aſſign to it any qualities, beyond what
are preciſely requiſite to produce the effect: Nor can
we, by any rules of juſt reaſoning, return back from
the cauſe, and infer other effects from it, beyond thoſe
by which alone it is known to us. No one, merely
from the ſight of one of ZEUXIS's pictures, could
know, that he was alſo a ſtatuary or architect, and
was an artiſt no leſs ſkilful in ſtone and marble than in
colours. The talents and taſte diſplayed in the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:0050800103:207"/>
work before us; theſe we may ſafely conclude
the workman to be poſſeſſed of. The cauſe muſt be
proportioned to the effect: And if we exactly and
preciſely proportion it, we ſhall never find in it any
qualities that point farther, or afford an inference con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
any other deſign or performance. Such qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
muſt be ſomewhat beyond what is merely requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
to produce the effect which we examine.</p>
            <p>ALLOWING, therefore, the gods to be the authors of
the exiſtence or order of the univerſe; it follows, that
they poſſeſs that preciſe degree of power, intelligence,
and benevolence, which appears in their workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip;
but nothing farther can ever be proved, except
we call in the aſſiſtance of exaggeration and flattery to
ſupply the defects of argument and reaſoning. So far
as the traces of any attributes, at preſent, appear, ſo
far may we conclude theſe attributes to exiſt. The
ſuppoſition of farther attributes is mere hypotheſis;
much more, the ſuppoſition, that, in diſtant periods of
place and time, there has been, or will be, a more
magnificent diſplay of theſe attributes, and a ſcheme
of adminiſtration more ſuitable to ſuch imaginary vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues.
We can never be allowed to mount up from
the univerſe, the effect, to JUPITER, the cauſe; and
then deſcend downwards, to infer any new effect from
that cauſe; as if the preſent effects alone were not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
worthy of the glorious attributes which we aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe
to that deity. The knowlege of the cauſe being
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:0050800103:208"/>
derived ſolely from the effect, they muſt be exactly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſted
to each other, and the one can never refer to
any thing farther, or be the foundation of any new in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
and concluſion.</p>
            <p>YOU find certain phaenomena in nature. You ſeek
a cauſe or author. You imagine that you have found
him. You afterwards become ſo enamoured of this
offspring of your brain, that you imagine it impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
but he muſt produce ſomething greater and more
perfect than the preſent ſcene of things, which is ſo
full of ill and diſorder. You forget, that this ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative
intelligence and benevolence are intirely ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary,
or, at leaſt, without any foundation in reaſon;
and that you have no ground to aſcribe to him any
qualities, but what you ſee he has actually exerted
and diſplayed in his productions. Let your gods,
therefore, O philoſophers, be ſuited to the preſent
appearances of nature: And preſume not to alter
theſe appearances by arbitrary ſuppoſitions, in order
to ſuit them to the attributes, which you ſo fondly
aſcribe to your deities.</p>
            <p>WHEN prieſts and poets, ſupported by your autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
O ATHENIANS, talk of a golden or a ſilver age,
which preceded the preſent ſcene of vice and miſery,
I hear them with attention and with reverence. But
when philoſophers, who pretend to neglect authority,
and to cultivate reaſon, hold the ſame diſcourſe, I pay
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:0050800103:209"/>
them not, I own, the ſame obſequious ſubmiſſion and
pious deference. I aſk; Who carried them into the
celeſtial regions, who admitted them into the councils
of the gods, who opened to them the book of fate,
that they thus raſhly affirm that their deities have exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted,
or will execute, any purpoſe, beyond what has
actually appeared? If they tell me, that they have
mounted on the ſteps or by the gradual aſcent of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
and by drawing inferences from effects to cauſes,
I ſtill inſiſt, that they have aided the aſcent of reaſon
by the wings of imagination; otherwiſe they could
not thus change their manner of inference, and argue
from cauſes to effect; preſuming, that a more perfect
production than the preſent world would be more ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to ſuch perfect beings as the gods, and forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
that they have no reaſon to aſcribe to theſe celeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
beings any perfection or any attribute, but what
can be found in the preſent world.</p>
            <p>HENCE all the fruitleſs induſtry to account for the
ill appearances of nature, and ſave the honour of the
gods; while we muſt acknowlege the reality of that
evil and diſorder, with which the world ſo much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds.
The obſtinate and intractable qualities of
matter, we are told, or the obſervance of general laws;
or ſome ſuch reaſon, is the ſole cauſe, which controlled
the power and benevolence of JUPITER, and obliged
him to create mankind and every ſenſible creature ſo
imperfect and ſo unhappy. Theſe attributes, then,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:0050800103:210"/>
are, it ſeems, beforehand, taken for granted, in their
greateſt latitude. And upon that ſuppoſition, I own,
that ſuch conjectures may, perhaps, be admitted as
plauſible ſolutions of the ill phaenomena<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But ſtill I
aſk; Why take theſe attributes for granted, or why
aſcribe to the cauſe any qualities but what actually ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
in the effect? Why torture your brain to juſtify
the courſe of nature upon ſuppoſitions, which, for
aught you know, may be intirely imaginary, and of
which there are to be found no traces in the courſe of
nature?</p>
            <p>THE religious hypotheſis, therefore, muſt be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
only as a particular method of accounting for
the viſible phaenomena of the univerſe: But no juſt
reaſoner will ever preſume to infer from it any ſingle
fact, and alter or add to the phaenomena, in any ſingle
particular. If you think, that the appearances of
things prove ſuch cauſes, 'tis allowable for you to draw
an inference concerning the exiſtence of theſe cauſes.
In ſuch complicated and ſublime ſubjects, every one
ſhould be indulged in the liberty of conjecture and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument.
But here you ought to reſt. If you come
backward, and arguing from your inferred cauſes,
conclude, that any other fact has exiſted, or will exiſt,
diſplay of particular attributes; I muſt admoniſh you,
that you have departed from the method of reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
attached to the preſent ſubject, and muſt certainly
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:0050800103:211"/>
have added ſomething to the attributes of the cauſe,
beyond what appears in the effect; otherwiſe you
could never, with tolerable ſenſe or propriety, add
any thing to the effect, in order to render it more
worthy of the cauſe.</p>
            <p>WHERE, then, is the odiouſneſs of that doctrine,
which I teach in my ſchool, or rather, which I exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
in my gardens? Or what do you find in this
whole queſtion, wherein the ſecurity of good morals,
or the peace and order of ſociety is in the leaſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned?</p>
            <p>I
DENY a providence, you ſay, and ſupreme go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
of the world, who guides the courſe of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents,
and puniſhes the vicious with infamy and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment,
and rewards the virtuous with honour
and ſucceſs, in all their undertakings. But ſurely; I
deny not the courſe itſelf of events, which lies open
to every one's inquiry and examination. I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege,
that, in the preſent order of things, virtue is
attended with more peace of mind than vice; and
meets with a more favourable reception from the
world. I am ſenſible, that, according to the paſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
of mankind, friendſhip is the chief joy of
human life, and moderation the only ſource of tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity
and happineſs. I never balance between the
virtuous and the vicious courſe of life; but am ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,
that, to a well diſpoſed mind, every advantage
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:0050800103:212"/>
is on the ſide of the former. And what can you ſay
more, allowing all your ſuppoſitions and reaſonings?
You tell me, indeed, that this diſpoſition of things
proceeds from intelligence and deſign. But whatever
it proceeds from, the diſpoſition itſelf, on which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends
our happineſs or miſery, and conſequently our
conduct and deportment in life, is ſtill the ſame. 'Tis
ſtill open for me, as well as you, to regulate my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour,
by my experience of paſt events. And if
you affirm, that, while a divine providence is allowed,
and a ſupreme diſtributive juſtice in the univerſe, I
ought to expect ſome more particular reward of the
good, and puniſhment of the bad, beyond the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
courſe of events; I here find the ſame fallacy,
which I have before endeavoured to detect. You per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
in imagining, that, if we grant that divine exiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
for which you ſo earneſtly contend, you may
ſafely infer conſequences from it, and add ſomething
to the experienced order of nature, by arguing from
the attributes which you aſcribe to your gods. You
ſeem not to remember, that all your reaſonings on
this ſubject can only be drawn from effects to cauſes;
and that every argument, deduced from cauſes to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects,
muſt of neceſſity be a groſs ſophiſm; ſince it is
impoſſible for you to know any thing of the cauſe, but
what you have, antecedently, not inferred, but diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
to the full, in the effect.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="216" facs="tcp:0050800103:213"/>
BUT what muſt a philoſopher judge of thoſe vain
reaſoners, who, inſtead of regarding the preſent ſcene
of things as the ſole object of their contemplation, ſo
far reverſe the whole courſe of nature, as to render
this life merely a paſſage to ſomething farther; a
porch, which leads to a greater, and vaſtly different
building; a prologue, which ſerves only to introduce
the piece, and give it more grace and propriety?
Whence, do you think, can ſuch philoſophers derive
their idea of the gods? From their own conceit and
imagination ſurely. For if they derived it from the
preſent phaenomena, it would never point to any thing
farther, but muſt be exactly adjuſted to them. That
the divinity may <hi>poſſibly</hi> poſſeſs attributes, which we
have never ſeen exerted; may be governed by prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of action, which we cannot diſcover to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied:
All this will freely be allowed. But ſtill this
is mere <hi>poſſibility</hi> and hypotheſis. We never can have
reaſon to <hi>infer</hi> any attributes, or any principles of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in him, but ſo far as we know them to have been
exerted and ſatisfied.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Are there any marks of a diſtributive juſtice in the
world?</hi> If you anſwer in the affirmative, I conclude,
that, ſince juſtice here exerts itſelf, it is ſatisfied. If
you reply in the negative, I conclude, that you have
then no reaſon to aſcribe juſtice to the gods. If you
hold a medium between affirmation and negation, by
ſaying, that the juſtice of the gods, at preſent, exerts
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:0050800103:214"/>
itſelf in part, but not in its full extent; I anſwer, that
you have no reaſon to give it any particular extent,
but only ſo far as you ſee it, <hi>at preſent,</hi> exert itſelf.</p>
            <p>THUS I bring the diſpute, O ATHENIANS, to a
ſhort iſſue with my antagoniſts. The courſe of nature
lies open to my contemplation as well as theirs. The
experienced train of events is the great ſtandard by
which we all regulate our conduct. Nothing elſe can
be appealed to in the field, or in the ſenate. Nothing
elſe ought ever to be heard of in the ſchool, or in the
cloſet. In vain would our limited underſtandings
break thro' thoſe boundaries, which are too narrow
for our fond imaginations. While we argue from the
courſe of nature, and infer a particular intelligent
cauſe, which firſt beſtowed, and ſtill preſerves order in
the univerſe, we embrace a principle which is both
uncertain and uſeleſs. 'Tis uncertain; becauſe the
ſubject lies intirely beyond the reach of human expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience.
'Tis uſeleſs; becauſe our knowlege of this
cauſe being derived intirely from the courſe of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
we can never, according to the rules of juſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning,
return back from the cauſe with any new in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences,
or making additions to the common and
experienced courſe of nature, eſtabliſh any new princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of conduct and behaviour.</p>
            <p>I OBSERVE (ſays I, finding he had finiſhed his ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangue)
that you neglect not the artifice of the dema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:0050800103:215"/>
of old; and as you was pleaſed to make me
ſtand for the people, you inſinuate yourſelf into my
favour, by embracing thoſe principles, to which, you
know, I have always expreſſed a particular attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
But allowing you to make experience (as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
I think you ought) the only ſtandard of our judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
concerning this, and all other queſtions of fact;
I doubt not but, from the very ſame experience, to
which you appeal, it may be poſſible to refute this
reaſoning, which you have put into the mouth of
EPICURUS. If you ſaw, for inſtance, a half-finiſhed
building ſurrounded with heaps of brick and ſtone
and mortar, and all the inſtruments of maſonry;
could you not <hi>infer</hi> from the effect, that it was a work
of deſign and contrivance? And could you not return
again, from this inferred cauſe, to infer new additions
to the effect, and conclude, that the building would
ſoon be finiſhed, and receive all the farther improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
which art could beſtow upon it? If you ſaw
upon the ſea-ſhore the print of one human foot, you
would conclude, that a man had paſſed that way, and
that he had alſo left the traces of the other foot, tho'
effaced by the rolling of the ſands or inundation of the
waters. Why then do you refuſe to admit the ſame
method of reaſoning with regard to the order of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture?
Conſider the world and the preſent life only as
an imperfect building, from which you can infer a
ſuperior intelligence; and arguing from that ſuperior
intelligence, which can have nothing imperfect; why
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:0050800103:216"/>
may you not infer a more finiſhed ſcheme or plan,
which will receive its completion in ſome diſtant pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod
of ſpace or time? Are not theſe methods of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning
exactly parallel? And under what pretext can
you embrace the one, while you reject the other?</p>
            <p>THE infinite difference of the ſubjects, replied he,
is a ſufficient foundation for this difference in my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions.
In works of <hi>human</hi> art and contrivance, 'tis
allowable to advance from the effect to the cauſe, and
returning back from the cauſe, form new inferences
concerning the effect, and examine the alterations
which it has probably undergone, or may ſtill under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go.
But what is the foundation of this method of
reaſoning? Plainly this; that man is a being, whom
we know by experience, whoſe motives and deſigns
we are acquainted with, and whoſe projects and incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
have a certain connexion and coherence, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the laws which nature has eſtabliſhed for
the government of ſuch a creature. When, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
we find, that any work has proceeded from the
ſkill and induſtry of man; as we are otherwiſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with the nature of the animal, we can draw a
hundred inferences concerning what may be expected
from him; and theſe inferences will all be founded on
experience and obſervation. But did we know man
only from the ſingle work or production which we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine,
it were impoſſible for us to argue in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner;
becauſe our knowlege of all the qualities, which
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:0050800103:217"/>
we aſcribe to him, being in that caſe derived from the
production, 'tis impoſſible they could point to any
thing farther, or be the foundation of any new infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences.
The print of a foot in the ſand can only
prove, when conſidered alone, that there was ſome
figure adapted to it, by which it was produced: But
the print of a human foot proves likewiſe, from our
other experience, that there was probably another
foot, which alſo left its impreſſion, tho' effaced by
time or other accide<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>s. Here we mount from the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
to the cauſe, and deſcending again from the
cauſe, infer alterations in the effect; but this is not a
continuation of the ſame ſimple chain of reaſoning.
We comprehend in this caſe a hundred other expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riences
and obſervations, concerning the <hi>uſual</hi> figure
and members of that ſpecies of animal, without which
this method of argument muſt be conſidered as falla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
and ſophiſtical.</p>
            <p>THE caſe is not the ſame with our reaſonings from
the works of nature. The Deity is known to us only
by his productions, and is a ſingle being in the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe,
not comprehended under any ſpecies or genus,
from whoſe experienced attributes or qualities, we can,
by analogy, infer any attribute or quality in him. As
the univerſe ſhews wiſdom and goodneſs, we infer
wiſdom and goodneſs. As it ſhows a particular degree
of theſe perfections, we infer a particular degree of
them, preciſely adapted to the effect which we exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine.
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:0050800103:218"/>
But farther attributes or farther degrees of the
ſame attributes, we can never be authoriſed to infer or
ſuppoſe, by any rules of juſt reaſoning. Now without
ſome ſuch licence of ſuppoſition, 'tis impoſſible for
us to argue from the cauſe, or infer any alteration in
the effect, beyond what has immediately fallen under
our obſervation. Greater good produced by this Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
muſt ſtill prove a greater degree of goodneſs:
More impartial diſtribution of rewards and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
muſt proceed from a ſuperior regard to juſtice
and equity. Every ſuppoſed addition to the works of
nature makes an addition to the attributes of the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of nature; and conſequently, being intirely un
ſupported by any reaſon or argument, can never be
admitted but as mere conjecture and hypotheſis<note n="*" place="bottom">In general, it may, I think, be eſtabliſhed as a maxim, that where any cauſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

                  </gap>, it muſt be impoſſible to infer any <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

We can never, therefore, have any reaſon to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the exiſtence of theſe qualities. To ſay that the new effects proceed only from a continuation of the ſame energy, which is already known from the firſt effects, will not remove the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty. For even granting this to be the caſe, (which can ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom be ſuppoſed) the very continuation and exertion of a like energy (for 'tis impoſſible it can be abſolutely the ſame) I ſay, this exertion of a like energy in a different period of ſpace and time is a very arbitrary ſuppoſition, and what there cannot poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly be any traces of in the effects, from which all our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of the cauſe is originally derived. Let the <hi>inferred</hi> cauſe be exactly proportioned (as it ſhould be) to the known effect; and 'tis impoſſible that it can poſſeſs any qualities, from which new or different effects can be <hi>inferred.</hi>
               </note>.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="222" facs="tcp:0050800103:219"/>
THE great ſource of our miſtake in this ſubject, and
of the unbounded licence of conjecture, which we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge,
is, that we tacitly conſider ourſelves, as in the
place of the Supreme Being, and conclude, that he
will, on every occaſion, obſerve the ſame conduct,
which we ourſelves, in his ſituation, would have em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced
as reaſonable and eligible. But beſides, that
the ordinary courſe of nature may convince us, that
almoſt every thing is regulated by principles and max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims
very different from ours; beſides this, I ſay, it
muſt evidently appear contrary to all rule of analogy
to reaſon, from the intentions and projects of men, to
thoſe of a being ſo different, and ſo much ſuperior.
In human nature, there is a certain experienced cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of deſigns and inclinations; ſo that when, from
any facts, we have diſcovered one intention of any man,
it may often be reaſonable, from experience, to infer
another, and draw a long chain of concluſions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
his paſt or future conduct. But this method
of reaſoning never can have place with regard to a
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:0050800103:220"/>
Being, ſo remote and incomprehenſible, who bears
much leſs analogy to any other being in the univerſe
than the ſun to a waxen taper, and who diſcovers him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
only by ſome faint traces or outlines, beyond
which we have no authority to aſcribe to him any at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
or perfection. What we imagine to be a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior
perfection may really be a defect. Or were it
ever ſo much a perfection, the aſcribing it to the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
Being, where it appears not to have been real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
exerted, to the full, in his works, favours more of
flattery and panegyric, than of juſt reaſoning and ſound
philoſophy. All the philoſophy, therefore, in the
world, and all the religion, which is nothing but a
ſpecies of philoſophy, will never be able to carry us
beyond the uſual courſe of experience, or give us mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
of conduct and behaviour different from thoſe
which are furniſhed by reflections on common life.
No new fact can ever be inferred from the religious
hypotheſis; no event foreſeen or foretold; no reward
or puniſhment expected or dreaded, beyond what is
already known by practice and obſervation. So that
my apology for EPICURUS will ſtill appear ſolid and
ſatisfactory; nor have the political intereſt of ſociety
any connexion with the philoſophical diſputes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
metaphyſics and religion.</p>
            <p>THERE is ſtill one circumſtance, replied I, which
you ſeem to have overlooked. I ho' I ſhould allow
your premiſes, I muſt ſtill deny your concluſion. You
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:0050800103:221"/>
conclude, that religious doctrines and reaſonings <hi>can</hi>
have no influence on life, becauſe they <hi>ought</hi> to have
no influence; never conſidering, that men reaſon not
in the ſame manner you do, but draw many conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
from the belief of a divine exiſtence, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
that the Deity will inflict puniſhments on vice,
and beſtow rewards on virtue, beyond what appear in
the ordinary courſe of nature. Whether this reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of their be juſt or not, is no matter. Its influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
on their life and conduct muſt ſtill be the ſame.
And thoſe, who attempt to diſabuſe them of ſuch pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices,
may, for aught I know, be good reaſoners,
but I cannot allow them to be good citizens and poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticians;
ſince they free men from one reſtraint upon
their paſſions, and make the infringement of the laws
of ſociety, in one reſpect, more eaſy and ſecure.</p>
            <p>AFTER all, I may, perhaps, agree to your general
concluſion in favour of liberty, tho' upon different pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
from thoſe, on which you endeavour to found it.
I think that the ſtate ought to tolerate every principle
of philoſophy; nor is there an inſtance that any go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
has ſuffered in its political intereſts by ſuch
indulgence. There is no enthuſiaſm among philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers;
their doctrines are not very alluring to the
people; and no reſtraint can be put upon their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings,
but what muſt be of dangerous conſquence
to the ſciences, and even to the ſtate, by paving the
way for perſecution and oppreſſion in points where the
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:0050800103:222"/>
generality of mankind are more deeply intereſted and
concerned.</p>
            <p>BUT there occurs to me (continued I) with regard
to your main topic, a difficulty, which I ſhall juſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
to you, without inſiſting on it; left it lead into
reaſonings of too nice and delicate a nature. In a
word, I much doubt whether it be poſſible for a cauſe
to be known only by its effect (as you have all along
ſuppoſed) or to be of ſo ſingular and particular a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
as to have no parallel and no ſimilarity with any
other cauſe or object, that has ever fallen under out
obſervation. 'Tis only when two <hi>ſpecies</hi> of objects
are found to be conſtantly conjoined, that we can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
the one from the other; and were an effect pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented,
which was intirely ſingular, and could not be
comprehended under any known <hi>ſpecies,</hi> I do not ſee,
that we could form any conjecture or inference at all
concerning its cauſe. If experience and obſervation
and analogy be, indeed, the only guides which we can
reaſonably follow in inferences of this nature; both
the effect and cauſe muſt bear a ſimilarity and reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
to other effects and cauſes which we know,
and which we have found, in many inſtances, to be
conjoined with each other. I leave it to your own
reflections to purſue the conſequences of this principle.
I ſhall juſt obſerve, that as the antagoniſts of EPI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CURUS
always ſuppoſe the univerſe an effect quite ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
and unparalleled; to be the proof of a Deity, a
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:0050800103:223"/>
cauſe no leſs ſingular and unparalleled; your reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
upon that ſuppoſition, ſeem, at leaſt, to merit
our attention. There is, I own, ſome difficulty, how
we can ever return from the cauſe to the effect, and
reaſoning from our ideas of the former, infer any al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration
on the latter, or any addition to it.</p>

thoſe, which prove the exiſtence of a Deity, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute
the fallacies of <hi>Atheiſts;</hi> and yet the moſt reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
philoſophers ſtill diſpute whether any man can
be ſo blinded as to be a ſpeculative atheiſt. How
ſhall we reconcile theſe contradictions? The knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>errants,
who wandered about to clear the world of
dragons and giants, never entertained the leaſt doubt
with regard to the exiſtence of theſe monſters.</p>
               <p>THE <hi>Sceptic</hi> is another enemy of religion, who na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
provokes the indignation of all divines and
graver philoſophers; tho' 'tis certain, that no man
ever met with any ſuch abſurd creature, or converſed
with a man, who had no opinion or principle con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:0050800103:225"/>
any ſubject, either of action or ſpeculation.
This begets a very natural queſtion; What is meant
by a ſceptic? And how far it is poſſible to puſh theſe
philoſophical principles of doubt and uncertainty?</p>
               <p>THERE is a ſpecies of ſcepticiſm, <hi>antecedent</hi> to all
ſtudy and philoſophy, which is much inculcated by
DES CARTES and others, as a ſovereign preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
againſt error and precipitate judgment. It recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends
an univerſal doubt, not only of all our former
opinions and principles, but alſo of our very faculties;
of whoſe veracity, ſay they, we muſt aſſure ourſelves,
by a chain of reaſoning, deduced from ſome original
principle, which cannot poſſibly be fallacious or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful.
But neither is there any ſuch original prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,
which has a prerogative above others, that are
ſelf-evident and convincing: Or if there were, could
we advance a ſtep beyond it, but by the uſe of theſe
very faculties, of which we are ſuppoſed to be already
diffident. The CARTESIAN doubt, therefore, were
it ever poſſible to be attained by any human creature
(as it plainly is not) would be entirely incurable;
and no reaſoning could ever bring us to a ſtate of
aſſurance and conviction upon any ſubject.</p>
               <p>IT muſt, however, be confeſſed, that this ſpecies of
ſcepticiſm, when more moderate, may be underſtood
in a very reaſonable ſenſe, and is a neceſſary prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
to the ſtudy of philoſophy, by preſerving a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:0050800103:226"/>
impartiality in our judgments, and weaning our
mind from all thoſe prejudices, which we may have
imbibed from education or raſh opinion. To begin
with clear and ſelf-evident principles, to advance by
timorous and ſure ſteps, to review frequently our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions,
and examine accurately all their conſequences;
tho' by this means we ſhall make both a ſlow and a
ſhort progreſs in our ſyſtems; are the only methods,
by which we can ever hope to reach truth, and attain
a proper ſtability and certainty in our determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>THERE
is another ſpecies of ſcepticiſm, <hi>conſequent</hi>
to ſcience and enquiry, where men are ſuppoſed to
have diſcovered, either the abſolute fallaciouſneſs of
their mental faculties, or their unfitneſs to reach any
fixed determination in all thoſe curious ſubjects of
ſpeculation, about which they are commonly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed.
Even our very ſenſes are brought into diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute,
by a certain ſpecies of philoſophers; and the
maxims of common life are ſubjected to the ſame
doubt as the moſt profound principles or concluſions
of metaphyſics and theology. As theſe paradoxical
tenets (if they may be called tenets) are to be met
with in ſome philoſophers, and the refutation of them
in ſeveral, they naturally excite our curioſity, and
make us enquire into the arguments, on which they
may be founded.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="230" facs="tcp:0050800103:227"/>
I NEED not inſiſt upon the more trite topics, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
by the ſceptics in all ages, againſt the evidence
of <hi>ſenſe;</hi> ſuch as thoſe derived from the imperfection
and fallaciouſneſs of our organs, on numberleſs occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions;
the crooked appearance of an oar in water;
the various aſpects of objects, according to their dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
diſtances; the double images which ariſe from
the preſſing one eye; with many other appearances
of a like nature. Theſe ſceptical topics, indeed, are
only ſufficient to prove, that the ſenſes alone are not
implicitely to be depended on; but that we muſt
correct their evidence by reaſon, and by conſiderations,
derived from the nature of the medium, the diſtance
of the object, and the diſpoſition of the organ, in
order to render them, within their ſphere, the proper
<hi>criteria</hi> of truth and falſhood. There are other more
profound arguments againſt the ſenſes, which admit
not of ſo eaſy a ſolution.</p>
               <p>IT ſeems evident, that men are carried, by a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
inſtinct or prepoſſeſſion, to repoſe faith in their
ſenſes; and that, without any reaſoning, or even al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
before the uſe of reaſon, we always ſuppoſe an
external univerſe, which depends not on our percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but would exiſt, tho' we and every ſenſible crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
were abſent or annihilated. Even the animal
creation are governed by a like opinion, and preſerve
this belief of external objects, in all their thoughts,
deſigns, and actions.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="231" facs="tcp:0050800103:228"/>
IT ſeems alſo evident, that when men follow this
blind and powerful inſtinct of nature, they always
ſuppoſe the very images, preſented by the ſenſes, to
be the external objects, and never entertain any ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion,
that the one are nothing but repreſentations
of the other. This very table, which we ſee white,
and which we feel hard, is believed to exiſt, indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
of our perception, and to be ſomething external
to our mind, which perceives it. Our preſence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtows
not being on it: Our abſence annihilates it not.
It preſerves its exiſtence uniform and entire, indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
of the ſituation of intelligent beings, who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
or contemplate it.</p>
               <p>BUT this univerſal and primary opinion of all men
is ſoon deſtroyed by the ſlighteſt philoſophy, which
teaches us, that nothing can ever be preſent to the
mind but an image or perception, and that the ſenſes
are only the inlets, thro' which theſe images are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
without being ever able to produce any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
intercourſe between the mind and the object.
The table, which we ſee, ſeems to diminiſh, as we
remove farther from it: But the real table which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts
independent of us, ſuffers no alteration: It was,
therefore, nothing but its image, which was preſent
to the mind. Theſe are the obvious dictates of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;
and no man, who reflects, ever doubted, that
the exiſtences, which we conſider, when we ſay, <hi>this
houſe</hi> and <hi>that tree</hi> are nothing but perceptions in the
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:0050800103:229"/>
mind, and fleeting copies or repreſentations of other
exiſtences, which remain uniform and independent.</p>
               <p>So far, then, are we neceſſitated by reaſoning to
contradict or depart from the primary inſtincts of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and to embrace a new ſyſtem with regard to the
evidences of our ſenſes. But here philoſophy finds
itſelf extremely embarraſſed, when it would juſtify
this new ſyſtem, and obviate the cavils and objections
of the ſceptics. It can no longer plead the infallible
and irreſiſtible inſtinct of nature: For that led us to
a quite different ſyſtem, which is acknowledged fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
and even erroneous. And to juſtify this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
philoſophical ſyſtem, by a chain of clear and
convincing argument, or even any appearance of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
exceeds the power of all human capacity.</p>
               <p>BY what argument can it be proved, that the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions
of the mind muſt be cauſed by external ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
entirely different from them, tho' reſembling
them (if that be poſſible) and could not ariſe either
from the energy of the mind itſelf, or from the ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion
of ſome inviſible and unknown ſpirit, or from
ſome other cauſe ſtill more unknown to us? 'Tis ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged,
that, in fact, many of theſe perceptions
ariſe not from any thing external, as in dreams,
madneſs, and other diſeaſes. And nothing can be
more inexplicable than the manner, in which body
ſhould ſo operate upon mind as ever to convey an
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:0050800103:230"/>
image of itſelf to a ſubſtance ſuppoſed of ſo different,
and even contrary a nature.</p>
               <p>'TIS a queſtion of fact, whether the perceptions
of the ſenſes be produced by external objects, reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
them: How ſhall this queſtion be determined?
By experience ſurely; as all other queſtions of a like
nature. But here experience is, and muſt be entirely
ſilent. The mind has never any thing preſent to it
but the perceptions, and cannot poſſibly reach any
experience of their connexion with objects. The ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
of ſuch a connexion is, therefore, without
any foundation in reaſoning.</p>
               <p>To have recourſe to the veracity of the ſupreme
Being, in order to prove the veracity of our ſenſes,
is ſurely making a very unexpected circuit. If his
veracity were at all concerned in this matter, our
ſenſes would be entirely infallible; becauſe it is not
poſſible that he can ever deceive. Not to mention,
that if the external world be once called in doubt,
we ſhall be at a loſs to find arguments, by which we
may prove the exiſtence of that Being or any of his
attributes.</p>
               <p>THIS is a topic, therefore, in which the profounder
and more philoſophical ſceptics will always triumph,
when they endeavour to introduce an univerſal doubt
into all ſubjects of human knowlege and enquiry.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="234" facs="tcp:0050800103:231"/>
Do you follow the inſtincts and propenſities of nature,
may they ſay, in aſſenting to the veracity of ſenſe?
But theſe lead you to believe, that the very perception
or ſenſible image is the external object. Do you diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
this principle, in order to embrace a more ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
opinion, that the perceptions are only repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
of ſomething external? You here depart from
your natural propenſities and more obvious ſentiments;
and yet are not able to ſatisfy your reaſon, which can
never find any convincing argument from experience
to prove, that the perceptions are connected with any
external objects.</p>
               <p>THERE is another ſceptical topic of a like nature,
derived from the moſt profound philoſophy; which
might merit our attention, were it requiſite to dive ſo
deep, in order to diſcover arguments and reaſonings,
which can ſerve ſo little any ſerious purpoſe. 'Tis
univerſally allowed by modern enquiers, that all the
ſenſible qualities of objects, ſuch as hard, ſoft, hot,
cold, white, black, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are merely ſecondary, and
exiſt not in the objects themſelves, but are perceptions
of the mind, without any external archetype or model,
which they repreſent. If this be allowed, with regard
to ſecondary qualities, it muſt alſo follow with regard to
the ſuppoſed primary qualities of extenſion and ſolidity;
nor can the latter be any more entitled to that deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
than the former. The idea of extenſion is
entirely acquired from the ſenſes of ſight and feeling;
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:0050800103:232"/>
and if all the qualities, perceived by the ſenſes, be in
the mind, not in the object, the ſame concluſion
muſt reach the idea of extenſion, which is wholly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent
on the ſenſible ideas or the ideas of ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary
qualities. Nothing can ſave us from this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion,
but the aſſerting, that the ideas of thoſe pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary
qualities are attained by <hi>Abſtraction;</hi> which, if
we examine accurately, we ſhall find to be unintel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible,
and even abſurd. An extenſion, that is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
tangible nor viſible, cannot poſſibly be conceived:
And a tangible or viſible extenſion, which is neither
hard nor ſoft, black nor white, is equally beyond the
reach of human conception. Let any man try to
conceive a triangle in general, which is neither <hi>Iſoceles,</hi>
nor <hi>Scalenum,</hi> nor has any particular length nor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
of ſides; and he will ſoon perceive the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity
of all the ſcholaſtic notions with regard to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraction
and general ideas<note n="*" place="bottom">This argument is drawn from Dr. BERKLEY; and ideed moſt of the writings of that very ingenious author form the beſt leſſons of ſcepticiſm, which are to be found either among the antient or modern philoſophers, BAYLE not excepted. He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes, however, in his title-page (and undoubtedly with great truth) to have compoſed his book againſt the ſceptics as well as againſt the atheiſts and free-thinkers. But that all his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, tho' otherwiſe intended, are, in reality, merely ſcepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, appears from this, <hi>that they admit of no anſwer and produce no conviction.</hi> Their only effect is to cauſe that momentary amazement and irreſolution and confuſion, which is the reſult of ſcepticiſm.</note>.</p>

THUS the firſt philoſophical objection to the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of ſenſe or to the opinion of external exiſtence
conſiſts in this, that ſuch an opinion, if reſted on na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
inſtinct, is contrary to reaſon, and if referred to
reaſon, is contrary to natural inſtinct, and at the ſame
time carries no rational evidence with it, to convince
an impartial enquirer. The ſecond objection goes
farther, and repreſents this opinion as contrary to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;
at leaſt, if it be a principle of reaſon, that all
ſenſible qualities are in the mind, not in the object.</p>

               <p>IT may ſeem a very extravagant attempt of the

yet is this the grand ſcope of all their enquiries
and diſputes. They endeavour to find objections,
both to our abſtract reaſonings, and to thoſe which
regard matter of fact and exiſtence.</p>
               <p>THE chief objection againſt all <hi>abſtract</hi> reaſonings
is derived from the ideas of ſpace and time; ideas,
which, in common life and to a careleſs view, are
very clear and intelligible, but when they paſs thro'
the ſcrutiny of the profound ſciences (and they are
the chief object of theſe ſciences) afford principles
which ſeem full of abſurdity and contradiction. No

<pb n="237" facs="tcp:0050800103:234"/>
ſubdue the rebellious reaſon of mankind, ever ſhocked
common ſenſe more than the doctrine of the infinite
diviſibility of extenſion, with its conſequences; as
they are pompouſly diſplayed by all geometricians
and metaphyſicians, with a kind of triumph and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ultation.
A real quantity, infinitely leſs than any
finite quantity, containing quantities, infinitely leſs
than itſelf, and ſo on, <hi>in infinitum;</hi> this is an edifice
ſo bold and prodigious, that it is too weighty for any
pretended demonſtration to ſupport, becauſe it ſhocks
the cleareſt and moſt natural principles of human rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon<note n="*" place="bottom">Whatever diſputes there may be about mathematical points, we muſt allow that there are phyſical points; that is, parts of extenſion, which cannot be divided or leſſened, either by the eye or imagination. Theſe images, then, which are preſent to the fancy or ſenſes, are abſolutely inviſible, and conſequently muſt be allowed by mathematicians to be infinitely leſs than any real part of extenſion; and yet nothing appears more certain to reaſon, than that an infinite number of them compoſes an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite extenſion. How much more an infinite number of thoſe infinitely ſmall parts of extenſion, which are ſtill ſuppoſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely diviſible.</note>. But what renders the matter more extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary,
is, that theſe ſeemingly abſurd opinions are
ſupported by a chain of reaſoning, the cleareſt and
moſt natural; nor is it poſſible for us to allow the
premiſes without admitting the conſequences. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:0050800103:235"/>
can be more convincing and ſatisfactory than all
the concluſions concerning the properties of circles
and triangles; and yet, when theſe are once received,
how can we deny, that the angle of contact between
a circle and its tangent is infinitely leſs than any rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilineal
angle, that as you may encreaſe the diameter
of the circle <hi>in infinitum,</hi> this angle of contact be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
ſtill leſs, even <hi>in infinitum,</hi> and that the angle
of contact between other curves and their tangents
may be infinitely leſs than thoſe between any circle
and its tangent, and ſo on, <hi>in infinitum?</hi> The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration
of theſe principles ſeems as unexception<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
as that which proves the three angles of a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angle
to be equal to two right ones; tho' the latter
opinion be natural and eaſy, and the former big with
contradiction and abſurdity. Reaſon here ſeems to be
thrown into a kind of amazement and ſuſpence,
which, without the ſuggeſtions of any ſceptic, gives
her a diffidence of herſelf, and of the ground on
which he treads. She ſees a full light, which illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minates
certain places; but that light borders upon
the moſt profound darkneſs. And between theſe ſhe
is ſo dazzled and confounded, that ſhe ſcarce can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
with certainty and aſſurance concerning any
one object.</p>
               <p>THE abſurdity of theſe bold determinations of the
abſtract ſciences ſeems to become, if poſſible, ſtill
more palpable with regard to time than extenſion.
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:0050800103:236"/>
An infinite number of real parts of time, paſſing in
ſucceſſion, and exhauſted one after another, appears
ſo evident a contradiction, that no man, one ſhould
think, whoſe judgment is not corrupted, inſtead of
being improved, by the ſciences, would ever be able
to admit of it.</p>
               <p>YET ſtill reaſon muſt remain reſtleſs and unquiet,
even with regard to that ſcepticiſm, to which ſhe is
led by theſe ſeeming abſurdities and contradictions.
How any clear, diſtinct idea can contain circumſtances,
contradictory to itſelf, or to any other clear, diſtinct
idea, is abſolutely incomprehenſible; and is, perhaps,
as abſurd as any propoſition, which can be formed. So
that nothing can be more ſceptical, or more full
of doubt and heſitation, than this ſcepticiſm itſelf,
which ariſes from ſome of the paradoxical concluſions
of geometry or the ſcience of quantity<note n="*" place="bottom">It ſeems to me not impoſſible to avoid theſe abſurdities and contradictions, if it be admitted, that there is no ſuch thing as abſtract or general ideas, properly ſpeaking; but that all ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral ideas are, in reality, particular ones, attached to a general term, which recalls, upon occaſion, other particular ones, that reſemble, in certain circumſtances, the idea, preſent to the mind: Thus when the term Horſe, is pronounced, we immediately figure to ourſelves the idea of a black or a white animal, of a particular ſize or figure: But as that term is alſo uſed to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to animals of other colours, figures and ſizes, theſe ideas, tho' not actually preſent to the imagination, are eaſily recalled, and our reaſoning and concluſion proceed in the ſame way, as if they were actually preſent. If this be admitted (as ſeems rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable) it follows that all the ideas of quantity, upon which mathematicians reaſon, are nothing but particular, and ſuch as are ſuggeſted by the ſenſes and imagination, and conſequently, cannot be infinitely diviſible. 'Tis ſufficient to have dropt this hint at preſent, without proſecuting it any farther. It certainly concerns all lovers of ſcience not to expoſe themſelves to the ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cule and contempt of the ignorant by their concluſions; and this ſeems the readieſt ſolution of theſe difficulties.</note>.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="240" facs="tcp:0050800103:237"/>
THE ſceptical objections to <hi>moral</hi> evidence, or to
the reaſonings concerning matter of fact are either
<hi>popular</hi> or <hi>philoſophical.</hi> The popular objections are
derived from the natural weakneſs of human under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding;
the contradictory opinions, which have been
entertained in different ages and nations; the variations
of our judgment in ſickneſs and health, youth and
old age, proſperity and adverſity; the perpetual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction
of each particular man's opinions and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents;
with many other topics of that kind. 'Tis
needleſs to inſiſt farther on this head. Theſe objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
are but weak. For as, in common life, we rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
every moment concerning fact and exiſtence, and
cannot poſſibly ſubſiſt, without continually employing
this ſpecies of argument, any popular objections, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:0050800103:238"/>
from thence, muſt be inſufficient to deſtroy that
evidence. The great ſubverter of <hi>Pyrrhoniſm</hi> or the
exceſſive principles of ſcepticiſm, is action, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment,
and the occupations of common life. Theſe
principles may flouriſh and triumph in the ſchools;
where it is, indeed, difficult, if not impoſſible, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute
them. But as ſoon as they leave the ſhade, and
by the preſence of the real objects, which actuate our
paſſions and ſentiments, are put in oppoſition to the
more powerful principles of our nature, they vaniſh
like ſmoak, and leave the moſt determined ſceptic in
the ſame condition as other mortals.</p>
               <p>THE ſceptic, therefore, had better keep in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
ſphere, and diſplay thoſe <hi>philoſophical</hi> objections,
which ariſe from more profound reſearches. Here
he ſeems to have ample matter of triumph; while
he juſtly inſiſts, that all our evidence for any matter
of fact, which lies beyond the teſtimony of ſenſe or
memory, is derived entirely from the relation of cauſe
and effect; that we have no other idea of this relation
than that of two objects, which have been frequently
<hi>cojoined</hi> together; that we have no arguments to
convince us, that object, which have, in our expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience,
been frequently conjoined, will likewiſe, in
other inſtances, be conjoined in the ſame manner;
and that nothing leads us to this inſerence but cuſtom
or a certain inſtinct of our nature; which it is indeed
difficult to reſiſt, but which, like other inſtincts, may
be fallacious and deceitful. While the ſceptic inſiſts
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:0050800103:239"/>
upon theſe topics, he ſhews his force, or rather, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
his own and our weakneſs; and ſeems, for the
time at leaſt, to deſtroy all aſſurance and conviction.
Theſe arguments might be diſplayed at greater length,
if any durable good or benefit to ſociety could ever be
expected to reſult from them.</p>
               <p>FOR here is the chief and moſt confounding objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to <hi>exceſſive</hi> ſcepticiſm, that no durable good can
ever reſult from it; while it remains in its full force
and vigour. We need only aſk ſuch a ſceptic,
<hi>What his meaning is? And what he propoſes by all
theſe curious reſearches?</hi> He is immediately at a loſs,
and knows not what to anſwer. A COPERNICAN or
PTOLEMAIC, who ſupports each his different ſyſtem
of aſtronomy, may hope to produce a conviction,
which will remain, conſtant and durable, with his
audience. A STOIC or EPICUREAN diſplays prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
which may not only be durable, but which
have a mighty effect on conduct and behaviour. But
a PYRRHONIAN cannot propoſe that his philoſophy
will have any conſtant influence on the mind: Or if
it had, that its influence would be beneficial to ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety.
On the contrary, he muſt acknowlege, if he
will acknowlege any thing, that all human life muſt
periſh, were his principles univerſally and ſteadily to
prevail. All diſcourſe, all action would immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ceaſe; and men remain in a total lethargy, till
the neceſſities of nature, unſatisfied, put an end to
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:0050800103:240"/>
their miſerable exiſtence. 'Tis true; ſo fatal an event
is very little to be dreaded. Nature is always too
ſtrong for principle. And tho' a PYRRHONIAN may
throw himſelf or others into a momentary amazement
and confuſion by his profound reaſonings; the firſt
and moſt trivial event in life will put to flight all his
doubts and ſcruples, and leave him the ſame, in every
point of action and ſpeculation, with the philoſophers
of every other ſect, or with thoſe who never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
themſelves in any philoſophical reſearches.
When he awakes from his dream, he will be the firſt
to join in the laugh againſt himſelf, and to confeſs,
that all his objections are mere amuſements, and can
have no other tendency than to ſhow the whimſical

               <head>PART III.</head>
               <p>THERE is, indeed, a more <hi>mitigated</hi> ſcepticiſm or
<hi>academical</hi> philoſophy, which may be both durable
and uſeful, and which may, in part, be the reſult of
this PYRRHONISM, or <hi>exceſſive</hi> ſcepticiſm, when its
undiſtinguiſhed doubts are, in ſome meaſure, corrected
by common ſenſe and reflexion. The greateſt part of
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:0050800103:241"/>
mankind are naturally apt to be affirmative and dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical
in their opinions; and while they ſee objects
only on one ſide, and have no idea of any counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poiſing
arguments, they throw themſelves precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tately
into the principles, to which they are inclin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
nor have they any indulgence for thoſe who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
oppoſite ſentiments. To heſitate or balance
perplexes their underſtandings, checks their paſſion,
and ſuſpends their actions. They are, therefore, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient
till they eſcape from a ſtate, which to them is
ſo uneaſy; and they think, that they can never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
themſelves far enough from it, by the violence
of their affirmations and obſtinacy of their belief.
But could ſuch dogmatical reaſoners become ſenſible
of the ſtrange infirmities of human underſtanding,
even in its moſt perfect ſtate, and when moſt accurate
and cautious in its determinations; ſuch a reflection
would naturally inſpire them with more modeſty and
reſerve, and diminiſh their fond opinion of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and their prejudice againſt antagoniſts. The
illiterate may reflect on the diſpoſition of the learned,
who, amidſt all the advantages of ſtudy and reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
are commonly ſtill diffident in their determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:
And if any of the learned are inclined, from
their natural temper, to haughtineſs and obſtinacy, a
ſmall tincture of PYRRHONISM may abate their pride,
by ſhowing them, that the few advantages, which they
may have attained over their fellows, are but incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable,
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:0050800103:242"/>
if compared with the univerſal perplexity
and confuſion, which is inherent in human nature.
In general, there is a degree of doubt, and caution,
and modeſty, which, in all kinds of ſcrutiny and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion,
ought for ever to accompany a juſt reaſoner.</p>
               <p>ANOTHER ſpecies of <hi>mitigated</hi> ſcepticiſm, which
may be of advantage to mankind, and which may be
the natural reſult of the PYRRHONIAN doubts and
ſcruples, is the limitation of our enquiries to ſuch
ſubjects as are beſt adapted to the narrow capacity of
human underſtanding. The <hi>imagination</hi> of man is
naturally ſublime, delighted with whatever is remote
and extraordinary, and running, without controul,
into the moſt diſtant parts of ſpace and time, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to avoid the objects, which cuſtom has rendered
too familiar to it. A correct <hi>judgment</hi> obſerves a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
method; and avoiding all diſtant and high en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries,
confines itſelf to common life, and to ſuch
ſubjects as fall under daily practice and experience;
leaving the more ſublime topics to the embelliſhment
of poets and orators, or to the arts of prieſts and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticians.
To bring us to ſo ſalutary a determination,
nothing can be more ſerviceable, than to be once
thoroughly convinced of the force of the PYRRHONIAN
doubt, and of the impoſſibility that any thing but the
ſtrong power of natural inſtinct, could free us from
it. Thoſe who have a propenſity to philoſophy, will
ſtill continue their reſearches; becauſe they reflect,
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:0050800103:243"/>
that beſides the immediate pleaſure, attending ſuch
an occupation, philoſophical deciſions are nothing but
the reflections of common life, methodized and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected.
But they will never be tempted to go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
common life, ſo long as they conſider the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection
of thoſe faculties which they employ, their
narrow reach, and their inaccurate operations. While
we cannot give a ſatisfactory reaſon, why we believe
after a thouſand experiments, that a ſtone will fall, or
fire burn; can we ever ſatisfy ourſelves concerning
any determinations which we may form with regard
to the origin of worlds, and the ſituation of nature,
from, and to enternity?</p>
               <p>THIS narrow limitation, indeed, of our enquiries,
is, in every reſpect, ſo reaſonable, that it ſuffices to
make the ſlighteſt examination into the natural powers
of the human mind, and to compare them to their
objects, in order to recommend it to us. We ſhall
then find what are the proper ſubjects of ſcience and
enquiry.</p>
               <p>IT ſeems to me, that the only objects of the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract
ſciences or of demonſtration are quantity and
number, and that all attempts to extend this more
perfect ſpecies of knowlege beyond theſe bounds are
mere ſophiſtry and illuſion. As the component parts
of quantity and number are entirely ſimilar, their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
become intricate and involved; and nothing
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:0050800103:244"/>
can be more curious, as well as uſeful, than to trace,
by a variety of mediums, their equality or inequality,
thro' their different appearances. But as all other
ideas are clearly diſtinct and different from each other,
we can never advance farther, by all our ſcrutiny, than
to obſerve this diverſity, and, by an obvious reflection,
pronounce one thing not to be another. Or if there
be any difficulty in theſe deciſions, it proceeds entirely
from the undeterminate meaning of words, which is
corrected by juſter definitions. That <hi>the ſquare of the
hypothenuſe is equal to the ſquares of the other two ſides,</hi>
cannot be known, let the terms be ever ſo exactly
defined, without a train of reaſoning and enquiry.
But to convince us of this propoſition, <hi>that where there
is no property, there can be no injuſtice,</hi> 'tis only neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
to define the terms, and explain injuſtice to be a
violation of property. This propoſition is, indeed,
nothing but a more imperfect deſinition. 'Tis the
ſame caſe with all thoſe pretended ſyllogiſtical reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
which may be found in every other branch of
learning, except the ſciences of quantity and number;
and theſe may ſafely, I think, be pronounced the only
proper objects of knowlege and demonſtration.</p>
               <p>ALL other enquiries of men regard only matter of
fact and exiſtence; and theſe are evidently incapable
of demonſtration. Whatever <hi>is</hi> may <hi>not be.</hi> No ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
of a fact can involve a contradiction. The
non-exiſtence of any being, without exception, is as
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:0050800103:245"/>
clear and diſtinct an idea as its exiſtence. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
which affirms it not to be, however falſe,
is no leſs conceivable and intelligible, than that which
affirms it to be. The caſe is different with the ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
properly ſo called. Every propoſition, which
is not true, is there confuſed and unintelligible. That
the cube root of 64 is equal to the half of 10, is a
falſe propoſition, and can never be diſtinctly conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
But that CAESAR, or the angel GABRIEL, or
any being never exiſted, may be a falſe propoſition,
but ſtill is perfectly conceivable, and implies no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction.</p>
               <p>THE exiſtence, therefore, of any being can only
be proved by arguments from its cauſe or its effect;
and theſe arguments are founded entirely on experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
If we reaſon <hi>à priori,</hi> any thing may appear
able to produce any thing. The falling of a pebble
may, for aught we know, extinguiſh the ſun; or the
wiſh of a man controul the planets in their orbits.
'Tis only experience, which teaches us the nature and
bounds of cauſe and effect, and enables us to inſer
the exiſtence of one object from that of another<note n="*" place="bottom">That impious maxim of the antient philoſophy, <hi>Ex nihilo, nihil fit,</hi> by which the creation of matter was excluded, ceaſes to be a maxim, according to this philoſophy. Not only the will of the ſupreme Being may create matter; but, for aught we know <hi>à priori,</hi> the will of any other Being might create it, or any other cauſe, that the moſt whimſical imagination can aſſign.</note>.
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:0050800103:246"/>
Such is the foundation of moral reaſoning, which
forms the greateſt part of human knowlege, and is
the ſource of all human action and behaviour.</p>
               <p>MORAL reaſonings are either concerning particular
or general facts. All deliberations in life regard the
former; as alſo all diſquiſitions in hiſtory, chronology,
geography, and aſtronomy.</p>
               <p>THE ſciences, which treat of general facts, are po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,
natural philoſophy, phyſic, chymiſtry, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
where the qualities, cauſes, and effects of a whole
ſpecies of objects are enquired into.</p>
               <p>DIVINITY or Theology, as it proves the exiſtence
of a Deity, and the immortality of ſouls, is compoſed
partly of reaſonings concerning particular, partly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
general facts. It has a foundation in <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi>
ſo far as it is ſupported by experience. But its
beſt and moſt ſolid foundation is <hi>faith</hi> and divine
revelation.</p>
               <p>MORALS and criticiſm are not ſo properly objects
of the underſtanding as of taſte and ſentiment. Beauty,
whether moral or natural, is felt, more properly than
perceived. Or if we reaſon concerning it, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to fix its ſtandard, we regard a new fact, <hi>viz.</hi>
the general taſte of mankind, or ſome ſuch fact, which
may be the object of reaſoning and enquiry.</p>

WHEN we run over libraries, perſuaded of theſe
principles, what havoc muſt we make? If we take in

reaſonings concerning quantity of number?</hi> No.
<hi>Does it contain any experimental reaſonings concerning
matters of fact or exiſtence?</hi> No. Commit it then to
the flames: For it can contain nothing but ſophiſtry
and illuſion.</p>

2. ALL good or evil, whence-ever it ariſes, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces
various paſſions and affections, according to the
light, in which it is ſurveyed.</p>
               <p>WHEN good is certain or very probable, it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces
JOY: When evil is in the ſame ſituation, there
ariſes GRIEF or SORROW.</p>
               <p>WHEN either good or evil is uncertain, it gives riſe
to FEAR or HOPE, according to the degrees of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty
on one ſide or the other.</p>
               <p>DESIRE ariſes from good conſidered ſimply; and
AVERSION, from evil. The WILL exerts itſelf, when
either the preſence of the good or abſence of the
evil may be attained by any action of the mind or
body.</p>
               <p>3. NONE of theſe paſſions ſeem to contain any
thing curious or remarkable except <hi>Hope</hi> and <hi>Fear,</hi>
which, being derived from the probability of any
good or evil, are mixed paſſions, that merit our
attention.</p>
               <p>PROBABILITY ariſes from an oppoſition of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
chances or cauſes, by which the mind is not
allowed to fix on either ſide; but is inceſſantly toſſed
from one to another, and in one moment is deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
to conſider an object as exiſtent, and in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:0050800103:250"/>
moment as the contrary. The imagination or
underſtanding, call it which you pleaſe, fluctuates be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the oppoſite views; and tho' perhaps it may
be oftener turned to one ſide than the other, it
is impoſſible for it, by reaſon of the oppoſition of
cauſes or chances, to reſt on either. The <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con</hi>
of the queſtion alternately prevail; and the mind,
ſurveying the objects in their oppoſite cauſes, finds
ſuch a contrariety as utterly deſtroys all certainty or
eſtabliſhed opinion.</p>
               <p>SUPPOSE, then, that the object, concerning which
we are doubtful, produces either deſire or averſion;
it is evident, that, according as the mind turns itſelf
to one ſide or the other, it muſt feel a momentary im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
of joy or ſorrow. An object, whoſe exiſtence
we deſire, gives ſatisfaction, when we think of thoſe
cauſes, which produce it; and for the ſame reaſon,
excites grief or uneaſineſs from the oppoſite conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.
So that, as the underſtanding, in probable
queſtions, is divided between the contrary points of
view, the heart muſt in the ſame manner be divided
between oppoſite emotions.</p>
               <p>NOW, if we conſider the human mind, we ſhall
obſerve, that with regard to the paſſions, it is not
like a wind inſtrument of muſic, which, in run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
over all the notes, immediately loſes the ſound
when the breath ceaſes; but rather reſembles a ſtring-inſtrument,
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:0050800103:251"/>
where, after each ſtroke, the vibrations
ſtill retain ſome ſound, which gradually and inſenſibly
decays. The imagination is extremely quick and
agile; but the paſſions, in compariſon, are ſlow and
reſtive: For which reaſon, when any object is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented,
which affords a variety of views to the one
and emotions to the other; tho' the fancy may change
its views with great celerity; each ſtroke will not
produce a clear and diſtinct note of paſſion, but the
one paſſion will always be mixed and confounded with
the other. According as the probability inclines to
good or evil, the paſſion of grief or joy predominates
in the compoſition; and theſe paſſions being inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingled
by means of the contrary views of the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination,
produce by the union the paſſions of hope
or fear.</p>
               <p>4. As this theory ſeems to carry its own evidence
along with it, we ſhall be more conciſe in our proofs.</p>
               <p>THE paſſions of fear and hope may ariſe, when the
chances are equal on both ſides, and no ſuperiority can
be diſcovered in one above the other. Nay, in this ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
the paſſions are rather the ſtrongeſt, as the mind
has then the leaſt foundation to reſt upon, and is toſt
with the greateſt uncertainty. Throw in a ſuperior
degree of probability to the ſide of grief, you im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
ſee that paſſion diffuſe itſelf over the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
and tincture it into fear. Encreaſe the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability,
and by that means the grief; the fear pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:0050800103:252"/>
ſtill more and more, 'till at laſt it runs inſenſibly,
as the joy continually diminiſhes, into pure grief. After
you have brought it to this ſituation, diminiſh
the grief, by a contrary operation to that, which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed
it, to wit, by diminiſhing the probability on
the melancholy ſide; and you will ſee the paſſion clear
every moment, 'till it changes inſenſibly into hope;
which again runs, by flow degrees, into joy, as you
increaſe that part of the compoſition, by the increaſe
of the probability. Are not theſe as plain proofs,
that the paſſions of fear and hope are mixtures of grief
and joy, as in optics it is a proof, that a coloured ray
of the ſun, paſſing thro' a priſm, is a compoſition of
two others, when as you diminiſh or increaſe the
quantity of either, you find it prevail proportionably,
more or leſs, in the compoſition?</p>
               <p>5.PROBABILITY is of two kinds; either when
the object is itſelf uncertain, and to be determined by
chance; or when, tho' the object be already certain,
yet is it uncertain to our judgment, which finds a
number of proofs or preſumptions on each ſide of the
queſtion. Both theſe kinds of probability cauſe fear
and hope; which muſt proceed from that property,
in which they agree; to wit, the uncertainty and fluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation
which they beſtow on the paſſion, by that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety
of views, which is common to both.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="256" facs="tcp:0050800103:253"/>
6. IT is a probable good or evil, which commonly
cauſes hope or fear; becauſe probability, producing
an inconſtant and wavering ſurvey of an object, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions
naturally a like mixture and uncertainty of
paſſion. But we may obſerve, that, wherever, from
other cauſes, this mixture can be produced, the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
of fear and hope will ariſe, even tho' there be
no probability.</p>
               <p>AN evil, conceived as barely <hi>poſſible,</hi> ſometimes
produces fear; eſpecially if the evil be very great.
A man cannot think of exceſſive pain and torture
without trembling, if he runs the leaſt riſque of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
them. The ſmallneſs of the probability is
compenſated by the greatneſs of the evil.</p>
               <p>BUT even <hi>impoſſible</hi> evils cauſe fear; as when we
tremble on the brink of a precipice, tho' we know
ourſelves to be in perfect ſecurity, and have it in our
choice, whether we will advance a ſtep farther. The
immediate preſence of the evil influences the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
and produces a ſpecies of belief; but being
oppoſed by the reflection on our ſecurity, that belief
is immediately retracted, and cauſes the ſame kind of
paſſion, as when, from a contrariety of chances, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
paſſions are produced.</p>
               <p>EVILS, which are <hi>certain,</hi> have ſometimes the ſame
effect as the poſſible or impoſſible. A man, in a ſtrong
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:0050800103:254"/>
priſon, without the leaſt means of eſcape, trembles at
the thoughts of the rack, to which he is ſentenced.
The evil is here fixed in itſelf; but the mind has not
courage to fix upon it; and this fluctuation gives riſe
to a paſſion of a ſimilar appearance with fear.</p>
               <p>7. BUT it is not only where good or evil is uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
as to its <hi>exiſtence,</hi> but alſo as to its <hi>kind,</hi> that fear
or hope ariſes. If any one were told that one of his
ſons is ſuddenly killed; the paſſion, occaſioned by
this event, would not ſettle into grief, 'till he got cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
information which of his ſons he had loſt. Tho'
each ſide of the queſtion produces here the ſame
paſſion; that paſſion cannot ſettle, but receives from
the imagination, which is unfixed, a tremulous un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteady
motion, reſembling the mixture and contention
of grief and joy.</p>
               <p>8. THUS all kinds of uncertainty have a ſtrong
connexion with fear, even tho' they do not cauſe any
oppoſition of paſſions, by the oppoſite views, which
they preſent to us. Should I leave a friend in any
malady, I ſhould feel more anxiety upon his account,
than if he were preſent; tho' perhaps I am not only
incapable of giving him aſſiſtance, but likewiſe of
judging concerning the event of his ſickneſs. There
are a thouſand little circumſtances of his ſituation and
condition, which I deſire to know; and the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege
of them would prevent that fluctuation and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty,
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:0050800103:255"/>
ſo nearly allied to fear. HORACE has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked
this phaenomenon.</p>

and greatneſs of the unknown event, ſo embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſs
the mind, that it knows not in what image or
paſſion to fix itſelf.</p>
               <p>9. CONCERNING the mixture of affections, we
may remark, in general, that when contrary paſſions
ariſe from objects no way connected together, they
take place alternately. Thus when a man is afflicted
for the loſs of a law-fuit, and joyful for the birth of
a ſon, the mind, running from the agreeable to the
calamitous object; with whatever celerity it may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
this motion, can ſcarcely temper the one affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
with the other, and remain between them in a
ſtate of indifference.</p>
               <p>IT more eaſily attains that calm ſituation, when the
<hi>ſame</hi> event is of a mixed nature, and contains ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
adverſe and ſomething proſperous in its different
circumſtance. For in that caſe, both the paſſions,
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:0050800103:256"/>
mingling with each other by means of the relation,
often become mutually deſtructive, and leave the mind
in perfect tranquillity.</p>
               <p>BUT ſuppoſe, that the object is not a compound of
good and evil, but is conſidered as probable or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable
in any degree; in that caſe the contrary paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
will both of them be preſent at once in the
ſoul, and inſtead of ballancing and tempering each
other, will ſubſiſt together, and by their union, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
a third impreſſion or affection, ſuch as hope or
fear.</p>
               <p>THE influence of the relations of ideas (which we
ſhall afterwards explain more fully) is plainly ſeen in
this affair. In contrary paſſions, if the objects be
<hi>totally different,</hi> the paſſions are like two oppoſite li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors
in different bottles, which have no influence on
each other. If the objects be intimately <hi>connected,</hi> the
paſſions are like an <hi>alcali</hi> and an <hi>acid,</hi> which, being
mingled, deſtroy each other. If the relation be more
imperfect, and conſiſts in the <hi>contradictory</hi> views of
the <hi>ſame</hi> object, the paſſions are like oil and vinegar,
which, however mingled, never perfectly unite and
incorporate.</p>
               <p>THE effect of a mixture of paſſions, when one of
them is predominant and ſwallows up the other, ſhall
be explained afterwards.</p>

               <p>1. BESIDES thoſe paſſions above-mentioned,
which ariſe from a direct purſuit of good and averſion
to evil, there are others which are of a more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated
nature, and imply more than one view or
conſideration. Thus <hi>Pride</hi> is a certain ſatisfaction in
ourſelves, on account of ſome accompliſhment or poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion,
which we enjoy: <hi>Humility,</hi> on the other hand,
is a diſſatisfaction with ourſelves, on account of ſome
defect or infirmity.</p>
               <p>LOVE or <hi>Friendſhip</hi> is a complacency in another,
on account of his accompliſhments or ſervices: <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred,</hi>
the contrary.</p>
               <p>2. IN theſe two ſets of paſſions, there is an obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
diſtinction to be made between the <hi>object</hi> of the
paſſion and its <hi>cauſe.</hi> The object of pride and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility
is ſelf: The cauſe of the paſſion is ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence
in the former caſe; ſome fault, in the latter.
The object of love and hatred is ſome other perſon:
The cauſes, in like manner, are either excellencies
or faults.</p>
               <p>WITH regard to all theſe paſſions, the cauſes are
what excite the emotion; the object is what the mind
directs its view to when the emotion is excited. Our
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:0050800103:258"/>
merit, for inſtance, raiſes pride; and it is eſſential
to pride to turn our view on ourſelf with complacency
and ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p>NOW as the cauſes of theſe paſſions are very nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous
and various, tho' their object be uniform and
ſimple; it may be a ſubject of curioſity to conſider,
what that circumſtance is, in which all theſe various
cauſes agree; or, in other words, what is the real,
efficient cauſe of the paſſion. We ſhall begin with
pride and humility.</p>
               <p>3. IN order to explain the cauſes of theſe paſſions,
we muſt reflect on certain properties, which tho' they
have a mighty influence on every operation, both of
the underſtanding and paſſions, are not commonly
much inſiſted on by philoſophers. The firſt of theſe
is the <hi>aſſociation</hi> of ideas, or that principle, by which
we make an eaſy tranſition from one idea to another.
However uncertain and changeable our thoughts may
be, they are not entirely without rule and method in
their changes. They uſually paſs with regularity,
from one object, to what reſembles it, is contiguous
to it, or produced by it<note n="*" place="bottom">See Enquiry concerning Human Underſtanding, Sect. III.</note>. When one idea is preſent
to the imagination; any other, united by theſe rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
naturally follows it, and enters with more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility,
by means of that introduction.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="262" facs="tcp:0050800103:259"/>
THE <hi>ſecond</hi> property, which I ſhall obſerve in the
human mind, is a like aſſociation of impreſſions or
emotions. All <hi>reſembling</hi> impreſſions are connected
together; and no ſooner one ariſes, than the reſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
follow. Grief and diſappointment give riſe
to anger, anger to envy, envy to malice, and malice
to grief again. In like manner, our temper, when
elevated with joy, naturally throws itſelf into love,
generoſity, courage, pride, and other reſembling af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections.</p>
               <p>IN
the <hi>third</hi> place, it is obſervable of theſe two
kinds of aſſociation, that they very much aſſiſt and
forward each other, and that the tranſition is more
eaſily made, where they both concur in the ſame ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.
Thus, a man, who by any injury from another,
is very much diſcompoſed and ruffled in his temper,
is apt to find a hundred ſubjects of hatred, diſcontent,
impatience, fear, and other uneaſy paſſions, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
if he can diſcover theſe ſubjects in or near the
perſon, who was the object of his firſt emotion. Thoſe
principles which forward the tranſition of ideas, here
concur with thoſe, which operate on the paſſions;
and both, uniting in one action, beſtow on the mind
a double impulſe.</p>
               <p>UPON this occaſion, I may cite a paſſage from an
elegant writer, who expreſſes himſelf in the following
manner<note n="*" place="bottom">ADDISON, Spectator, N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 412.</note>. <q rend="inline">"As the fancy delights in every thing,
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:0050800103:260"/>
that is great, ſtrange, or beautiful, and is ſtill the
more pleaſed the more it finds of theſe perfections
in the <hi>ſame</hi> object, ſo it is capable of receiving new
ſatisfaction by the aſſiſtance of another ſenſe. Thus,
any continual found, as the muſic of birds, or a
fall of waters, awakens every moment the mind
of the beholder, and makes him more attentive to
the ſeveral beauties of the place, that lie before
him. Thus, if there ariſes a fragrancy of ſmells
or perfumes, they heighten the pleaſure of the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination,
and make even the colours and verdure
of the landſcape appear more agreeable; for the
ideas of both ſenſes recommend each other, and
are pleaſanter together than where they enter the
mind ſeparately: As the different colours of a pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
when they are well diſpoſed, ſet off one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and receive an additional beauty from the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of the ſituation."</q> In theſe phaenomena,
we may remark the aſſociation both of impreſſions
and ideas; as well as the mutual aſſiſtance theſe aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciations
lend to each other.</p>
               <p>4. IT ſeems to me, that both theſe ſpecies of rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
have place in producing <hi>Pride</hi> or <hi>Humility,</hi> and
are the real, efficient cauſes of the paſſion.</p>
               <p>WITH regard to the firſt relation, that of ideas,
there can be no queſtion. Whatever we are proud
of, muſt, in ſome manner, belong to us. It is always
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:0050800103:261"/>
                  <hi>our</hi> knowlege, <hi>our</hi> ſenſe, beauty, poſſeſſions, family,
on which we value ourſelves. Self, which is the
<hi>object</hi> of the paſſion, muſt ſtill be related to that qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
or circumſtance, which <hi>cauſes</hi> the paſſion. There
muſt be a connexion between them; an eaſy tranſition
of the imagination; or a facility of the conception in
paſſing from one to the other. Where this connexion
is wanting, no object can either excite pride or hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility;
and the more you weaken the connexion, the
more you weaken the paſſion.</p>
               <p>5. THE only ſubject of enquiry is, whether there
be a like relation of impreſſions or ſentiments, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
pride or humility is felt; whether the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
which cauſes the paſſion, produces antecedently
a ſentiment ſimilar to the paſſion; and whether there
be an eaſy transfuſion of the one into the other.</p>
               <p>THE feeling or ſentiment of pride is agreeable; of
humility, painful. An agreeable ſenſation is, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
related to the former; a painful, to the latter.
And if we find, after examination, that every object,
which produces pride, produces alſo a ſeparate plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure;
and every object, that cauſes humility, excites
in like manner a ſeparate uneaſineſs; we muſt allow,
in that caſe, that the preſent theory is fully proved
and aſcertained. The double relation of ideas and
ſentiments will be acknowleged inconteſtable.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="265" facs="tcp:0050800103:262"/>
6. To begin with perſonal merit and demerit, the
moſt obvious cauſes of theſe paſſions; it would be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
foreign to our preſent purpoſe to examine the
foundation of moral diſtinctions. It is ſufficient to
obſerve, that the foregoing theory concerning the
origin of the paſſions may be defended on any hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis.
The moſt probable ſyſtem, which has been
advanced to explain the difference between vice and
virtue, is, that either from a primary conſtitution of
nature, or from a ſenſe of public or private intereſt,
certain characters, upon the very view and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation,
produce uneaſineſs; and others, in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
excite pleaſure. The uneaſineſs and ſatisfaction,
produced in the ſpectator, are eſſential to vice and
virtue. To approve of a character, is to feel a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
upon its appearance. To diſapprove of it, is to
be ſenſible of an uneaſineſs. The pain and pleaſure
therefore, being, in a manner, the primary ſource of
blame or praiſe, muſt alſo be the cauſes of all their
effects; and conſequently, the cauſes of pride and
humility, which are the unavoidable attendants of
that diſtinction.</p>
               <p>BUT ſupposing this theory of morals ſhould not
be received; it is ſtill evident that pain and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
if not the ſources of moral diſtinctions, are at
leaſt inſeparable from them. A generous and noble
character affords a ſatisfaction even in the ſurvey;
and when preſented to us, tho' only in a poem or
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:0050800103:263"/>
fable, never fails to charm and delight us. On the
other hand, cruelty and treachery diſpleaſe from their
very nature; nor is it poſſible ever to reconcile us to
theſe qualities, either in ourſelves or others. Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
therefore, produces always a pleaſure diſtinct
from the pride or ſelf-ſatisfaction which attends it:
Vice, an uneaſineſs ſeparate from the humility or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe.</p>
               <p>BUT
a high or low conceit of ourſelves ariſes not
from thoſe qualities alone of the mind, which, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to common ſyſtems of ethics, have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
parts of moral duty; but from any other, which
have a connexion with pleaſure or uneaſineſs. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
flatters our vanity more than the talent of pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by our wit, good-humour, or any other accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment;
and nothing gives us a more ſenſible mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification,
than a diſappointment in any attempt of
that kind. No one has ever been able to tell pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely,
what <hi>wit</hi> is, and to ſhew why ſuch a ſyſtem of
thought muſt be received under that denomination,
and ſuch another rejected. It is by taſte alone we can
decide concerning it; nor are we poſſeſt of any other
ſtandard, by which we can form a judgment of this
nature. Now what is this <hi>taſte,</hi> from which true and
falſe wit in a manner receive their being, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which no thought can have a title to either of
theſe denominations? It is plainly nothing but a
ſenſation of pleaſure from true wit, and of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:0050800103:264"/>
from falſe, without our being able to tell the
reaſons of that ſatisfaction or uneaſineſs. The power
of exciting theſe oppoſite ſenſations is, therefore, the
very eſſence of true or falſe wit; and conſequently,
the cauſe of that vanity or mortification, which ariſes
from one or the other.</p>
               <p>7. BEAUTY of all kinds gives us a peculiar delight
and ſatisfaction; as deformity produces pain, upon
whatever ſubject it may be placed, and whether ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed
in an animate or inanimate object. If the
beauty or deformity belong to our own face, ſhape,
or perſon, this pleaſure or uneaſineſs is converted into
pride or humility; as having in this caſe all the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
requiſite to produce a perfect tranſition,
according to the preſent theory.</p>
               <p>IT would ſeem, that the very eſſence of beauty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts
in its power of producing pleaſure. All its ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects,
therefore, muſt proceed from this circumſtance:
And if beauty is ſo univerſally the ſubject of vanity,
it is only from its being the cauſe of pleaſure.</p>
               <p>CONCERNING all other bodily accompliſhments,
we may obſerve in general, that whatever in ourſelves
is either uſeful, beautiful, or ſurprizing, is an object
of pride; and the contrary, of humility. Theſe qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
agree in producing a ſeparate pleaſure; and agree
in nothing elſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="268" facs="tcp:0050800103:265"/>
WE are vain of the ſurprizing adventures which
we have met with, the eſcapes which we have made,
the dangers to which we have been expoſed; as well
as of our ſurprizing ſeats or vigour and activity.
Hence the origin of vulgar lying; where men, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any intereſt, and merely out of vanity, heap up
a number of extraordinary events, which are either the
fictions of their brain; or, if true, have no connexion
with themſelves. Their fruitful invention ſupplies
them with a variety of adventures; and where that
talent is wanting, they appropriate ſuch as belong to
others, in order to gratify their vanity: For between
that paſſion, and the ſentiment of pleaſure, there is
always a cloſe connexion.</p>
               <p>8. BUT tho' pride and humility have the qualities
of our mind and body, that is, of ſelf, for their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
and more immediate cauſes; we find by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
that many other objects produce theſe affections.
We found vanity upon houſes, gardens, equipage,
and other external objects; as well as upon perſonal
merit and accompliſhments. This happens when ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
objects acquire any particular relation to our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and are aſſociated or connected with us. A
beautiful fiſh in the ocean, a well-proportioned ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
in a foreſt, and indeed, any thing, which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
belongs nor is related to us, has no manner of
influence on our vanity; whatever extraordinary qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
it may be endowed with, and whatever degree
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:0050800103:266"/>
if ſurprize and admiration it may naturally occaſion.
It muſt be ſomeway aſſociated with us, in order to
touch our pride. Its idea muſt hang, in a manner,
upon that of ourſelves; and the tranſition from one
to the other muſt be eaſy and natural.</p>
               <p>MEN are vain of the beauty either of <hi>their</hi> country,
or <hi>their</hi> country, or even of <hi>their</hi> pariſh. Here the
idea of beauty plainly produces a pleaſure. This
pleaſure is related to pride. The object or cauſe of
this pleaſure is, by the ſuppoſition, related to ſelf, the
object of pride. By this double relation of ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and ideas, a tranſition is made from one to the
other.</p>
               <p>MEN are alſo vain of the happy temperature of the
climate, in which they are born; of the fertility of
their native ſoil; of the goodneſs of the wines, fruits,
or victuals, produced by it; of the ſoftneſs or force
of their language, with other particulars of that kind.
Theſe objects have plainly a reference to the pleaſures
of the ſenſes, and are originally conſidered as agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to the feeling, taſte, or hearing. How could
they become cauſes of pride, except by means of that
tranſition above explained?</p>
               <p>THERE are ſome, who diſcover a vanity of an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite
kind, and affect to depreciate their own coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
in compariſon of thoſe, to which they have tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled.
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:0050800103:267"/>
Theſe perſons find, when they are at
home, and ſurrounded with their countrymen, that
the ſtrong relation between them and their own nation
is ſhared with ſo many, that it is in a manner loſt to
them; whereas, that diſtant relation to a foreign
country, which is formed by their having ſeen it, and
lived in it, is augmented by their conſidering how
few have done the ſame. For this reaſon, they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
admire the beauty, utility, and rarity of what
they met with abroad, above what they find at
home.</p>
               <p>SINCE we can be vain of a country, climate, or
any inanimate object, which bears a relation to us;
it is no wonder we ſhould be vain of the qualities of
thoſe, who are connected with us by blood or friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.
Accordingly we find, that any qualities which,
when belonging to ourſelf, produce pride, produce
alſo, in a leſs degree, the ſame affection, when diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
in perſons, related to us. The beauty, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs,
merit, credit, and honours of their kindred are
carefully diſplayed by the proud, and are conſiderable
ſources of their vanity.</p>
               <p>AS we are proud of riches in ourſelves, we deſire,
in order to gratify our vanity, that every one, who
has any connexion with us, ſhould likewiſe be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt
of them, and are aſhamed of ſuch as are mean
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:0050800103:268"/>
or poor among our friends and relations. Our fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers
being conceived as our neareſt relations; every
one naturally affects to be of a good family, and to
be deſcended from a long ſucceſſion of rich and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
anceſtors.</p>
               <p>THOSE, who boaſt of the antiquity of their fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
are glad when they can join this circumſtance,
that their anceſtors, for many generations, have been
uninterrupted proprietors of the <hi>ſome</hi> portion of land,
and that their family has never changed its poſſeſſions,
or been tranſplanted into any other county or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince.
It is an additional ſubject of vanity, when
they can boaſt, that theſe poſſeſſions have been tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
thro' a deſcent, compoſed entirely of males,
and that the honours and fortune have never paſſed
thro' any female. Let us endeavour to explain theſe
phaenomena from the foregoing theory.</p>
               <p>WHEN any one values himſelf on the antiquity of
his family the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> of his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> anceſtors (for in
that respect all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> are alike<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but theſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
joined <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſriches and credit of his ancef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
which are ſuppoſed to reflect a luſtre on him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
upon account of his connexion with them. Since
therefore the paſſion depends on the connexion, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
ſtrengthens the connexion muſt alſo encreaſe the
paſſion, and whatever weakens the connexion muſt
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:0050800103:269"/>
diminiſh the paſſion. But 'tis evident, that the ſame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the poſſeſſions muſt ſtrengthen the relation of
ideas, ariſing from blood and kindred, and convey
the fancy with greater facility from one generation to
another; from the remoteſt anceſtors to their poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
who are both their heirs and their deſcendants.
By this facility, the ſentiment is tranſmitted more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire,
and excites a greater degree of pride and vanity.</p>
               <p>THE caſe is the ſame with the tranſmiſſion of the
honours and fortune, thro' a ſucceſſion of males, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
their paſſing thro' any female. It is an obvious
quality of human nature, that the imagination natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
turns to whatever is important and conſiderable;
and where two objects are preſented, a ſmall and a
great, it uſually leaves the former, and dwells entirely
on the latter. This is the reaſon, why children com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
bear their father's name, and are eſteemed to
be of a nobler or meaner birth, according to <hi>his</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily.
And tho' the mother ſhould be poſſeſt of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior
qualities to the father, as often happens, the
<hi>general rule</hi> prevails, notwithſtanding the exception,
according to the doctrine, which ſhall be explained
afterwards. Nay, even when a ſuperiorty of any
kind is ſo great, or when any other reaſons have
ſuch an effect, as to make the children rather repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
the mother's family than the father's, the general
rule ſtill retains an efficacy, ſufficient to weaken the
relation, and make a kind of breach in the line of
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:0050800103:270"/>
anceſtors. The imagination runs not along them with
the ſame facility, nor is able to tranfer the honour
and credit of the anceſtors to their poſterity of the
ſame name and family ſo readily, as when the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
is conformable to the general rule, and paſſes
thro' the male line, from father to ſon, or from bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to brother.</p>
               <p>9. BUT <hi>property,</hi> as it gives us the fulleſt power
and authority over any object, is the relation, which
has the greateſt influence on theſe paſſions<note n="*" place="bottom">That property is a ſpecies of <hi>relation,</hi> which produces a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion between the perſon and the object is evident: The ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination paſſes naturally and eaſily from the conſideration of a field to that of the perſon, whom it belongs to. It may only be aſked, how this relation is reſolveable into any of thoſe three, viz. <hi>cauſation, contiguity</hi> and <hi>reſemblance,</hi> which we have affirmed to be the ſole connecting principles among ideas. To be the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietor of any thing is to be the ſole perſon, who, by the laws of ſociety, has a right to diſpoſe of it, and to enjoy the benefit of it. This right has at leaſt a tendency to procure the perſon the exerciſe of it; and in fact does commonly procure him that advantage. For rights which had no influence, and never took place, would be no rights at all. Now a perſon who diſpoſes of an object, and reaps benefit from it, both produces, or may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, effects on it, and is affected by it. Property therefore is a ſpecies of <hi>cauſation.</hi> It enables the perſon to produce alterations on the object, and it ſuppoſes that his condition is improved and altered by it. It is indeed the relation the moſt intereſting of any, and occurs the moſt frequently to the mind.</note>.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="274" facs="tcp:0050800103:271"/>
EVERY thing, belonging to a vain man, is the beſt
that is any where to be found. His houſes, equipage,
furniture, cloaths, horſes, hounds, excel all others in
his conceit; and it is eaſy to obſerve, that, from the
leaſt advantage in any of theſe, he draws a new ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of pride and vanity. His wine, if you will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
him, has a finer flavour than any other; his
cookery is more exquiſite; his table more orderly; his
ſervants more expert; the air, in which he lives, more
healthful; the ſoil, which he cultivates, more fertile;
his fruits ripen earlier, and to greater perfection:
Such a thing is remarkable for its novelty; ſuch ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for its antiquity: This is the workmanſhip of
a famous artiſt; that belonged once to ſuch a prince
or great man. All objects, in a word, which are uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
beautiful, or ſurprizing, or are related to ſuch,
may, by means of property, give riſe to this paſſion.
Theſe all agree in giving pleaſure. This alone is
common to them; and therefore muſt be the quality,
that produces the paſſion, which is their common
effect. As every new inſtance is a new argument,
and as the inſtances are here without number; it
would ſeem, that this theory is ſufficiently confirmed
by experience.</p>
               <p>RICHES imply the power of acquiring whatever is
agreeable; and as they comprehend many particular
objects of vanity, neceſſarily become one of the chief
cauſes of that paſſion.</p>

10. OUR opinions of all kinds are ſtrongly affected
by ſociety and ſympathy, and it is almoſt impoſſible
for us to ſupport any principle or ſentiment, againſt
the univerſal conſent of every one, with whom we
have any friendſhip or correſpondence. But of all our
opinions, thoſe, which we form in our own favour;
however lofty or preſuming; are at bottom, the frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt,
and the moſt eaſily ſhaken by the contradiction
and oppoſition of others. Our great concern, in this
caſe, makes us ſoon alarmed, and keeps our paſſions
upon the watch: Our conſciouſneſs of partiality ſtill
makes us dread a miſtake: And the very difficulty of
judging concerning an object, which is never ſet at
a due diſtance from us, nor is ſeen in a proper point
of view, makes us hearken anxiouſly to the opinions
of others, who are better qualified to form juſt opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
concerning us. Hence that ſtrong love of fame,
with which all mankind are poſſeſt. It is in order to
fix and confirm their favourable opinion of themſelves,
not from any original paſſion, that they ſeek the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſes
of others. And when a man deſires to be
praiſed, it is for the ſame reaſon, that a beauty is
pleaſed with ſurveying herſelf in a favourable look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-glaſs,
and ſeeing the reflexion of her own
charms.</p>
               <p>THO' it be difficult in all points of ſpeculation
to diſtinguiſh a cauſe, which encreaſes an effect, from
one, which ſolely produces it; yet in the preſent caſe
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:0050800103:273"/>
the phaenomena ſeem pretty ſtrong and ſatisfactory
in confirmation of the foregoing principle.</p>
               <p>WE receive a much greater ſatisfaction from the
approbation of thoſe whom we ourſelves eſteem and
approve of, than of thoſe, whom we contemn and
deſpiſe.</p>
               <p>WHEN eſteem is obtained after a long and inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
acquaintance, it gratifies our vanity in a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
manner.</p>
               <p>THE ſuffrage of thoſe, who are ſhy and backward
in giving praiſe, is attended with an additional reliſh
and enjoyment, if we can obtain it in our favour.</p>
               <p>WHERE a great man is nice in his choice of favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites,
every one courts with greater earneſtneſs his
countenance and protection.</p>
               <p>PRAISE never gives us much pleaſure, unleſs it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur
with our own opinion, and extol us for thoſe
qualities, in which we chiefly excel.</p>
               <p>THESE phaenomena ſeem to prove, that the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable
opinions of others are regarded only as au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities,
or as confirmations of our own opinion.
And if they have more influence on this ſubject than
in any other, it is eaſily accounted for from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the ſubject.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="277" facs="tcp:0050800103:274"/>
11. THUS few objects, however related to us, and
whatever pleaſure they produce, are able to excite a great
degree of pride or ſelf ſatisfaction; unleſs they be alſo
obvious to others, and engage the approbation of the
ſpectators. What diſpoſition of mind ſo deſirable as
the peaceful, reſigned, contented; which readily ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
to all the diſpenſations of providence, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves
a conſtant ſerenity amidſt the greateſt misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes
and diſappointments? Yet this diſpoſition, tho'
acknowleged to be a virtue or excellence, is ſeldom
the foundation of great vanity or ſelf-applauſe; hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no brilliancy or exterior luſtre, and rather cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the heart, than animating the behaviour and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation.
The caſe is the ſame with many other
qualities of the mind, body, or fortune; and this cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance,
as well as the double relations above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
muſt be admitted to be of conſequence in the
production of theſe paſſions.</p>
               <p>A SECOND circumſtance, which is of conſequence
in this affair, is the conſtancy and duration of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.
What is very caſual and inconſtant, beyond
the common courſe of human affairs, gives little joy,
and leſs pride. We are not much ſatisfied with the
thing itſelf; and are ſtill leſs apt to feel any new de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of ſelf-ſatisfaction upon its account. We foreſee
and anticipate its change; which makes us little ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
with the thing itſelf: We compare it to our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
whoſe exiſtence is more durable; by which
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:0050800103:275"/>
means its inconſtancy appears ſtill greater. It ſeems
ridiculous to make ourſelves the object of a paſſion,
on account of a quality or poſſeſſion, which is of ſo
much ſhorter duration, and attends us during ſo ſmall
a part of our exiſtence.</p>
               <p>A THIRD circumſtance, not to be neglected, is,
that the objects, in order to produce pride or ſelf-value,
muſt be peculiar to us, or at leaſt, common to
us with a few others. The advantages of ſun-ſhine,
good weather, a happy climate, &amp;c. diſtinguiſh us not
from any of our companions, and give us no prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
or ſuperiority. The compariſon which we are
every moment apt to make, preſents no inference to
our advantage; and we ſtill remain, notwithſtanding
theſe enjoyments, on a level with all our friends and
acquaintance.</p>
               <p>AS health and ſickneſs vary inceſſantly to all men,
and there is no one, who is ſolely or certainly fixed
in either; theſe accidental bleſſings and calamities are
in a manner ſeparated from us, and are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered
as a foundation for vanity or humiliation. But
wherever a malady of any kind is ſo rooted in our
conſtitution, that we no longer entertain any hopes
of recovery, from that moment it damps our ſelf-conceit,
as is evident in old men, whom nothing
mortifies more than the conſideration of their age and
infirmities. They endeavour, as long as poſſible, to
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:0050800103:276"/>
conceal their blindneſs and deafneſs, their rheums
and gouts; nor do they ever avow them without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctance
and uneaſineſs. And tho' young men are
not aſhamed of every head-ach or cold which they
fall into; yet no topic is more proper to mortify hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
pride, and make us entertain a mean opinion of
our nature, than this, that we are every moment of
our lives ſubject to ſuch infirmities. This proves,
that bodily pain and ſickneſs are in themſelves proper
cauſes of humility; tho' the cuſtom of eſtimating
every thing, by compariſon, more than by its intrinſic
worth and value, makes us overlook thoſe calamities,
which we find incident to every one, and cauſes us to
form an idea of our merit and character, independent
of them.</p>
               <p>WE are aſhamed of ſuch maladies as affect others,
and are either dangerous or diſagreeable to them. Of
the epilepſy; becauſe it gives a horror to every one
preſent: Of the itch; becauſe it is infectious: Of the
king's evil; becauſe it often goes to poſterity. Men
always conſider the ſentiments of others in their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of themſelves.</p>
               <p>A FOURTH circumſtance, which has an influence
on theſe paſſions, is <hi>general rules;</hi> by which we form
a notion of different ranks of men, ſuitable to the
power or riches of which they are poſſeſſed; and this
notion is not changed by any peculiarities of the health
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:0050800103:277"/>
or temper of the perſons, which may deprive them
of all enjoyment in their poſſeſſions. Cuſtom readily
carries us beyond the juſt bounds in our paſſions, as
well as in our reaſonings.</p>
               <p>IT may not be amiſs to obſerve on this occaſion,
that the influence of general rules and maxims on the
paſſions very much contributes to facilitate the effects
of all the principles or internal mechaniſm, which we
here explain. For it ſeems evident, that, if a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
full grown, and of the ſame nature with ourſelves'
were on a ſudden tranſported into our world, he would
be very much embarraſſed with every object, and
would not readily determine what degree of love or
hatred, of pride or humility, or of any other paſſion
ſhould be excited by it. The paſſions are often varied
by very inconſiderable principles; and theſe do not
always play with perfect regularity, eſpecially on the
firſt trial. But as cuſtom or practice has brought to
light all theſe principles, and has ſettled the juſt va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
of every thing; this muſt certainly contribute to
the eaſy production of the paſſions, and guide us, by
means of general eſtabliſhed rules, in the proportions,
which we ought to obſerve in prefering one object
to another. This remark may, perhaps, ſerve to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate
difficulties, that may ariſe concerning ſome
cauſes, which we here aſcribe to particular paſſions,
and which may be eſteemed too refined to operate
ſo univerſally and certainly, as they are found to
do.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="3" type="section">
               <pb n="281" facs="tcp:0050800103:278"/>
               <head>SECT. III.</head>
               <p>1. IN running over all the cauſes, which produce
the paſſion of pride or that of humility; it would
readily occur, that the ſame circumſtance, if tansfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
from ourſelf to another perſon, would render him
the object of love or hatred, eſteem or contempt. The
virtue, genius, beauty, family, riches, and authority
of others beget favourable ſentiments in their behalf;
and their vice, folly, deformity, poverty and mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
excite the contrary ſentiments. The double re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of impreſſions and ideas ſtill operates on theſe
paſſions of love and hatred; as on the former of pride
and humility. Whatever gives a ſeparate pleaſure or
pain, and is related to another perſon or connected
with him, makes him the object of our affection or
diſguſt.</p>
               <p>HENCE too injury or contempt is one of the greateſt
ſources of hatred; ſervices or eſteem, of friendſhip.</p>
               <p>2. SOMETIMES a relation to ourſelf excites affection
towards any perſon. But there is always here im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
a realtion of ſentiments, without which the other
relation would have no influence<note n="*" place="bottom">The affection of parents to children ſeems founded on an original inſtinct. The affection towards other relations depends on the principles here explained.</note>.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="282" facs="tcp:0050800103:279"/>
A PERSON, who is related to us, or connected with
us, by blood, by ſimilitude of fortune, of adventures,
profeſſion, or country, ſoon becomes an agreeable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion
to us; becauſe we enter eaſily and familiarly
into his ſentiments and conceptions: Nothing is ſtrange
or new to us: Our imagination, paſſing from ſelf,
which is ever intimately preſent to us, runs ſmoothly
along the relation or connexion, and conceives with
a full ſympathy the perſon, who is nearly related to
ſelf. He renders himſelf immediately acceptable, and
is at once on an eaſy ſooting with us: No diſtance,
no reſerve has place, where the perſon introduced is
ſuppoſed ſo cloſely connected with us.</p>
               <p>RELATION has here the ſame influence as cuſtom
or acquaintance, in exciting affection; and from like
cauſes. The eaſe and ſatisfaction, which, in both
caſes, attend our intercourſe or commerce, is the
ſource of the friendſhip.</p>
               <p>3. The paſſions of love and hatred are always fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
by, or rather conjoined with, benevolence and
anger. It is this conjunction, which chiefly diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhes
theſe affections, from pride and humility. For
pride and humility are pure emotions in the ſoul, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>attended
with any deſire, and not immediately excit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
us to action. But love and hatred are not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
within themſelves, nor reſt in that emotion, which
they produce; but carry the mind to ſomething far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:0050800103:280"/>
Love is always followed by a deſire of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs
to the perſon beloved, and an averſion to his
miſery: As hatred produces a deſire of the miſery,
and an averſion to the happineſs of the perſon hated.
Theſe oppoſite deſires ſeem to be originally and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily
conjoined with the paſſion of love and hatred.
It is a conſtitution of nature, of which we can give
no farther explication.</p>
               <p>4. COMPASSION frequently ariſes, where there is
no preceding eſteem or friendſhip; and compaſſion is
an uneaſineſs in the ſufferings of another. It ſeems
to ſpring from the intimate and ſtrong conception of
his ſufferings; and our imagination proceeds by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
from the lively idea, to the real feeling of
another's miſery.</p>
               <p>MALICE and envy alſo ariſe in the mind without
any preceding hatred or injury; tho' their tendency
is exactly the ſame with that of anger and ill will.
The compariſon of ourſelves with others ſeems the
ſource of envy and malice. The more unhappy ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is, the more happy do we ourſelves appear in
our own conception.</p>
               <p>5. THE ſimilar tendency of compaſſion to that of
benevolence, and of envy to anger, forms a very cloſe
relation between theſe two ſets of paſſions; tho' of a
different kind from that inſiſted on above. It is not
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:0050800103:281"/>
a reſemblance of feeling or ſentiment, but a reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
of tendency or direction. Its effect, however,
is the ſame, in producing an aſſociation of paſſions.
Compaſſion is ſeldom or never felt without ſome mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of tenderneſs or friendſhip; and envy is naturally
accompanied with anger or ill will. To deſire the
happineſs of another, from whatever motive, is a
good preparative to affection: and to delight in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
miſery almoſt unavoidably begets averſion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
him.</p>
               <p>EVEN where intereſt is the ſource of our concern,
it is commonly attended with the ſame conſequences.
A partner is a natural object of friendſhip; a rival of
enmity.</p>
               <p>6. POVERTY, meanneſs, diſappointment, produce
contempt and diſlike: But when theſe misfortunes
are very great, or are repreſented to us in very ſtrong
colours, they excite compaſſion, and tenderneſs, and
friendſhip. How is this contradiction to be accounted
for? The poverty and meanneſs of another, in their
common appearance, gives us uneaſineſs, by a ſpecies
of imperfect ſympathy; and this uneaſineſs produces
averſion or diſlike, from the reſemblance of ſentiment.
But when we enter more intimately into another's
concerns, and wiſh for his happineſs, as well as feel
his miſery, friendſhip or good-will ariſes, from the
ſimilar tendency of the inclinations.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="285" facs="tcp:0050800103:282"/>
7. IN reſpect, there is a mixture of humility,
with the eſteem or affection: In contempt, a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of pride.</p>
               <p>THE amorous paſſion is uſually compounded of
complacency in beauty, a bodily appetite, and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
or affection. The cloſe relation of theſe ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
is very obvious, as well as their origin from
each other, by means of that relation. Were there
no other phaenomenon to reconcile us to the preſent
theory, this alone, methinks, were ſufficient.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="4" type="section">
               <head>SECT. IV.</head>
               <p>1. THE preſent theory of the paſſions depends en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
on the double relations of ſentiments and ideas,
and the mutual aſſiſtance, which theſe relations lend to
each other. It may not, therefore, be improper to
illuſtrate theſe principles by ſome farther inſtances.</p>
               <p>2. THE virtues, talents, accompliſhments, and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions
of others, make us love and eſteem them:
Becauſe theſe objects excite a pleaſant ſenſation, which
is related to love; and as they have alſo a relation or
connexion with the perſon, this union of ideas for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the union of ſentiments, according to the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going
reaſoning.</p>
               <p>BUT ſuppoſe, that the perſon, whom we love, is
alſo related to us, by blood, country, or friendſhip;
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:0050800103:283"/>
it is evident, that a ſpecies of pride muſt alſo be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited
by his accompliſhments and poſſeſſions; there
being the ſame double relation, which we have all
along inſiſted on. The perſon is related to us, or
there is an eaſy tranſition of thought from him to us;
and the ſentiments, excited by his advantages and
virtues, are agreeable, and conſequently related to
pride. Accordingly we find, that people are natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
vain of the good qualities or high fortune of
their friends and countrymen.</p>
               <p>3. BUT it is obſervable, that, if we reverſe the
order of the paſſions, the ſame effect does not follow.
We paſs eaſily from love and affection to pride and
vanity; but not from the latter paſſions to the former,
tho' all the relations be the ſame. We love not thoſe
related to us on account of our own merit; tho' they
are naturally vain on account of our merit. What is
the reaſon of this difference? The tranſition of the
imagination to ourſelves, from objects related to us,
is always very eaſy; both on account of the relation,
which facilitates the tranſition, and becauſe we there
paſs from remoter objects, to thoſe which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiguous.
But in paſſing from ourſelves to objects, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
to us; tho' the former principle forwards the
tranſition of thought, yet the latter oppoſes it; and
conſequently there is not the ſame eaſy transfuſion
of paſſions from pride to love as from love to pride.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="287" facs="tcp:0050800103:284"/>
4. THE virtues, ſervices, and fortune of one man
inſpire us readily with eſteem and affection for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
related to him. The ſon of our friend is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
entitled to our friendſhip: The kindred of a
very great man value themſelves, and are valued by
others, on account of that relation. The force of
the double relation is here fully diſplayed.</p>
               <p>5. THE following are inſtances of another kind,
where the operation of theſe principles may ſtill be
diſcovered. Envy ariſes from a ſuperiority in others;
but it is obſervable, that it is not the great diſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
between us, which excites that paſſion, but on
the contrary, our proximity. A great diſproportion
cuts off the relation of the ideas, and either keeps
us from comparing ourſelves with what is remote
from us, or diminiſhes the effects of the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon.</p>
               <p>A POET is not apt to envy a philoſopher, or a poet
of a different kind, of a different nation, or of a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
age. All theſe differences, if they do not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent,
at leaſt weaken the compariſon, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
the paſſion.</p>
               <p>THIS too is the reaſon, why all objects appear great
or little, merely by a compariſon with thoſe of the
ſame ſpecies. A mountain neither magnifies nor di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhes
a horſe in our eyes: But when a FLEMISH
and a WELSH horſe are ſeen together, the one ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:0050800103:285"/>
greater and the other leſs, than when viewed
apart.</p>
               <p>FROM the ſame principle we may account for that
remark of hiſtorians, that any party, in a civil war,
or even factious diviſion, always chooſe to call in a
foreign enemy at any hazard rather than ſubmit to
their fellow-citizens. GUICCIARDIN applies this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark
to the wars in ITALY; where the relations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the different ſtates are, properly ſpeaking, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but of name, language, and contiguity. Yet
even theſe relations, when joined with ſuperiority, by
making the compariſon more natural, make it like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
more grievous, and cauſe men to ſearch for ſome
other ſuperiority, which may be attended with no
relation, and by that means, may have a leſs ſenſible
influence on the imagination. When we cannot break
the aſſociation, we feel a ſtronger deſire to remove the
ſuperiority. This ſeems to be the reaſon, why tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers,
tho' commonly laviſh of their praiſes to the
CHINESE and PERSIANS, take care to depreciate
thoſe neighbouring nations, which may ſtand upon a
footing of rivalſhip with their native country.</p>
               <p>6. THE fine arts afford us parallel inſtances. Should
an author compoſe a treatiſe, of which one part was
ſerious and profound, another light and humorous;
every one would condemn ſo ſtrange a mixture, and
would blame him for the neglect of all rules of art
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:0050800103:286"/>
and criticiſm. Yet we accuſe not PRIOR for joining
his <hi>Alma</hi> and <hi>Solomon</hi> in the ſame volume; though
that amiable poet has ſucceeded perfectly in the
gaiety of the one, as well as in the melancholy of
the other. Even ſuppoſe the reader ſhould peruſe
theſe two compoſitions without any interval, he
would feel little or no difficulty in the change of the
paſſions. Why? but becauſe he conſiders theſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances
as entirely different; and by that break in
the ideas, breaks the progreſs of the affections, and
hinders the one from influencing or contradicting the
other.</p>
               <p>AN heroic and burleſque deſign, united in one
picture, would be monſtrous; though we place two
pictures of ſo oppoſite a character in the ſame cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
and even cloſe together, without any ſcruple.</p>
               <p>7. IT needs be no matter of wonder, that the eaſy
tranſition of the imagination ſhould have ſuch an influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
on all the paſſions. It is this very circumſtance,
which forms all the relations and connexions amongſt
objects. We know no real connection between one
thing and another. We know only, that the idea of
one thing is aſſociated with that of another, and that
the imagination makes an eaſy tranſition between
them. And as the eaſy tranſition of ideas, and that
of ſentiments mutually aſſiſt each other; we might
beforehand expect, that this principle muſt have a
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:0050800103:287"/>
mighty influence on all our internal movements and
affections. And experience ſufficiently confirms the
theory.</p>
               <p>FOR, not to repeat all the foregoing inſtances:
Suppoſe, that I were travelling with a companion
through a country, to which we are both utter ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers;
it is evident, that, if the proſpects be beautiful,
the roads agreeable, and the fields finely cultivated;
this may ſerve to put me in good humour, both with
myſelf and fellow-traveller. But as the country has
no connexion with myſelf or friend, it can never be
the immediate cauſe either of ſelf-value or of regard
to him: And therefore, if I found not the paſſion on
ſome other object, which bears to one of us a cloſer
relation, my emotions are rather to be conſidered as
the overflowings of an elevated or humane diſpoſition,
than as an eſtabliſhed paſſion. But ſuppoſing the
agreeable proſpect before us to be ſurveyed either
from his country-ſeat or from mine; this new con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion
of ideas gives a new direction to the ſentiment
of pleaſure, proceeding from the proſpect, and raiſes
the emotion of regard or vanity, according to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the connection. There is not here, methinks,
much room for doubt or difficulty.</p>

               <p>1. IT ſeems evident, that reaſon, in a ſtrict ſenſe,
as meaning the judgment of truth and falſehood, can
never, of itſelf, be any motive to the will, and can
have no influence but ſo far as it touches ſome paſſion
or affection. <hi>Abſtract relations</hi> of ideas are the object
of curioſity, not of volition. And <hi>matters of fact,</hi>
where they are neither good nor evil, where they
neither excite deſire nor averſion, are totally indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent;
and whether known or unknown, whether
miſtaken or rightly apprehended, cannot be regarded
as any motive to action.</p>
               <p>2. WHAT is commonly, in a popular ſenſe, called
reaſon, and is ſo much recommended in moral diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes,
is nothing but a general and a calm paſſion,
which takes a comprehenſive and a diſtant view of its
object, and actuates the will, without exciting any
ſenſible emotion. A man, we ſay, is diligent in his
profeſſion from reaſon; that is, from a calm deſire
of riches and a fortune. A man adheres to juſtice
from reaſon; that is, from a calm regard to public
good, or to a character with himſelf and others.</p>
               <p>3. THE ſame objects, which recommend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to reaſon in this ſenſe of the word, are alſo the
objects of what we call paſſion, when they are brought
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:0050800103:289"/>
near to us, and acquire ſome other advantages, either
of external ſituation, or congruity to our internal
temper; and by that means, excite a turbulent and
ſenſible emotion. Evil, at a great diſtance, is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided,
we ſay, from reaſon: Evil, near at hand,
produces averſion, horror, fear, and is the object of
paſſion.</p>
               <p>4. THE common error of metaphyſicians has lain
in aſcribing the direction of the will entirely to one
of theſe principles, and ſuppoſing the other to have
no influence. Men often act knowingly againſt their
intereſt: It is not therefore the view of the greateſt
poſſible good which always influences them. Men
often counteract a violent paſſion, in proſecution of
their diſtant intereſts and deſigns: It is not therefore
the preſent uneaſineſs alone, which determines them.
In general, we may obſerve, that both theſe princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
operate on the will; and where they are contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
that either of them prevails, according to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
character or preſent diſpoſition of the perſon.
What we call <hi>ſtrength of mind</hi> implies the prevalence
of the calm paſſions above the violent; though we
may eaſily obſerve, that there is no perſon ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
poſſeſſed of this virtue, as never, on any oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion,
to yield to the ſollicitation of violent affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and deſires. From theſe variations of temper
proceeds the great difficulty of deciding concerning
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:0050800103:290"/>
the future actions and reſolutions of men, where
there is any contrariety of motives and paſſions.</p>

               <p>1. WE ſhall here enumerate ſome of thoſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
which render a paſſion calm or violent, which
heighten or diminiſh any emotion.</p>
               <p>IT is a property in human nature, that any emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which attends a paſſion, is eaſily converted into
it; though in their natures they be originally diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
from, and even contrary to each other. It is
true, in order to cauſe a perfect union amongſt paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
and make one produce the other, there is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
required a double relation, according to the
theory above delivered. But when two paſſions are
already produced by their ſeparate cauſes, and are
both preſent in the mind, they readily mingle and
unite; though they have but one relation, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
without any. The predominant paſſion ſwallows
up the inferior, and converts it into itſelf. The
ſpirits, when once excited, eaſily receive a change in
their direction; and it is natural to imagine, that this
change will come from the prevailing affection. The
connection is in many caſes cloſer between any two
paſſions, than between any paſſion and indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="294" facs="tcp:0050800103:291"/>
WHEN a perſon is once heartily in love, the little
faults and caprices of his miſtreſs, the jealouſies and
quarrels, to which that commerce is ſo ſubject; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
unpleaſant they be, and rather connected with
anger and hatred; are yet found, in many inſtances,
to give additional force to the prevailing paſſion. It
is a common artifice of politicians, when they would
affect any perſon very much by a matter of fact, of
which they intend to inform him, firſt to excite his
curioſity; delay as long as poſſible the ſatisfying it;
and by that means raiſe his anxiety and impatience to
the utmoſt, before they give him a full inſight into
the buſineſs. They know, that this curioſity will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate
him into the paſſion, which they purpoſe to
raiſe, and will aſſiſt the object in its influence on the
mind. A ſoldier, advancing to battle, is naturally
inſpired with courage and confidence, when he
thinks on his friends and fellow-ſoldiers; and is
ſtruck with fear and terror, when he reflects on
the enemy. Whatever new emotion, therefore,
proceeds from the former, naturally encreaſes the
courage; as the ſame emotion proceeding from the
latter, augments the fear. Hence in martial diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,
the uniformity and luſtre of habit, the regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity
of figures and motions, with all the pomp and
majeſty of war, encourage ourſelves and our allies;
while the ſame objects in the enemy ſtrike terror into
us, though agreeable and beautiful in themſelves.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="295" facs="tcp:0050800103:292"/>
HOPE is, in itſelf, an agreeable paſſion, and allied
to friendſhip and benevolence; yet is it able ſometimes
to blow up anger, when that is the predominant paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.
<hi>Spes addita ſuſcitat iras.</hi> VIRG.</p>
               <p>2. SINCE paſſions, however independent, are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
transfuſed into each other, if they are both
preſent at the ſame time; it follows, that when good
or evil is placed in ſuch a ſituation as to cauſe any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
emotion, beſides its direct paſſion of deſire or
averſion, that latter paſſion muſt acquire new force
and violence.</p>
               <p>3. THIS often happens, when any object excites
contrary paſſions. For it is obſervable, that an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
of paſſions commonly cauſes a new emotion
in the ſpirits, and produces more diſorder than the
concurrence of any two affections of equal force.
This new emotion is eaſily converted into the predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant
paſſion, and in many inſtances, is obſerved to
encreaſe its violence, beyond the pitch, at which it
would have arrived, had it met with no oppoſition.
Hence we naturally deſire what is forbid, and often
take a pleaſure in performing actions, merely becauſe
they are unlawful. The notion of duty, when oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
to the paſſions, is not always able to overcome
them; and when it fails of that influence, is apt ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to increaſe and irritate them, by producing an
oppoſition in our motives and principles.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="296" facs="tcp:0050800103:293"/>
4. THE ſame effect follows, whether the oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
ariſes from internal motives or external obſtacles.
The paſſion commonly acquires new force in both
caſes. The efforts, which the mind makes to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount
the obſtacle, excite the ſpirits, and enliven the
paſſion.</p>
               <p>5. UNCERTAINTY has the ſame effect as oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
The agitation of the thought, the quick turns
which it makes from one view to another, the variety
of paſſions which ſucceed each other, according to the
different views: All theſe produce an emotion in the
mind, and this emotion transfuſes itſelf into the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant
paſſion.</p>
               <p>SECURITY, on the contrary, diminiſhes the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.
The mind, when leſt to itſelf, immediately
languiſhes; and in order to preſerve its ardor, muſt
be every moment ſupported by a new flow of paſſion.
For the ſame reaſon, deſpair, though contrary to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity,
has a like influence.</p>
               <p>6. NOTHING more powerfully excites any affection
than to conceal ſome part of its object, by throwing
it into a kind of ſhade, which, at the ſame time,
that it ſhows enough to prepoſſeſs us in favour of the
object, leaves ſtill ſome work for the imagination.
Beſides, that obſcurity is always attended with a kind
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:0050800103:294"/>
of uncertainty; the effort, which the fancy makes to
compleat the idea, rouzes the ſpirits, and gives an
additional force to the paſſion.</p>
               <p>7. AS deſpair and ſecurity, though contrary, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
the ſame effects; ſo abſence is obſerved to have
contrary effects, and in different circumſtances, either
encreaſes or diminiſhes our affection. ROCHEFOU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CAULT
has very well remarked, that abſence deſtroys
weak paſſions, but encreaſes ſtrong; as the wind ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhes
a candle, but blows up a fire. Long ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
naturally weakens our idea, and diminiſhes the
paſſion: But where the paſſion is ſo ſtrong and lively
as to ſupport itſelf, the uneaſineſs, ariſing from ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
encreaſes the paſſion, and gives it new force
and influence.</p>
               <p>8. WHEN the ſoul applies itſelf to the performance
of any action, or the conception of any object, to
which it is not accuſtomed, there is a certain unpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs
in the faculties, and a difficulty of the ſpirits
moving in their new direction. As this difficulty
excites the ſpirits, it is the ſource of wonder, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize,
and of all the emotion, which ariſe from
novelty; and is in itſelf, very agreeable, like every
thing, which inlivens the mind to a moderate degree.
But though ſurpriſe be agreeable in itſelf, yet as it puts
the ſpirits in agitation, it not only augments our
agreeable affections, but alſo our painful, according
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:0050800103:295"/>
to the foregoing principle. Hence every thing, that
is new, is moſt affecting, and gives us either more
pleaſure or pain, than what, ſtrictly ſpeaking, ſhould
naturally follow from it. When it often returns upon
us, the novelty wears off; the paſſions ſubſide; the
hurry of the ſpirits is over; and we ſurvey the object
with greater tranquillity.</p>
               <p>9. THE imagination and affections have a cloſe
union together. The vivacity of the former, gives
force to the latter. Hence the proſpect of any plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
with which we are acquainted, affects us more
than any other pleaſure, which we may own ſuperior,
but of whoſe nature we are <hi>wholly</hi> ignorant. Of the
one we can form a particular and determinate idea:
The other, we conceive under the general notion of
pleaſure.</p>
               <p>ANY ſatisfaction, which we lately enjoyed, and of
which the memory is freſh and recent, operates on the
will with more violence, than another of which the
traces are decayed and almoſt obliterated.</p>
               <p>A PLEASURE, which is ſuitable to the way of life,
in which we are engaged, excites more our deſires
and appetites than another, which is foreign to
it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="299" facs="tcp:0050800103:296"/>
NOTHING is more capable of infuſing any paſſion
into the mind, than eloquence, by which objects are
repreſented in the ſtrongeſt and moſt lively colours.
The bare opinion of another, eſpecially when inforced
with paſſion, will cauſe an idea to have an influence
upon us, though that idea might otherwiſe have been
entirely neglected.</p>
               <p>IT is remarkable, that lively paſſions commonly
attend a lively imagination. In this reſpect, as well
as others, the force of the paſſion depends as
much on the temper of the perſon, as on the nature
and ſituation of the object.</p>
               <p>WHAT is diſtant, either in place or time, has not
equal influence with what is near and contiguous.</p>
               <p>I PRETEND not here to have exhauſted this ſubject.
It is ſufficient for my purpoſe, if I have made it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
that in the production and conduct of the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
there is a certain regular mechaniſm, which is
ſuſceptible of as accurate a diſquiſition, as the laws of
motion, optics, hydroſtatics, or any part of natural
philoſophy.</p>
