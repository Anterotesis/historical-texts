            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE Author's compliments to Miſs EL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIOT, and he deſires to inſcribe to her the following ſcenes. She need not be alarmed at a dedication, the propriety of which will ſtrike every reader, who remembers that Miſs ELLIOT and the CITIZEN made their firſt appearance on the ſtage together, and that her uncommon talents gave the piece the beſt and moſt effectual protection. Elegance of figure, a voice of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing variety, a ſtrong expreſſion of humour, not impaired, but rendered exquiſite, by delicacy; theſe were circumſtances that ſecured the farce at firſt, and have ſince brought it into favour. No author ever met with a better patronage; and though the CITIZEN, like other <hi>things of this kind,</hi> has many faults, yet it has this peculiar merit, that it produced, in the character of MA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIA, a genuine comic genius. The CITIZEN claims another praiſe. When all the little arts of theatrical malice were conſpiring againſt her, it recommended Miſs ELLIOT to the notice of Mr. BEARD, and obtained for her that generous treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which <hi>that manager</hi> ſeems determined to extend to real merit. The Author therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires Miſs ELLIOT'S acceptance of this farce, for the defects of which he makes no apology, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, ſhould the moſt ſevere judge in this kind reſolve to arm himſelf with criticiſms, let him but look at the acting of MARIA, <hi>and he will forget them all.</hi>

Love of all things!—My dear Beaufort, one ſees ſo many people breathing raptures about each other before marriage, and dinning their inſipidity into the ears of all their acquaintance; <q>My dear ma'am, don't you think him a ſweet man? charminger creature never was.</q> Then he, on his ſide— <q>My life, my angel, oh! ſhe's a paradiſe of ever blooming ſweets.</q> And then in a month's time, <q>He's a perfidious wretch! I wiſh I had never ſeen his face—the devil was in me when I had any thing to ſay to him."—"Oh! damn her for an inanimated piece—I wiſh ſhe'd poiſon herſelf with all my heart.</q> That is ever the way; and ſo
