            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <q>
                  <hi>Let us follow after the things which make for Peace, and things wherewith one may edifie another.</hi>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <div type="introduction">
               <p>THESE Words of St. <hi>Paul</hi> recommend two things to us, <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Mutual Edification;</hi> very proper to be diſcours'd of at this Time, as well as to be purſu'd throughout our whole Lives. To the <hi>One</hi> we owe, whatever is Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant and Grateful to us in this Life; and to the <hi>Other,</hi> all the Happineſs we hope to enjoy in the Next.</p>
               <p>Nor does the Apoſtle alone join theſe two together, but even God himſelf and the Nature of Things require ſuch a Connexion. For while we live in <hi>Peace,</hi> we are more Ready in Finding out, more Happy in Executing, and more Succeſsful in Promoting thoſe Things that
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0402602600:4"/>
tend to <hi>Edification;</hi> and whilſt we ſtudy <hi>Edification,</hi> Tranquillity of Mind and Brotherly Love flow in of courſe. From hence it ſeems very evident, that he will never attain to either, who doth not proſecute Both; and that the One can never be true and genuine with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Other. That <hi>Peace</hi> is falſe and impious which obſtructs <hi>Edification;</hi> and he is not the Servant of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> but of <hi>Satan,</hi> who under pretence of <hi>Edification</hi> violates <hi>Peace.</hi> For thus St. <hi>James</hi> argues; <note place="margin">Jam. iii. <hi>V.</hi> 13, 14, 15.</note>
                  <hi>Who</hi> (ſays he) <hi>is a wiſe Man, and endued with Knowledge amongſt you? Let him ſhew out of a good Converſation his Works with Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Wiſdom. But if ye have bitter Envying and Strife in your Hearts, glory not, and lie not againſt the Truth. This Wiſdom deſcendeth not from Above, but is Earthly, Senſual, Deviliſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That therefore <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Edification</hi> ſhould, every where, and in all Ages of the Church, go hand in hand together, is highly neceſſary; and our Apoſtle, in this his Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> recommends <hi>Both</hi> for a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Reaſon: For the Church planted at <hi>Rome</hi> was then but young and tender, its Root not firm and deep, and yet was expos'd to the Inſults both of <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles.</hi> There were in that City ſeveral <hi>Weak</hi> Brethren, who were not well acquainted with the true Bounds of a <hi>Chriſtian Liberty.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>V.</hi> 2. <hi>V.</hi> 5.</note>
                  <hi>One believed that he might eat all things; another who was Weak, eat Herbs:</hi> And <hi>one Man eſteem'd every day alike, whilſt another eſteem'd one day above another,</hi> having not as yet ſufficiently ſhaken off the Yoke of the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Diſpenſation. From both theſe Extreams therefore very dangerous Conſequences were to be expected. On one ſide it was to be fear'd, leſt the better Inſtructed Chriſtians ſhould, by a vain Oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of their Liberty, draw over the Weaker to do that, with which their Conſcience could not as yet comply;
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0402602600:5"/>
which could never be conſiſtent with <hi>Edification.</hi> Hence the Apoſtle adviſes; <note place="margin">
                     <hi>V.</hi> 13, 14, 15.</note>
                  <hi>Judge this rather, that no Man put a Stumbling-block, or an occaſion to fall in his Brother's Way. I know,</hi> (adds he) <hi>and am perſwaded by the Lord Jeſus, that there is nothing unclean of it ſelf: But to him that eſteemeth any thing to be unclean, to him it is unclean. But if thy Brother be grieved with thy Meat, now walkeſt thou not Charitably. Deſtroy not him with thy Meat, for whom Chriſt died.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Danger that threatned on the other hand was, leſt the mutual Conteſts and Offences ariſing about theſe Matters, ſhould both diſturb the Peace of the Church, and give the common Enemy an opportunity of ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering the Flock of Chriſt. For it was very natural for the <hi>Weak</hi> to condemn thoſe as <hi>Sinners,</hi> who made uſe of a Liberty, which they look'd upon as Criminal; and it was as natural for thoſe who were puff'd up with Knowledge, to deſpiſe them as <hi>Ignorant,</hi> who declin'd that Liberty, which they knew to be allowed by Chriſt himſelf. Now, what elſe would have been the Iſſue of theſe Conteſts, but that the Weaker-minded, would either have return'd back again to <hi>Judaiſm,</hi> or have torn the Church to pieces by Schiſm? And that the Enemies of Chriſtianity, would have taken occaſion from the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure which each Party paſs'd upon the other, to have cruſh'd them Both: cutting off thoſe who made uſe of their Liberty, as being wicked Men, by the Teſtimony of the Weak; and oppreſſing the Weak, who, in the Judgment of their Brethren, were a fooliſh and inconſiderable ſort of People? For how mean an Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion muſt the Infidels needs have conceiv'd of that Church, which by the Confeſſion of Chriſtians them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, was made up of <hi>Ignorant</hi> and <hi>Impious</hi> Perſons?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:0402602600:6"/>
Hence it is that St. <hi>Paul,</hi> as a faithful Miniſter of Chriſt, and one who regarded the Salvation of Both Parties, earneſtly exhorts them, in the firſt place, to a mutual Forbearance: <note place="margin">
                     <hi>V.</hi> 5, 10, 12, 13.</note>
                  <hi>Let every Man</hi> (ſays he) <hi>be fully perſwaded in his own Mind: But why doſt thou judge thy Brother? or why doſt thou ſet at nought thy Brother? every one of us ſhall give account of himſelf to God; let us not therefore judge one another any more.</hi> Then he perſwades thoſe, who had a right Notion of Chriſtian Liberty, <hi>not to put it on as a Cloak of Maliciouſneſs, but as the Servants of God</hi> ſo to temper it with Charity, that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regarding Matters of leſſer Moment, they would chiefly mind thoſe things that promote the Glory of God, and the good of Souls. After this he tells them, that by theſe Means the Church would gain to it ſelf Protection from God, and Good-will from Men. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>V.</hi> 16, 17. 18.</note>
                  <hi>Let not then</hi> (ſays he) <hi>your Good be evil ſpoken of; for the Kingdom of God is not Meat and Drink, but Righteouſneſs and Peace, and Joy in the Holy Ghoſt; For he that in theſe things ſerveth Chriſt is acceptable to God, and approved of Men.</hi> And then he ſubjoins the Admonition here in the Text, <hi>Let us therefore follow after the things which make for Peace, and things wherewith one may edifie ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Chriſtian Religion, through the Goodneſs of God, was planted very early in theſe <hi>Britiſh</hi> Iſlands; And the ſame good hand of Divine Providence (to the Glory of God be it ſpoken) has convey'd it down to us, Reform'd in the laſt Age, reſcued from imminent Danger in our Times, and at preſent eſtabliſh'd, and in a flouriſhing Condition. Theſe are ſuch Inſtances of the Divine Favour as cannot be ſufficiently acknowledg'd or proclaim'd. However, the preſent ſtate of our Church is not ſo much better, than that of the <hi>Roman</hi> in the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0402602600:7"/>
Primitive Times, but that this Advice of the Apoſtle may be as applicable to <hi>Us,</hi> as it was to thoſe <hi>Romans.</hi> The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> has ſo far departed from the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Doctrine of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> that having trampled under foot that true Faith, for which that Church was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly ſo famous throughout the whole World, it is now become the bittereſt Enemy of our Pure and Primitive Religion; Heathen <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf not being more invete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate againſt the Firſt Chriſtians, than <hi>Chriſtian Rome</hi> (with Shame be it ſpoken!) is at preſent againſt the modern Aſſerters and Maintainers of that Ancient Faith. It ſeems to be the ſole End and Deſign of the Abetters of that Tyrannical See, either to reduce the Purer Churches of Chriſt to Slavery and Error, or elſe to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpate them by Conſpiracies, War and Bloodſhed. In the mean time, into how many Sects and Parties are <hi>We Proteſtants</hi> crumbled, too ſecure, alas! under all thoſe Dangers that hang over our Heads? With how many Conteſts and Diſputes (many of which are of the ſame nature with thoſe treated of by St. <hi>Paul</hi> in this Epiſtle) are we conſtantly perplexed? And all this while, the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies both of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> and <hi>Reformed</hi> Religion tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph openly; the <hi>One</hi> railing againſt <hi>Religion</hi> it ſelf, as the Source of Contentions; and the <hi>Others</hi> arming <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants</hi> againſt one another, that ſo all of them in their turn may at laſt (without the Interpoſition of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence) fall a Sacrifice to <hi>Roman</hi> Cruelty.</p>
               <p>Not One of us therefore ſingly can imploy his private Thoughts and Endeavours better; nor can All of us to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, who are met in this <hi>Venerable Synod,</hi> direct our joint Wiſhes and Counſels to a nobler End, than <hi>the following thoſe things which make for Peace and mutual Edification.</hi> If we neglect the <hi>Latter,</hi> we ſhall have a Corrupt Church: and if we take no Care of the <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:0402602600:8"/>
we ſhall have a Divided and Weak One, or perhaps None at all.</p>
               <p>Wherefore my main Deſign at preſent is to lay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you, <hi>Fathers</hi> and <hi>Brethren,</hi> theſe things, which are more eſpecially neceſſary, being recommended by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Great Apoſtle; that upon a thorough View of their Weight and Value in the Church, we may all of us be conſtantly ſo far concerned for them, as to ſeek them with our Prayers, promote them by our Counſels, and proſecute them by our Endeavours. And to this End, I ſhall make uſe only of ſuch Arguments as occur to my Thoughts, upon conſidering the Nature of the Things themſelves, and the preſent State of the <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Church.</hi> I ſhall ſpeak firſt of thoſe that relate to <hi>Peace;</hi> and Secondly, of ſuch as belong to <hi>Edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>

                     <hi>Let ſuch an one</hi> (I ſay) <hi>be delivered unto Satan for the deſtruction of the Fleſh, that the Spirit may be ſaved in the Day of the Lord Jeſus; therefore put away from among your ſelves that wicked Perſon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We have too many of ſuch Chriſtians, falſely ſo called, among our ſelves who not only deny the Reſurrection of the Fleſh but even that Chriſt is come in the Fleſh: who do not acknowledge <hi>Father, Son</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> the One True God of the Chriſtians, in whoſe Name we were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized. Some we have, who take away the Merits and Satisfaction of our Saviour: and others, who pretend their own are equal to his. On one ſide we meet with thoſe that reject the Authority of the Scriptures; on the other, with thoſe that make their own Traditions equal with them, and impoſe upon us their private Fictions of Purgatory, worſhipping of Saints and I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0402602600:10"/>
and the Infallibility of the Pope, as Articles of Faith neceſſary to Salvation. Nor is it any Wonder, that the <hi>Manners</hi> of theſe Men are like their <hi>Doctrines.</hi> Hence it is, that the Church of God has been either rent into Factions, or oppreſs'd by a Tyrannical Power; That Magiſtrates have been diveſted of their Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, tho' deriv'd to them from God himſelf: That the Innocent have been exil'd, tortur'd and put to death: And laſtly, that at the Will and Pleaſure of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> Kings have been depos'd, the People robb'd of their Laws and Eſtates, and at laſt maſſacred. But ſuch Doctrines and ſuch Practices can never belong to the Church of God: Nor can any Peace be obſerved with thoſe who teach and avow ſuch things; but the utmoſt Care ought to be taken, that the Peace of the Church be not deſtroyed by their Contrivan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
                  <p>I own indeed, that a Chriſtian Charity is to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercis'd even towards theſe Men, how little ſoever they may deſerve it: and that all Methods ought to be us'd to bring them to a better Mind. 'Tis the part of a good-natur'd Man, and a Chriſtian Paſtor, to convince ſuch Perſons of their Error, to repreſent the Danger they are in, and to admoniſh, exhort and beſeech them to return into the right way. And ſuch of them, who through an invincible Ignorance, or the Prejudice of Education, or the Craftineſs of their Teachers, have been ſo far ſeduc'd, as to do they know not what, may lay claim to a gentler ſort of Uſage. Herein we fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Rule preſcribed us by St. <hi>Jude,</hi> while <note place="margin">Jud. v. 23.</note>
                     <hi>we ſave them with Fear, plucking them out of the Fire,</hi> tho' <hi>hating even the Garment ſpotted by the Fleſh.</hi> Nor is it to be denied, but that a Man, who is a true Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, may in ſome Caſes act in Conjunction with the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0402602600:11"/>
of his Religion: as for Inſtance, in Trade, Civil Offices, the Defence of ones Countrey, and the like: Neither will it be unbecoming us to carry our ſelves peaceably towards them in common Converſation and the Affairs of this Life; for this will make them ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that the Reaſon why we differ from them in Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion, is the Obligation of Conſcience, and not a Humour of Oppoſition. However, they are to be excluded from the Communion of our Church, from partaking with us in our Sacraments, and from joining with us in our Publick Prayers; For neither our Temples, nor the Worſhip of God, are to be prophaned by the Enemies of our Religion: According to that Precept of the Apoſtle, <note place="margin">2 Cor. 6. 14. 15.</note>
                     <hi>Be ye not unequally yok'd toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with Unbelievers: for what Fellowſhip hath Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs with Unrighteouſneſs? and what Communion hath Light with Darkneſs? And what Concord hath Chriſt with Belial? Or what part hath he that believeth with an Infidel?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Apoſtle therefore does not admoniſh us to <hi>follow Peace</hi> with thoſe that ſubvert either the <hi>Faith</hi> or <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi> of Chriſtians; but with ſuch, who, agreeing with Us in the Fundamentals of Religion, are of different Opinions from us in other Matters of leſſer moment. With theſe he perſwades us to maintain as ſtrict an U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion as poſſible, and not to divide into Parties, but to ſtand by one another in a mutual Defence againſt the common Enemies of Chriſtianity. He informs us, that ſuch weak Perſons as theſe, are to be eſteemed as Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren; and that provided the Subſtance of Religion be ſecured, we ſhould not give way to Paſſion and Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, upon the Account of ſome trivial Differences in Opinions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="10" facs="tcp:0402602600:12"/>
But becauſe (as was hinted before) in the ſame Church, ſome may happen to be united to others with more and cloſer Ties than ordinary, we are to conſider what ſort of Peace is to be kept, according to the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of the ſeveral Perſons, with whom it is to be maintained.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In the firſt place then, it certainly becomes <hi>Us,</hi> who are <hi>Paſtors of the ſame Flock,</hi> and <hi>Miniſters attending at the ſame Altar,</hi> not only to be united together by the Bonds of <hi>Peace,</hi> but by the cloſeſt Ties of <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Affection.</hi> By this means we ſhall be the more firm and conſtant in oppoſing the Enemies of our Religion and Function; and teach our reſpective Flocks to demean themſelves after the ſame manner towards All of us, as we behave our ſelves towards one another. For what Thoughts would an Atheiſt, or an Infidel, or a weaker Chriſtian have of the whole Body of the Clergy, if there ſhould ſcarce be found one among them famous for his Writings, his Dignity, or the Poſt he holds in the Church, whom ſome of his Equals do not charge with Ignorance, Craft, or Impiety? And how can it be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected that the People ſhould eſteem us as Pious and Faithful Miniſters of Chriſt, unleſs we our ſelves, who, 'tis reaſonable to ſuppoſe, ſhould know one another beſt, teſtifie to the World, both by Word and Deed, that we have really the ſame Thoughts of one another.</p>
                  <p>The Church of <hi>England,</hi> by the ſpecial Providence of God, has a double Advantage, which the Unhappineſs of the Times in the Beginning of the <hi>Reformation,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied to many of our Neighbours. The One, that <hi>Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy</hi> is preſerved among us; the Other, that our <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination</hi> is in all reſpects perfect, and handed down to us from the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> themſelves. To teſtifie how much
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0402602600:13"/>
we prize the former Advantage, let us honour, reſpect, and obey our Biſhops; and that they may govern and protect us with the Affection of <hi>Fathers,</hi> let us behave our ſelves towards them with the Affection and Duty of <hi>Sons.</hi> If (as it ſometimes happens in Human Affairs) we ſhould engage in any Controverſie with them, let us beware, leſt by any undecent Reflections on their <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,</hi> we vilifie their <hi>Order;</hi> bearing all due Reſpect to the Dignity of their Station, and being fully perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that whatever Diſgrace is caſt upon the <hi>Fathers,</hi> will reflect upon the <hi>Sons.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And that the Chriſtian World may perceive how high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we value our <hi>Ordination,</hi> let us honour and eſteem all thoſe, who have received the ſame Holy Orders with our ſelves: Let us imitate our Anceſtors, on whom the Apoſtles laid their Hands; and let us be animated by the ſame Spirit of mutual Love with which they were, <note place="margin">Rom. 12. 10.</note>
                     <hi>being kindly affectionate one to another with brotherly Love, in honour preferring one another,</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes himſelf. So long as we all preach ſound Doctrine, let us neither envy nor cenſure thoſe, who do it either more or leſs dexterouſly than our ſelves: Nor let us ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count him as an Enemy, who, when his Belief of what God has revealed to us, be the ſame with ours, yet is not ſo happy as to explain himſelf exactly in the ſame Terms with us. But above all things, this Caution is more eſpecially neceſſary, That when we engage in any Controverſie in Divinity, we do not come to it with exaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perated Minds: If any Doubts ariſe, let them be ſeriouſly weighed, accurately diſcuſſed, ſolidly handled; and let Truth be eſtabliſhed by Dint of Argument, not by opprobrious Language. But in caſe (as it often happens) that neither Party can be convinc'd by the force of the Arguments on the other ſide, it will become them
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0402602600:14"/>
Both to conſider, that being Members of a well regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated Church, they ought to lay aſide all Contention and Reflections, and leave the Point in queſtion to be examined and determined by their Superiours. In do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus, we ſhall follow the Apoſtle's Advice: <note place="margin">Eph. 4. 29. 31.</note>
                     <hi>Let no Corrupt Communication proceed out of your Mouth, but that which is good to the uſe of Edifying.</hi>—And again, <hi>Let all Bitterneſs, and Wrath, and Clamour, and Evil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeaking be put away from you, with all Malice.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. For the maintaining ſincere Peace among all thoſe, who profeſs themſelves Sons of our Church, it is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that they, as Members of the ſame Body, ſhould be ſo intimately united, as both to join with their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, and with one another, as well in the Publick Worſhip, as in Brotherly Love. True it is, that the Variety of Cuſtoms, the ſeveral Ways of Living, the particular Conſtitution of our Bodies, and the like, do occaſion Variety of Opinions, and different Modes of Acting in divers Inſtances. One is for leading a Life of Auſterity, whilſt another thinks, that he may take his Freedom in thoſe things that are innocent. Some are for the Exerciſe of a ſeverer Diſcipline towards Offenders, whilſt others would have gentler Methods to be applied. Some are of Opinion, that it would be beſt for the Security of the Church, if thoſe things that are eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed already, remain as they are; and thoſe Perſons be kept at a diſtance from her, who are not fully ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in every Particular: Whilſt others, on the contrary, think it more adviſeable, that things ſhould be varied, according to the Diverſity of Times and Occaſions; That ſome Allowances ſhould be made to Mens Prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and that the Terms of Communion ſhould be enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged for the Reception of Weaker Brethren into the Boſom
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0402602600:15"/>
of the Church. But in theſe and ſuch like Inſtances which are Matters of <hi>Prudence,</hi> rather than <hi>Religion,</hi> we may eaſily bear with one another, whilſt we all hold the ſame Faith, and all make uſe of the ſame Prayers, Sacraments, Worſhip, and Diſcipline. The Church is but little beholden to thoſe Men, who are for excluding out of it All, that cannot in every thing think as they do; and look upon them as Enemies, who are not Friends juſt in their own way. Beſides, there are many things, which God has not been pleas'd to reveal to us: Several others, which perhaps it is our Intereſt to be Ignorant of; and ſome ſtill, wherein we have no Concern on which ſide the Truth lies. In ſuch caſes, if Men differ in their Opinions, it is not to be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd at, nor ought any Offence to be taken from thence. Such Varieties of Opinions ſhould not divide us into Sects and Parties; for the Church ſuffers no real detriment by them. They ſeem to be too fond of Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relling, who upon the Account of ſuch trivial Matters, violate Brotherly Love and Chriſtian Communion.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. There are many <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Churches <hi>Abroad,</hi> who hold the ſame Fundamental Articles of Faith as we do, tho' they make uſe of different Ceremonies and Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline: It were to be wiſh'd, that they were better united among themſelves, and that All of them were in a cloſer Union with the Church of <hi>England,</hi> than hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to they have been; that ſo, tho' diſtant one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Place, and differing in ſome things, yet they might be truly joyn'd together in Chriſtian Peace and Communion. It is indeed to be own'd, that ſome of theſe might rectifie their Sentiments in particular In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances; and 'tis matter of great concern, that ſome others of them are ſo unhappy as to want that <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical</hi>
                     <pb n="14" facs="tcp:0402602600:16"/>
                     <hi>Hierarchy,</hi> which has flouriſh'd down from the Apoſtle's Times: Hence it comes to paſs, that they commonly decline Communion with one another, and if at any time the Members of thoſe Churches happen, in the ſame Places, to meet with the Members of our Church, they do not, without ſome Difficulty, join to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the ſame External Worſhip. And hence ariſes that Alienation of Affections, that Diſunion of Strength, and that unſteady Friendſhip which is to be obſerved among <hi>Proteſtants.</hi> It would certainly be worth our while, and perhaps not unworthy the Thoughts of this Holy Synod, to conſider how we might all become One Body. But by what Means this might be effected, what Abatements or Allowances in order thereunto might be made on either Side, is not Mine, nor any private Man's Province to determine; only thus much we may be allow'd to wiſh, that for the Honour of the <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> and the ſafety of the <hi>Reform'd</hi> Religion, ſuch an Union may ſome time be brought about, and that God in his Mercy would teach all the <hi>Proteſtant Churches</hi> in general, <note place="margin">Luk. xix. 42.</note>
                     <hi>to know at leaſt in this their Day, the things that belong to their</hi> mutual <hi>Peace before they be hid from their Eyes;</hi> that ſo at length that Reproach may be remov'd, which is ſo often caſt upon us by the <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> of our not being the <hi>Sons of Peace,</hi> who cannot tell how to agree even among our ſelves; and that other Means proving ineffectual, we may at laſt be inſtructed by our Misfortunes, with Brotherly Love, and united Force to defend one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther againſt the Subtilty and Power of the Common Enemy; or if at any time (which God prevent) the ſame Calamity ſhould overtake any other of the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Churches, which has in our days befal'n the <hi>French,</hi> that in ſuch caſe the Diſpers'd and Exil'd Brethren,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0402602600:17"/>
may, by a Communion both in <hi>Temporals</hi> and <hi>Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuals,</hi> find their own <hi>Country</hi> and <hi>Church</hi> in every <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Region into which they come.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. But the moſt difficult Queſtion is ſtill behind, <hi>viz.</hi> What ſort of Peace is to be maintain'd with thoſe, who having the ſame Country, Laws, and Religion in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon with us, yet for ſome Reaſons (not proper to be enquired into at preſent) are diſſatisfied with our <hi>Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline</hi> or our <hi>Liturgy,</hi> and upon that account divide into Parties, chooſe themſelves Paſtors, and form themſelves into ſeparate Communions. Their Caſe is different from that of the <hi>Foreign Proteſtants;</hi> theſe Latter would have been glad of our Church Government, if they could have had it; at leaſt they do not condemn it; they are at liberty to uſe their own Cuſtoms and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies; whilſt the Former withdraw themſelves from the Paſtors of their own Church, and oppoſe that Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline which is eſtabliſhed by Lawful Authority.</p>
                  <p>We do indeed maintain ſome ſort of Peace with theſe; for no open War or Perſecution is carry'd on againſt them: And herein the truly laudable Charity and Moderation of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> is made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt to the Chriſtian World; that conſtant Pains are taken, by Preaching, Writing, and Conference, to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie the Weaker of them: And Matters are manag'd with ſo much Gentleneſs towards our <hi>Diſſenting Brethren</hi> that without exaſperating their Minds, we chuſe rather to gain them over into a willing Compliance with <hi>the Meekneſs of Wiſdom;</hi> and yet there are ſtill remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeparate Congregations, diſtinct Paſtors, and a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ſort of Diſcipline. However, it does not ſeem adviſeable, or Chriſtian-like, to caſt off ſo great a Body of our People, as loſt and undone: That they are not
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0402602600:18"/>
as yet paſt reclaiming, is the Opinion of Many good Men, and that they may be reclaim'd is the hearty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of All. Let us therefore put up our Conſtant Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions to the Father of Lights, that he would at laſt vouchſafe to open their Eyes, that they may ſee what a groſs Error they lie under, with what a deep Wound they tear and weaken the Church, and what encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement they give to our Common Enemies, by their Separation.</p>
                  <p>Nor ought we to deſpair, but ſtill to add our farther Endeavours, that, at one time or other, this ſo Pious and Beneficial a Deſign may be accompliſh'd: The happy Day may come, which may produce what an Age has deny'd us; and at laſt a Way be open'd to us, whereby we may ſatisfie the Scruples of the Diſſenters, without prejudicing the Doctrine, Authority, or Diſcipline of the Church; and they may return into the Boſom of their Mother, after too long an Alienation from her: Than which, nothing certainly could be more deſirable to a Chriſtian, or more fortunate to this Church: Then we ſhould have perfect and entire Peace among our ſelves, which is at preſent ſo lamentably broken and diſturb'd by ſeparate Aſſemblies, and mutual Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies.</p>
                  <p>It is not my preſent Buſineſs to enquire, by what Methods this moſt deſirable Peace may be obtain'd: This is to be left to the Piety and Prudence of this Venerable Synod, under the Divine Conduct of the Spirit of Peace, and the Author of Concord, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they ſhall think fit to enter upon the Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe weighty Concerns. Having thus ſhewn what ſort of Peace is to be follow'd, and with whom; all that remains under this Head, is to excite you to
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0402602600:19"/>
a vigorous Proſecution of it: which I cannot do better, than by deſiring you, according to my propoſed Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod,</p>
               </div>
               <div n="2" type="subsection">
                  <p>II. To obſerve of what great Moment this <hi>Peace</hi> is to us, our preſent Circumſtances conſider'd. Now 'tis of ſo great Moment, that almoſt the Whole of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion depends upon it; nor can it rationally be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, according to the preſent State of Affairs, that we ſhould long have any Church at all, but by the means of Unity and Peace. For the confirmation of this, among many other Arguments, which the time does not permit me to run through, I ſhall only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce theſe Four.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> moſt implacable to Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, has never ſhewn her ſelf more eager, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triving our Ruin, both by ſecret Conſpiracies, and open Force, than at this time. I need not tell you what Fury it has exercis'd againſt Some, nor what Arts it makes uſe of againſt Others of the <hi>Reformed Churches;</hi> theſe things are but too manifeſt to every one who reads any thing of the Tranſactions of <hi>Europe.</hi> In <hi>France,</hi> in <hi>Bearne,</hi> and in <hi>Piedmont,</hi> the very Name of <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant</hi> is almoſt extinct; every Day we hear of many in thoſe Places condemn'd to Priſons, to Gallies, and to Tortures; the reſt who have made their Eſcape, are reduc'd to live upon Charity, and compell'd to ſeek new Places of Abode, either here or elſewhere. Nor are we ignorant of the Danger which threatens the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants of the <hi>Palatinate, Hungary,</hi> and <hi>Tranſylvania:</hi> By theſe Diſaſters we have loſt Some of the Reformed Churches, and from theſe Dangers we are in fear for Others. And if once the Ruin of thoſe Remoter
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0402602600:20"/>
Churches ſhall be totally accompliſh'd, This of ours will become an eaſie Prey to the Tyranny of <hi>Rome:</hi> Nor can we otherwiſe be ſafe, unleſs with united Force we make ſo vigorous an Oppoſition, as to let our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies know, that, whilſt they exerciſe their Cruelty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards our Brethren, we look upon it as if done to our ſelves.</p>
                  <p>That ſuch a <hi>Peace</hi> and intimate Union among <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants</hi> is highly neceſſary, is what hardly any one can be inſenſible of; but ſome perhaps will be apt to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, that now 'tis too late: and ſo it is to be fear'd it will be, if in ſuch a weighty Concern we do not take ſome early Care. Let us then be prevail'd upon, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out delay, to do our Part towards the attaining of this End, that by being at Peace among our ſelves, we may open a Way to an <hi>Univerſal Peace.</hi> If ever, by the Providence of God, the Churches Abroad ſhould unite, one may very fairly ſuppoſe, that ſuch a Thing would hardly be done, but by the Mediation of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> but how ſhall others make uſe of our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels for the Compoſing their Differences, if we can find out no Remedy to our own? <note place="margin">Gal. v. 14, 15.</note>
                     <hi>All the Law,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, and all our Safety, <hi>is fulfilled in one Word, Thou ſhalt love thy Neighbour as thy ſelf: but if,</hi> inſtead of mutual Love, <hi>we bite and devour one another, let us take heed, that we be not conſumed one of another,</hi> and all of us together by our Common Enemy. <note place="margin">Matt. xii. 25.</note>
                     <hi>For every Kingdom divided againſt it ſelf, is brought to Deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation; and every City or Houſe divided againſt it ſelf ſhall not ſtand.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The <hi>Faith</hi> it ſelf is endanger'd by mutual Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and whilſt warm Debates, and angry Diſputes are carry'd on among Brethren about the Punctilio's of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0402602600:21"/>
Religion, the Blow really, tho' not deſignedly, falls up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Religion it ſelf. It often happens, that they who believe one and the ſame Article of Faith, do differ in their manner of explaining it; and whilſt Both are pleas'd with their own Explanation, One contends that it cannot be True in the others way of Expreſſing it, and the other, that it muſt be true his way or not at all; in the mean time, the Enemies of Religion, bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing Arguments from each Party, do infer, that it muſt be certainly Falſe, and cannot be at all. Thus whilſt ſome contend about the Shadow, they occaſion others to loſe the Subſtance. It would certainly be much better, when the Subſtance of our Doctrine is the ſame, to be leſs ſolicitous about other Matters; for whilſt we are agreed in thoſe things, which God himſelf teaches, it is not becoming either a Modeſt Man, or a Chriſtian, to contend eagerly about his own Illuſtrations. Let the Enemies of our Faith rather perceive, that we aim not at our Own, but at the Glory of God; and that we never fall out with thoſe, who, together with our ſelves, embrace the Scripture Revelation, upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of our own private Opinions.</p>
                  <p>But from theſe Contentions, if they happen among Paſtors themſelves, a farther danger ariſes to the Faith: For we know that Religion is planted, increaſes, and flouriſhes by their Care and Labours; and that the greater eſteem Men have for them, the more eaſily will they be perſwaded by them: Now if they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves charge each other with Ignorance and Error, what elſe can be the Iſſue, but that the People mov'd by theſe Reflections, will deſpiſe or hate them, and by degrees fall from deſpiſing the Paſtor, to contemn Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion it ſelf? It would certainly be more adviſeable, for Both Sides to conſult their Mutual Honour and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation;

and if there ſhould be a Miſtake in any caſe, to conceal it rather, than by expoſing the Weakneſs of particular Perſons, to fruſtrate the Succeſs of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Endeavours.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Unleſs we maintain <hi>Peace,</hi> farewel to Diſcipline and Good-Manners, without which the Church can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſtand long; for whilſt Factions prevail, Juſtice, for fear it ſhould ſeem to be ſeverer on one ſide than the other, is apt to proceed too timerouſly; and ill Men either conceal their Vices in the Miſt of Contention, or if they be too manifeſt to be conceal'd, then they ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter 'em by their Zeal for one of the contending Parties. Whilſt the Quarrel on both Sides is manag'd with an immoderate Heat, neither Party examines of what Life or Faith the Men of their own Side are, but only how they ſtand affected towards the Party: Nor is there any concern, whether they be Good Men or no, but only whether they be on our Side. But if theſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions are heighten'd into Schiſms, the Caſe is ſtill worſe, for then the worſt of Men, even the Corrupters of our Faith and Manners, by leaving one Communion for another, as occaſion ſerves, equally eſcape the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of all. But what ſort of Manners can we expect where there is no Diſcipline? and what ſort of Face is the Church like to have, when 'tis ſtain'd with corrupt Manners? How valuable ſoever a pure Faith is, yet a pure Life will be always brighter, and more eſteem'd. Vices pollute the Soil in which they grow, nor will any Church preſerve its Honour, whoſe Members are <hi>Chriſtians</hi> by <hi>Name,</hi> but <hi>Infidels</hi> in <hi>Practice.</hi> Peace therefore is to be follow'd, that we may proſecute Vice; and Friendſhip maintain'd among Good Men, that we may turn our whole Force againſt Impiety, an Enemy
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0402602600:23"/>
both to the Salvation of our Souls, and to the Peace of the Church. For neither can a Church flouriſh or be ſecure, unleſs Care be taken of Mens Manners, nor can there be any Regulation of Manners, unleſs Peace be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. By the Loſs of <hi>Peace,</hi> we, together with it, loſe <hi>Edification:</hi> For there is no room for Perſwaſion in the midſt of Heat and Paſſion: Nor do thoſe, whoſe Minds are poſſeſt with the Prejudices of contending Parties, eaſily attend to him that preaches Faith in Chriſt, or Piety towards God, or the Love of Vertue. When Paſſion is laid, the Underſtanding is more apt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Truth, and the Will is the more eaſily moved by the weight of Arguments. If one ſide is angry, ſo is the other; nor does either of them conſider what becomes Themſelves, but what may prejudice their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries. There is therefore need of Peace, both for the Planting Faith in our Minds, and alſo for promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Fruits of Faith, Integrity of Life, and the Care of our Souls. Conformable to this, is what we meet with in Scripture, <note place="margin">Act. ix. 31.</note>

Nor can the Church it ſelf, in the midſt of perpetual Storms, hold out always againſt the Violence of the Waves: It muſt ſometimes come into Port to refit; it will want frequent Repair, to ſecure it from Shipwreck; and the Care and Vigilance of the <hi>Builder</hi> muſt be conſtantly

               <p>II. This <hi>Edification</hi> has a regard to two things, <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Manners,</hi> both of them abſolutely neceſſary to our Salvation.

To call in queſtion the Doctrines of the Goſpel, to throw aſide all Revelation as a Cheat; nay, to deny the Exiſtence of God, or, which amounts to the ſame thing, to diſown his Providence; is grown ſo faſhiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that thoſe who openly do ſo, are no longer (as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly they were) looked upon as Monſters.

Our Force and Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage is rather to be rallied under ſuch an imminent Danger; and it will be our Duty, as becomes the Soldiers of Chriſt, to find out, attempt, and execute, to the utmoſt of our Power, whatever may reduce Men to a ſounder Mind, and to the Communion of the Church.</p>
                  <p>For the more remiſs we are in defending the <hi>Faith,</hi> the more will the Enemies and Corrupters of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion exalt themſelves; the more ſecurely will Satan, the Betrayer of Man's Salvation, ſow his Tares in the Field of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and it may be at laſt juſt with God, in Judgment to take away from us that Faith, which we have been ſo negligent in keeping; and the Light of the Goſpel being removed, to ſuffer this ungrateful Nation to fall back again into the Darkneſs of <hi>Infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> or <hi>Popery.</hi>

How ſucceſsfully this was done in the late Times, when <hi>Popery</hi> was growing upon us, and upon other Occaſions, we have found by Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, to the great Honour of our Clergy, and to the Good of the Church.</p>

And all theſe things, by the Bleſſing of God, are generally practiſed among us, both to the Good of Souls, and the Honour of this Church. One thing is ſtill to be wiſh'd (and how it might be obtained, I leave to the Judgment and Prudence of my Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours,) <hi>viz.</hi> that ſome Method may be found out, whereby all thoſe who are Eminent for their Birth, Station or Wealth, may be obliged to inſtill betimes theſe important Matters into the Minds of their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and to inſtruct them throughly, as they grow up, in the Chriſtian Religion; to teach them what the Articles of our Faith are, on what Foundations they are built, and by what Arguments defended a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Atheiſts, Hereticks and Infidels. For the Riſe and Growth of our Misfortune is chiefly owing to this, that theſe young Gentlemen (except ſome few, on whom the Care of their Parents, or the Diſcipline of an Univerſity, beſtow a more happy Education) neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting the Buſineſs of Religion, conform themſelves to the Manners of the Age; and being furniſhed with a little humane Learning, or rendred more confident by a Smattering in Philoſophy, think it genteel to doubt of Sacred Truths, to laugh at Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and to form each for himſelf a new, or no Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, as the Fancy takes him. From theſe the Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction deſcends to the People; for they are the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, whom when <hi>young,</hi> thoſe of the ſame Age imitate, and whom when <hi>grown up,</hi> All Men make their court to. God grant that ſome ſuitable Remedy may be applied to this Unhappineſs; that Religion may not be run down chiefly by thoſe, who are more indebted to God than others, by whoſe Authority the Vulgar ought to
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0402602600:28"/>
be kept within the Bounds of their Duty, and by whoſe Example they ſhould be taught to lead regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Lives, and to reverence things Sacred.</p>

                  <p>II. The Second, and withal the moſt neceſſary Part of <hi>Edification,</hi> is that which relates to <hi>Manners.</hi> For let our Faith be never ſo Sound and Orthodox, if in our Manners we act counter thereto, our Church will never be eſteemed as truly Chriſtian. All Men cannot pretend to judge of Opinions; but all may be Judges of our Lives. The wiſer ſort may perhaps come over to us for the ſake of Truth; but to win over the Vulgar, we muſt adorn the Purity of our Doctrine by Integrity of Life. 'Tis true indeed, in the Reformation of Manners, we are to ſtruggle with a very corrupt Age: But the more corrupt the Age is, the more Occaſion is there for us to endeavour in the firſt Place, that things may not grow worſe; and then, that they may alter for the better. Nor can we beſtow our Pains on a Work more accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to God, more becoming our ſelves, or more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial to our Flocks. The Church of <hi>England</hi> was reformed by our Anceſtors from the Corruptions of <hi>Popery</hi> in Matters of <hi>Faith.</hi> How much will it be for our Glory, to be inſtrumental in tranſmitting it down to Poſterity, purg'd at laſt from a <hi>Practice</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuitable to its <hi>Doctrine!</hi>

                  <p>But that theſe our Attempts may meet with a happy Iſſue, Endeavours ought to be uſed,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Diſcipline</hi> may be reſtored; that we may obtain this Favour at leaſt of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0402602600:29"/>
Power, that they would not weaken, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtrengthen our Hands, whilſt they are employed in promoting the Publick Safety. For the Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which we labour under, both in <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi> is to be imputed to the Loſs of our Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That we procure as far as may be, good Laws to be enacted againſt publick and ſcandalous Vices eſpecially; and that ſuch Men may be afraid of the Civil Sword, who do not ſtand in awe of the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the Church.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That Magiſtrates be excited to add Life to the Laws already in force againſt ill Manners, by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them into Execution; that they may not by their Remiſſneſs ſuffer Vice to grow headſtrong, whilſt the Remedy grows weak.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That we conſtantly ſhew the People the Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a Holy Life, in our Diſcourſes, Writings, and Preaching; and fully convince them, that there is no hope of Pardon without a ſincere Repentance; nor any way to Salvation, but by Holineſs of Life.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall add only this one thing more, which is of the higheſt Importance; That the Clergy would by their Examples give Life and Strength to all theſe things, and ſtir up the People committed to their Charge, by ſhewing, that themſelves are concerned for theſe weighty Matters, not only in their Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but in their Hearts and Practice. Nothing will
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0402602600:30"/>
have a greater Influence upon the Common People to incline them to perform all the Parts of a good Life, <hi>Piety</hi> towards God, <hi>Obedience</hi> towards the King, <hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Charity</hi> towards their Neighbours, and <hi>Sobriety</hi> and <hi>Modeſty</hi> towards themſelves, than the perceiving that all theſe Duties are not only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended by the Diſcourſes of their Paſtors, but viſibly propoſed to our Imitation in their Lives and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>

2. That we ſtill may preſerve that Reputation of <hi>Loyalty</hi> towards our <hi>King,</hi> for which the Church of <hi>England</hi> has been ſo famous throughout the whole World.

May there not be met with in the Annals of Poſterity, any Inſtance of a more grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and Dutiful Clergy. We are ſufficiently ſenſible of the Envy of ill Men, and have found by Experience, that there are ſome who would have us paſs for ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected Perſons, and ſuch as have not a ſteady affection for the Government: Let us, by an open-hearted Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty and Obedience, ſtop the Mouths of theſe Malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Perſons, and let it appear, that they are only the Enemies of Religion it ſelf, who calumniate the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of our Religion, as defective in their Love, Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and Duty to their Prince.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That we may recommend <hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Mutual Love</hi> to our People, it is to be wiſh'd, that we may always demean our ſelves juſtly and affectionately one towards another; that we who are <hi>Sons,</hi> may be ready to pay all due Obedience and Honour to our <hi>Fathers in Chriſt;</hi> and that the <hi>Fathers</hi> themſelves may not oppreſs thoſe who are under them, but govern them with Kindneſs and Lenity, <note place="margin">1 Pet. v. 3.</note>
                  <hi>Not as being Lords over God's Heritage, but being enſamples to the Flock:</hi> That if at any time it ſhall happen, that we meet and conſult together in one Body, Matters may be diſcuſſed calmly and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberately, without Noiſe or Clamour; and that it may be evident, that the ſole Good of the Church, not

               <p n="4">4. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Let us beſeech God, that he would vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe to grant us All the ſpecial Grace of his Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, that Sobriety, Modeſty, Temperance, and the Contempt of Worldly Things may ſhine forth in us; that our Flocks may be convinced, that we are heartily ſolicitous about our own Souls, and are not over-fond of this World, whilſt we preach to them of another to come, but that <note place="margin">1 Cor. 9. 27.</note>
