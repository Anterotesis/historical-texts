            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <lg>
                  <l>DEAR Mother, my Time has been wretchedly ſpent</l>
                  <l>With a Gripe or a Hickup wherever I went,</l>
                  <l>My Stomach all ſwell'd, till I thought it would burſt,</l>
                  <l>Sure never poor Mortal with Wind was ſo curſt!</l>
                  <l>If ever I ate a good Supper at Night,</l>
                  <l>I dream'd of the Devil, and wak'd in a Fright:</l>
                  <l>And ſo as I grew ev'ry Day worſe and worſe,</l>
                  <l>The Doctor advis'd me to ſend for a Nurſe;</l>
                  <l>And the Nurſe was ſo willing my Health to reſtore,</l>
                  <l>She beg'd me to ſend for a few Doctors more;</l>
                  <l>For when any difficult Work's to be done,</l>
                  <l>Many Heads can diſpatch it much ſooner than one;</l>

                     <pb n="26" facs="tcp:0100300600:25"/>And I find there are Doctors enough at this Place,</l>
                  <l>If you want to conſult in a dangerous Caſe.</l>
                  <l>So they all met together, and thus began talking:</l>
                  <l>"Good Doctor, I'm your's—'tis a fine Day for walking—</l>
                  <l>"Sad News in the Papers—G-d knows who's to blame—</l>
                  <l>"The Colonies ſeem to be all in a Flame—</l>
                  <l>"This Stamp-Act, no doubt, might be good for the Crown—</l>
                  <l>"But I ſear 'tis a Pill that will never go down—</l>
                  <l>"What can <hi>Portugal</hi> mean?—is <hi>She</hi> going to ſtir up</l>
                  <l>"Convulſions and Heats in the Bowels of <hi>Europe?</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>"'Twill be fatal if <hi>England</hi> relapſes again</l>
                  <l>"From the ill Blood and Humours of <hi>Bourbon</hi> and <hi>Spain.</hi>"—</l>
                  <l>Says I, my good Doctors, I can't underſtand</l>
                  <l>Why the Deuce ye take ſo many Patients in Hand,</l>
                  <l>Ye've a great deal of Practice, as far as I find;</l>
                  <l>But ſince ye're come hither, do pray be ſo kind</l>
                  <l>To write me down ſomething that's good for the Wind.</l>
                  <l>No Doubt ye are all of ye great Politicians,</l>
                  <l>But at preſent <hi>my Bowels</hi> have need of Phyſicians:</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="27" facs="tcp:0100300600:26"/>Conſider my Caſe in the Light it deſerves,</l>
                  <l>And pity the State of my Stomach and Nerves.—</l>
                  <l>But a tight little Doctor began a Diſpute</l>
                  <l>About Adminiſtrations, NEW—LE and B—E,</l>
                  <l>Talk'd much of Oeconomy, much of Proſuſeneſs.—</l>
                  <l>Says another— "This Caſe, which at firſt was a Looſeneſs,</l>
                  <l>"Is become a Teneſmus, and all we can do</l>
                  <l>"Is to give him a gentle Cathartic or two;</l>
                  <l>"Firſt get off the Phlegm that adheres to the <hi>Plicae,</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>"Then throw in a Med'cine that's pretty and ſpicy,—</l>
                  <l>"A Peppermint Draught,—or a—Come, let's be gone,</l>
                  <l>"We've another bad Caſe to conſider at One."</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>So thus they bruſh'd off, each his Cane at his Noſe,</l>
                  <l>When JENNY came in, who had heard all their Proſe:</l>
                  <l>I'll teach them, ſays ſhe, at their next Conſultation,</l>
                  <l>To come and take Fees for the Good of the Nation.</l>
                  <l>I could not conceive what the Devil ſhe mean't,</l>
                  <l>But ſhe ſeiz'd all the Stuff that the Doctor had ſent,</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="28" facs="tcp:0100300600:27"/>And out of the Window ſhe flung it down ſouſe,</l>
                  <l>As the firſt Politician went out of the Houſe.</l>
                  <l>Decoctions and Syrups around him all flew,</l>
                  <l>The Pill, Bolus, Julep, and Apozem too;</l>
                  <l>His Wig had the Luck a Cathartic to meet,</l>
                  <l>And ſquaſh went the Gallipot under his Feet.</l>
                  <l>She ſaid 'twas a Shame I ſhould ſwallow ſuch Stuff</l>
                  <l>When my Bowels were weak, and the Phyſic ſo rough;</l>
                  <l>Declar'd ſhe was ſhock'd that ſo many ſhould come</l>
                  <l>To be Doctor'd to Death, ſuch a Diſtance from Home,</l>
                  <l>At a Place where they tell you that Water alone</l>
                  <l>Can cure all Diſtempers that ever were known.</l>
                  <l>But what is the pleaſanteſt Part of the Story,</l>
                  <l>She has order'd for Dinner a Piper and Dory;</l>

                  <l>That worthy Acquaintance of JENNY's and mine.</l>
                  <l>'Tis a Shame to the Army, that Men of ſuch Spirit</l>
                  <l>Should never obtain the Reward of their Merit,</l>
                  <l>For the Captain's as gallant a Man, I'll be ſworn,</l>
                  <l>And as honeſt a Fellow as ever was born;</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="29" facs="tcp:0100300600:28"/>After ſo many Hardſhips and Dangers incurr'd,</l>
                  <l>He Himſelf thinks He ought to be better preferr'd;</l>
                  <l>And ROGER, or what is his Name, NICODEMUS,</l>
                  <l>Appears full as kind, and as much to eſteem us;</l>
                  <l>Our PRUDENCE declares he's an excellent Preacher,</l>
                  <l>And by Night and by Day is ſo good as to teach her;</l>
                  <l>His Doctrine ſo ſound with ſuch Spirit he gives,</l>
                  <l>She ne'er can forget it as long as ſhe lives.</l>
                  <l>I told you before that He's often ſo kind</l>
                  <l>As to go out a riding with PRUDENCE behind,</l>
                  <l>So frequently dines here without any preſſing,</l>
                  <l>And now to the Fiſh he is giving his Bleſſing;</l>
                  <l>And as that is the Caſe, tho' I've taken a Griper,</l>
                  <l>I'll venture to peck at the Dory and Piper.</l>

                  <l>Since the City-Muſicians ſo tickled my Ear;</l>
                  <l>For when we arriv'd here at <hi>Bath</hi> t'other Day,</l>

                  <l>THIS Morning, dear Mother, as ſoon as 'twas light,</l>
                  <l>I was wak'd by a Noiſe that aſtoniſh'd me quite,</l>

                  <l>I could not conceive what the Deuce was the Matter:</l>
                  <l>And, would you believe it? I went up and found her</l>
                  <l>In a Blanket, with two luſty Fellows around her,</l>
                  <l>Who both ſeem'd a going to carry her off in</l>

                  <l>Pray tell me, ſays I, what ye're doing of there?</l>
                  <l>"Why, Maſter, 'tis hard to be bilk'd of our Fare,</l>
                  <l>"And ſo we were thruſting her into a Chair:</l>

                     <pb n="37" facs="tcp:0100300600:36"/>"We don't ſee no Reaſon for uſing us ſo,</l>

                  <l>"We're earn'd all the Fare, for we both came and knock'd her</l>
                  <l>"Up, as ſoon as 'twas light, by Advice of the Doctor;</l>

                  <l>''Tis all by the Doctor's Advice, I ſuppoſe,</l>
                  <l>'That Nothing is left to be ſeen but your Noſe:</l>

                  <l>'I'll juſt ſtep and ſee you jump into the Bath.'</l>
                  <l>So they hoiſted her down juſt as ſafe and as well</l>
                  <l>And as ſnug as a Hod'mandod rides in his Shell:</l>
                  <l>I fain would have gone to ſee TABITHA dip,</l>
                  <l>But they turn'd at a Corner and gave me the Slip,</l>
                  <l>Yet in ſearching about I had better Succeſs,</l>
                  <l>For I got to a Place where the Ladies undreſs;</l>

                  <l>So I peep'd at the Door, and I ſaw a great Mat</l>
                  <l>That cover'd a Table, and got under that,</l>
                  <l>And laid myſelf down there, as ſnug and as ſtill</l>

                  <l>How the Ladies did giggle and ſet up their Clacks,</l>

                  <l>Oh 'twas pretty to ſee them all put on their Flannels,</l>
                  <l>And then take the Water like ſo many Spaniels,</l>
                  <l>And tho' all the while it grew hotter and hotter,</l>
                  <l>They ſwam, juſt as if they were hunting an Otter;</l>

                  <l>In a great ſmoaking Kettle as big as our Hall:</l>
                  <l>And To-Day many Perſons of Rank and Condition</l>
                  <l>Were boil'd by Command of an able Phyſician,</l>

                  <l>Thank Heaven of late, my dear Mother, my Face is</l>
                  <l>Not a little regarded at all public Places;</l>
                  <l>For I ride in a Chair with my Hands in a Muff,</l>
                  <l>And have bought a Silk Coat and embroidered the Cuff;</l>
                  <l>But the Weather was cold, and the Coat it was thin,</l>
                  <l>So the Taylor advis'd me to line it with Skin:</l>
                  <l>But what with my <hi>Nivernois'</hi> Hat can compare,</l>
                  <l>Bag-Wig, and lac'd Ruffles, and black Solitair?</l>
                  <l>And what can a Man of true Faſhion denote,</l>
                  <l>Like an Ell of good Ribbon ty'd under the Throat?</l>
                  <l>My Buckles and Box are in exquiſite Taſte;</l>
                  <l>The one is of Paper, the other of Paſte;</l>

                  <l>For To-night I'm to dance with the charming Miſs TOZIER:</l>
