            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>HAVING had the honour of being appointed preacher of the <hi>Bampton Lectures</hi> for the current year, by the Heads of Colleges in Oxford, I have the happineſs to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them to the Public with the additional great advantage of your Grace's protection; an advantage the more conſiderable, as it derives as much from the character, as the rank of my patron.</p>

In this ſituation it will, I preſume, become me to addreſs your Grace ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther under the form of preface than in the ſtyle of dedication.</p>
            <p>My ſlender pretenſions to your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour are grounded in the earneſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour of the following ſheets fully and circumſtantially to vindicate that faith which, I need not tell your Grace, is not barely attacked, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted every day. The Charity which <hi>is not eaſily provoked</hi> muſt reſent the freedom, I had almoſt ſaid the audacity which diſtinguiſhes the infidels of the preſent generation. Theſe Gentlemen affect to be the party aggrieved; and to conſole themſelves at the ſame time with a hope, and ſometimes a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion of the ſpeedy abolition of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions and ſyſtems, and, in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:1123800600:5"/>
of it, the revival of evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal doctrine in its native ſimplicity.</p>
            <p>I cannot think opinions openly and arrogantly hoſtile to the national eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabliſhment can be juſtified even by their ſincerity. But infidelity in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral is without this excuſe: it has been repeatedly ſhewn to draw its principal reſources from the vigilance of captiouſneſs, the popularity of profeſſion, the artifice of diſſimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the confuſion of things not really connected, and the occaſional ſuppreſſion, or adulteration of truth. To theſe I am ſorry, for our own ſakes, to add the inconſiſtency be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween certain controverſial terms, and the imprudence, or unwarineſs of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion. Such reſources as theſe are indeed inexhauſtible. Mr. <hi>Bampton</hi>'s wiſe and pious inſtitution, and every

However, my Lord, I flatter myſelf I have happily choſen more advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous ground than many of my fellow-ſoldiers in this warfare; to whoſe names on other accounts I look up with deference and venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. After all, the event muſt be left in the hands of Providence. I have only to beg the favour of the intelligent reader to peruſe theſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes and the annexed annotations, (which will be equally neceſſary,) with an inclination to be ſatisfied; and in that ſpirit of candor and impartiallity with which, I truſt, he will find them to have been compoſed. I requeſt his attention throughout the performance, and reaſonable allowances for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accuracy,
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:1123800600:9"/>
or inequality that may be diſcovered in it. I hope he will be biaſſed, not by ſpeciouſneſs of princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, or habit of attachment, but by preponderance of argument. I ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it to his judgment, whether I have in any inſtance ſhewn an undue warmth, or unwarrantable reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and deſire him finally to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine, as he ſhall upon the whole be perſuaded, not of the abilities of the advocate, but the merits of the cauſe. Open to conviction myſelf, I ſhall always be ready to rectify an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, or to renounce an opinion, on competent repreſentation; but ſhall not pay the leaſt regard to any cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure or animadverſion, the features of which ſhall manifeſtly betray it to be the offspring of prepoſſeſſion, chagrin, or malevolence.</p>

               <p>I direct and appoint, that, upon the firſt Tueſday in Eaſter Term, a Lecturer be yearly choſen by the Heads of Colleges only, and by no others, in the room ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joining to the Printing-Houſe, between

               <p>Alſo I direct and appoint, that the eight Divinity Lecture Sermons ſhall be preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon either of the following ſubjects—to confirm and eſtabliſh the Chriſtian Faith, and to confute all heretics and ſchiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matics—upon the divine authority of the Holy Scriptures—upon the authority of the writings of the primitive Fathers, as to the faith and practice of the primitive Church—upon the Divinity of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt—upon the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the Holy Ghoſt—upon the Articles of the Chriſtian Faith, as comprehended in the Apoſtles' and Nicene Creeds.</p>
               <p>Alſo I direct, that thirty copies of the eight Divinity Lecture Sermons ſhall be always printed, within two months after they are preached, and one copy ſhall be given to the Chancellor of the Univerſity, and one copy to the Head of every Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege,

            </epigraph>
            <p>THIS queſtion, of all by far the moſt important, was put to our bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour by the <hi>Roman Governour,</hi> perhaps care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſly, perhaps contemptuouſly, but certainly without the leaſt wiſh for information. In much the ſame ſpirit of ſcorn, or with ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar indifference, the ſame queſtion is every day in the mouths, ſometimes of ſceptics and ſcoffers, and ſometimes of men of a more ſerious caſt, who affect to be perſuaded that we cannot, and, it may be, deſire not to give them ſatisfaction. Unhappily, the Chriſtian world is divided and ſubdivided almoſt infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely;
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:1123800600:15"/>
it is parcelled out into ſectaries of a thouſand denominations. The fact is, though the right of private judgment in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of religion, which has been exerciſed from the beginning, was juſtly and neceſſarily aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted by the leaders and friends of the RE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FORMATION, it muſt be acknowledged, folly, perverſeneſs, pride, and enthuſiaſm, have, by ſeverally maintaining it, been productive of that ſtrange multiplicity of religious ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which we have ſo much cauſe to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; of that ſchiſm, hereſy, ſcepticiſm, and infidelity, which have all along diſturbed the Church, but fix a mark of peculiar diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace on the laſt and preſent century.</p>
            <p>And indeed, when it is conſidered, that the Scriptures are on many accounts particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly liable to be miſapplied, perverted, or miſconſtrued; <hi>(a)</hi> that ſome paſſages are to be underſtood in a literal, and ſome in a figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſenſe; that ſome things are expreſſed agreeably to the modes of common ſpeech, and ſome in pure condeſcenſion to the human capacity; that paſſages are to be compared
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:1123800600:16"/>
with each other in order to a true underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them, and doctrines to be deduced, not ſo much from ſingle and ſeparate texts, as from the manifeſt tenor of the Scriptures at large; that not unfrequently one and the ſame text ſhall be capable of different, and even oppoſite conſtruction; that though moſt places in holy writ are of univerſal im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, yet ſome are of temporary and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſional purport only; that the ſacred writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, ſtrictly ſpeaking, are the foundation of a rule of faith and manners, ſuch as a creed, formulary, or confeſſion, rather than the rule itſelf, as will, I truſt, in due time more fully appear; and that an aſſent to the collective body of ſcripture, as true, does not imply a knowlege, or belief of all ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural truths; when all this, to which more, were there occaſion, might be added, is fairly conſidered, we cannot poſſibly be at a loſs to account for that variety of notion, that wild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and abſurdity of conceit, that extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance, or impiety of opinion, which I juſt now obſerved has more or leſs ſo ſhamefully diſhonoured the Chriſtian name in all ages.
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:1123800600:17"/>
Of this exuberance of folly and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs Popery has ever been induſtrious to avail itſelf. From the acknowledged liableneſs of the Scriptures to the groſſeſt abuſe, when in the hands of ſuch as are <hi>unlearned</hi> and <hi>unſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> (to uſe the apoſtle's words,) the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> draws her moſt ſpecious argument againſt the common uſe of them; and would fain have us infer the neceſſity, or the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of an infallible authority lodged in the Church for the deciſion of controverſies, and aſcertainment of a rule of faith, from the confeſſed convenience and utility of ſuch an authority. <hi>(b)</hi> But, unfortunately for her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions, as much error and abſurdity has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peatedly been demonſtrated to be within her pale as out of it. <hi>Wh t is truth?</hi> becomes therefore with many a queſtion of as much difficulty as importance; or, rather, of more form than importance; ſome encouraging themſelves in ſcepticiſm from theſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, and others blindly acquieſcing in any mode of religion, or in none at all, or at beſt in that which is uſually called natural religion, from a pretence of the utter impoſſibility of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:1123800600:18"/>
diſcovering the true under ſuch a complica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of perplexity.</p>
            <p>With points of inferior conſequence I ſhall not trouble myſelf; but to ſuch as deny, or call in queſtion the capital articles of our religion on the ſtrength of the above conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, let me inſiſt that nothing of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ought to ſuperſede their endeavours to find the truth, and much leſs to diſcourage their obedience to it when found. After inquiry we may in ſome reſpect or other be miſtaken, but without it we are inexcuſable. In fact, the very diverſity, or contrariety complained of may be juſtly urged in behalf of the faith which is received in the Church. Were the doctrine of the Trinity, for inſtance, impugned from one quarter only, and by conſiſtent and uniform oppoſition, infidelity would be a much more formidable thing than it is; but you may as well look for <hi>one language</hi> at <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel</hi> as for a catholic ſyſtem of unbelief, if I may be indulged with the expreſſion. To enumerate all the hereſies which have at different times torn and diſmembered the

Too true indeed it is that the principal controverted points ſubſiſting among thoſe "who profeſs and call themſelves Chriſtians" are of the moſt ſerious nature. If the tenets of our gainſayers and adverſaries of many ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellations are right and juſt, the doctrines of the Trinity, and of the reſurrection of the body, (which will be the objects of the enſuing diſquiſitions,) are hereſies of the moſt abominable, or ridiculous tendency. However, theſe are circumſtances which ſhould not check, but ſtimulate the ſpirit of inveſtigation.

            <p>Complaints againſt the damnatory clauſes of the <hi>Athanaſian</hi> Creed, as it is commonly called, reverberate from more quarters than one.

It is plain theſe clauſes are to be conſidered as ſimply declarative on ſcriptural grounds of the neceſſity both of faith and of good works to ſalvation; and at the ſame time as leaving all men to that infinite mercy, and thoſe ineſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timable merits, which are fully adequate to the pardon and atonement of ſins, failings, ignorances, and errors of integrity. <hi>(c)</hi> Which few conſiderations will, I apprehend, fairly deliver the Creed before us from the reproach of uncharitableneſs. With regard to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral articles of which it conſiſts, I truſt, they will be found, in the courſe of theſe diſquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to have foundation in a fully competent authority; and in the mean time I ſhall endeavour to remove one general prejudice againſt them, and to create rather a prepoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion in their favour, by evincing, that their acknowleged myſteriouſneſs and incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſibility does by no means unqualify them for our aſſent.</p>
            <p>"Man is as ſuch a rational creature;" and as a rational creature he is a believing one too. We can no more conceive him to be

without belief, than without ſenſe, thought, or reflection. The Atheiſt who <hi>ſays in his heart,</hi> as well as with his lips, <hi>there is no God,</hi> believes there is none. He proteſts againſt the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed folly, or extravagance of the fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal article of all religion; and on the ſtrength of falſe concluſions, reſolves every thing into a concourſe of atoms fortuitouſly uniting; or into the operation of an unintelligent prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple which we call nature; or, in other words, into an everlaſting ſucceſſion of cauſes and effects. It is poſſible for a man to deny his own exiſtence, or that there is any ſuch thing as motion. We have heard of inſtances of this ſort; though properly they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, not of falſe perſuaſion, but of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanity. <hi>(d)</hi> Still man is a rational creature, whether he reaſons well or ill; and whether, in conſequence of ſuch reaſoning, his faith be well or ill grounded.

This will readily be granted even by infidels who deny the truths of Revelation; and much more by ſuch Chriſtians as have
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:1123800600:31"/>
called into debate particular points of that Revelation, to which in general they profeſs to ſubſcribe. It is well worth remarking that Deiſts and Heretics never fail to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack the profeſſed atheiſt with ſuch reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, as, if purſued through their juſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences, may fairly and ſucceſsfully be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced upon themſelves. For if <hi>he</hi> affects to decry the fundamental principle of all reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, the Being of a God, on account of the pretended inconceivableneſs of it, will not <hi>they</hi> obſerve, in order to confute him, that, unleſs a more complete, a more uniform, and intelligible ſyſtem could be built on the ruins of this great article, ſuch his exception can have no weight? And this is the very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning we urge againſt the principles both of deiſts and heretics. With the profeſſed atheiſt I ſhall no farther concern myſelf; but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to obſerve, that deiſts and heretics of all denominations are agreed with us in one ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral point, the acknowlegement of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence of God, and conſequently the incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſibleneſs of the Divine nature, attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes, and operations. The primary notion
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:1123800600:32"/>
which the human mind frames of God is this general and complex, yet negative idea of incomprehenſibleneſs. There is a certain preeminence, if I may ſo call it, in the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine eſſence, &amp;c. which utterly precludes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtigation. But if ſo, all myſteries, whether natural or religious, whether relative, <hi>e. g.</hi> to the extenſion of ſpace, &amp;c. or to the nature of the Deity; all theſe, if conſidered purely as myſteries, will ſtand upon a level in point of credibility. And let a revelation be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, all adventitious truths introduced there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by will be fixed upon the ſame foot; becauſe faith cannot have a ſtronger foundation in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man reaſon than in divine authority. This is granted without difficulty; but then as the deiſt denies the authenticity of thoſe writings which we affirm to contain ſuch revelation, ſo the heretic diſputes the ſenſe and ſcope of them. The queſtion therefore is, whether the opinion of the one, and the unbelief of the other, is reſpectively the reſult of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or of paſſion; of conviction, or of pride; of impartial enquiry, or of unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to ſubmit the underſtanding of man to
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:1123800600:33"/>
the <hi>wiſdom of God?</hi> For, I repeat it, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the one nor the other can, conſiſtently with his own principles and acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, controvert the received ſenſe, or deny the authority of thoſe writings which the Church holds to be the <hi>Word of God,</hi> barely on account of myſterious truths contained in them. If the Divine Eſſence be neceſſarily incomprehenſible, no Revelation can poſſibly make it leſs ſo; ſo far from it, that the very idea of a Divine Revelation, with reſpect to that eſſence, implies a Revelation of myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; <hi>i. e.</hi> of truths undiſcoverable, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceivable by our natural powers; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, the credit of Revelation is rather confirmed than weakened by the number and importance of ſuch truths. For it is but natural to expect a more ample diſplay of wonders, and larger diſcoveries of ſublime and ſacred points of faith in this Revelation; and ſurely God is not the leſs to be believed, the more he communicates to us of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, properties, and diſpenſations. As far as theſe remarks affect Revelation in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, heretics in general will admit the juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:1123800600:34"/>
of them; though at the very inſtant that they allow the writings in queſtion to be the ſole rule of faith, they endeavour, as much as may be, to reduce that rule to the meaſure of their own judgments and apprehenſions. I am however already juſtified in aſſerting, that as much as ſome people are averſe to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving what they do not underſtand, they cannot avoid believing what they do not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand; and that therefore, on proper au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, it is full as reaſonable to believe an hundred myſteries as one. <hi>(e)</hi> And here taking my leave of the deiſt, I would deſire the he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retic by what appellation ſoever diſtinguiſhed, to recollect, that Revelation left human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as it found it; I mean with reſpect to our intellectual faculties; that, <hi>from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the creation</hi> to this very hour, man is to be conſidered as a reaſonable creature, as a free-agent, as ſometimes believing upon competent evidence, ſometimes governed by paſſions, and ſometimes influenced by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſion. A truth which accounts in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the multitude of perſuaſions which have engaged the ſpeculative world. To ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:1123800600:35"/>
or require that God ſhould manifeſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and his proceedings, &amp;c. to every man fully and perſonally, is to deſtroy every no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion not only of faith, but of obedience likewiſe; and to wiſh to invert the eſſential frame and conſtitution of things. Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, unſurmountable difficulties of many kinds occur to our contemplations on that frame and conſtitution; difficulties, on which the light of Revelation darts not a ſingle beam. If we indulge the excurſive faculty of imagination beyond the bounds which reaſon and ſcripture have ſet us, we ſhall find ourſelves inextricably entangled in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity, and ſometimes in impiety too. Who ſhall diſcover the conſiſtency between Divine preſcience and human free-will? Yet that man acts freely, and that God foreknows all events, and decrees accordingly, are equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly truths not to be ſhaken by any ſeeming irreconcileableneſs or contrariety whatſoever. So again: that the moſt perfect <hi>freedom</hi> of agency muſt be aſcribed to God, cannot poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly be controverted; and yet does he not <hi>neceſſarily</hi> foreknow his own actions? Does
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:1123800600:36"/>
not <hi>neceſſarily</hi> act agreeably to the eternal rules of juſtice, wiſdom, and holineſs? That God is in no ſenſe the author of evil, either natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral or moral, every reaſonable man, and much more every Chriſtian will maintain; yet is it not certain, that had this world never been made, neither <hi>ſin</hi> nor <hi>death</hi> could have <hi>entered</hi> into it? Human wiſdom has fatigued itſelf to no purpoſe in the ventilation of theſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. <hi>(f)</hi> Many real truths, but at preſent ſeeming paradoxes, will doubtleſs be capable of future explication; and ſpiritual things in general ſhould rather be received with the humility of reverence, than encountered with the arrogance of diſcuſſion. There will be no end to <hi>doubtful diſputations</hi> while men's ſentiments are modified by a partial attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to a favourite principle; and while truths, apparently oppoſite and contradicto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, are ſeparately contended for, which ought both to be admitted; as ultimately they will be reconciled.</p>
            <p>What has been here advanced concerning faith, or myſteries in general, will, I truſt,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:1123800600:37"/>
ſecure at leaſt a fair and earneſt attention to what I ſhall have to offer in defence of the myſteries of the Goſpel. If theſe myſteries ſhould be found to be real objects of faith, it will be neither right, nor ſafe, to think, or to ſpeak of them indifferently, unhandſomely, or contemptuouſly.</p>
            <p>That the doctrines of the Church of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> the doctrine of one God in Trinity, and Trinity in Unity, and that of the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the Body, are as reconcileable to our ideas as the conſiſtency of free-will with neceſſity, or of the Divine perfections with the exiſtence of evil, I ſhould ſuppoſe, no man can deny; and therefore the great queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is, whether thoſe doctrines be undeniably in thoſe Scriptures which all with whom I am concerned acknowledge to be the rule of faith.</p>
            <p>That, with reſpect to the Trinity, the doctrine of the Church has been ſo long, ſo frequently, ſo copiouſly agitated with much leſs ſucceſs, on our part, than might have been expected from ſome of the beſt <hi>Soldiers of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:1123800600:38"/>
the <hi>weapons</hi> of whoſe <hi>warfare</hi> have been <hi>migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> in this ſpiritual field; this, I muſt confeſs, is a circumſtance enough diſcouraging; but however, not without its counterbalance in certain conſiderations. <hi>The race is not always to the ſwift, nor the battle to the ſtrong.</hi> Matters are capable of being ſet in new lights; nor will any exertion be deſperate which has for its object the honour of God, and the peace of his Church. Men are wedded to their errors as much as to their vices; but as we are not to be remiſs, or hopeleſs in our labours for the reformation of ſinners, though the <hi>whole world</hi> ſhould <hi>lie in wickedneſs;</hi> ſo neither ſhould we be impeded or diſheartened in our attempts for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of infidels and heretics, by that pride, that prejudice, however contracted, that <hi>hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> or that <hi>ſlowneſs of heart,</hi> which indiſpoſes them for the reception of truth.—After all, inquiries of this nature are of very conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable uſe and importance; they cannot fail at leaſt to <hi>ſtabliſh, ſtrengthen,</hi> and <hi>ſettle</hi> our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; to <hi>root</hi> and <hi>ground</hi> us in that <hi>faith</hi> which we ſhall find to be built upon the moſt immoveable foundations.</p>

            <p>TO the Scriptures of the Old Teſtament our bleſſed Saviour referred the <hi>Jews</hi> for ſatisfaction with reſpect to his claims to the character in which he appeared among them; and to the Scriptures of the New Teſtament, together with the other, I am to refer for proofs of thoſe great but myſterious doctrines which I have undertaken to defend: the doctrines contained in the Liturgy, and in the Articles of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Without laying before you at preſent all, or the principal texts by which the doctrine
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:1123800600:41"/>
of the Trinity is ſupported, or in which the abſolute divinity both of the Son and of the Holy Ghoſt is explicitly aſſerted, or neceſſarily implied, we may previouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark that, ſuppoſing them to be authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic, unequivocal, and intelligible, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidel is in fact precluded from taking advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of thoſe paſſages which are declarative either of the acknowleged humanity of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, or of the gifts and operations of the bleſſed Spirit: that humanity, and thoſe operations being things manifeſtly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct from the Divine eſſence, and real per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonality. What we ſhall have to do therefore will be to enquire, in due time and place, whether the exceptions which have been made againſt the texts with which the catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic doctrine is fortified, are grounded in prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of common candour and common ſenſe; or, in other words, whether the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations of anti-trinitarians are critically juſt, and agreable to the rules which are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally allowed to govern interpretation. In the mean time, it will be well worth while to examine, whether the doctrine before us
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:1123800600:42"/>
is not proveable by evidence which, though indirect and collateral, is irreſiſtible. There is hardly any ſuch thing as framing a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, or a propoſition that cannot be preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricated with; but the tenor of a context, and the weight of circumſtances will not eaſily admit of ſophiſtication.</p>
            <p>According to the Athanaſian Creed, as it is called, <q>the Catholic Faith is this; that we worſhip one God in Trinity, and Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in Unity; and that the Godhead of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt is all one: the Glory equal, the Majeſty co-eternal.</q> 
               <hi>But what ſaith the Scripture? Saith it not,</hi> in effect, <hi>the ſame alſo?</hi> That the Father is the firſt Perſon in the Trinity, merely in order of nomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; the Son, the ſecond; and the Holy Ghoſt, the third; is ſufficiently demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble from many conſiderations. In the firſt place, though the three divine Perſons are uſually mentioned in a manner which at firſt ſight ſeems to import an order of a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent kind, yet this order is upon ſome oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:1123800600:43"/>
inverted; <hi>e. g.</hi> in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s often quoted benediction to the <hi>Corinthians; The grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Ghoſt be with you:</hi> and in the following paſſage of the ſame Apoſtle; <hi>there are diverſities of gifts, but the ſame Spirit; and there are diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences of adminiſtrations, but the ſame Lord; and there are diverſities of operations, but it is the ſame God which worketh all in all.</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">1 Cor. xii. 4.</note>And, in other places, the ſame inverſion is obſervable with regard to the firſt and ſecond perſons; <hi>Ye know,</hi> ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>that no whoremon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, nor unclean perſon, &amp;c. hath any inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance in the kingdom of Chriſt and of God.</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Epheſ. v. 5.</note>
               <hi>Now our Lord Jeſus Chriſt</hi> HIMSELF, ſays the ſame Apoſtle, <hi>and God, even our Father, which hath loved us, comfort your hearts, &amp;c. No man,</hi> ſays our Lord, <hi>knoweth the Son but the Father, neither knoweth any man the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſave the Son, and he to whom the Son will reveal him.</hi> 
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">Matt. xi. 27.</note>To this we may add the intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s epiſtle to the <hi>Galatians; Paul, an Apoſtle, not of men, neither by man,</hi>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:1123800600:44"/>
               <hi>but by Jeſus Chriſt, and God the Father, who hath raiſed him from the dead,</hi> &amp;c. From theſe inſtances we may at leaſt draw this inference, that the general priority of order above mentioned imports no diſtinction, or preeminence of eſſence.</p>
            <p>The root, ground, or fountain of eſſence may be acknowledged to be in the <hi>Father,</hi> without the leaſt prejudice to the <hi>Trinitarian</hi> doctrine, which ſuppoſes an ETERNAL com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication to the Son and to the Holy Ghoſt. The terms <hi>root</hi> and <hi>fountain,</hi> &amp;c. are cuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary indeed, but by no means ſtrictly proper, or preciſely deſcriptive. They are familiar, not to our ideas, but to our ears. When we ſpeak of, or contemplate the Divine nature, abſolutely, and without reference to particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar diſpenſations, God the <hi>Father</hi> is generally the firſt in our conception, as far as he can be the object of conception, but not to the excluſion of the Divine nature either of the <hi>Son</hi> or <hi>Holy Ghoſt.</hi> In theſe diſpenſations, in the heavenly oeconomy, we have a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt and obvious reaſon for addreſſing our
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:1123800600:45"/>
prayers and petitions, public and private, for the moſt part, to the firſt Perſon of the Holy Trinity. In ſhort, the terms <hi>Father</hi> and <hi>Son,</hi> under which it has pleaſed infinite wiſdom, by way of analogy, to repreſent this myſterious relation to our minds; theſe terms imply nothing more than nominal preemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence and ſubordination: if the Anti-trinita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian ſhould inſiſt that they do imply more, and aſk what we mean by eternal generation, or proceſſion, we will anſwer him the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment we are told what he means by eternal eſſence itſelf. <hi>(g)</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again. The Father is commonly repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to us under the character of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, the governor, preſerver, and judge of the world; the Son under that of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, advocate, and ſaviour; the Holy Ghoſt under that of our guide, comforter, and ſanctifier; and yet theſe characters, we ſhall ſee, with the names, properties, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes of the Deity, are frequently recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated. Thus, in the following places among others, the office of Redeemer is aſcribed in
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:1123800600:46"/>
expeſs terms to the firſt perſon; or, if you pleaſe, to God abſolutely conſidered. <hi>God will redeem my ſoul from the power of the grave. I will ranſom them from the power of the grave; I will redeem them from death.</hi>

Thus our bodies are ſometimes called the <hi>temple of God,</hi> and ſometimes of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt.</hi> The Apoſtle declares, that <hi>it is God which worketh in us to will and to do of his good pleaſure.</hi> The ſame Apoſtle prays, that <hi>the very God of peace may ſanctify the Theſſalonians; and</hi>

            <p>Again. We find all the great properties and characters of the firſt Perſon frequently at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to the ſecond. In a <hi>Paſſage</hi> in <hi>Iſaiah</hi> he is even called the <hi>(h) everlaſting Father.</hi>

               <hi>and he gave himſelf for the Church, that he might ſanctify and cleanſe it;</hi> and the Apoſtle could <hi>do all things through Chriſt which ſtrengthned him.</hi> Farther; the characters and properties both of the <hi>firſt</hi> and <hi>ſecond</hi> Perſon in the Holy Trinity are likewiſe many of them aſcrib'd to the <hi>third.</hi> Thus, in the old Teſtament, the work of creation ſeems to be attributed to the operation of the Holy Ghoſt, as a diſtinct perſonage, or agent. <hi>The Spirit of God,</hi> ſays <hi>Moſes, moved upon the face of the waters.

think, ſufficiently directs us to the above in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation. Thus again, the Holy Ghoſt is omniſcient, and eternal; for the <hi>Spirit ſearcheth all things, yea the deep things of God;</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">1 Cor. ii 10.</note>and <hi>Chriſt through the eternal Spirit offered himſelf without ſpot to God.</hi>

<pb n="38" facs="tcp:1123800600:53"/>
and yet our ſalvation is ſometimes aſcribed abſolutely to the mercy, or grace of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Thus St. <hi>Peter</hi> declares his and his brethren's belief, that both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles ſhall be ſaved through the grace of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt;</hi>

            <p>Again; this great point is evincible from the neceſſary ſenſe, or natural import of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain paſſages. Let us turn to a few of the moſt remarkable. <note place="bottom">1 Theſſ. iii. 11.</note>

               <note n="*" place="bottom">1 Theſſ. iv. 9.</note>Now that by him who in this place is abſolutely ſtyled God, we are to underſtand <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> I have little or no difficulty to pronounce, for the two following reaſons; firſt, becauſe, though we may very properly be ſaid to be <hi>taught of God,</hi> when we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed by the mouth, or by the preaching of his prophets, or apoſtles, or others com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion'd by him, yet the doctrine of univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal love and charity was more immediately
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:1123800600:57"/>
and peculiarly the doctrine of our bleſſed Saviour: <hi>A new commandment,</hi> ſays he, <hi>I give unto you, that ye love one another;—by this all all men know that ye are</hi> MY <hi>diſciples, if ye have love one to another</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">John xiii. 34.</note>; <hi>this is</hi> MY <hi>commandment, that ye love one another</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">John xiv. 9.</note>: and ſecondly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Apoſtle ſeems to regard this great duty as a principle recently taught, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly enforced by the precept and exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of our Divine Maſter.</p>
            <p>Again. <hi>He that hath ſeen me hath ſeen the Father</hi> 
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">John i. 18.</note>, ſays our Lord, and <hi>he that ſeeth me, ſeeth him that ſent me.</hi> Now in what ſenſe are theſe declarations true? Not in the literal; for the <hi>Father</hi> could not be viſible in the human perſon of the <hi>Son;</hi> becauſe <hi>God is a Spirit, and no man hath ſeen God at any time; whom no man hath ſeen, or can ſee</hi> 
               <note n="§" place="bottom">1 Tim. vi. 16.</note>: and by neceſſary conſequence our Saviour hereby in effect aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts, that, notwithſtanding his appearance in the fleſh, he himſelf really and truly par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took of the Divine nature; that, according
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:1123800600:58"/>
to his own expreſſion, the <hi>Father dwelt in him;</hi> or, in the language of the Apoſtle, in him <hi>dwelt all the fulneſs of the Godhead bodily,</hi> or ſubſtantially.</p>
            <p>Again. In the Goſpels St. <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt is called <hi>the voice of one crying in the wilderneſs, prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths ſtrait</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Matt. iii. 3.</note>: but in the evangelical prophet the ſtyle is at once more explicit and more majeſtical; <hi>prepare ye,</hi> ſays he, <hi>the way of the Lord, make ſtrait in the deſart a high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way for our God.</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Iſa. xl. 3.</note>In the courſe of the ſame ſublime chapter <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is called upon to <hi>lift up her voice with ſtrength,</hi> to <hi>lift it up and ſay unto the cities of Judah, Behold your God.</hi> And then the prophecy proceeds in the following words. <hi>Behold, the Lord God will come with ſtrong hand, and his arm ſhall rule for him: behold, his reward is with him, and his work before him. He ſhall feed his flock like a ſhepherd,</hi> &amp;c. Now, unleſs it can be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated, that theſe paſſages do not refer, ultimately at leaſt, to the coming, and to the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:1123800600:59"/>
perſon of the Meſſiah, he is manifeſtly here announced under the different characters of a <hi>good ſhepherd,</hi> a <hi>righteous judge,</hi> and the <hi>Lord God.</hi> Beſides, if there is no ſuch reference, the ſeveral apoſtolical citations from the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet are moſt impertinently ridiculous.</p>
            <p>Once more. The firſt and ſecond perſons of the bleſſed Trinity are expreſsly diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed, and reſpectively characteriſed as equal, in a paſſage wherein the Apoſtle occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionally aſſerts the unity of eſſence in the Godhead. <hi>We know,</hi> ſays he, <hi>that there is none other God but one; for though there be that are called Gods, to us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we in him; and one Lord Jeſus Chriſt, by whom are all things, and we by him</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">1 Cor. viii. 4. &amp;c.</note>. It may be pretended indeed, that the terms under which the <hi>Son</hi> is here characteriſed are not of equal weight and ſignificance with thoſe which are deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criptive of the <hi>Father;</hi> but I will take upon me to aver, that the ſame might have been pretended, had theſe terms been tranſpoſed,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:1123800600:60"/>
and the paſſage had run thus; <hi>to us there is but one God, the Father,</hi> by <hi>whom are all things, and we</hi> by <hi>him; and one Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> of <hi>whom are all things, and we</hi> in <hi>him.</hi> And in many places the three divine Perſons are ſeverally ſpecified and referred to, as jointly concurring in the wonderful ſcheme of man's redemption; particularly in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing. St. <hi>Peter</hi> inſcribes his firſt epiſtle to the <hi>ſtrangers ſcattered through Pontus, Galatia, &amp;c. elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through ſanctification of the Spirit unto obedience, and ſprinkling of the blood of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt:</hi> and St. <hi>John</hi> ſalutes the <hi>churches</hi> of <hi>Aſia</hi> with wiſhing them <hi>grace and peace from him which is, which was, and which is to come, and from the ſeven ſpirits which are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his throne, and from Jeſus Chriſt</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">1 Rev. 4.</note>. I am ſenſible indeed that by the <hi>ſeven ſpirits,</hi> juſt mentioned, interpreters do not univerſally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the <hi>Holy Ghoſt;</hi> but this at leaſt, I cannot help remarking, may be offered in favour of the ſenſe in which I have taken the expreſſion, that it is a ſenſe of which the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:1123800600:61"/>
words are full as capable as of any other whatever; and that by the preſent conſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion a very conſiderable difficulty is removed which clogs a different interpretation. For admitting the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> to be ſignified by the <hi>ſeven ſpirits,</hi> there will be nothing ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular or unprecedented in this inverſion of the order of Perſons in the <hi>Trinity;</hi> but why <hi>angels,</hi> according to the ſenſe of ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentators, ſhould be mentioned before <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> (who is higher than the angels even in many of our adverſaries conceptions,) ſeems accountable only by forced and unnatural ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications. And ſtill more perplexed, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compatible with the nature of a bleſſing, or a ſalutation in general, or with the apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal greetings and benedictions in particular, the ſenſe of others ſeems to be, who by the <hi>ſeven ſpirits</hi> underſtand the <hi>graces</hi> of the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> or the various operations of Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence. <hi>(i)</hi> However, granting the paſſage to be rather obſcure, I would take occaſion to obſerve from it yet farther, that although we ſhould be very cautious of deducing doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines of faith from ſymbols, or myſtical ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:1123800600:62"/>
yet types and emblems confeſſedly ſignificant and characteriſtical will juſtify our ſuitable concluſions. It may be queſtioned perhaps what is preciſely to be underſtood by the <hi>ſeven ſpirits</hi> juſt mentioned, or by many other ſymbols in the <hi>Revelation;</hi> but it would be exceſs of perverſeneſs to doubt, whether the <hi>Lamb</hi> in our Apoſtle's allegori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal prophecy be the emblem of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Whenever therefore we obſerve divine ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours plainly aſcribed to the <hi>Lamb,</hi> or find him ſpoken of in terms of equal importance and majeſty with thoſe which are predicated of him who is indiſputably the true God, the inference is obvious and unavoidable. How then will the <hi>antitrinitarian</hi> evade the force of ſuch paſſages as theſe? <hi>And every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, &amp;c. heard I ſaying, Bleſſing and glory, and honour, and power, be unto him that ſitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb for ever and ever.</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Rev. v. 13.</note>
               <hi>The Lamb ſhall overcome them, for he is Lord of Lords, and King of Kings.</hi>

               <hi>I ſaw no temple therein, for the Lord God Almighty,</hi>

               <hi>and the Lamb are the temple of it; and the city had no need of the Sun, &amp;c. for the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the light thereof</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Rev. xxi. 22.</note>. <hi>And he ſhewed me a pure river of water of life, proceeding out of the throne of God, and of the Lamb</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Rev. xxii. i.</note>. <hi>And the kings of the earth, and the great men, &amp;c. hid them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the rocks and the mountains, and ſaid unto the mountains and rocks, fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that ſitteth on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb</hi> 
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">Rev. vi. 15.</note>. If any man ſhould affect to make a diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion betwixt <hi>him that ſitteth on the throne and the Lamb,</hi> or him who is ſaid to <hi>ſit on the right hand of God,</hi> in proof of the ſuperio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the former, I would deſire him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that the throne in queſtion is called ſometimes ſimply the <hi>throne of God;</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, as in a text lately produced, the <hi>throne of God and of the Lamb;</hi> that, in another place, the <hi>Lamb</hi> is ſaid to be <hi>in the midſt of the throne;</hi> in another, to <hi>ſit down in the throne of the Father;</hi> and that it is the <hi>throne</hi> of the <hi>Son of God</hi> which is <hi>for ever and ever.</hi>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:1123800600:64"/>
So likewiſe, notwithſtanding the diverſity of conſtructions to which the expreſſion of the <hi>ſeven ſpirits</hi> is liable, the perſonality, opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Divinity of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> may be demonſtrated from the plain literal ſenſe of many places in this book which are utterly void of emblematical ornament, or alluſion. Indeed, the whole was evidently dictated by the <hi>Spirit,</hi> by whoſe <hi>inſpiration all ſcripture was given,</hi> who alone <hi>ſearcheth the deep things of God,</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">1 Cor. ii. 10.</note>and under whoſe immediate direction our Apoſtle wrote this epiſtle: for he tells us expreſſly, before he communicates his Revelations, that he <hi>was in the Spirit on the Lord's day;</hi> and elſewhere, that he <hi>was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away in the Spirit;</hi> and the ſolemn call to all perſons concerned is frequently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated, <hi>He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit ſaith unto the Churches.</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Rev. ii. 11.</note>To all this we may add, that the perſonal inherency of the <hi>Spirit</hi> in the eſſence of the Godhead is demonſtrable from St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s illuſtration of a paſſage juſt now quoted from him. <hi>The Spirit,</hi> ſays he, <hi>ſearcheth all things, yea, the</hi>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:1123800600:65"/>
               <hi>deep things of God. For what man,</hi> continues he, <hi>knoweth the things of a man, ſave the Spirit of man which is in him? Even ſo the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God.</hi> If the conſcious ſpirit in man is man, the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God muſt be eſſentially God.</p>
            <p>I deſire to obſerve yet farther, that nothing leſs than a belief in the doctrine of the <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> as it is received in the Church, can ſatisfy the full demands of the terms—<hi>faith,</hi>—and <hi>myſtery,</hi>—which we meet with ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peatedly in the New Teſtament, and to which there is ſo much reference under the old. The whole of the <hi>myſtery</hi> of the divine <hi>will made known in the diſpenſation of the fulneſs of times;</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Epheſ. i. 10.</note>
               <hi>the wiſdom of God in a myſtery, even the hidden wiſdom which God ordained before the world,</hi>  
               <note n="†" place="bottom">1 Cor. ii. 7.</note>or, if you pleaſe, the real cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the univerſal Saviour, who was to be both God and man, was a ſecret from the beginning. This ſtupendous doctrine was infinitely, and by the divine intention, too ſublime for the carnal conceptions of the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:1123800600:66"/>
               <hi>Jews;</hi> who, whatever they might ultimately underſtand by, or hope from the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to <hi>Adam,</hi> to <hi>Abraham,</hi> to the <hi>Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs,</hi> and to others; and foretold by the Prophets in language clear and ſtrong indeed, but at the ſame time figurative, magnificent, and myſterious, expected, and primarily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired only a temporal deliverer, who ſhould <hi>reſtore again,</hi> and perpetuate <hi>the kingdom to Iſrael.</hi> Nay, it is abundantly evident that the Prophets themſelves, thoſe <hi>holy men of God who ſpake as they were moved by the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">2 Pet. i. 21.</note>had not an inſight into the full ſcope, and whole import of the ſacred truths and oracles which they delivered. Our Lord ſeems to allude to this ignorance, when he acquaints his diſciples, that <hi>many prophets and kings had deſired to ſee the things</hi> which they ſaw, and <hi>had not ſeen them,</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Luke x. 24.</note>&amp;c. It is true this was ſaid by way of anticipation; becauſe, as will be ſhewn, it was not then even to them <hi>given</hi> to <hi>know</hi> the capital <hi>myſtery of the kingdom of heaven.</hi> But St. <hi>Peter</hi> is plain and full upon this ſubject, when, ſpeaking, in his firſt general epiſtle, of the ſalvation obtained
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:1123800600:67"/>
for us by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> he proceeds in the following words; <hi>of which ſalvation the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets have enquired, and ſearched diligently, who propheſied of the grace that ſhould come unto you; ſearching what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Chriſt which was in them did ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify, when it teſtified beforehand the ſufferings of Chriſt, and the glory that ſhould follow: unto whom it was revealed, that not unto themſelves, but unto us they did miniſter the things which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the Goſpel unto you, with the Holy Ghoſt ſent down from heaven; which things the angels deſire to look into.</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">1 Pet. i. 10.</note>The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions here are, I think, in themſelves al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſufficiently deciſive upon the great point before us. For it is hard to conceive that the Prophets, in whom, it ſeems, the <hi>Spirit of Chriſt</hi> reſided; and much harder that the angels ſhould not have a clear idea of the work of human redemption; ſhould not be <hi>able to comprehend what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height,</hi> (as St. <hi>Paul</hi> expreſſes himſelf, with an eye, I imagine,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:1123800600:68"/>
to this diſpenſation,) ſuppoſing that work to have been accompliſhed by any perſon leſs than <hi>very God;</hi> but admit the Divinity of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and the inquiſitiveneſs and the incapacity of men and angels will by no means be unaccountable. All this, I truſt, will afford a moſt ſtrong argument, that the <hi>faith</hi> which the Apoſtles preached after the aſcenſion of our Saviour; the <hi>faith</hi> which was firſt <hi>delivered</hi> to the chriſtian <hi>Saints;</hi> the <hi>faith</hi> which we are required to <hi>hold faſt without wavering,</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Heb. x. 23.</note>and to <hi>build up ourſelves upon,</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Jude 20.</note>is a <hi>faith</hi> in the incarnation of the <hi>eternal Son of God;</hi> or, in other words, in the doctrine of the <hi>Holy Trinity,</hi> as it has all along been held in the Chriſtian Church. In conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of the removal of a popular objection againſt all this, I hope in the enſuing diſqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions to ſet in a ſtill clearer point of view the great doctrine before us.</p>

            <p>THESE words immediately refer to the great event of our Lord's reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but in conſequence of it to the divinity of his perſon. Of this therefore I ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to lay more proofs before you, taking firſt this opportunity to obviate the following popular objection; that, notwithſtanding all that has been, or can be advanced, the doctrine before us is not ſo abſolutely clear and indiſputable as we would have it thought, and as a fundamental article of faith ought to be; in as much as no text can be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced which preciſely, and <hi>totidem verbis,</hi>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:1123800600:70"/>
ſpeaks the language of the firſt article of our Church; <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>in the unity of the Godhead there be three Perſons of one ſubſtance, power, and eternity, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt; or of the ſecond; two whole and perfect natures, that is to ſay, the Godhead and Manhood are joined together in one Perſon, never to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, whereof is one Chriſt, very God and very man; or of the fifth; the Holy Ghoſt, proceeding from the Father, and the Son, is of one ſubſtance, majeſty, and glory with the Father and the Son, very and eternal God.</q>
            </p>
            <p>To all this, I apprehend, we may readily reply, that if there be any real force in ſuch objections, it will operate much farther by neceſſary conſequence than the objectors themſelves can be ſuppoſed to deſire it ſhould. For it will ſupply the perverſe, or idle caviller with pretences and exceptions againſt all the divine properties and attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes, as far as they are aſſerted in the firſt article. There is no <hi>one</hi> paſſage in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:1123800600:71"/>
which literally tells us, that <q>there is but one living and true God, everlaſting, without body, parts, or paſſions, of infinite power, wiſdom, and goodneſs, the Maker and Preſerver of all things both viſible and inviſible.</q> The divine ſuperintendency, &amp;c, uſually called <hi>Providence,</hi> is juſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted one of the capital doctrines of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. Yet, upon the principles of theſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectors, it ſhould be no doctrine at all. For we meet with no ſuch term as <hi>Providence,</hi> in the ſenſe demanded, either in the <hi>old</hi> or <hi>new</hi> Teſtament. So that this doctrine muſt inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably fall to the ground, unleſs it be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained and ſupported by natural inference; or unleſs we are at liberty to make uſe of a proper term to expreſs our ſenſe of it. He who objects to the term—<hi>Trinity</hi>—as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptural, ſhould conſider by what texts he will undertake to prove the <hi>Unity</hi> of the Divine Nature; which, in the ſenſe required by his argument, is a term no more to be found in Scripture than the other. In fact, upon the principle of our opponents, we ſhall be under a neceſſity of expunging a
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:1123800600:72"/>
great part of the Apoſtles Creed, and even ſuch parts of it as all Chriſtians whatever, without the leaſt ſcruple or heſitation, have aſſented to. For I deſire to know by what expreſs or literal authority of Scripture any perſon believes in the <hi>Holy Catholic Church,</hi> or in the <hi>Communion of Saints;</hi> or that our bleſſed Lord was <hi>born of the Virgin Mary, or ſuffered under Pontius Pilate,</hi> &amp;c? In ſhort, if we are to be abſolutely precluded the uſe and application of proper terms and expreſſions in the inveſtigation and expoſition of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-meaning, it will, I preſume, be impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to frame the moſt ſimple ſyſtem, or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulary of Chriſtian faith and doctrine, or any ſuch thing as a <hi>Creed</hi> of any kind in the Church. The holy Scripture is the ſole rule or meaſure of every form of confeſſion,  it is the only teſt by which any doctrine, or ſyſtem is, in all its branches, even the moſt minute of them, to be deliberately and ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately tried; but it is not the rule itſelf; and indeed a little inquiry will ſhew us why the capital points of religion are not ſyſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matically delivered in the ſacred writings.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:1123800600:73"/>
The doctrine of the <hi>Holy Trinity,</hi> as main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by the Church of <hi>England,</hi> was the doctrine of the Catholic Church at and before the time of the publication of the Scriptures of the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> or it was not. If it was, the controverſy is at an end. If it was not, we would fain know how to account for that great variety of paſſages, and thoſe numerous circumſtances, by which it is at leaſt ſo plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly countenanced, not to ſay forcibly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended. We would fain know how to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile with the character of the <hi>meek</hi> and the <hi>lowly</hi> Jeſus, any one of his expreſſions which is capable of being conſtrued into a claim to the Divinity. If this doctrine was the doctrine of the Church previouſly to the publication of the holy writings, they are ſufficiently full and explicit for the ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or confirmation of Chriſtians of all ages; if otherwiſe, here is more than enough ſaid to perplex and miſguide them, and to lead them into errors of the firſt magnitude. The great queſtion therefore, I take it, is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we have not all the reaſon in the world to infer from the very mode in which the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:1123800600:74"/>
doctrine of the <hi>Trinity</hi> is inſerted and incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated in the ſacred pages; the queſtion, I ſay, is, whether we are not authoriſed by this circumſtance to conclude that this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine was antecedently received in the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian world? For inſtance; ſuppoſing the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of the <hi>Trinity</hi> to have been the ſtanding doctrine of the Church when St. <hi>John (k)</hi> wrote his Goſpel, we have no kind of diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty to encounter; but are we not very much embaraſſed by the contrary ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? In the former caſe, we may readily conceive the Apoſtle to be aſſerting the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> in the moſt expreſs terms at the beginning of his Goſpel; and, in the courſe of it, to record many particulars clearly declarative of the ſame; not by way of formal anſwer to <hi>Cerinthus,</hi> or any other heretic that diſputed, or denied it, but purely in flat contradiction to the novel and he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terodox notions advanced and propagated by them; and to encourage and ſtabliſh good Chriſtians in the faith, as they had all along been taught. What this great Evangeliſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares at the latter end of his Goſpel, <hi>viz.</hi>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:1123800600:75"/>
that <hi>theſe things were written,</hi> or, as we may ſay, given under his own hand, that the Chriſtians whom he addreſſes <hi>might believe that Jeſus is the Chriſt, the Son of God,</hi> is perfectly conſiſtent with their pre-acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with theſe matters. Agreably hereunto, and indeed in direct confirmation of our hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis, St. <hi>Luke</hi> (and many, it ſeems, before him,) <hi>ſet in order a declaration of thoſe things which moſt ſurely were believed among Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Luke i. 1.</note>that the perſon he writes to <hi>might know the certainty of thoſe things wherein</hi> he had <hi>been inſtructed.</hi> In the ſame light we may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard thoſe paſſages in the epiſtles which have often been produced in vindication of the doctrine before us. Some of theſe epiſtles were, with reſpect to the main end and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of them, entirely of a temporary nature; being written with a view to the deciſion of controverſies in the primitive Church, which for many centuries have been out of date; and upon ſeveral occaſions and ſubjects of little moment to ſucceeding generations. Not one of them however was profeſſedly written
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:1123800600:76"/>
in defence of the doctrine of the <hi>Trinity.</hi> Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our preſent hypotheſis, a vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of this kind had been abſolutely ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous; and though we cannot wonder to obſerve a point of this conſequence fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently mentioned, or alluded to in theſe writings, yet it would be very unreaſonable to expect to find it methodically or ſyſtema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically taught.</p>
            <p>The grand principle of the leading op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugners of the doctrine under conſideration is, that the only thing required of Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians to be believed with regard to the Perſon of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> is, that he was the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> the Perſon promiſed and ſent by God to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem men from that death which they were inevitably appointed to as deſcendants of <hi>Adam;</hi> and that the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> and the <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and the <hi>king of Iſrael,</hi> and the <hi>Son of God,</hi> are terms or titles in Scripture abſolutely denoting one and the ſame thing. I need not tell you, that this is the favourite tenet of Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> in his treatiſe on the <hi>Reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs of Chriſtianity,</hi> as delivered in Scripture.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:1123800600:77"/>
Now we ſhall willingly admit, that the Apoſtles themſelves were believers under this idea moſtly, during our Saviour's reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence upon earth; as 'tis certain, they had not the whole <hi>myſtery</hi> of the Divine <hi>Will,</hi> the grand ſcheme of man's redemption, clearly and fully made known to them before our Lord's Aſcenſion into heaven. <hi>I have many things to ſay unto you,</hi> he ſays to them, <hi>but ye cannot bear them now;</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">John xvi. 12.</note>&amp;c. and in ſaying this he had moſt probably an eye to the <hi>myſtery</hi> of the Goſpel. For though he took frequent occaſions to aſſert and preſignify, as I may ſay, his truly Divine Nature, either directly, or by neceſſary implication, and could not but have been underſtood ſo to have done by his diſciples, and by the <hi>Jews,</hi> who <hi>ſought to ſtone him</hi> on that very account, yet, <hi>in the days of his fleſh,</hi> many circumſtances con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred to ſhake, or rather to overturn the faith of his followers, with reſpect to this great article. This is plain enough from the tenor of the evangelical hiſtory. It would be ridiculous to ſuppoſe that the Apoſtles could believe their Maſter to be the <hi>Son of</hi>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:1123800600:78"/>
               <hi>God</hi> in the higheſt ſenſe, or even to be the <hi>redeemer of Iſrael</hi> in any ſenſe, when <hi>they all forſook him and fled.</hi> At the melancholy criſis I refer to, they conceived no doubt very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent notions of their Lord from what they had once entertained of him, and afterwards did, when he was <hi>declared to be the Son of God with power,</hi> or to full effect, by his <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection from the dead.</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Rom. i. 4.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The fact is, the ſcheme of human redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> the <hi>only-begotten Son of God,</hi> in the ſtricteſt ſenſe, was opened gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually, and propounded to the world as it were article by article. At firſt it muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily have been ſufficient to have believed that <hi>Jeſus</hi> was the <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> or the <hi>Son of God,</hi> merely as executing a divine commiſſion,  his reſurrection, aſcenſion, and exaltation to the <hi>right hand of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty on high,</hi> being ſubſequent points of faith; and accordingly we read of many that <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved on him</hi> at different times, and in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent places, long before the converſion of
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:1123800600:79"/>
the <hi>three thouſand on the day of Pentecoſt,</hi> whom we cannot but conſider as believers in a much higher ſenſe. The <hi>faith</hi> of Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians at that memorable period, and ever ſince, cannot with the leaſt colour of reaſon be aſcertained, or is to be meaſured by what is declared to be <hi>faith</hi> in particular inſtances recorded in the Goſpels. The <hi>faith</hi> which <hi>made the woman whole,</hi> who <hi>had an iſſue of blood,</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Luke viii. 43.</note>and the <hi>faith</hi> that <hi>ſaved,</hi> i. e. reſtored to ſight the <hi>blind man</hi> near <hi>Jericho,</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid. xviii. 35.</note>could not be that <hi>faith,</hi> the <hi>myſtery</hi> of which St. <hi>Paul</hi> requires <hi>Deacons to hold in a pure con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</hi> 
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">1 Tim. iii. 9.</note>In ſhort, our Saviour's actual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, by virtue of his own as well as his Father's power, (as we ſhall preſently ſee,) cleared up a thouſand difficulties in a moment, and amounted to a full demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Divinity. From a thorough con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of this no doubt it was that his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples <hi>worſhipped him;</hi> and St. <hi>Thomas</hi> in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular burſt into that rapture of acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legement, <hi>My Lord, and my God!</hi> Though therefore the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> or the <hi>Chriſt,</hi> be not
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:1123800600:80"/>
unfrequently called the <hi>Son of God,</hi> as a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon <hi>ſent from God,</hi> as a <hi>teacher,</hi> a <hi>prophet,</hi> or deliverer, &amp;c. (as many even created beings, angels, &amp;c. and men in general are called <hi>Sons of God</hi> in certain reſpects,) yet we inſiſt that this appellation belongs peculiarly to <hi>Jeſus,</hi> the <hi>author of our faith,</hi> as a Divine Perſon likewiſe; and that he is ſo called with reference to his nature, as well as to his offices. In ſome paſſages of Scripture per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, the preciſe import of this title may be controvertible; as when <hi>devils</hi> and <hi>unclean ſpirits</hi> call our Saviour the <hi>Son of God,</hi> and the <hi>Holy One of God;</hi> and when <hi>Peter</hi> ſtyles him the <hi>Son of the living God.</hi> In anſwer to our Lord's queſtion, <hi>whom ſay ye that I am?</hi> the diſciples, according to St. <hi>Mark,</hi> replied by the mouth of <hi>Peter, thou art the Chriſt.</hi> In other places the ſignificance of the title in queſtion is diſcoverable by the context; as when <hi>Nathaniel</hi> addreſſes our Saviour in the character of the <hi>Son of God,</hi> the <hi>king of Iſrael.</hi> But why muſt all this affect the ſenſe of any one paſſage wherein the appellation is given for reaſons infinitely ſuperiour? <hi>The</hi>
               <pb n="67" facs="tcp:1123800600:81"/>
               <hi>Holy Ghoſt ſhall come upon thee, and the power of the Higheſt ſhall overſhadow thee; therefore alſo that Holy thing which ſhall be born of thee ſhall be called the Son of God.</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Luke i. 35.</note>
               <hi>(l)</hi> Could ſtronger terms be deviſed to expreſs the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of the human nature by the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine? Is it not perfectly reaſonable to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that the ſacred penmen often make mention of the <hi>Son of God</hi> with an eye to this myſterious and ineffable incarnation? And is it not certain that the perſon whom St. <hi>John,</hi> at the end of his Goſpel, calls the <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the <hi>Son of God,</hi> is the ſame with him whom, at the beginning of it, he ſtyles the <hi>Word</hi> that <hi>was with God,</hi> and <hi>was God?</hi> And if ſo, is not the ſenſe of the latter paſſage determinable by the preceding? Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the great Philoſopher above mentioned leaves the introduction to this Goſpel, and other paſſages in it of equal import, entirely unnoticed, as though it had no connection with his argument; which is a piece of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingenuouſneſs that, one cannot avoid ſaying, did little credit to his cauſe, or to himſelf.
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:1123800600:82"/>
We ſhall be enabled, by ſuch conſiderations as theſe, to put the true conſtruction on the title of the <hi>Son of God,</hi> in moſt, if not all the places where it occurs in the Epiſtles; naturally taking into the account the many clear and expreſs proofs of our Lord's Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity which are cited from them. Of ſome of the moſt ſtriking of theſe proofs, among other particulars, we ſhall for ſatisfaction<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake take a review in proper time. What Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> has adduced on this ſubject with a purpoſe to invalidate theſe proofs in general, will, I am confident, be utterly overthrown by the force of the following conſiderations; <hi>viz.</hi> that the <hi>Epiſtles</hi> are a part of the <hi>New Teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and as eſſential a part as the Goſpels; were like them, as was obſerved, written oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſionally, and after our Saviour's <hi>Aſcenſion,</hi>  that St. <hi>Paul,</hi> e. g. was as much a <hi>teacher</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> an inſpired <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> as St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> or any other Apoſtle who has hiſtorically recorded the actions, words, or doctrine of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> and that a <hi>Creed,</hi> or ſyſtem of faith ſhould have its foundation in theſe <hi>Epiſtles</hi> together with the other Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:1123800600:83"/>
The truth is, St. <hi>John</hi> in his <hi>Epiſtles</hi> aſſérts the ſame doctrine of our Lord's Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity as in his Goſpel. By Mr. <hi>Locke's</hi> way of proceeding, <hi>viz.</hi> arbitrarily admitting, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting Scripture, we may mould Chriſtianity into what form we pleaſe; and to this way of proceeding, among other cauſes, we are to aſcribe the various Schiſms, and Hereſies, which have ſo long, and ſo deplorably di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided the Chriſtian world.</p>
            <p>We may now, I imagine, fairly date the reception of the doctrine of our Lord's Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity from his reſurrection; and we will next ſee whether the ſubſequent accounts we have of the propagation of the Goſpel be not entirely uniform and conſiſtent upon this hypotheſis, at the ſame time that they open to us the whole <hi>Trinitarian</hi> ſyſtem.</p>
            <p>Let it be obſerved then, that the firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded prayer we meet with is that of the Apoſtles after the <hi>Aſcenſion,</hi> in which the addreſs is made immediately to our Lord himſelf, that he would be pleaſed to <hi>ſhew</hi>
               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:1123800600:84"/>
whether he had <hi>choſen Joſeph, or Matthias,</hi> to ſupply the place vacated by <hi>Judas</hi> the <hi>traitor,</hi> whom he had originally choſen with the <hi>eleven Apoſtles. Thou, Lord, which knoweſt the hearts of all men, ſhew whether of theſe two thou haſt choſen.</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Acts i. 24.</note>It is, I believe, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally agreed that this addreſs was made to <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and if ſo, this attribution of om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſcience to him is ſure as ſtrong an argument of his Divinity as any one thing which can be produced in demonſtration of it. The aſcription is to me on any other foot unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable. It is indeed true, that the Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles had not yet a thorough inſight into the evangelical myſtery, nor had got perfectly clear of the prejudices and notions, reſpecting the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> which they had imbibed in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon with their countrymen: in conſequence of which we find them aſking our Lord, even after his reſurrection, and after he had ſpoken to them, more or leſs explicitly, of the <hi>things pertaining to the kingdom of God,</hi> whether he would <hi>at that time reſtore again the kingdom to Iſrael?</hi> But that they put this queſtion to
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:1123800600:85"/>
him as to one who was able to effect ſuch reſtoration by his own inherent divine power, or, in other words eſſentially partook of the divine nature, muſt ſurely be concluded from this conſideration; that they could not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly <hi>now</hi> entertain the leaſt doubt but that all his declarations and aſſurances to them would be verified to a tittle; and that as he <hi>came forth from the Father, and was come into the world,</hi> ſo he would ſoon <hi>leave the world, and go to the Father; and be glorified with that glory which he had with the Father, before the world was.</hi> The caſe appears plainly to have been this: they did not yet comprehend the whole evangelical plan in the concurrence of three Divine Perſons, in "glory equal, in majeſty coeternal;" they did not perfectly conceive all the <hi>things pertaining</hi> to Chriſt's ſpiritual kingdom; the <hi>kingdom of God</hi> in the fulleſt and moſt exalted ſenſe, of which he had been ſpeaking to them alluſively <hi>forty days,</hi> and with regard to which he may be ſuppoſed to have before promiſed them, that the <hi>ſpirit of truth, whom</hi> he would <hi>ſend unto them from the Father,</hi> ſhould <hi>guide them into</hi>
               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:1123800600:86"/>
ALL truth, and <hi>teſtify of him.</hi> Accordingly, after the miraculous effuſion of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> on the <hi>day of Pentecoſt,</hi> we find them diſcovering very different ſentiments, and animated with ſpiritual expectations; we ſee them calling upon the people to <hi>ſave</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from an <hi>untoward generation;</hi> exhorting them to <hi>repent,</hi> and to be <hi>baptized for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins; (m)</hi> renouncing in an inſtant all honours, profits, and pleaſures of this world; <hi>rejoicing that they were counted worthy to ſuffer ſhame</hi> for the <hi>name</hi> of their Divine Maſter; and, in a word, preaching the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> the <hi>Son of God,</hi> through the inſpiration of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and in the trueſt ſenſe of the expreſſion. On the memorable day juſt mentioned we are told, that the <hi>Apoſtles were all filled with the Holy Ghoſt, and began to ſpeak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.</hi> What they ſpake is not particularly ſpecified; but in general we are given to underſtand, that they ſpake in all languages the <hi>wonderful works of God.</hi> On the credit of what has been advanced, which will be ſtrengthned by what will follow, it
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:1123800600:87"/>
is moſt reaſonable to ſuppoſe, that, by the <hi>works</hi> here referred to, the great work of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption by the eternal <hi>Son of God</hi> is prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally intended; the <hi>myſtery of godlineſs,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited in <hi>God manifeſt in the fleſh,</hi> and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played in the wonderful effuſion of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the firſt addreſs of the Apoſtles to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and <hi>Jewiſh proſelytes,</hi> by the mouth of <hi>Peter,</hi> on the ſame day, both the humanity and divinity of our Saviour are plainly and diſtinctly aſſerted, or implied; and in ſuch a manner as hardly to be liable to miſconſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The doctrine of the reſurrection of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> conſidered as the confirmation of a ſtill greater doctrine, that of his Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, is the chief <hi>corner-ſtone</hi> of our Chriſtian Faith; and, as ſuch, is particularly inſiſted upon by the Apoſtles, who were <hi>ordained</hi> to be <hi>witneſſes</hi> of it. And becauſe this moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant of all events could not be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed by himſelf in his mere human capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, we find the holy writers frequently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring that <hi>God raiſed him from the dead.</hi> But
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:1123800600:88"/>
let it be remembered, that <hi>Jeſus, whom God raiſed up,</hi> is likewiſe as expreſsly ſaid to have <hi>riſen;</hi> and is ſtyled by theſe very witneſſes the <hi>Holy One,</hi> and the <hi>Juſt,</hi> and the <hi>Prince of life</hi> in different places; which beyond all doubt are titles appertaining to the Supreme God. Under the firſt of theſe characters, God the Creator is deſcribed in numberleſs paſſages of the <hi>Old Teſtament;</hi> and he who is the <hi>Prince,</hi> or author of <hi>life,</hi> according to the marginal reading, muſt be the ſame, in point of power and perogative, with him to whom belong the <hi>iſſues from death;</hi> who <hi>kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth and maketh alive;</hi> and <hi>in whoſe hand is the life of every thing.</hi> Indeed the <hi>Prince,</hi> or Author of <hi>life</hi> muſt have <hi>life in himſelf</hi> from all eternity; muſt be emphatically <hi>the life</hi> and <hi>reſurrection,</hi> as our Saviour calls himſelf; and therefore may as truly and properly be ſaid to have <hi>raiſed the temple of his body</hi> by his own power, (to borrow his own phraſe,) as to have been <hi>raiſed from the dead</hi> by the power of <hi>God the Father.</hi> We may ſay, in ſhort, with equal truth and propriety, <hi>Chriſt was raiſed from the dead,</hi> or <hi>Chriſt roſe from the</hi>
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:1123800600:89"/>
               <hi>dead, according to the Scriptures;</hi> the latter aſſertion importing his Divinity, the former not ſuperſeding it; and therefore when St. <hi>Peter</hi> told the <hi>men of Iſrael,</hi> that they had <hi>killed the Prince of life,</hi> I ſcarce know which ſtrikes us moſt, the force of the implied truth, or the keenneſs of the ſarcaſm. But to return to the addreſs of the Apoſtles. <hi>Peter, ſtanding up with the eleven,</hi> ſays the ſacred hiſtorian, <hi>lift up his voice, and ſaid unto them, ye men of Judea, and all ye that dwell at Jeruſalem, be this known unto you, and hearken to my words; for theſe are not drunken, as ye ſuppoſe,  but this is that which was ſpoken by the prophet Joel: and it ſhall come to paſs in the laſt days, (ſaith God,) I will pour out of my Spirit upon all fleſh; and your ſons and your daughters ſhall propheſy,</hi>  and I <hi>will ſhew wonders,  and it ſhall come to paſs, that whoſoever ſhall call on the name of the Lord ſhall be ſaved.</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Acts ii. 14.</note>Now let us com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the promulgation or delivery of this prophecy with the completion of it at this period. Obſerve the words of the Apoſtle in
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:1123800600:90"/>
the courſe of his harange. <hi>This Jeſus,</hi> ſays he, (whom, with reference to his humanity, he had juſt before called <hi>a man approved</hi> by God,) <hi>hath God raiſed up, whereof we all are witneſſes. Therefore being by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father the promiſe of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> HE <hi>hath ſhed forth this which ye now ſee and hear.</hi> That the <hi>Father</hi> and the <hi>Son</hi> concurred in this won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful diſpenſation of infinite wiſdom and power on an equal foot, it will ſcarce be poſſible for us to doubt, when we recollect that the <hi>ſecond Perſon</hi> in the bleſſed <hi>Trinity</hi> is often repreſented as the giver of <hi>ſpiritual gifts,</hi> independently on any <hi>promiſe</hi> from, or aſſociation with the <hi>firſt.

alluſion to the effuſion of the <hi>Spirit</hi> on the <hi>day of Pentecoſt,</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> aſſures the <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians,</hi> that <hi>unto every one is given grace ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the meaſure of the gift of Chriſt.

               <note n="†" place="bottom">Epheſ. iv. 7. 1 Cor. vii 11.</note>It may be pertinent yet farther to remark, that ſometimes neither the <hi>Father,</hi> nor the <hi>Son,</hi> appear to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in this matter; the <hi>Spirit</hi> being ſaid, of and by himſelf, to <hi>divide</hi> his <hi>gifts</hi> and graces <hi>to every man ſeverally as he will.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what ſhall we ſay to the invocation implied in the cloſe of the prophecy we are conſidering; <hi>whoſoever ſhall call on the name of the Lord ſhall be ſaved?</hi> Whom are we to underſtand by the <hi>Lord</hi> here? This, I ſhould think, may be determined by the ſignificance of the ſame words in other places. They cannot be miſunderſtood in the original pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy of <hi>Joel.</hi> And if we refer to the tenth Chapter of St. <hi>Paul's</hi> Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> where they occur again, they will amount

to an irreſiſtible, though indirect proof of the point in queſtion. It is apparent that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is intended, or included however in all theſe texts, is accordingly to be worſhipped, and conſequently is God.</p>
            <p>After what has been ſaid, we ſhall not be at a loſs for the conſtruction to be put upon the inference with which the Apoſtle con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes this firſt diſcourſe which we have been remarking on. <hi>Therefore let all the houſe of Iſrael know aſſuredly, that God hath made that ſame Jeſus whom ye have crucified both Lord and Chriſt.</hi> Juſt noting that in the phraſe—<hi>that ſame Jeſus</hi>—abundance of reproach is conveyed, I obſerve, that theſe words ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently expreſs the two natures united in our bleſſed Saviour, the <hi>Chriſt</hi> in his human cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, the <hi>Lord</hi> in his divine. But yet far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Apoſtle encourages his auditors, (who, it ſeems, were <hi>pricked</hi> in the heart by what he had preached to them,) to <hi>repent and be baptized in the name of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> with the comfortable aſſurance that the <hi>promiſe of the Holy Ghoſt was unto them, and to their</hi>

When therefore we are told at the 42d verſe of this Chapter, that the newly-baptized converts <hi>continued ſtedfaſtly in the Apoſtles doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine;</hi> and afterwards, that the <hi>Apoſtles taught and preached Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and ſpake to <hi>the people the words of this life,</hi> &amp;c. we may juſtly conclude that doctrine to have been the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of redemption, as it has ſince been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in the Chriſtian Church.</p>

And as he journeyed, ſuddenly there ſhined round about him a light from heaven. And he fell to the earth, and heard a voice ſaying unto him,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:1123800600:98"/>
Saul, Saul, why perſecuteſt thou me? And he ſaid, who art thou, Lord? And the Lord ſaid, I am Jeſus whom thou perſecuteſt: it is hard for thee to kick againſt the pricks. And he trembling, and aſtoniſhed, ſaid, Lord, what wilt thou have me to do? And the Lord ſaid, Ariſe, and go into the city, and it ſhall be told thee; and Saul aroſe, and when his eyes were opened, he ſaw no man; but they led him, and brought him into Damaſcus. And there was a certain diſciple at Damaſcus, named Ananias; and to him ſaid the Lord in a viſion, Ananias. And he ſaid, behold I am here, Lord. And the Lord ſaid, Ariſe, and go into the ſtreet which is called ſtrait, and enquire in the houſe of Judas for one called Saul of Tarſus; for behold he prayeth; and hath ſeen in a viſion a man named Ananias, coming in, and putting his hands on him, that he might receive his ſight. Then Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nias anſwered, Lord, I have heard by many of this man, how much evil he hath done to thy ſaints at Jeruſalem: and here he hath autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity from the chief prieſts, to bind all that call on thy name. But the Lord ſaid unto him, go thy way; for he is a choſen veſſel unto me. And
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:1123800600:99"/>
Ananias went his way, and entered into the houſe; and putting his hands on him, ſaid, Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Saul, the Lord (even Jeſus that appeared unto thee) hath ſent me, that thou mighteſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive thy ſight, and be filled with the Holy Ghoſt. And he received ſight forthwith, and aroſe, and was baptized. Then was Saul certain days with the diſciples which were at Damaſcus; and he preached Chriſt in the ſynagogues, that he is the Son of God. But all that heard him were amazed, and ſaid, is not this he that deſtroyed them which called on this name? But Saul in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed the more in ſtrength, and confounded the Jews which dwelt at Damaſcus, proving that this is very Chriſt. <hi>Upon this compendious narrative I remark, firſt, that throughout the whole we muſt underſtand by—the</hi> Lord—Jeſus Chriſt: <hi>ſecondly, that whether</hi> Saul <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the</hi> Holy Ghoſt <hi>by virtue of the impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the hands of</hi> Ananias, <hi>and previouſly to his baptiſm, or after it; in either caſe, the whole</hi> myſtery of the Goſpel <hi>muſt have been communicated to him by immediate ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiation: and, thirdly, that therefore when</hi> he preached Chriſt in the Synagogues that he is
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:1123800600:100"/>
the Son of God, <hi>he aſſerted him ſo to be by eternal generation. Occaſionally indeed, when he</hi> confounded the Jews, <hi>by proving</hi> that this is very Chriſt, <hi>his argument no doubt turned upon what he alledged to ſhew that</hi> Jeſus Chriſt <hi>was the true</hi> Meſſiah, <hi>the</hi> prophet that ſhould come into the world, <hi>and the</hi> king of Iſrael <hi>in a ſpiritual ſenſe, whom they had, and did expect under the idea of a temporal Saviour. It ſeems after this</hi> Saul ſpake boldly in the name of the Lord Jeſus at Jeruſalem; <hi>and we are told, that upon his being</hi> ſent forth to Tarſus, <hi>that he might be out of the reach of the</hi> Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, <hi>who</hi> went about to ſlay him, the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches had reſt throughout all Judea, &amp;c, and were edified, and walking in the <hi>FEAR OF THE LORD,</hi> and in the <hi>COMFORT OF THE HOLY GHOST,</hi> were multiplied. <hi>I recommend the two laſt particulars of this paſſage to the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of every candid and intelligent hearer.

            <p>The converſion of <hi>Cornelius</hi> and his family preſents itſelf next to our conſideration; and the ſhort, but important narrative of it is pregnant with matter to our purpoſe. This <hi>proſelyte</hi> of the <hi>gates</hi> (for ſuch doubtleſs he was) <hi>ſaw evidently an Angel of</hi> GOD <hi>coming unto him,</hi> &amp;c. To the <hi>voice</hi> which called to <hi>Peter</hi> to <hi>riſe, kill, and eat,</hi> he anſwered, <hi>not ſo,</hi> LORD; <hi>for I have never eaten any thing that is common, &amp;c. While Peter thought on the viſion, the</hi> SPIRIT <hi>ſaid unto him, Behold, three men ſeek thee; ariſe therefore, and go with them, nothing doubting, for I have ſent them.</hi> GOD <hi>hath ſhewed me,</hi> ſays he afterwards to <hi>Cornelius</hi> and his friends, that <hi>I ſhould not call any man common,</hi> &amp;c. Now if we only ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, as, I think, we can do no leſs than ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that St. <hi>Peter</hi> addreſſes <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> in the words—<hi>not ſo, Lord,</hi> we have plainly a diſtinction of <hi>three</hi> Perſons in the ſacred ſtory. The ſame will be obſervable likewiſe in the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:1123800600:102"/>
harangue of the Apoſtle upon this extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary occaſion. <hi>Of a truth I perceive that</hi> GOD <hi>is no reſpecter of perſons; but in every nation he that feareth him, &amp;c. is accepted with him. The word which</hi> GOD <hi>ſent unto the child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren of Iſrael, preaching peace by Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> (HE IS LORD OF ALL,) <hi>that word, I ſay, you know, which was publiſhed throughout all Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea; how God anointed Jeſus of Nazareth with the</hi> HOLY GHOST, <hi>and with power,</hi> &amp;c. However, if it be objected, that it is by no means credible this devout <hi>proſelyte</hi> and his family ſhould be converted to the Chriſtian Faith, in the <hi>trinitarian</hi> ſenſe, by any thing aſſerted, or intimated in St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s diſcourſe to them, we will admit the objection, and leave our adverſaries in poſſeſſion of all the advantage they can make of it. We may venture to do ſo without the leaſt heſitation: for I deſire it may be remembered in what manner, and by whom the Apoſtle was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted in his ſermon, if it may be called one. <hi>While Peter yet ſpake theſe words,</hi> ſays the ſacred writer, <hi>the Holy Ghoſt fell on all them which heard the word. And they of the</hi>
               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:1123800600:103"/>
               <hi>circumciſion were aſtoniſhed, for they heard them ſpeak with tongues, and magnify God.</hi> By this miraculous event therefore all farther endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of the Apoſtle for the inſtruction of theſe people were happily ſuperſeded: they were, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> was, inſtantaneouſly as it were, <hi>guided into all truth;</hi> and became be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers in the ſame ſenſe in which he was one. Agreeably hereunto, when St. <hi>Peter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſed</hi> this matter, and <hi>expounded it by order to thoſe of the circumciſion who contended with him,</hi> he tells them in the courſe of his nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, that <hi>as he</hi> BEGAN <hi>to ſpeak, the Holy Ghoſt fell on them</hi> that heard him. After this, would it not be idle to inſiſt upon the inade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quateneſs of St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s addreſs to the purpoſe of converſion in its utmoſt extent?</p>
            <p>We read in the ſequel of this, and in the following chapters, that the <hi>word was preached,</hi> that the <hi>hand of the Lord was with theſe preachers;</hi> that <hi>a great number believed, and turned unto the Lord; and that the word of God grew and multiplied.</hi> If theſe expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions are compared with others ſimilar to

            </p>
            <p>When <hi>Peter</hi> was <hi>put in priſon by Herod,</hi> it ſeems, <hi>prayer was made without ceaſing of the church unto God for him</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Acts xii. 5.</note>; and on the night before his intended execution, <hi>the Lord,</hi> we find, <hi>ſent his angel, and delivered him out</hi>

               <hi>of the hand of Herod,</hi> &amp;c.

Now we ſhould be glad to know, why theſe particulars are not to be regarded as equivalent to the appearances, and viſions, and deliverances <note n="*" place="bottom">See Dan. iii. 28. and chap. vi. 22.</note>, which are ſo frequent in the <hi>Old Teſtament;</hi> and, in that caſe, I need not point out the conſequences they lead to.</p>

               <hi>In the following chapter, we ſee</hi> Barnabas <hi>and</hi> Saul ſent forth <hi>by an immediate com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion from the</hi> Holy Ghoſt. The Holy Ghoſt ſaid, ſeparate me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have called them <note n="§" place="bottom">Acts xiii. 2.</note>. So they being ſent forth by the Holy Ghoſt, departed
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:1123800600:107"/>
unto Seleucia, &amp;c. <hi>The paſſage has been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced before, and I leave it to the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of every attentive and impartial hearer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next occurrence is the converſion of the <hi>Deputy S. Paulus,</hi> who, we are informed, was a <hi>prudent man,</hi> and <hi>called for Barnabas and Saul, and deſired to hear the word of God.</hi> And we may reaſonably ſuppoſe that our Apoſtles preached it to him at large, and laid before him the great myſteries of the Goſpel; and that he <hi>believed</hi> in the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive ſenſe, and was confirmed in his faith by the judgment which he ſaw miraculouſly inflicted by the <hi>hand of the Lord</hi> upon <hi>Ely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas the ſorcerer;</hi> being, as the ſacred text expreſſes it, <hi>aſtoniſhed at the doctrine of the Lord:</hi> the doctrine juſt above ſtyled the <hi>word of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this we find St. <hi>Paul</hi> preaching in the <hi>ſynagogue</hi> of the <hi>Jews</hi> at <hi>Antioch</hi> in <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidia</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Acts xiii. 16, &amp;c.</note>Now theſe <hi>Jews,</hi> though they were
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:1123800600:108"/>
not immediately concerned with them that dwelt at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in the proceedings againſt our bleſſed Lord, were yet in all probability <hi>conſenting unto his death;</hi> as they could not all this while be unacquainted with his ſtory, or ſtrangers to his pretenſions. The Apoſtle therefore adopts the ſame mode of argumentation which St. <hi>Peter</hi> had uſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in his ſpeech to the council, and lays the main ſtreſs on the fundamental article of the reſurrection of our Lord from the dead. From the admiſſion of this, the truth of the other great points of Chriſtianity muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily follow. And it ſhould ſeem that this diſcourſe of our Apoſtle had a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable effect upon ſome of his audience; and indeed that others conceived the full force and import of the moſt ſtriking particulars in it: for we read, that <hi>when the congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was broken up,</hi> many of the <hi>Jews</hi> and religious <hi>proſelytes followed Paul and Barna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas; who ſpeaking to them, perſuaded them to continue in the grace of God.</hi> And, by the way, this circumſtance may well be thought to imply, that the <hi>Spirit of grace</hi> had previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:1123800600:109"/>
operated in their hearts to their entire converſion. But the <hi>next ſabbath day,</hi> we are farther told, <hi>almoſt the whole city came together to hear the word of God;</hi> and the reſult was, that the <hi>Jews, filled with envy, ſpake againſt thoſe things which were ſpoken by Paul, contradicting and blaſpheming.</hi> I would juſt aſk then, whether this BLASPHEMY does not help us to a very ſtrong preſumptive proof of the ſenſe in which theſe <hi>Jews</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood <hi>the things which were ſpoken</hi> by the Apoſtle?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Let us now attend</hi> Paul <hi>and</hi> Barnabas <hi>to</hi> Iconium; <hi>and ſee whether we may not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily infer the nature of their doctrine from the ſucceſs of it there.

               <hi>feet,</hi> &amp;c: <note n="*" place="bottom">Acts xiv. 8, &amp;c.</note>on the ſight of which miracle, <hi>the people lift up their voices, ſaying, the gods are come down to us in the likeneſs of men.</hi> Poſſeſſed with this notion, the <hi>prieſts</hi> of <hi>Jupiter brought oxen,</hi> and would <hi>have done ſacrifice,</hi> &amp;c. This no ſooner came to the ears of <hi>Barnabas</hi> and <hi>Paul than they rent their clothes, and ran in among the people, crying out, ſirs, why do ye theſe things? We alſo are men of like paſſions with you, and preach unto you, that ye ſhould turn from theſe vanities unto the living God, which made heaven and earth,</hi> &amp;c. &amp;c. Now this was preciſely the expoſtulation which the occaſion demanded. The exiſtence of the one living and true God was to be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted to theſe idolatrous believers in a plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of deities. At that time to have op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to their perſuaſions doctrines peculiarly Chriſtian, would have been altogether pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mature and unſeaſonable. It appears however that our Apoſtles had, before and after this, preached theſe doctrines at <hi>Lyſtra,</hi> and in the neighbourhood, with ſucceſs; though moſt probably, for obvious reaſons, not in the
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:1123800600:112"/>
hearing of thoſe that <hi>would have done ſacrifice.</hi> For we read at the ſixth verſe of this chapter, that, being <hi>ware</hi> of the deſign of the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> at <hi>Iconium to uſe them deſpitefully, &amp;c. they fled unto Lyſtra and Derbe,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>there they preached the Goſpel.</hi> And after the affair of the ſacrifice, we are told, that <hi>there came to Lyſtra certain Jews from Antioch, who perſuaded the people, and having ſtoned Paul, drew him out of the city,</hi>  that nevertheleſs he revived, and ſoon after <hi>preached the Goſpel at Derbe, and taught many, and returned again to Lyſtra, &amp;c, confirming the ſouls of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and exhorting them to continue in the ſaith.</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Acts xvi. 1.</note>
            </p>
            <p>We meet with nothing now that hath particular connexion with our argument, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the converſions related in the ſixteenth chapter. Let us proceed then to theſe. At <hi>Troas,</hi> ſays the hiſtory, <hi>a viſion appeared to Paul in the night;</hi> from which he and <hi>Silas aſſuredly gathered that the Lord had called them to preach the Goſpel in Macedonia.</hi> Obſerve
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:1123800600:113"/>
then the account of the converſion of <hi>Lydia</hi> at <hi>Philippi. A certain woman named Lydia, which worſhipped God, heard us: whoſe heart the Lord opened, that ſhe attended unto the things which were ſpoken of Paul. And when ſhe was baptized, ſhe beſought us, ſaying, if ye have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my houſe,</hi> &amp;c. Now I would aſk, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we may not reaſonably ſuppoſe the <hi>Lord opened</hi> this woman's <hi>heart</hi> for the reception of all evangelical truths, almoſt in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant? Whether her caſe is not at leaſt ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar to that of <hi>Cornelius?</hi> And whether we are not as much authoriſed to take it for granted, that <hi>the things which were ſpoken of Paul</hi> were <hi>the things pertaining to the kingdom of God,</hi> agreeably to our ſyſtem, as that this convert was baptized according to the form in St. <hi>Matthew</hi>'s Goſpel? I would juſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark here, that this ſyſtem is in no wiſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced, either by the declaration of the <hi>damſel poſſeſſed with a ſpirit of diviniation,</hi> who <hi>followed Paul</hi> and his companions, <hi>and cried, ſaying, theſe men are the ſervants of the moſt high God, which ſhew unto us the way of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation;</hi>
               <pb n="100" facs="tcp:1123800600:114"/>
or by the Apoſtle's exorciſm of that ſpirit in the following words, <hi>I command thee in the name of Jeſus Chriſt to come out of her.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But let us turn to the converſion of the jailor, to whoſe cuſtody <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> were committed at <hi>Philippi. Sirs, what muſt I do to be ſaved?</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Acts xvi. 30.</note>is the queſtion which the former, in a fit of aſtoniſhment and terror, put to the latter. <hi>And they ſaid, believe on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and thou ſhalt be ſaved, and thy houſe. And they ſpake unto him the word of the Lord, &amp;c. And he was baptized, he and all his. And he rejoiced, believing in God with all his houſe. To believe in God, and to believe on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> appear here to be convertible expreſſions. In ſhort, I af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm that in this, as well as in preceding in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, we have good reaſon to ſuppoſe the perſons preached to were made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted by the Apoſtle and his companion with the capital truths of Chriſtianity, as they are taught in the Church.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="101" facs="tcp:1123800600:115"/>
Not long after this, our Apoſtle and his fellow-travellers came to <hi>Theſſalonica, where was a ſynagogue of the Jews.</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Acts xvii. 1, &amp;c.</note>
               <hi>And Paul</hi> (as the narrative proceeds) <hi>went in unto them, and three ſabbath days reaſoned with them out of the ſcriptures; opening and alledging, that Chriſt muſt needs have ſuffered, and riſen again,</hi> and that <hi>this Jeſus whom I preach unto you is Chriſt. And ſome of them believed.</hi> It will be ſufficient to obſerve here, that our Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle dealt no doubt with theſe <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Jewiſh</hi> proſelytes, as he had before done with others on like occaſions. But the groſs miſrepreſentation, and ſcandalous calumny of the <hi>unbelieving Jews,</hi> in the city juſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, is extremely worth notice. They drew <hi>Jaſon,</hi> as we are informed, and <hi>certain brethren unto the rulers of the city, crying, theſe men that have turned the world upſide down, are come hither alſo;</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid. xvii. 6.</note>
               <hi>and theſe all do contrary to the decrees of Caeſar, ſaying, that there is another king, one Jeſus.</hi> Now it is perfectly reaſonable to ſuppoſe, that <hi>Jaſon</hi> and theſe <hi>brethren</hi> proclaimed their crucified
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:1123800600:116"/>
maſter king in a ſpiritual ſenſe; nay, that they proclaimed him the ſovereign of the univerſe, <hi>king of kings, and lord of lords;</hi> but it is clear, beyond a poſſibility of doubt, that they aſſerted no temporal juriſdiction of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> or ſaid or did any thing <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the decrees,</hi> or againſt the government of <hi>Caeſar.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We have next an account of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las</hi>'s preaching the Goſpel at <hi>Berea</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Acts xvii. 10.</note>; but there is nothing in it which diſcriminates it from parallel ones already ſpoken to, except the candid reception the Goſpel met with at that place.</p>
            <p>We will therefore follow our Apoſtle to <hi>Athens,</hi> where we find him <hi>diſputing in the ſynagogue with the Jews, and others that met with him.</hi> Among theſe were <hi>certain philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers of the Epicureans and the Stoics, who encountered him;</hi> ſome calling him a <hi>babler;</hi> others, <hi>a ſetter forth of ſtrange gods, becauſe he preached unto them Jeſus and the reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
               <pb n="103" facs="tcp:1123800600:117"/>
               <note n="§" place="bottom">Acts xvii. 16, &amp;c.</note>. I mean not to inſinuate from this paſſage, that the Apoſtle is maintaining the Divinity of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> as it is evident from the tenor of his enſuing diſcourſe to thoſe heathen philoſophers, which is ſet down at large, that he has here only an eye to the prophetic character, or office of our bleſſed Lord. If you will turn to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, you will find the great points in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted on, to be the unity and the ſpirituality of the Godhead, together with the doctrine of a future ſtate, and the reſurrection of <hi>all</hi> men from the dead, in conſequence of <hi>his,</hi> whom God had <hi>ordained</hi> to be the judge of the world. This was a proper beginning with heathens. But what effect had this diſcourſe upon theſe idolatrous philoſophers? <hi>When they heard of the reſurrection,</hi> continues the ſacred ſtory, <hi>ſome mocked,</hi> and others ſaid, <hi>we will hear thee again; howbeit certain men clave unto, him, and believed,</hi> &amp;c. Our Apoſtle appears then to have made converts at <hi>Athens,</hi> though we do not read that they were <hi>baptized,</hi> or indeed believed in the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:1123800600:118"/>
articles of Chriſtianity, according to our hypotheſis. Without doubt, theſe articles, the great myſteries of faith, were gradually opened to them afterwards, and previouſly to their admiſſion into the church by baptiſm. For we ſhall ſee preſently that theſe converts are not the only inſtances of perſons who were diſciples, or believers in a certain ſenſe, though they were uninſtructed in the firſt principles of Chriſtianity; and this too even ſince the propagation of it by the Apoſtles.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>After theſe things, we are told,</hi> Paul <hi>and</hi> Silas—came to Corinth <note n="§" place="bottom">Acts xviii. 1, &amp;c.</note>; and Paul reaſoned in the ſynagogue,—and perſuaded the Jews and Greeks;—and was preſſed in ſpirit, and teſtified to the Jews that Jeſus was Chriſt; and when they oppoſed themſelves, and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemed, he ſhook his raiment, and ſaid unto them, your blood be upon your own heads, &amp;c. <hi>You will be pleaſed to compare this relation with that of the perverſe and unbelieving</hi>
               <pb n="105" facs="tcp:1123800600:119"/>
Jews at Antioch in Piſidia, <hi>already taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We have next an account of the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of <hi>Juſtus,</hi> (though it is not particularly ſet down,) and of <hi>Criſpus,</hi> and of <hi>many of the Corinthians;</hi> which contains nothing mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial to our argument.</p>
            <p>But after this we read-of an <hi>inſurrection made</hi> by the <hi>Jews againſt Paul,</hi> and of a charge brought againſt him before <hi>Gallio;</hi> which has a particular worth our notice. <hi>This fellow,</hi> ſay they, <hi>perſuadeth men to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God contrary to the law</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Acts xviii. 13.</note>. Now when we recollect, that our bleſſed Saviour was <hi>circumciſed,</hi> and <q>obedient to the law for man;</q> that himſelf and his Apoſtles con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to the religion of their country in all points, and attended divine ſervice in the temple, and in the ſynagogues; that our Apoſtle circumciſed <hi>Timothy</hi> in pure conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcenſion to the <hi>Jews;</hi> that, in vindication of his innocence, he declared to <hi>Feſtus,</hi> as
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:1123800600:120"/>
he had done before in ſubſtance to <hi>Felix,</hi> that <hi>neither againſt the law of the Jews, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther againſt the temple he had offended any thing at all;</hi> that the <hi>Moſaic</hi> oeconomy to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally ceaſed not before the final deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> when all diſputes concerning circumciſion, and the legal rites and obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances were happily terminated; when we recollect all this, to which more might be ſubjoined, it will, I conceive, be impoſſible to make tolerable ſenſe of the accuſation juſt mentioned, without ſuppoſing ſomething to have been ſuperadded to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> worſhip by the Apoſtles, and firſt Chriſtians, which gave this <hi>great offence;</hi> and what ſhould this be but the worſhip of Chriſtians, as ſuch; or, in other words, the adoration of Chriſt, as God?</p>
            <p>We will now proceed to the account which the ſacred hiſtorian gives us of <hi>Apollos</hi> in the ſame chapter. <note n="*" place="bottom">Acts xviii. 24.</note>
               <hi>A certain Jew named Apollos, an eloquent man, and mighty in the Scriptures, came to Epheſus. This man was</hi>
               <pb n="107" facs="tcp:1123800600:121"/>
               <hi>inſtructed in the way of the Lord; and, being fervent in the Spirit, he ſpake and taught dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently the things of the Lord, knowing only the baptiſm of John. And he began to ſpeak boldly in the ſynagogue. Whom when Aquila and Priſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilla had heard, they expounded unto him the way of God more perfectly. And when he was diſpoſed to paſs into Achaia, the brethren wrote, exhorting the diſciples to receive him: who, when he was come, helped them much which had believed through grace; for he mightily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced the Jews, and that publickly, ſhewing by the Scriptures that Jeſus was Chriſt.</hi> This portion of Scripture, though a little abſtruſe, is replete with matter for our obſervation. <hi>Apollos</hi> is here ſaid to have been <hi>mighty in the Scriptures;</hi> to have been <hi>inſtructed in</hi> THE WAY OF THE LORD; and to have ſpoken, and <hi>taught diligently</hi> the THINGS OF THE LORD; i. e. beyond all controverſy, the <hi>things of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Nevertheleſs he is only called a <hi>Jew;</hi> and why, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was not baptized in the name of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt?</hi> He was not a Chriſtian in the full ſenſe of the term, as we underſtand it;
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:1123800600:122"/>
he <hi>knew only the baptiſm of John;</hi> he knew, as we cannot but ſuppoſe from this account of him, he knew <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> to be the <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,</hi> the <hi>Meſſiah that was to come,</hi> whoſe <hi>way John</hi> had <hi>prepared</hi> by <hi>preaching the baptiſm of repentance,</hi>  but he knew not the whole <hi>myſtery of godlineſs,</hi> the grand ſecret of human redemption by the <hi>Son of God,</hi> coexiſtent with his <hi>Father, before the foundation of the world.</hi> And accordingly, we may ſafely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that it was with reſpect to this great myſtery, that <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Priſcilla expounded to him the</hi> WAY OF GOD <hi>more perfectly.</hi> If we do not infer from hence, that he expreſsly and directly preached the great myſtery in queſtion to thoſe <hi>Jews</hi> whom he <hi>mightily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced,</hi> &amp;c. every difficulty under this head is fairly ſolved by preceding conſiderations.</p>
            <p>The caſe of the diſciples whom St. <hi>Paul</hi> found at <hi>Epheſus</hi> is very ſimilar to that we have juſt diſpatched. <hi>Have ye received the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> ſays he, <hi>ſince ye believed? And they ſaid unto him, we have not ſo much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghoſt.</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Acts xix. 2, &amp;c.</note>
               <hi>And</hi>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:1123800600:123"/>
               <hi>he ſaid, unto them what then were ye baptized? And they ſaid, unto John's baptiſm. Then ſaid Paul, John verily baptized with the baptiſm of repentance, ſaying unto the people, that they ſhould believe on him which ſhould come after him, that is, on Chriſt Jeſus. When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jeſus. And when Paul had laid his hands upon them, the Holy Ghoſt came on them; and they ſpake with tongues, and propheſied.</hi> The paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage is not wholly free from obſcurity; but we cannot do leſs than collect from it, that theſe <hi>diſciples</hi> knew as much of <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> antecedently to this interview as <hi>Apollos</hi> did before his acquaintance with <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Priſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilla;</hi> and conſequently, that when <hi>they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jeſus,</hi> they were baptized in the name of a greater per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon than a prophet; and when the <hi>Holy Ghoſt came on them, and they ſpake with tongues and propheſied,</hi> had, like <hi>Cornelius</hi> and his houſhold, an immediate inſight into the profound myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery of the Chriſtian faith. I juſt add that, in the chapter before us, the <hi>name of the Lord Jeſus</hi> is ſaid to have been <hi>magnified;</hi>
               <pb n="110" facs="tcp:1123800600:124"/>
and that the WORD OF THE LORD JESUS, and the WORD OF GOD are different modes of expreſſion which at firſt ſight will be found to import one and the ſame thing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But to proceed. I ſee nothing of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence enough to our argument to detain us, till we find St.</hi> Paul <hi>at</hi> Miletus, <hi>from whence he</hi> ſent to Epheſus, and called the elders of the Church. And when they were come to him, <hi>ſays the hiſtory,</hi> he ſaid unto them, ye know from the firſt day that I came into Aſia, after what manner I have been with you; ſerving the <hi>LORD</hi> with all humility; and how I kept back nothing that was profitable unto you; teſtifying both to Jews and Greeks, repentance towards <hi>GOD, and</hi> faith toward our <hi>LORD</hi> Jeſus Chriſt. And now behold, I go bound in the ſpirit unto Jeruſalem, not knowing the things that ſhall befall me; ſave that the <hi>HOLY GHOST</hi> witneſſeth in every city, ſaying, that afflictions abide me. But none of theſe things move me, ſo that I might finiſh my courſe, and the miniſtry which I have received of the <hi>LORD</hi> 
               <note place="bottom">* Acts xx. 17, &amp;c.</note>
               <pb n="111" facs="tcp:1123800600:125"/>
Jeſus, to teſtify the Goſpel of the grace of <hi>GOD.</hi> And now I know, that ye all, among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom of <hi>GOD,</hi> ſhall ſee my face no more. Wherefore I take you to record, that I am pure from the blood of all men; for I have not ſhunned to declare unto you <hi>ALL THE COUNSEL OF GOD.</hi> Take heed therefore unto yourſelves, and to all the flock, over which the <hi>HOLY GHOST</hi> hath made you overſeers, to feed the Church of <hi>GOD,</hi> which he hath purchaſed with his <hi>OWN BLOOD.</hi> For I know this, that after my departing ſhall grievous wolves enter in among you, not ſparing the flock: alſo of your own ſelves ſhall men ariſe, ſpeaking perverſe things, to draw away diſciples after them. <hi>Now if we ſuppoſe this Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical charge to have been delivered to perſons pre-inſtructed in the myſtery of the Goſpel, agreeably to our repreſentation of it, i. e. to have been believers in the Holy Trinity, it muſt be acknowleged to contain words of perſpicuity,</hi> truth, and ſoberneſs; <hi>but on every other ſuppoſition, muſt not St.</hi> Paul <hi>have been thought by his audience to have been indeed</hi> beſide himſelf? <hi>I would recommend</hi>
               <pb n="112" facs="tcp:1123800600:126"/>
               <hi>the whole of this paſſage to every judicious and impartial reader's thorough conſideration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We will now attend this great Apoſtle to <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> where we find him violently at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked by the <hi>Jews which were of Aſia, who ſtirred up all the people, and laid hands on him, crying out, men of Iſrael help, this is the man that teacheth all men every where againſt the people and the law,</hi> &amp;c. The accuſation brought here againſt our Apoſtle is plainly in ſubſtance the ſame with that alledged by the <hi>Jews of Achaia,</hi> who accuſed him of <hi>perſuading men to worſhip God contrary to the law.</hi> I ſhall therefore refer you to what was ſaid on that occaſion. Only I will add here, that the obſervation then made is much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the circumſtance of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s <hi>pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying</hi> himſelf at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> with the <hi>four men who had a vow on them,</hi> agreeably to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice before given by the judaizing Chriſtians, and in exact conformity to the <hi>Moſaic</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution. But if we turn to what the Apoſtle has to ſay in his own defence, we ſhall find <note place="bottom">* Acts xxi. 27, &amp;c.</note>
               <pb n="113" facs="tcp:1123800600:127"/>
his apology to contain an account of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, and of his Apoſtolical commiſſion in conſequence of it; which ſtrengthens much what has been remarked relative to the charge brought againſt him. It is obſervable, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls himſelf here a <hi>Jew</hi> in the very ſame breath almoſt in which he avows him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a Chriſtian. He admits his hearers to be <hi>zealous towards God, according to the perfect manner of the law of the fathers,</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Acts xxii. 1, &amp;c.</note>though he plainly intimates all the while that they were erroneouſly or blindly zealous, or, as he elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where expreſſes it, that their <hi>zeal of God was not according to knowlege.</hi> He does not undervalue or vilify the law, and much leſs pronounce it to be <hi>void,</hi> and of <hi>none effect,</hi> though he profeſſes himſelf a preacher of the Goſpel. Neither the <hi>Jews</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> nor thoſe of <hi>Aſia,</hi> could poſſibly be ſtrangers to the NEW DOCTRINE which he taught under that character: ſo that we are not at a loſs to know the nature and import of the teſtimony which he bore concerning his Divine Maſter. Beſide, we are to remember, that he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:1123800600:128"/>
in the courſe of his harangue, and precluded from enlarging his ſpeech, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patiating on his doctrine, (which otherwiſe perhaps he might have done,) by the cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours and outrage of a giddy and incenſed multitude.</p>
            <p>We ſee him next before the <hi>chief prieſts</hi> and <hi>council;</hi> in which ſituation he politicly takes advantage of the difference of ſentiment between them that compoſed it: the <hi>one part</hi> being <hi>Sadducees,</hi> and <hi>the other Phariſees.</hi> The Apoſtle openly declares himſelf a <hi>Phariſee;</hi> in which plea his immediate view was mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly to his own preſervation; though ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately he had doubtleſs an eye to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of the moſt conſiderable and reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table part of his audience, by tacitly at leaſt referring to the reſurrection of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and the important conſequences neceſſarily reſulting from it.</p>
            <p>In much the ſame light we may regard his apology for himſelf before <hi>Felix</hi> in the <note place="bottom">† Acts xxiii. 1, &amp;c.</note>
               <pb n="115" facs="tcp:1123800600:129"/>
following Chapter. Under one article of his accuſation he is charged with being <hi>a ring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leader of the ſect of the Nazarenes;</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Acts xxiv. 5, &amp;c.</note>or, as the <hi>Aſiatic Jews</hi> had expreſſed themſelves, with <hi>teaching men every where againſt the law;</hi> or, in the words of the <hi>Jews</hi> of <hi>Achaia,</hi> with <hi>perſuading men to worſhip God contrary to the law;</hi> and under another article he is traduced as a <hi>mover of Sedition,</hi> and a diſturber of the public peace. Now there is ſomething ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervably dexterous in our Apoſtle's reply to all this; in which he partly denies the charge, profeſſes his innocence, and defies them to <hi>prove the things whereof they accuſe him;</hi> and partly aſſerts the cauſe he had eſpouſed, and in general terms acknowleges his Chriſtian principles. In this, as in the preceding caſe, there is fine addreſs in the Apoſtle's endeavour to intereſt his auditors on the ſide of Chriſtianity, by repreſenting its profeſſors as holding one common tenet with the <hi>ſtraiteſt</hi> and moſt popular ſect of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> religion; while at the ſame time he was indirectly <hi>preaching through Jeſus the</hi>
               <pb n="116" facs="tcp:1123800600:130"/>
               <hi>reſurrection from the dead,</hi> and by neceſſary implication maintaining the great myſtery of the Chriſtian Faith. <hi>Felix,</hi> we find, was far from being unacquainted with at leaſt ſome of the doctrines of Chriſtianity, and reſerved the matter for a farther hearing; but in the interim he, with his wife <hi>Druſilla, which was a Jeweſs,</hi> ſent for <hi>Paul</hi> privately, and <hi>heard him concerning the faith in Chriſt.</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Acts xxiv. 24, &amp;c.</note>It does not appear that our Apoſtle on this occaſion diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed on any one article of faith, ſtrictly and peculiarly Chriſtian. <hi>He reaſoned of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, temperance, and judgment to come,</hi> till this iniquitous governor <hi>trembled;</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably had proceeded to the full diſplay of all evangelical truth, had he not been ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptly diſmiſſed. However, if there be any difficulty here, it is ſuch as affects not our argument in particular; becauſe the very ſame difficulty will ſubſiſt, whether we ſuppoſe <hi>that Jeſus whom Paul preached</hi> to be "very God of very God," or to be the <hi>Son of God</hi> in a ſecondary ſenſe only, or indeed barely the <hi>prophet that was to come into the world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="117" facs="tcp:1123800600:131"/>
Many of the foregoing remarks may be applied to the defence made afterwards by our Apoſtle before king <hi>Agrippa and Feſtus</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Acts xxvi. 1, &amp;c.</note>. I think it unneceſſary therefore to cite it. It will ſuffice to obſerve, or rather to repeat, that, aſſerting the doctrine of the reſurrection in general, and particularly that of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> at one and the ſame time in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuates himſelf into the good graces of ſuch as were phariſaically diſpoſed; and points to a fact, the admiſſion of which, upon full and diſpaſſionate enquiry, muſt lead all that heard him, all the <hi>Jews</hi> at leaſt into a train of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions, neceſſarily comprehending the great truths of the Goſpel. And that this was a much more judicious mode of conviction than the direct or poſitive aſſertion of all, or any of thoſe truths could have been, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume, I need not ſtay to prove.</p>
            <p>When St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſome time after this <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded and teſtified the kingdom of God to the Jews at Rome, perſuading them concerning Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus both out of the law of Moſes, and out of the</hi>
               <pb n="118" facs="tcp:1123800600:132"/>
               <hi>prophets,</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Acts xxviii. 23, 31.</note>we cannot ſay with any preciſion how much of the whole ſcheme of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity he laid before them. Moſt probably his uſual diſcretion directed him to deal tenderly with them at firſt; though when he declared to the unbelieving part of them that the <hi>ſalvation of God was ſent unto the Gentiles,</hi> the expreſſion has evident reference to that ſcheme; as, ſuitably hereto, the hiſtory of the <hi>Apoſtolical Acts</hi> concludes with an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his <hi>receiving all that came in unto him for two whole years, and preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching thoſe things which concern the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This minute and circumſtantial ſurvey of the hiſtory of the <hi>Acts of the Apoſtles,</hi> ſo far as it is connected with our preſent ſubject, will, I apprehend, throw much light upon the ſame. And it will receive additional luſtre from the following conſideration: that, as in the Holy Scriptures, ſo in the writings of the Apoſtolical Fathers, the leading truths of Chriſtianity are incidentally mentioned, or
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:1123800600:133"/>
alluded to, and not ſyſtematically, but uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formly taught. The doctrine of theſe Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers is delivered in the ſpirit of ſimplicity; it appears plainly to have been the ſtanding doctrine of the Church; nor is there a ſingle circumſtance that will incline us to ſuſpect them of a deſign to obtrude their own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate opinions, or conceits, upon the Chriſtian world. This to me ſeems demonſtrable from a very obſervable particular; which is, that in their writings they do not cite all, or the principal texts which are adduced in main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of the doctrine of the Trinity, but aſſert the ſame in other terms, and in lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage fully equivalent. They evidently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered it, not as requiring proof, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving illuſtration. <hi>Ignatius,</hi> in the intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction to his Epiſtle to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> ſalutes them <q>according to the will of the Father, and <hi>Jeſus Chriſt our</hi> GOD.</q> The ſame Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wiſhes the <hi>Romans</hi> to <q>permit him to imitate the paſſion of his GOD;</q> or, of <hi>Chriſt</hi> his GOD, as it ſtands in the Original. In the above-mentioned Epiſtle to the <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians,</hi> he takes occaſion thus to expreſs him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:1123800600:134"/>
               <q>There is one phyſician, both fleſhly and ſpiritual; made and not made; GOD INCARNATE; true life in death; both of <hi>Mary</hi> and of God; firſt paſſible, then im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſible; even <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> our Lord.</q> 
               <hi>(n)</hi> In the concluſion of his Epiſtle to the <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſians,</hi> he injoins them to <q>be ſubject to their biſhop, as <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> to the Father, according to the fleſh, <note n="†" place="bottom">Romans i. 3.</note>and the Apoſtles both to Chriſt, and to the Father, and to the Holy Ghoſt.</q> This inverſion is a very remarkable one. In his Epiſtle to <hi>Polycarp</hi> he exhorts him <q>to conſider the times, and expect him who is above all time, eternal, inviſible, &amp;c.</q> Were there occaſion, much more to the ſame purpoſe might be extracted from this venerable Father.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Polycarp</hi> in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Philipians,</hi> wiſhes them to be <q>ſubject to the Prieſts, &amp;c. as unto God and Chriſt.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In St. <hi>Clement</hi>'s firſt epiſtle to the <hi>Corinth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ians</hi> theſe paſſages occur. <q>The ſceptre of
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:1123800600:135"/>
the majeſty of GOD, our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> came not in the ſhew of pride,</q> &amp;c. &amp;c. The ſecond ſection of the ſame epiſtle pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds in the terms following. <q>Ye were all of you humble-minded, &amp;c. deſiring rather to be ſubject than to govern, &amp;c. being content with the portion GOD had diſpenſed to you, and hearkening dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently to HIS word, ye were enlarged in your bowels, having HIS SUFFERINGS always before your eyes.</q> This paſſage is not unſimilar to part of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s diſcourſe at <hi>Miletus</hi> to the elders of the church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> before ſubmitted to your conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Let us ſee now what this Father ſays in his other epiſtle to the Corinthians. The exordium of it is this—<q>Brethren, we ought ſo to think of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> as of GOD &amp;c.</q> In the third paragraph he quotes theſe words of our bleſſed Saviour; <hi>Whoſoever ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs me before men, him will I confeſs before my Father.</hi> But, continues he, <q>Wherein muſt we confeſs him? Namely, in doing thoſe things which he ſaith, &amp;c. by wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping him, not with our lips only, but
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:1123800600:136"/>
with all our heart, &amp;c. for HE ſaith in <hi>Iſaiah, This people honoureth me with their lips, but</hi> &amp;c.</q> In conformity with this good Father's idea, we may aſk, after the manner of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> is <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> the God of the <hi>New Teſtament only? Is he not alſo of the Old? Yea, of the Old alſo.</hi> In the concluſion of the epiſtle, St. <hi>Clement</hi> exhorts the <hi>Corinth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ians</hi> to be vigilant, &amp;c. <q>becauſe we know not <hi>the day of</hi> GOD<hi>'s</hi> appearing;</q> 
               <hi>i. e.</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly, the day when we <hi>muſt appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the judgmentſeat of Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is true, as the learned tranſlator acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, this ſecond Epiſtle, was neither held in ſo much reverence by the ancients, nor is ſo generally received among the moderns, as the firſt; and, it is certain, St. <hi>Jerome, Photius,</hi> and <hi>Archbiſhop Uſher</hi> after them, concur in endeavouring to repreſent it as a ſpurious production. But I am apt to think every reader will be ſatisfied with what the learned Prelate has advanced in its defence; though, were the point ſtill really contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertible, as the ground of the objections,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:1123800600:137"/>
raiſed by theſe illuſtrious perſonages, does not lie in the doctrine ſo explicitly contained in it, and at the ſame time ſo conſonant to the ſentiments of the apoſtolical fathers, I ſee no manner of neceſſity for retracting theſe quotations. Whoever the author might be, we have his clear ſenſe of the matter.</p>
            <p>The charge of credulity brought againſt many of the Fathers by a late celebrated Author, with vehemency of zeal, and in the dialect of virulence, even admitting it to be well founded, cannot juſtly be thought to affect in the leaſt the validity of theſe pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive and plain teſtimonies to the great truths of the Goſpel, as they <hi>are moſt ſurely believed among us.</hi> There is not, I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, one circumſtance to colour a charge of this nature againſt the Fathers from whom we have been drawing our evidence, except that of the <hi>Phoenix,</hi> by which, as we ſhall ſee, St. <hi>Clement</hi> illuſtrates the doctrine of the reſurrection. And ample ſatisfaction will be given on that head in its proper place. <hi>(o)</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="124" facs="tcp:1123800600:138"/>
To theſe teſtimonies we might ſubjoin thoſe of <hi>Juſtin Martyr, Athenagoras, Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus,</hi> and a number of others; the weight of whoſe collected evidence will be found in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely to preponderate all that has perverſely been alledged to its diſcredit from writers of a ſubſequent date, and minor authority. <hi>(p)</hi> This in due time will fully appear.</p>
            <p>Now, if in all this doctrine we can ſee nothing like a formulary, or ſyſtem, we ſee however from whence <hi>confeſſions of faith</hi> may reaſonably be ſuppoſed to have origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated, and by what at this day they may be moſt juſtly defended. Suppoſing the firſt rule of faith to have been purely the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſmal form; or, agreeing with Dr. <hi>Sykes,</hi> that the <q>very ſhort Creed which at firſt was deemed ſufficient to entitle men to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, was no other than a faith in God the Father Almighty, maker of heaven and earth, and in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> his Son our Lord, and in the <hi>Holy Ghoſt;</hi>
               </q> even admitting this, we cannot ſurely have recourſe to better or ſounder authority than that which has been
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:1123800600:139"/>
laid before you, in order to know exactly what <hi>this faith</hi> implies. It will be hard in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed if the Apoſtles, and theſe Apoſtolical Fathers, ſhould be all along teaching he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſy, while they perpetually and earneſtly, though not formally or methodically, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of, and expatiate againſt it.</p>
            <p>But I have yet farther to obſerve, that the ſenſe of antiquity, and the faith of the primitive Church, may be inferred from ſuch circumſtantial evidence as has never, that I know of, been profeſſedly produced, but yet, I truſt, will be allowed to come little if at all ſhort of demonſtration.</p>
            <p>The infamous reproach which was caſt upon the whole Chriſtian name by its firſt enemies, is a circumſtance of a particular aſpect to our purpoſe. Chriſtianity was called emphatically THE ATHEISM. <hi>(q)</hi> Now I own I cannot help conſidering this equally horrid and ridiculous imputation as neceſſarily im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting the primitive Chriſtians to have wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> as ONE with the Father,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:1123800600:140"/>
or as "very God of very God" from all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. For nothing leſs than ſuch worſhip will account for the charge either from <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Gentiles.</hi> It might naturally be conſidered by both as a kind of dethroning of the ONE SUPREME GOD. But every modern unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever will readily agree with me, that the idea of inferiority and delegation, &amp;c. is far from being irreconcileable with <hi>Jewiſh</hi> te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, or with known principles of Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſm. <hi>(r)</hi>
            </p>
            <p>According to the <hi>Apoſtolical conſtitutions,</hi> as we learn from an eminent author, it was cuſtomary for the prieſt, after <hi>amen</hi> ſolemnly pronounced by the communicants in the holy ſacrament, to cry out with a loud voice <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>In his <hi>Diſſertation on Epictetus, Arrian</hi> (as Biſhop <hi>Wilkins</hi> obſerves) <q>aſſures us, that in his time, (which was about an hundred and tweny years after Chriſt,) it was an uſual form in the prayers of the heathen to ſay <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>—<hi>Lord have mercy upon us;</hi> whereby they did acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege the <hi>unity</hi> of God, ſays his Lordſhip; which clauſe, he adds, is thought to have been from that uſage taken into the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy of Chriſtians.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Now, if this be admitted, I would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, that as the title of <hi>Lord</hi> confeſſedly belongs to our Saviour, the Chriſtians may fairly be ſuppoſed, in their triple form of ejaculatory addreſs,—<hi>Lord, have mercy upon us; Chriſt, have mercy upon us; Lord, have mercy us;</hi> to invoke <hi>Chriſt</hi> the <hi>Lord,</hi> as ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme <hi>God:</hi> or if by <hi>Lord</hi> we are in the firſt

            </p>
            <p>In confirmation of what has been offered, I deſire to add one or two more facts, which, if I miſtake not, have more weight in them than is commonly apprehended; as, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, the appointment of the <hi>Lord's day;</hi> and the ſtyle or title <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>I ſhall conclude this diſcourſe with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minding you of a circumſtance, if poſſible, ſtill more deciſive: I mean the <hi>Unitarian</hi> doctrine which is ſo copiouſly, and ſo em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatically inculcated in the <hi>Koran</hi> of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>But with reſpect to our Lord's Divinity, or equality with the Father, you have, among a thouſand parallel ones, the ſentiments fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing. <q>They (viz. the Chriſtians) ſay, God hath begotten children; God forbid. It is not meet for God that he ſhould have any ſon; God forbid. Bleſſed be he that hath revealed the <hi>Forkan,</hi> (Koran,) to whom belongeth the kingdom of heaven and earth; who hath begotten no iſſue, and hath no partner in his kingdom, &amp;c. Yet have they taken other Gods beſides him, which have created nothing, but are themſelves created, &amp;c. <hi>Jeſus</hi> is no other than a ſervant whom we favoured with the gift of prophecy, &amp;c.

The 112th. ch. of the <hi>Koran</hi> is entitled <hi>the declaration of God's Unity,</hi> and the whole runs thus: Say God is one God; <hi>(t)</hi> the eternal God; he begetteth not, neither is he begotten; and there is not any like unto him.

            </p>
            <p>That theſe carnal ſentiments, this groſs language, (the language of infidels and ſcof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers every day,) is directly levelled, not at a <hi>new</hi> or <hi>ſtrange</hi> thing; not at a peculiar tenet of a few enthuſiaſts; or a particular ſect of Chriſtians; but at the leading article, the fundamental principle of our religion, may be affirmed in utter defiance of the united powers of effrontery and equivocation.

All theſe conſiderations combined, demoliſh in a moment the ſeveral forts of infidelity, in early corruptions, in Monaſtic ſuperſtition, in Gothic barbariſm, Scholaſtic ſubtilty, and Papal innovation. <hi>(v)</hi>

And I hope very much to ſtrengthen what has been advanced by ſhewing the repugnancy of anti-trinita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian principles to the genius and deſign of the Chriſtian diſpenſation; or, in other words, by proving that, if we ſolely or chiefly regard our bleſſed Saviour under any character inferior to that of the <hi>true God,</hi> our higheſt ideas will come infinitely ſhort both of the dignity of his Perſon, and the nature and end of his Commiſſion.</p>
            <p>By affecting the common appellation of <hi>Unitarians,</hi> modern unbelievers, as well the followers of <hi>Socinus</hi> as the diſciples of <hi>Arius,</hi> (who again may be ranged under many more claſſes than one,) appear in ſome ſort to be aſhamed of the leaders of their reſpective hereſies, and to deſert the captains under whoſe banners they fight. But be their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral motives hereunto what they may, (tho' indeed they are obvious enough,) it will ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, without concerning myſelf with parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular conceits, to take into conſideration the two following general perſuaſions:</p>

               <hi>What the ſum and ſubſtance of our Saviour's preaching was, will be remembered preſently; and mean time we ſhall find his Apoſtles delivering themſelves in language correſponſive to the above.</hi> The law was given by Moſes, <hi>ſays St.</hi> John, but grace and peace came by Jeſus Chriſt. <note n="†" place="bottom">John i. 17.</note>In this was manifeſted the love of God towards us, <hi>ſays the ſame Apoſtle,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that God ſent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him.

            </p>
            <p>I muſt beg leave then, in the third place, to put you in mind, that Chriſtianity is not a <hi>new</hi> law, properly ſpeaking, but a new edition, if I may ſo ſay, or promulgation of the <hi>old;</hi> agreeably to the expreſs declaration of its Divine Author, who aſſures us that he <hi>came not to deſtroy the</hi> moral <hi>law, or the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, but to fulfil both.</hi>

A religion of this ſort ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed and required reformation in the lives of its profeſſors; and accordingly our bleſſed Lord, in his excellent diſcourſe on the mount, and in other places, enforces the import, and explains the obligation of many of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> lawgiver; the full ſenſe and genuine meaning of which had been perverted by the falſe gloſſes and miſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions of later ages, and particularly of the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees.</hi> We find him perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually upbraiding theſe with their ſubſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of oral tradition in the room of the written word of God; and with abſurdly and impiouſly <hi>teaching for doctrines the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of men.</hi>

and faithfully diſcharges the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant office, not of a maker or preſcriber of law, but of a doctor or expounder of it.</p>
            <p>Suitably to all this, our Lord cites and refers to the law of <hi>Moſes</hi> upon all occaſions. <hi>If thou wilt enter into life, keep the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>

was not teaching a <hi>new doctrine, or bringing ſtrange things to their ears,</hi> this duty being evidently implied in the <hi>love</hi> of our <hi>neighbour,</hi> but only injoining a duty, by the practice of which his followers ought to be more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially diſtinguiſhed; to which they had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducements of an extraordinary nature; to which they were bound by ties and conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations peculiarly Chriſtian, and by reverence for his aſtoniſhingly great example, who ſo <hi>loved</hi> them, <hi>and waſhed</hi> them <hi>from</hi> their <hi>ſins in his own blood.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>In perfect conſiſtence with this, the Apoſtles <hi>preached the Goſpel,</hi> after their <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Maſter</hi> had left the world, and was <hi>gone to his Father.</hi> They taught Goſpel truths; they inſiſted on, (St. <hi>Paul</hi> more eſpecially,) they rejoiced, they gloried in their deliverance from <hi>bondage under weak and beggarly ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;</hi>

<pb n="142" facs="tcp:1123800600:156"/>
as of inviolable authority, and a complete ſtandard of conduct ſtill. When the Apoſtle juſt now named expoſes the extreme folly of ſuch tranſgreſſors of the law as ſtood ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condemned; or complains of the rigour of its requiſitions; or declares the impoſſibility of yielding meritorious obedience <hi>to it,</hi> and conſequently of obtaining Salvation <hi>under it,</hi> its ſubſiſtence and obligation are ſuppoſed beyond all poſſible contradiction. That it <hi>could not make the comers thereunto perfect,</hi> was an argument of its own intrinſic perfection. The ſame great Apoſtle, preſſing upon his <hi>Roman</hi> converts the duties of <hi>brotherly love,</hi> and univerſal charity, recites almoſt all the commandments of the ſecond table; and ſubjoins that comprehenſive precept of <hi>Moſes</hi> juſt now mentioned, which he no doubt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as incluſive of every evangelical pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, even that of <hi>loving our enemies, thou ſhalt love thy neighbour as thyſelf.</hi> St. <hi>James</hi> calls this very precept, this great ſocial prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, the <hi>royal law;</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">James ii. 8.</note>and when he argues againſt the folly and preſumption of a partial
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:1123800600:157"/>
obedience to the divine commandments, and a commuting as it were for iniquities, reſts his argument wholly in that ſupreme autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity by which the law of <hi>Moſes</hi> was enacted: <hi>he that ſaid, do not commit adultery, ſaid alſo, do not kill.</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">James ii. 11.</note>In ſhort, both our Lord and his Apoſtles inculcated, and enlarged upon many things of practical importance, as circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances admitted, and occaſions required; but they taught nothing of this kind but what was reducible to the <hi>Moſaic</hi> inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or to ſome general head of <hi>Jewiſh,</hi> or natural morality.

            <p>When we conſider theſe ſentiments and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples independently and ſeparately from what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is erroneous, inconſiſtent, or extravagant in heathen authors, we can do no leſs than re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence them as doing credit to human nature in its moſt depraved ſtate; as ſo many efforts of reaſon nobly ſtruggling to emerge from a vaſt abyſs of ignorance and impurity. The grand uſe and advantage of the Goſpel, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded as a moral ſcheme, is not ſo <hi>much</hi> that things are uniformly taught therein, and delivered in conſummate purity, as that they are taught with proper authority, by a Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor <note n="†" place="bottom">See Locke's Reaſonab. of Chriſtian. p. 269.</note>from heaven, and under ſanctions the moſt efficacious imaginable. In ſhort, the
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:1123800600:167"/>
Chriſtian religion ſtands particularly diſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated from all other inſtitutions by the perſonal pre-eminence of its Author, and by the tranſcendent graciouſneſs, importance, and ſplendor of the diſpenſation.</p>
            <p>If we regard our Saviour under any cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter inferior to that of the true God; at leaſt if we regard him merely as a man, or as a law-giver, we ſhall find few or no marks of that originality by which the founders of all perſuaſions, religious or philoſophical, are diſtinguiſhed. As a prophet, he was <hi>like unto Moſes,</hi> according to the expreſs prediction of the latter; as a worker of <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,</hi> he ſtood ſupereminent, but not ſingle; as a teacher, or inſtructer, he followed pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedents; his apologues and allegories were agreeable to the oriental mode, and many of his parables were borrowed from the <hi>Jews;</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">See Whitby on Matt. 6. v. 9.—13. v. 10.</note>even that excellent form of prayer which he taught his diſciples was almoſt entirely taken out of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> liturgies; and the ſacraments which "he ordained in his

               <hi>Moſes is here.</hi> How does <hi>Socinianiſm</hi> ſhrink before ſuch conſiderations as theſe!</p>
            <p>But it is little material which of two errors may be moſt plauſible, when both are equidiſtant from the centre of truth. Our bleſſed Saviour is no more <hi>half-God</hi> than he is <hi>all man,</hi> if I have leave ſo to expreſs myſelf; nor will <hi>Arianiſm</hi> fix a firmer baſis of faith by its chimerical expedient of a ſecondary worſhip, and a gradation of Deity. For this at beſt will be found to be neither more nor leſs than <hi>Paganiſm</hi> improved, and contracted within a ſmaller circle. It muſt be equally idolatrous, equally injurious to the honour of the Supreme Being, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowlege <hi>Gods many,</hi> or Gods few, or only one God <hi>beſides</hi> him. Infinite almoſt as the number of ſubaltern deities was among the Heathens, there is no doubt but the wiſeſt of them at leaſt acted nearly upon <hi>Arian</hi> principles; <hi>viz.</hi> under a perſuaſion of the exiſtence and properties, and with a reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the prerogatives of the one Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme God. According to univerſal tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:1123800600:170"/>
the notion of a ſupreme power, a ſelf-exiſtent, independent Being, a firſt cauſe of all things, prevailed more or leſs every where in the world. <note n="*" place="bottom">See Shuckford's Sac. and Prof. Hiſt. connec. Vol. 1. B. 5.</note>The doctrine of divine Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy was no ſecret even among people whoſe religious rites and uſages were ſilly and extravagant enough to render them ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to the ſcorn and laughter of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, thro' all ages. The ſuperſtitions of the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> were groſs and numberleſs; and their worſhip of the meaneſt animals, and indeed of things inanimate, was beyond meaſure contemptible. And yet they had an opinion with reſpect to God, that erred even on the ſide of ſpirituality. For they held that he is not to be addreſſed by mortals ſo much as in vocal prayer. <note n="†" place="bottom">See Parker on Idolatry, p. 43.</note>This is at once an inſtance of ſtrong belief, and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken veneration. The great attributes of the Deity are aſſerted by writers of all ſorts, by philoſophers, and by poets, and in terms of the fulleſt ſignificancy. His ſpirituality, omnipotence, omnipreſence, independence, inviſibility, and incomprehenſible nature, are
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:1123800600:171"/>
ſet in a very ſtrong light by <hi>Pagan</hi> authors; particularly by <hi>Pythagoras, Plato, Anaxago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras, Cicero, Porphyry, Seneca, Homer,</hi> and the <hi>Greek Dramatiſts. (x)</hi> I have not time or occaſion to produce my authorities here. The truth is, many <hi>goodly pearls</hi> of ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive doctrine are to be found amongſt the rubbiſh of <hi>Pagan</hi> antiquity; and they ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kingly contraſt an enormous <hi>farrago</hi> of tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionary error, radical prejudice, vulgar folly, and popular ſuperſtition. They are the ſentiments of minds that ſeem to have been enlightened beyond the conceptions of the bulk of mankind. If we ſeparate the carnal <hi>droſs</hi> from the ſpiritual <hi>bullion</hi> of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſm, we ſhall be able to extract a body of theoretic divinity from the old <hi>Pagans,</hi> little if at all inferior to the fineſt <hi>unitarian</hi> ſyſtem. In ſhort, if <hi>Arianiſm</hi> be not ſtrictly <hi>polytheiſm,</hi> it is not much better; it is maintainable only on much the ſame ground, and by a ſimilar mode of reaſoning.</p>
            <p>Surely a <hi>Tully,</hi> or a <hi>Plato,</hi> had as admiſſible an apology for his conformity to idolatrous
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:1123800600:172"/>
ſervices, in general prepoſſeſſion, and national eſtabliſhment, as the modern unbeliever has for his ſecondary worſhip, in any diſtiction he may affect to make between <hi>Pagan</hi> and <hi>Arian</hi> theology. For unleſs the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures direct us in the plaineſt manner, and with all poſſible cautiouſneſs of expreſſion, NOT <hi>to honour the Son even as we honour the Father;</hi> if they do not clearly and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formly diſtinguiſh between <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and the <hi>Supreme God,</hi> in point of <hi>nature,</hi> or <hi>eſſence;</hi> or, in other words, if <hi>Arianiſm</hi> has not a moſt firm foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation in the ſacred pages, and in apoſtolical and primitive worſhip, we cannot honeſtly reſolve it into any thing but the pride of human reaſon, fabricating its own theory, and <hi>reſiſting the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> Now the inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity of its pretences has, I perſuade myſelf been ſufficiently ſhewn already; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are to reject its hypotheſis, together with that of <hi>Socinianiſm,</hi> as reſpectively aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to eſtabliſh <hi>another doctrine</hi> than <hi>that</hi> we have <hi>received;</hi> as fundamentally erroneous, and abſolutely repugnant to the genius and ſpirit of Chriſtianity.</p>

            <p>THE Apoſtle, as appears from the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument he proſecutes throughout this epiſtle, had, in the words juſt read, an eye to thoſe <hi>Jewiſh</hi> converts who were ſo zeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly attached to the <hi>Moſaic</hi> ritual, the <hi>law</hi> of their <hi>fathers,</hi> that they could not endure to ſee it ſuperſeded by the more liberal, the more pure, the more ſublime principles of the Goſpel.

<pb n="160" facs="tcp:1123800600:175"/>
imbecility of allegation, conſtruction, and exception on the part of infidelity, I ſtand engaged to make appear in the following diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>That pride, or prepoſſeſſion ſhould be te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacious of any opinion however ſtrange, or however extravagant, will be no matter of ſurprize to us when we recollect, that almoſt every thing which we ſee not by immediate intuition, or which is not capable of a ſtrictly mathematical demonſtration, may be ſtarted, and upheld for a ſubject of diſpute. It is poſſible indeed, and it ſometimes happens, that men ſhall reaſon injudiciouſly and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concluſively even in a righteous cauſe; and truth may ſuffer, or rather be ſuppoſed to ſuffer by precipitance of paſſion, or inadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency of zeal. This before now has been the caſe with the cauſe before us. A pious wiſh to confirm the doctrine of the <hi>Trinity</hi> by producing multifarious evidence, and heaping proof upon proof; <hi>(y)</hi> or an earneſt endeavour to elucidate a point, the knowlege of which is too wonderful and excellent for
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:1123800600:176"/>
the attainment of human wiſdom, by meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſical nicety, and the ſagacity of abſtract ſpeculation; <hi>(z)</hi> or by ſtudied ſimilitudes, and artificial alluſions, to bring it nearer to our conceptions; all this has been hurtful to the intereſt of religion, and <hi>given occaſion to the enemy</hi> to ridicule, if not to <hi>blaſpheme.</hi> Erroneous conſtructions, and miſapplication of particular paſſages, betray too often a want of moderation, or of ſkill in interpreters. But, all this while, a charge of unſkilfulneſs, or of prevarication, or of perverſeneſs, or of preſumption, or of inſincerity, or of intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, will come with a very ill grace from our adverſaries; and we are to look on the ſide of infidelity for the moſt viſible ſigns of weakneſs, and the ſureſt tokens of conſcious diſtreſs. I am apt to believe, you will ſoon be convinced by a few ſelect particulars that this is not arbitarily, or groundleſsly ſaid.</p>
            <p>I ſhall hardly be called upon to apologize for freedoms I ſhall be obliged to take with authors who are no more. It will be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowleged, with reſpect to every <hi>Arian</hi> &amp;c.

of note, that, to miſchievous purpoſe, he <hi>being dead yet ſpeaketh.</hi> To proceed then.</p>
            <p>That when we are baptized <hi>in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> we are baptized in the name of three Perſons, and of three Divine Perſons, and of three equally Divine Perſons, <note n="*" place="bottom">See Lightfoot's Harm. of the N.

For elſe we are baptized in the name of <hi>two</hi> Perſons and <hi>one</hi> virtue or quality, &amp;c. which is a notion pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pably ridiculous; or we are baptized in the name of <hi>three</hi> Perſons, betwixt the <hi>firſt</hi> and <hi>two latter</hi> of which there is an infinite diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parity; (there being no medium between God and a creature;) which is a ſuppoſition not leſs ridiculous.

expreſsly ſays,—<hi>I am the God of Bethel,</hi>—we are to underſtand him as in effect ſaying only, <hi>my Father, whom I repreſent, is God of Bethel.</hi> Such is the ſenſe of theſe expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors; who however kindly and <hi>logically</hi> grant that <hi>the Word was with God,</hi> or, in plain terms, exiſted from all eternity, tho' not <hi>actually,</hi> yet <hi>potentially!</hi> One is tempted to ſpeak ludicrouſly by the extravagance of theſe conceits.

            <p>Let us take a view of another famous writer's ſentiments on this important ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.—Mr. <hi>Whiſton,</hi> after acknowleging <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> (whom he calls <gap reason="foreign">

               </q> ſuppoſes him to have been <q>truly and really concerned in the
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:1123800600:184"/>
creation of the world.</q> But, obſerve, he was a Creator merely by commiſſion; &amp;c. <q>it being (according to this author) unfit and impoſſible for the DIVINE NATURE ITSELF, or at leaſt THAT OF THE FA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THER, to be ſo much, and in ſuch a manner concerned with the corporeal world, and the ſinful race of mankind, as we every where find this DIVINE PERSON, our bleſſed Mediator, to have been.</q> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Whiſton's Solution, &amp;c. p. 254.</note>And ſo we are obliged to this philoſopher for his wonderful diſcovery, that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> tho' a DIVINE PERSON with all the attributes &amp;c. and the "incommunicable name of the God of <hi>Iſrael,"</hi> was yet without the DI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VINE NATURE, becauſe it is impoſſible for the DIVINE NATURE to act in the abſtract; or at leaſt for THAT of the FATHER to do ſo, which, it ſeems, is ſomething <hi>diſtinct</hi> from, or ſuperior to the <hi>Divine!</hi> If this is not Chriſtianity, it is tolerable Platoniſm.</p>

Dr.</hi> Clarke <hi>not unartfully tells us, that</hi> 
               <q>the reaſon why the Scripture, tho' it ſtiles the Father God, and alſo ſtiles the Son God, yet at the ſame time always declares that there is but one God, is, becauſe in the monarchy of the univerſe there is but one authority, origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal in the Father, derivative in the Son: the power of the Son being not another power oppoſite to that of the Father, nor another power co-ordinate to that of the Father, but itſelf the power and authority of the Father, communicated to, manifeſted in, and exerciſed by the Son.</q>

            <p>We not unfrequently meet with interpreters who agree in oppoſition to the catholic ſenſe of a paſſage, but differ in the mode of

But <hi>Grotius,</hi> unwilling, as it ſhould ſeem, that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> ſhould be ſuppoſed to have any concern in the creation, even as an agent or miniſter, gives us to know, that the <hi>worlds</hi> were <hi>made</hi> not <hi>by</hi> him, but <hi>for</hi> him, or for his ſake; agreeably enough to part of a text juſt now cited, and agreably to the notion of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Rabbins, that the world was made for the <hi>Meſſiah.</hi> Now, in the firſt place, not to inſiſt with Dr. <hi>Whitby,</hi> that this conſtruction manifeſtly wreſts the prepoſition <gap reason="foreign">

               <hi>by the glory of the Father,</hi> (the ſingle one with which he ſupports his interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,) without obſcuring, or confounding our ideas of the divine operations. For, according to our author, <hi>God</hi> the <hi>Father made the worlds</hi> for the <hi>glory</hi> of his <hi>Son,</hi> but raiſed up that Son from the dead for his own <hi>glory.—Chriſt was raiſed from the dead for the glory of the Father,</hi> ſays our commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tator; ſo that by this interpretation the Apoſtle in effect affirms, that <hi>Chriſt was raiſed from the dead by the Father for the glory of the Father:</hi> which at beſt is uncouth phraſeolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy. But let us ſee how the paſſage will fare under the management of <hi>Socinus</hi> and his followers.

Are not theſe ſeveral expoſitions as irreconcileable as light and darkneſs? And have we not reaſon in abundance rather to reject both, than to ſubſcribe to either? I juſt obſerve farther; that <hi>Grotius</hi> had been more conſiſtent, had he done no violence to the prepoſition aforeſaid, and adopted the <hi>Socinian</hi> interpretation.

            <p>But this is not the only inſtance of this great writer's inconſiſtency with others and with himſelf. Convinced by ocular demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the reſurrection of his Maſter, <hi>Thomas anſwered and ſaid,</hi> that is, ſay ſome very gravely, in effect cried out, or exclaimed, <hi>My Lord, and my God.</hi> For, it ſeems, this is not the language of confeſſion, but of aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment! <hi>Grotius</hi> however ſees this matter in a very different light. <q>Hic primum, ſays he, ea vox in narratione Evangelica reperitur ab Apoſtolis Jeſu tributa, poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam ſcilicet ſua reſurrectione probaverat,

            <p>And yet we are not much obliged to this eminent commentator for an acknowlege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which appears to have been forced from him. In the firſt place, it is not true that Chriſt is ſtyled God purely becauſe he is <hi>the reſurrection and the life,</hi> as is here more than intimated. It is not true, that he is ſo called by the Apoſtles and firſt Chriſtians, merely on the ſtrength of the paſſage before us. For though the terms in which St. <hi>Thomas</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares his conviction, <hi>My Lord, and my God,</hi> occur not before, nor poſſibly could, Chriſt is not only in effect in many places, but alſo expreſsly ſtyled God in this Goſpel. In the next place it is worth remarking, that this
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:1123800600:192"/>
author in ſome ſort at leaſt aſſerts the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Chriſt from a text, of which, when he takes it ſeparately in hand, he queſtions the authenticity. <note n="*" place="bottom">See Grotius on Rom. ix. 5.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The truth is, we find too many among us perpetually leaning to the ſide of infidelity, by ſoftening and qualifying as much as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible the ſenſe of texts which are quoted every day on the part of the orthodox. An eminent commentator ſuppoſes the firſt prayer of the Apoſtles, <hi>Thou Lord, who knoweſt the hearts of all men, ſhew whether of theſe two thou haſt choſen,</hi> to be addreſs'd not to <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> but ſimply to God. <hi>Whoſoever ſhall call on the name of the Lord ſhall be ſaved,</hi> ſays St. <hi>Peter</hi> in his diſcourſe on the <hi>day of Pentecoſt;</hi> i. e. ſays Dr. <hi>Pyle,</hi> 
               <q>Whoſoever ſhall believe and embrace his religion;</q> which paraphraſe plainly reprobates the idea of invocation on <hi>Chriſt.</hi> The reference of the words <hi>he is Lord of all,</hi> in St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs to <hi>Cornelius,</hi> either to God the Father,

or to <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> is at beſt perverſely ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular; and ſurely neither juſt nor natural. <hi>To this end,</hi> ſays St. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Romans, Chriſt both died and roſe, &amp;c. that he might be Lord both of the dead and living;</hi>

<pb n="182" facs="tcp:1123800600:197"/>
glories, being the firſt and grand article in the covenant with <hi>Abraham;</hi> and which he fails not to aſſert among the ſingular privileges of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> (Ch. v. 11.) when he is ſhewing that the ſubjects of their glorying were not inferior to thoſe of the <hi>Jews.</hi> How could he overlook the main article of this liſt?

                  </gap>) might be very eaſily tranſpoſed. This is only my conjecture.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Now I beg leave to aſk, whether our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notator was under an abſolute neceſſity of conjecturing? Conjectures, I preſume, are
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:1123800600:198"/>
never admiſſible in criticiſm, but when they clear the ſenſe of an author from obſcurity; or when direct abſurdities, or conſiderable difficulties are removed by them. Is either of theſe caſes the caſe at preſent? So far from it, that unleſs we are to ſacrifice ſenſe to figure, and real truth to ideal climax, I affirm without ceremony the old and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal reading to be the only right one; and that this paſſage, abundantly plain and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent in itſelf, is here obſcured by elucida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and marred by amendment. Mr. T. in fact ſmothers himſelf in a duſt of his own raiſing. For though, in a ſpirit of true com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, and in the tendereſt affection to his brethren, &amp;c. the Apoſtle calls to mind their national character, and many of the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges they had enjoyed, yet at the time of his writing this Epiſtle, it ſhould be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered, that their grand privilege of all, as our author juſtly terms it, that which the <hi>Jews</hi> conſtantly made their boaſt of, and <q>which was indeed the glory of all their glories,</q> was abſolutely loſt, and irreco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verably <hi>done away</hi> for ever.

               <hi>their</hi> God in any ſenſe favourable to them; they were diſowned; they were <hi>cut off</hi> by him, to uſe St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s words in another place; the believing <hi>Gentiles</hi> were now <q>more nearly related to him;</q> 
               <hi>they</hi> were <hi>purified</hi> to be a <hi>peculiar people;</hi> and <hi>Jews,</hi> as <hi>Jews,</hi> had no manner of intereſt in the new diſpenſation: ſo that, according to this author's conſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Apoſtle falſifies fact, and inſults his <hi>kinſmen,</hi> by way of commiſeration.</p>
            <p>There is another text which the ſame au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor handles not leſs to his own diſadvantage. <hi>Every houſe is builded by ſome man,</hi> ſays the writer of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> Ch. iii. 4. <hi>but he that built all things is God.</hi> Mr. T's. paraphraſe is as follows. <q>When he ſaith, <hi>every houſe is builded by ſome perſon, but he who built all things is God,</hi> he evidently diſtinguiſhes between a <hi>ſubordinate</hi> and <hi>Supreme</hi> builder. But this diſtinction he needed not to have mentioned, had he not ſpoke of a <hi>ſubordinate</hi> builder before. For, if in the caſe under conſideration, there be no <hi>ſubordinate</hi> builder at all, this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:1123800600:200"/>
is nothing to his purpoſe. Then his argument would have been; <hi>Chriſt</hi> muſt build the houſe; becauſe no one could build it but he; ſeeing no houſe is built by any but God. Whereas, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwiſe, he aſſerts a <hi>ſubordinate</hi> builder, and tells us ſuch a one is conſiſtent with God's being the <hi>Supreme</hi> original builder.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Now, I take it, this is a mere fanciful diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction of Mr. <hi>Taylor</hi>'s own brain. The context runs thus. <hi>This man was counted worthy of more glory than Moſes, inaſmuch as he who hath builded the houſe, hath more honour than the houſe: for every houſe is builded by ſome man, but he that built all things is God.</hi> Surely he <hi>that built all things,</hi> he who made the world was the very Perſon or Being that <hi>built the houſe,</hi> as the Apoſtle expreſſes it; i. e. who founded the whole <hi>Jewiſh</hi> OEco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy, eccleſiaſtical and civil; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, though <hi>every houſe is builded by ſome man,</hi> though every inſtitution, &amp;c. has ſome author, and <hi>Moſes</hi> in particular may be ſaid to be a founder in a ſecondary ſenſe, <hi>Jeſus</hi>
               <pb n="186" facs="tcp:1123800600:201"/>
               <hi>Chriſt</hi> is ſtrictly and properly the Supreme Architect, as we may ſay, as well in the one as the other of the above inſtances, to the total excluſion of every idea of <hi>ſubordination.</hi> And ſo this very paſſage in effect plainly aſſerts our Saviour's Divinity, and confirms the <hi>Supremacy</hi> this Gentleman appears to be extremely forward to deſtroy by it. It is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable enough that the texts under conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration have been before now a <hi>ſnare</hi> to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers. For the <hi>Socinian</hi> gloſs on them is, <q>that Chriſt is as much more excellent than <hi>Moſes</hi> as God is more excellent than his own people;</q> and this ſuperexcellence is on all hands allowed not to come one jot ſhort of abſolute infinity.</p>
            <p>In conſequence of the ſhifts to which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity is reduced, it will add, omit, affirm, and ſuggeſt, ſometimes arbitrarily, ſometimes imprudently, and ſometimes on weak and incompetent authority. That paſſage in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s firſt Epiſtle to <hi>Timothy, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy great is the myſtery of godlineſs;</hi>

And that they do ſo purely by the help of a ſuppoſititious reading, which can be ſupported only by a ſtrained, incoherent, and ridiculous conſtruction, (according to which the <hi>myſtery of godlineſs</hi> was <hi>manifeſt in the fleſh,</hi> and <hi>received up into glory,</hi> &amp;c. in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,)</hi> hath been abundantly ſhewn by many, and eſpecially by the learned Biſhop <hi>Pearſon</hi> in his <hi>Expoſition of the Creed.</hi>

And if ſo, infidelity would appear at beſt to ſtand upon a precarious foundation, as far as it depends on the ſpuriouſneſs of this text; and we ſhould ſurely err with more prudence and modeſty on the ſide of the Catholic Church, than againſt her.

and therefore could hardly be ſaid to ſubſiſt without it.</q> To this performance I refer you with pleaſure.</p>
            <p>It has been urged, and with an air of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> cannot be an object of divine worſhip, becauſe in that excellent form of addreſs to the Deity which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended to his diſciples, there is not the leaſt mention made of himſelf, nor the moſt diſtant alluſion to his office and character.

            <p>There are two remarkable paſſages in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epiſtles, which, as they are claimed by our adverſaries with more appearance of right than the foregoing, it will be proper to take into conſideration. <hi>Who</hi> (i. e. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt) being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God, but made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of no reputation,</hi> &amp;c. <note n="‡" place="bottom">Phil. ii. 6. &amp;c.</note>This text is often quoted as aſſerting the true Divinity of our Saviour. I am therefore concerned to deliver
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:1123800600:206"/>
it from the conſtruction which the <hi>Arians</hi> with much aſſurance put upon it; and which many amongſt ourſelves have, I think, very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warily admitted; ſubjecting themſelves there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to the neceſſity of having recourſe to a hack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neyed, and after all mere verbal diſtinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>ſelf-exiſtence and neceſſary exiſtence,</hi> in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to reconcile their admiſſion with orthodox principles. <hi>Thought it not robbery,</hi> &amp;c. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, i. e. (ſays <hi>Novatian</hi> and many with him,) he never compared himſelf with God the Father, <hi>nunquam ſe Deo Patri aut comparavit aut contulit;</hi> the reaſon follows, <hi>memor ſe eſſe ex ſuo Patre.</hi> Every <hi>Arian</hi> will abide by this explication; and how do the advocates for <hi>Novatian</hi> get clear of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted conſequences? Why, ſays <hi>Dr. Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> 
               <q>this interpretation of the text (ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing it juſt) implies no more than this, that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> never pretended to an equality with the Father in reſpect of his <hi>original,</hi> knowing himſelf to be ſecond only in order, not the firſt Perſon of the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſſed Trinity.</q> Dr. W. obſerves, that the whole paſſage in <hi>Novatian,</hi> rightly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:1123800600:207"/>
affords a ſtrong proof of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equality of the two Perſons; and that it is quoted accordingly by Dr. <hi>Whitby</hi> in his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe <hi>de vera Chriſti deitate.</hi> But as this can only be done by help of the above diſtinction, I muſt aſk, why <hi>Novatian's</hi> ſenſe of this text muſt be admitted as the true one? He did not <hi>affect,</hi> ſay ſome, did not <hi>claim,</hi> did not <hi>take upon him,</hi> &amp;c. to be honoured as God. Notwithſtanding the great authorities of <hi>Grotius, Tillotſon,</hi> and <hi>Clarke,</hi> &amp;c. <note n="*" place="bottom">See Mr. Parkhurſt's Note at p. 79 of his Treatiſe on the Divinity and Pre-exiſtence of our Saviour.</note>with which this interpretation is fortified, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not help thinking the reading in uſe, <hi>thought it not robbery to be equal with God,</hi> not barely to be the more eligible, but indeed the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per reading. For, not to inſiſt on one cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance in its favour, which is the non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreement of the ſeveral interpretations of the learned Gentlemen above-mentioned, it deſerves to be noted, that though the phraſe <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> would admit the conſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion contended for, yet the context will be found abſolutely to revolt againſt it. Grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the phraſe <hi>being in the form of God</hi> to be
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:1123800600:208"/>
in itſelf of undeterminate ſignification, yet when predicated of him who is <hi>one</hi> with the <hi>Father,</hi> who <hi>was in the beginning with God,</hi> and really and truly <hi>was God,</hi> it certainly is to be regarded as ſynonymous with thoſe expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; and conſequently as importing an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire equality with God. But herewith the conſtruction of <hi>Novation,</hi> and of the <hi>Arians,</hi> not to ſay of Dr. W. himſelf, is totally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compatible. The reading in uſe therefore muſt be allowed to be not only natural, but neceſſary. <hi>He thought it not robbery,</hi> i. e. to be no violation of right, or juſtice.</p>
            <p>The other paſſage is the following. <hi>There is one body,</hi> ſays the Apoſtle to the Epheſians, and <hi>one Spirit; one Lord, one Faith, one Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm; one God, and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all.</hi> Chap. iv. 4. &amp;c. The <hi>Socinian</hi> and the <hi>Arian</hi> inference from theſe texts is obvious; but in proof that it is an unfair one, I would remark, that had St. <hi>Paul</hi> intended here to have diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed the <hi>Father</hi> from the <hi>Son</hi> and the
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:1123800600:209"/>
               <hi>Spirit,</hi> by this aſcription of Supremacy, he would certainly have named the two latter with their ſeverally diſcriminating inferior titles; and this without a needleſs, and I might ſay, impertinent combination of <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi> if I may ſo call them. Beſides, had this been the Apoſtle's deſign, how comes it to paſs that ſupremacy is in almoſt the ſame terms aſcribed in the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> to <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> whoſe <hi>throne is for ever and ever,</hi> who is <hi>Lord of all, who is over all, God bleſſed for ever?</hi> Or how are we to account for its being ſo frequently ſaid, that both <hi>Chriſt</hi> and the <hi>Spirit</hi> as well as the <hi>Father</hi> is <hi>in us?</hi> If the manifeſt attribution of Supremacy in the texts juſt now cited does not exclude the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> why muſt it be underſtood in the place under conſideration to exclude the <hi>Son?</hi> The ſame queſtion may be aſked with the ſame propriety, and with the ſame ſucceſs, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the following well-known paſſages in the firſt Epiſtle to <hi>Tim.</hi> which, I believe, the Anti-trinitarians in general ſet with much aſſurance at the head of their authorities.</p>

               <q>If Chriſt be preached that he roſe from the dead, how ſay ſome among you that there is no reſurrection of the dead?</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THAT important article of our Creeds, the <hi>Reſurrection of the Body,</hi> is the other great <hi>myſtery</hi> which has all along been <hi>fooliſhneſs</hi> to Infidels, and a <hi>ſtumbling-block</hi> to many Chriſtians. Under this article then I am to endeavour, agreeably to my engagements, to give all the ſatisfaction which the ſenſible, the candid, and the well-diſpoſed can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire.</p>
            <p>I might inſiſt that the great doctrine before us is virtually at leaſt contained in my text:
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:1123800600:219"/>
but as there is a ſtrong propenſity in human pride to conſider what is propounded to our faith as inſulting our underſtandings, it will be neceſſary to enter into a full and even minute diſcuſſion of the ſubject.</p>
            <p>A late ingenious author, Dr. <hi>Sykes,</hi> very confidently aſſerts, that this doctrine has no manner of warrant from ſcriptural authority. He obſerves, as Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> has done before him, that <q>there is not any ſuch expreſſion in the New Teſtament as the <hi>Reſurrection of the fleſh;</hi> that the Scriptures often ſpeak of a <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> and of the <hi>Reſurrection of the dead;</hi> but as to the <hi>Reſurrection of the body, or of the fleſh,</hi> there is not one word. And therefore that ſuch an article was required <hi>at firſt</hi> to be profeſſed in order to Baptiſm, can never be proved.</q>

            <p>I have already apologized for freedoms taken with the dead. The names I juſt now mentioned are of the firſt authority with unbelievers at this day; and I take a part in the controverſy with a hope to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:1123800600:220"/>
it to your content, if not by recency of argument, or reply, at leaſt by the mode of their enforcement.</p>
            <p>Now that the above expreſſions or phraſes,—the <hi>Reſurrection of the body,</hi> or <hi>the fleſh,</hi> never occur in the New Teſtament; that this article, together with ſome others which Dr. <hi>S.</hi> mentions, did not make a part of the <hi>Baptiſmal Creed</hi> before the middle of the fourth century, may without difficulty be admitted; becauſe if it will appear, that the <hi>Reſurrection of the body,</hi> or <hi>of the fleſh,</hi> is moſt unqueſtionably the doctrine of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and of the Apoſtolical and primitive Church, we are bound by all means to retain it; and its inſertion into the <hi>Creed</hi> at <hi>any</hi> time was both proper and neceſſary; the original <hi>Creed,</hi> whatever it preciſely was, having been reaſonably enlarged, (by Dr. <hi>S</hi>'s own confeſſion), as circumſtances de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, and hereſies multiplied.</p>
            <p>Let us enquire then, whether the doctrine of the <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> as it is delivered in our
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:1123800600:221"/>
               <hi>Creeds,</hi> be not founded in evidence rational, ſcriptural, and irreſiſtible.</p>
            <p>If we conſider this doctrine as a matter of opinion, and not of faith, we ſhall find it to have countenance in no contemptible autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. Tho' the heathens ſaw <hi>ſpiritual things</hi> in general thro' a dim <hi>glaſs</hi> indeed; tho' the proſpect of futurity was greatly clouded to a world almoſt wholly corrupt in principle, and abandoned in practice, yet the notion of another ſtate, and even of a <hi>reſurrection,</hi> or of a <hi>renovation</hi> of all things, which is a <hi>reſurrection</hi> in effect, was far from being univerſally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploded, as abſolutely ridiculous, or chimeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal. We are aſſured <hi>Zorouſtres</hi> taught the doctrine of the <hi>reſurrection</hi> among the antient <hi>Perſians,</hi> as he himſelf derived it moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably from the <hi>Jews,</hi> with whom he had communications. <hi>Grotius,</hi> who, with reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to this article at leaſt, was not of <hi>doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful mind,</hi> in proof of the admiſſible poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the thing, cites the authorities both of hiſtorians and philoſophers, and affirms it to have been the tenet of almoſt the whole ſect of the Stoics. <note n="*" place="bottom">See Grotius de vent. l. 7. and 10.

cuſtom of burying the dead with their faces upwards, and looking toward the riſing Sun, which is exactly the Chriſtian mode, has a very ſtrong ſmatch of this ſentiment. <hi>(aa)</hi> 'Tis obſervable, <hi>Mahomet</hi> ſpeaks in his <hi>Koran</hi> of the <hi>reſurrection</hi> as of a doctrine known and received in the world from the beginning, and far antecedently to the <hi>Moſaic</hi> diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

In his note at the 19th verſe of the 26th chapter of Iſaiah,—<hi>Thy dead men ſhall live, together with my dead body ſhall they ariſe,</hi> &amp;c. the learned Bp. <hi>Lowth</hi> obſerves, that the doctrine of the <hi>reſurrection of the dead</hi> muſt have been "a popular and common doctrine" among the <hi>Jews,</hi> at the time of the delivery of this prophecy; and we may reaſonably make the ſame inference from a parallel paſſage in <hi>Daniel;—many of them that ſleep in the duſt of the earth ſhall awake; &amp;c. many,</hi> as I find it noted by the judicious commentator, being here and elſewhere manifeſtly equivalent to <hi>all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the notion of a <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the common acceptation of the term, prevailed among the <hi>Jews</hi> in our Saviour's time, will be ſoon manifeſt from certain occurrences and paſſages in the evangelical writings. St. <hi>Paul,</hi> in his apology before King <hi>Agrippa,</hi> affirms it to have its founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the <hi>hope of the promiſe made unto the Fathers:</hi> tho' when, where, or in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, he mentions not. And certain it is that the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> the <hi>ſtraiteſt</hi> and moſt

conſiderable <hi>Sect</hi> among them, not only en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained this notion with ſeriouſneſs, but contended for it with vehemency; as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from the violence of oppoſition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them and the <hi>Sadducees,</hi> who as ſtre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuouſly denied it. What then did both parties underſtand by it? Let us, for a reſolution of this queſtion, turn firſt to the account which the evangeliſts give us of a diſcourſe held by the <hi>Sadducees</hi> with our Saviour, on the ſubject of the <hi>Reſurrection. The ſame day,</hi> ſays St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> and much in the ſame words, St. <hi>Mark,</hi> and St. <hi>Luke</hi> after him, <hi>came to him the Sadducees, who ſay that there is no Reſurrection, and aſked him, ſaying, Maſter, Moſes ſaid, if a man die having no children, his brother ſhall marry his wife, and raiſe up ſeed unto his brother: now there were with us ſeven brethren; and the firſt when he had married a wife, deceaſed; and having no iſſue left his wife to his brother; likewiſe the ſecond alſo, and the third, to the ſeventh. And laſt of all, the woman died alſo. Therefore in the Reſurrection whoſe wife ſhall ſhe be of the ſeven, for they all</hi>
               <pb n="210" facs="tcp:1123800600:225"/>
               <hi>had her.</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Matt. 22. 23. &amp;c.</note>The argument herein implied is indeed perfectly ridiculous, and groſſly car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal; and is expoſed accordingly by our bleſſed Lord in his reply to it: but it unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niably ſuppoſes the <hi>reſurrection</hi> of the <hi>bodies</hi> of theſe ſame <hi>brethren</hi> and their <hi>wife,</hi> agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably to the <hi>Phariſaical</hi> hypotheſis. Indeed that very reply plainly ſuppoſes the ſame thing. <hi>Ye do err, not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God. For in the reſurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, but are as the angels of God in heaven.</hi> All this is abundantly confirmed by our Saviour's own argument immediately follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. <hi>As touching the reſurrection of the dead, have you not read that which was ſpoken to you by God, ſaying, I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Iſaac, and the God of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.</hi> There is neither connection, nor indeed ſenſe in this portion of ſcripture<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hiſtory, unleſs we ſuppoſe the re-union of the <hi>ſouls</hi> and <hi>bodies</hi> of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Iſaac,</hi> &amp;c. in the <hi>reſurrection;</hi> and that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:1123800600:226"/>
meant by implication to aſſert it. For his argument directly proves nothing more than the immortality of the ſoul, and its conſequential exiſtence in a future ſtate. But had this proof been the ſole object of his diſcourſe, he would moſt aſſuredly have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed himſelf in a very different manner upon the occaſion. Our Lord's meaning is yet more fully diſcovered by St. <hi>Luke</hi>'s ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of this matter. <hi>Now that the dead are raiſed,</hi> ſays he, according to that Evangeliſt, EVEN <hi>Moſes ſhewed at the buſh,</hi> ſaying, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Again: When our Lord told <hi>Martha,</hi> that her <hi>brother,</hi> newly deceaſed, ſhould <hi>riſe again, ſhe ſaid unto him,</hi> ſays the ſacred text, <hi>I know that he ſhall riſe again in the reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at the laſt day.</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">John xi. 24.</note>Now that <hi>Martha</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved her <hi>brother ſhould riſe again at the laſt day</hi> with that <hi>body</hi> which was laid in the grave, and had been <hi>dead four days,</hi> is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent enough from this conſideration; that, though ſhe appears to have been doubtful of the poſſibility of his reſurrection at <hi>that</hi> time,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:1123800600:227"/>
and in ſo <hi>extraordinary</hi> a way, <hi>Lord,</hi> ſays ſhe, <hi>by this time he ſtinketh,</hi> and this notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding <hi>her</hi> avowed belief that <hi>whatſoever</hi> our Saviour would <hi>aſk of God, God would give it</hi> him, and <hi>his</hi> declaration that he was him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf <hi>the reſurrection and the life,</hi> yet when <hi>Lazarus</hi> actually <hi>came forth,</hi> neither ſhe nor the many <hi>Jews</hi> who were preſent ſhewed the leaſt ſign of amazement. It does not appear that they were in any degree aſtoniſhed at this mode of his reſtoration to life; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we may juſtly preſume they were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded that <hi>in the reſurrection at the laſt day</hi> "all men ſhall riſe again with their bodies," through the operation of that omnipotent power which, <hi>in the twinkling of an eye,</hi> is able to inſpire life and vigour into duſt and aſhes, and animate corruption itſelf.</p>
            <p>The ſuppoſed <hi>reſurrection</hi> of <hi>John the Baptiſt</hi> may be conſidered in the ſame point of view. <hi>Herod,</hi> hearing of the <hi>fame of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, ſaid unto his ſervants,</hi> as the Evangeliſt acquaints us, <hi>this is John the Baptiſt, he is riſen from the dead, and therefore mighty</hi>
               <pb n="213" facs="tcp:1123800600:228"/>
               <hi>works do ſhew forth themſelves in him. Herod</hi> hardly thought theſe <hi>works</hi> were done by the ſpirit or apparition of the <hi>Baptiſt;</hi> and if not, we muſt conclude that he believed him to be riſen indeed, according to the notions entertained by the <hi>Jews.</hi> The ſacred hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory informs us the <hi>Sadducees</hi> were <hi>grieved</hi> that the Apoſtles <hi>preached through Jeſus the reſurrection from the dead.</hi> And is it not as plain as implication can make it, that their doctrine was, that the followers of Jeſus, and indeed all men, ſhould be raiſed in like manner as he was?</p>
            <p>The truth is, of this kind of implied evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence we have plenty in the ſacred volume. I will only produce one piece more of Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-hiſtory, in preſumptive proof that <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi> as well as <hi>Jews</hi> underſtood by a <hi>reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection</hi> what we do at this day. St. <hi>Paul</hi> concludes his diſcourſe to the <hi>Athenians</hi> with inſiſting on the certainty of a future judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the <hi>aſſurance</hi> which God had <hi>given to all men</hi> of it, by his having <hi>raiſed that man, whom he had ordained to be their judge,</hi>
               <pb n="214" facs="tcp:1123800600:229"/>
               <hi>from the dead. And when they heard of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of the dead,</hi> ſays the hiſtorian, <hi>ſome mocked;</hi> but <hi>others ſaid, we will hear thee again of this matter.</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Acts xvii. 32.</note>Now St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence conſiſted chiefly of <hi>Stoics</hi> and <hi>Epicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reans;</hi> and the latter moſt undoubtedly were the party that derided the doctrine which the former did not conceive to be altogether ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant, or ridiculous. But had the Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle meant only to inculcate the general doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of a future ſtate, the <hi>Stoics</hi> in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability would have been ſatisfied as to that point without a farther hearing; and the <hi>Epicureans</hi> would have no more <hi>mocked,</hi> or inſulted, than if a <hi>Stoic</hi> had preached it.</p>
            <p>Indeed there is one circumſtance in the evangelical hiſtory which at firſt glance may be thought to militate againſt what has been laid before you. When our Saviour <hi>came down from the mountain</hi> after his <hi>Transfigura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> with <hi>Peter, James, and John, and charged them that they ſhould tell no man what things they had ſeen, till the Son of man were riſen</hi>
               <pb n="215" facs="tcp:1123800600:230"/>
               <hi>from the dead, they kept that ſaying with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, queſtioning one with another, what the riſing from the dead ſhould mean.</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Mark ix. 10.</note>But that they could not poſſibly doubt what was to be underſtood by the expreſſion, or the thing itſelf, is demonſtrable from preceding con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations; and therefore the caſe muſt have been this. They were perplexed with the account our Lord had given of himſelf; they could not conceive how their Maſter, whom they ſtill regarded as a temporal deliverer, ſhould ſuffer and be put to an ignominious death, (as he had aſſured them he ſhould in the 31<hi rend="sup">st</hi> v. of the laſt Chapter;) or how the expected deliverance would be effected by, or after ſuch reſurrection: this was probably the ſubject of their enquiry; they <hi>queſtioned one with another,</hi> not what THE, but what HIS <hi>riſing from the dead ſhould mean.</hi> All this is perfectly conſiſtent with a parallel paſſage in St. <hi>Luke. He took unto him the twelve, and ſaid unto them, Behold, we go up to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, and all things that are written by the prophets concerning the Son of man ſhall be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed.</hi>
               <pb n="216" facs="tcp:1123800600:231"/>
               <hi>For he ſhall be delivered unto the Gentiles, and ſhall be mocked, and ſpitefully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated and ſpitted on; and they ſhall ſcourge him, and put him to death: and the third day he ſhall riſe again. And they underſtood none of theſe things: and this ſaying was hid from them, neither knew they the things which were ſpoken.</hi> Luke xviii. 31.</p>
            <p>What has already been advanced will ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate a common aſſertion, or inſinuation, that there is a very material difference between the caſe of a body which has been dead a few days, or months, or even years, and of one which has been buried in the earth many centuries ſince; and that the ſame Power which is able to effect a <hi>reſurrection</hi> in the former caſe, cannot be conceived adequate to the like operation in the latter. And indeed it deſerves to be remarked, that to maintain, or to intimate this, is at beſt to make ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely free with Omnipotence, and in fact only begs a queſtion inſtead of ſatisfying it. Beſides, this expedient will appear to be hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily encumbered with ſtrange inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences;
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:1123800600:232"/>
to ſpeak much leſs harſhly of it than perhaps in juſtice I ſhould. When a finite underſtanding has laid the line which infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite power cannot paſs, it will have a fair claim to our attention; although, even were this done, the number of inſtances we meet with in holy writ of the ſame identical body's being raiſed from the grave, or reſtored to life, which had actually deceaſed, will how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever juſtify our ſuppoſition, that the bodies of ſuch as ſhall die within a reaſonable time before the <hi>laſt day</hi> ſhall be raiſed after this <hi>modus</hi> or manner; and agreeably to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and natural ideas of a <hi>reſurrection.</hi> It will be hard indeed if our adverſaries will not allow us to take this for granted; and if they will, the ſame underſtanding which is able to meaſure infinity can readily inform us how, or whether with a body or without one, the bulk of mankind ſhall appear at the great day of final retribution.</p>
            <p>I come now to revelation more clear and explicit; to plain, intelligible Scripture; with reſpect to which, it pains one to ſee ſo great a man as Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> taking refuge
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:1123800600:233"/>
in the above diſtinction, and indeed in the moſt pitiful evaſions. Obſerve then how this juſtly celebrated philoſopher expreſſes himſelf in the paſſage following. <q>In the New Teſtament (wherein, I think, are contained all the articles of the Chriſtian Faith,) I find our Saviour and his Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles to preach the <hi>reſurrection from the dead,</hi> and the <hi>reſurrection of the dead</hi> in many places: but I do not remember any place where the <hi>reſurrection of the ſame body</hi> is ſo much as mentioned. Nay, which is very remarkable in the caſe, I do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member in any place of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, (where the general <hi>reſurrection</hi> at the laſt day is ſpoken of,) any ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion as the <hi>reſurrection of the body,</hi> much leſs of the <hi>ſame body.</hi> I ſay, the general <hi>reſurrection,</hi> &amp;c. becauſe where the <hi>reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection</hi> of ſome <hi>particular perſons</hi> preſently upon our Saviour's reſurrection is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, the words are, <hi>the graves were opened, and many bodies of ſaints, which ſlept, aroſe, and came out of the graves, after his reſurrection, and went into the holy city, and appeared to many:</hi> of which peculiar way
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:1123800600:234"/>
of ſpeaking of <hi>this</hi> reſurrection, the paſſage itſelf gives a reaſon in theſe words, <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to many;</hi> i. e. thoſe <hi>who ſlept, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared,</hi> ſo as to be riſen. But this could not be known, unleſs they brought with them the evidence, that they were thoſe who had been dead, &amp;c. And it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable they were ſuch as were <hi>newly</hi> dead, whoſe bodies were not <hi>yet</hi> diſſolved, &amp;c.</q>

            </p>
            <p>There is, I perſuade myſelf, little or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in this paſſage but has its anſwer in the foregoing conſiderations; unleſs we ſhould be kind enough to acknowlege for argument the triumphant ſneer of that parentheſis, <hi>(wherein, I think, are contained all the Articles of the Chriſtian Faith.)</hi> It might therefore be ſufficient to remark, that Mr. L. ſeems to admit <hi>myſteries</hi> as ſome people diſpenſe <hi>alms, viz. grudgingly,</hi> or <hi>of neceſſity;</hi> and at the ſame time to expreſs our obligations to him for his indulgent conceſſion, that <hi>bodies</hi> have been raiſed from the dead upon <hi>particular oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions.</hi> But becauſe this great writer may poſſibly be ſtill thought by ſome to have hit
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:1123800600:235"/>
upon an expedient, which happily helps him out of embaraſſment, in the ſtale diſtinction between a <hi>particular</hi> and the <hi>general</hi> Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, let us ſee whether this diſtinction will not vaniſh before the enſuing argumentation.</p>
            <p>I venture to aver then that the <hi>reſurrection</hi> of the <hi>body</hi> of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is an eſpecial earneſt, or ſure token of the <hi>reſurrection</hi> of our <hi>bodies</hi> from the dead. I deſire your im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial judgment of the texts which follow. <hi>Now is Chriſt riſen from the dead, and become the firſt-fruits of them that ſlept.</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">1 Cor. xv. 20. vi. 14.</note>
               <hi>God hath both raiſed up the Lord, and will alſo raiſe up us by his own power. If we have been</hi>

               <hi>planted together in the likeneſs of his death, we ſhall be alſo in the likeneſs of his reſurrection. He who raiſed up the Lord Jeſus, ſhall raiſe up us alſo by Jeſus.</hi>

               <note n="§" place="bottom">John v. 21.</note>Theſe texts will be ſufficient for my preſent purpoſe. Let us conſider them ſeparately a little. <hi>Now is</hi>

               <hi>Chriſt riſen from the dead, and become the firſt-fruits of them that ſlept.</hi> I need not enlarge upon the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> practice alluded to under this figurative expreſſion; and ſhall only ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that, as the <hi>firſt-fruits</hi> were offerings of that identical grain of which the harveſt was to follow, the <hi>reſurrection</hi> of our <hi>bodies,</hi> after that of Chriſt, could not have been ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified by a finer emblem. <hi>God hath both raiſed up the Lord, and will alſo raiſe up us by his own power:</hi> i. e. moſt undoubtedly, he will raiſe up us in like manner. <hi>If we have been planted together in the likeneſs of his death, we ſhall be alſo in the likeneſs of his reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> The former part of this verſe has ſome obſcurity in it, which may be liable to va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious conſtruction; but the latter aſcertains, almoſt as fully as words can do, the great article before us. <hi>He who raiſed up the Lord Jeſus, ſhall raiſe up us alſo by Jeſus.</hi> This text is exactly parallel with that juſt quoted from the other Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians. As the Father raiſeth up the dead, and quickeneth them, even ſo the Son quickeneth whom he will.</hi> This proof runs rather in another line, but how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:1123800600:237"/>
will terminate in the ſame point. For we may ſafely conclude, that the Son will <hi>raiſe the dead, and quicken them</hi> hereafter, in the ſame manner in which himſelf and many dead perſons have been already raiſed. We have by this time, I hope, ſufficient grounds for this concluſion. And indeed St. <hi>Paul</hi> aſſures us, that the <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſhall change our vile body that</hi> IT <hi>may be faſhioned like unto his glorious body.</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Phil. iii. 21.</note>For how, or when ſhall he do this, if not in the GENERAL <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection at the laſt day,</hi> and by a change of THAT <hi>body</hi> which was depoſited in the ground? Our <hi>vile body</hi> is not to be <hi>changed</hi> for ANOTHER <hi>body,</hi> but is ITSELF to be <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhioned like unto Chriſt's glorious body.</hi> Would it not be <hi>prima facie</hi> ridiculous to attempt tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turing the paſſage to any other ſenſe?</p>
            <p>Though what has been here offered can, I think, ſcarcely fall ſhort of bringing convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to a mind open to it, yet it will be greatly corroborated by other paſſages and particulars, and eſpecially by the doctrine
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:1123800600:238"/>
contained <hi>in the fifteenth Chapter of the firſt Epiſtle to the Corinthians,</hi> which is almoſt totally ſpent upon this ſubject. In truth, there are more reaſons than one for our not paſſing by that Chapter. If we read this por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Scripture with due attention, and impartiality, we ſhall be led, I preſume, to this unavoidable concluſion, that the <hi>bodies</hi> of all men ſhall be raiſed, if not abſolutely, totally, or numerically, yet really and truly the ſame as they died; or, in other words, that the <hi>bodies</hi> which ſhall be raiſed ſhall, with their reſpective ſouls, conſtitute the ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that lived before in the world: nor can this doctrine be invalidated by metaphyſical ſubtilties, and <hi>oppoſitions of ſcience falsly ſo called;</hi> which are much leſs calculated to ſatisfy, than to perplex and confound us. If the import of ſuch paſſages as the following, <hi>it is ſown in diſhonour, it is raiſed in glory;</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">v. 43, &amp;c. 51, &amp;c.</note>
               <hi>it is ſown in weakneſs, it is raiſed in power; it is ſown a natural body, it is raiſed a ſpiritual body; behold I ſhew you a myſtery; we ſhall not all ſleep, but we ſhall all be changed in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
               <pb n="224" facs="tcp:1123800600:239"/>
               <hi>in the twinkling of an eye, at the laſt trump; for the trumpet ſhall ſound, and the dead ſhall be raiſed incorruptible, and we ſhall be changed; for</hi> THIS <hi>corruptible muſt put on incorruption, and</hi> THIS <hi>mortal muſt put on im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality;</hi> if the manifeſt import of theſe texts can be evaded, ſo may the moſt ſtudied paraphraſe, or the moſt careful illuſtration of them. There will be no ſuch thing as intelligible language to be found. The caſe is, the human body undergoes many changes in a courſe of years, e. g. from infancy to old age, which, I ſuppoſe, it will be granted, are the changes of the ſame body, properly ſpeaking, ſtill. For though it may not be eaſy to ſay preciſely in what the <hi>ratio</hi> of identity conſiſts, we may ſafely ſay, than an almoſt infinite number of changes and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difications, which might be ſuppoſed, do not affect it. There are very few names which have a ſtronger claim to deference than that of Mr. <hi>Boyle;</hi> and it is an obſervation of his, that <q>there is no ſaying what the utmoſt human art or contrivance may be able to effect; much leſs what means, even phyſical
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:1123800600:240"/>
ones, God is able to uſe for the repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of bodies; of which the <hi>neceſſary conſtituent parts</hi> may be preſerved conſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tently with numberleſs changes from the cradle to the grave, and after death.</q> Our great Creator at leaſt knows what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly conſtitutes identity much better than we can tell him; and therefore without en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering fully into the ſtate of the controverſy as maintained long ago by Dr. <hi>Stilling fleet</hi> and Mr. <hi>Locke,</hi> (which would be little bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than continuing a <hi>game of words,)</hi> I ſhall content myſelf with pointing out to you one or two inſtances of cavil, and quibble, and captiouſneſs in the latter, which plainly enough indicate him to have been galled in many places, and are indeed altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy both of himſelf and his argument.</p>
            <p>The Biſhop, in vindication of his own and the catholic tenet, cites theſe words of our bleſſed Saviour, <hi>all that are in the graves ſhall hear his voice, and ſhall come forth.</hi> 
               <q>From hence, ſays Mr. L., your Lordſhip
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:1123800600:241"/>
argues, that theſe words, <hi>all that are in the graves,</hi> relate to no other ſubſtance than what was united to the Soul in life; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a different ſubſtance cannot be ſaid to be in the graves, and to come out of them. Which words of your Lordſhip, if they prove any thing, prove that the Soul too is lodged in the grave, and raiſed out of it at the laſt day. For your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip ſays, <hi>can a different ſubſtance be ſaid to be in the graves, and come out of them?</hi> So that according to this interpretation of theſe words of our Saviour, no other ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance being raiſed but what hears his voice, but what, being called, comes out of the grave; and no other ſubſtance com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of the grave, but what was in the grave; any one muſt conclude, that the Soul, unleſs it be in the grave, will make no part of the perſon that is raiſed, unleſs, as your Lordſhip argues againſt me, you can make it out, that a ſubſtance which never was in the grave, may come out of it; or that the Soul is no ſubſtance.</q> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>But
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:1123800600:242"/>
will not this ſophiſtical bubble burſt in an inſtant before a moſt ſimple conſideration, purſued through its neceſſary conſequences? By a common figure, and agreeably to the cuſtomary licenſe of ſpeech, we talk of the acts, or operations of one of the two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituent parts of man, as of the acts or ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of the whole. E. G. <hi>No ſoul ſees me;</hi> or <hi>no body ſees me; every ſoul heard him;</hi> or <hi>no body heard him;</hi> are expreſſions uſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcriminately, not only in ordinary diſcourſe, but in correct compoſition. The ſoul per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives the <hi>voice;</hi> the body is raiſed by divine power, and reunited to it. <hi>(bb)</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again: The learned prelate quotes the following words of the Apoſtle, in ſupport of the doctrine of the <hi>reſurrection</hi> as it is held in the Church. <hi>We muſt all appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the judgmentſeat of Chriſt, that every one may receive the things done in his body, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.</hi> To which his Lordſhip ſubjoins this queſtion: CAN THESE WORDS BE UNDER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STOOD
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:1123800600:243"/>
OF ANY OTHER MATERIAL SUB<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STANCE BUT THAT BODY IN WHICH THESE THINGS WERE DONE? <q>A man, Mr. L. anſwers, may ſuſpend his deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining the meaning of the Apoſtle to be, that a ſinner ſhall ſuffer for his ſins in the <hi>very ſame body</hi> in which he committed them: becauſe St. <hi>Paul</hi> does not ſay he ſhall have the <hi>very ſame body</hi> when he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, that he had when he ſinned. The Apoſtle ſays indeed, done <hi>in his body.</hi> The body he had, and did things in at five, or fifteen, was, no doubt, <hi>his body,</hi> as much as that which he did things in at fifty was <hi>his body,</hi> though <hi>his body</hi> were not the <hi>very ſame body</hi> at thoſe different ages: and ſo will the body, which he ſhall have AFTER the <hi>reſurrection,</hi> be <hi>his body,</hi> though it be not the <hi>very ſame</hi> with that which he had at five, at fifteen, or fifty.</q> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>Now agreeing with Mr. L. and the admirers of his doctrine upon this head, that <q>the body which a man ſhall have <hi>after</hi> the reſurrection,</q> according to their ſcheme, (for what ſhall be done <hi>in</hi>
               <pb n="229" facs="tcp:1123800600:244"/>
or <hi>at</hi> it, we are left to conjecture,) I ſay, agreeing with them, that this body will be <hi>his body,</hi> yet we would fain know in what ſenſe he could be ſaid to <hi>receive the things done</hi> IN IT, <hi>or</hi> BY IT, according to another reading. A man has <hi>his body</hi> truly, if not numerically the ſame through life, under a greater or leſs variety of changes and modi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications; but by Mr. L's train of reaſoning, it ſhould ſeem that a man may have <hi>his body</hi> before he is in poſſeſſion of it. Had the Apoſtle ſaid, as a man ſins in <hi>a</hi> body, ſo he ſhall ſuffer in <hi>a</hi> body, Mr. L's mode of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing might have been admitted; but as matters ſtand at preſent, it has evidently no logic to ſupport it.</p>
            <p>Once more. <q>The next text of Scripture you bring for the ſame body, ſays Mr. L. is, <hi>if there be no reſurrection of the dead, then is not Chriſt raiſed.</hi> From which your Lordſhip argues, IT SEEMS THEN OTHER BODIES ARE TO BE RAISED AS HIS WAS. I grant other dead as certainly raiſed as
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:1123800600:245"/>
Chriſt was; for elſe his <hi>reſurrection</hi> would be of no uſe to mankind. But I do not ſee how it follows, that they ſhall be raiſed with the <hi>ſame</hi> body, as your Lordſhip in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers in theſe words annexed; AND CAN THERE BE ANY DOUBT, WHETHER HIS BODY WAS THE SAME MATERIAL SUB<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STANCE WHICH WAS UNITED TO HIS SOUL BEFORE? I anſwer, none at all; nor that it had juſt the ſame diſtinguiſhed lineaments and marks, yea and the ſame wounds that it had at the time of his death. If therefore your Lordſhip will argue from other bodies being raiſed as his was, that they muſt have proportion with his in SAMENESS, then we muſt believe, that every man ſhall be raiſed with the ſame lineaments and other notes of diſtinction he had at the time of his death, even with his wounds yet open, if he had any, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe our Saviour was ſo raiſed; which ſeems to be ſcarce reconcileable with what your Lordſhip ſays, of A FAT MAN FALLING INTO A CONSUMPTION, AND DYING.</q> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="231" facs="tcp:1123800600:246"/>
The wit here is not worth anſwering; and the fallacy of the paragraph was obviated in ſome of the foregoing obſervations. Suffice it to remark that the addition of one word in its <hi>proper</hi> place would have demoliſhed all this fine fabric of reaſoning. Mr. L. ſhould have granted, that other <hi>dead</hi> and BURIED ſhall "as certainly be raiſed as Chriſt was." In ſhort, we affirm, on Scriptural authority, that at the <hi>laſt day</hi> the <hi>bodies</hi> of men ſhall really be raiſed. The article of the <hi>reſurrection</hi> in our Creeds requires only this belief. We are neither concerned in niceties of conjecture, nor obliged to adopt Mr. L's. notion of identity. <hi>(cc)</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to return to Dr. S. I admit that this learned writer has ſpeciouſly enough recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled a text or two <note n="*" place="bottom">See particularly Rom. viii. 11.</note>to his favourite tenet, which have been generally referred to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived doctrine. But ſhall plauſibility be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truded upon us for demonſtration? Shall it overturn the credit of other interpretations
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:1123800600:247"/>
of the ſame paſſages, more ſolid perhaps, or at leaſt equally ingenious? Shall it ſuperſede the authority of a very great number of texts too clear and explicit to be oppoſed by any thing but general aſſertions, bold denials, flat contradictions, and the artifice of ſubti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lization? Shall it ſhake the faith of ages, and nullify the doctrine of the catholic Church?</p>
            <p>And, after all, in this, as in the caſe of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> we are in effect only called upon to exchange one Creed for another. Theſe <hi>ſqueamiſh</hi> Gentlemen who know not how to <hi>digeſt</hi> the <hi>wholſome</hi> doctrines of the Goſpel, expect us to <hi>ſwallow</hi> with <hi>greedineſs</hi> a kind of ſpiritual <hi>Noſtrum, prepared</hi> by human imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. It is true, Dr. S. with all the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frontery of <hi>quackery,</hi> would make us believe his <hi>doſe</hi> may be <hi>taken</hi> without any ſort of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience. For he roundly aſſerts, that <q>the <hi>reſurrection of the dead</hi> is no ways liable to any of the difficulties which the other notion MAY be liable to.</q> Now whatever
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:1123800600:248"/>
difficulties our notion <hi>may</hi> be liable to, I aſk, whether that of the Doctor has not at firſt ſight its <hi>peculiar</hi> difficulties? Indeed it will ſtand clear of all, if we anſwer the following queries ſuitably to the confidence with which he propoſes them. <q>May there not be a <hi>reſurrection of the dead,</hi> ſays he, without the <hi>reſurrection of fleſh?</hi> May not the dead perſon be raiſed to life, and have a <hi>body</hi> given to him, ſuitable to the place he is to have? May not the <hi>thinking conſcious</hi> perſon be reſtored, though he has not that reſtored which has no thought, nor conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs belonging to it?</q> To the firſt of theſe three queſtions I anſwer abſolutely—No.—A <hi>reſurrection of the dead,</hi> ſuppoſes a <hi>reſurrection of fleſh.</hi> To the ſecond and third I make free to reply with a few queſtions in my turn; and deſire to aſk, whether, when the <hi>graves and the ſea ſhall give up the dead,</hi> they will not give up what was <hi>put into them?</hi> Was this the <hi>body,</hi> or was it the <hi>ſoul?</hi> Or, if by a <hi>reſurrection of the dead</hi> we are only to underſtand our being inveſted with a <hi>new</hi>
               <pb n="234" facs="tcp:1123800600:249"/>
               <hi>body,</hi> with what ſhadow of ſenſe is this ſtyled a <hi>reſurrection?</hi> Or, if there is ſenſe and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety in the term, may we not fairly aſk, from whence is <hi>this body</hi> to <hi>come? (dd)</hi> If <hi>thought,</hi> or <hi>conſciouſneſs</hi> conſtitutes perſon, can <hi>thought or conſciouſneſs</hi> die? If not, what are we to underſtand by <q>a thinking con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious perſon's being reſtored?</q> Reſtored! From whence? Or to what? <hi>(ee)</hi> In ſhort, whatever becomes of man after death, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever may be the nature of the intermediate ſtate, what notion can we form of <hi>thought's riſing from the dead,</hi> or the <hi>reſurrection of conſciouſneſs?</hi> Men will advance inconſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, and aſſert paradoxes ſooner than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve as the Church would have them. <hi>(ff)</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This notion of a <hi>thinking perſon's being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored</hi> does indeed correſpond well enough with an opinion maintained with much ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſs ſome years ſince by certain Divines, <note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. Law. Mr. Peckard, &amp;c.</note>who held, that during the ſtate between death and the laſt day, the ſoul will <hi>ſleep,</hi> as
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:1123800600:250"/>
it were, and all the rational powers be ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended. I ſhall not enter into the merits of their arguments. It will be ſufficient to ſay, that theſe writers ſuppoſed the reunion of the Soul to the body at the day of judgment; and conſequently, according to their notion, (for argument's ſake admitting it,) the <hi>reſtora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Soul</hi> to its powers, &amp;c. and <hi>the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of the dead,</hi> are very different things.</p>
            <p>Again: if we believe the Apoſtle's ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, the inſtantaneous change which is to be effected in us at the <hi>reſurrection</hi> will be from <hi>natural</hi> to <hi>ſpiritual,</hi> from <hi>corruptible</hi> to <hi>incorruptible;</hi> but we ſhall look in vain for ſuch a change under any other hypotheſis. They who inſiſt, that our ſouls ſhall be united to <hi>new bodies</hi> may be allowed to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſuch bodies will be <hi>ſpiritual,</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, and <hi>incorruptible;</hi> but will they not be hard put to it to prove that <hi>theſe</hi> ever were <hi>natural,</hi> or <hi>corruptible?</hi> Or does this Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle's illuſtration of the doctrine before us by the ſimilitude of ſeed ſown, which <hi>is not quickened except it die,</hi> convey the leaſt idea
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:1123800600:251"/>
of a ſoul's awaking from ſleep, and in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as it were recovering the uſe of all its faculties? Surely this cannot be the <hi>myſtery</hi> which the inſpired writer <hi>ſhews</hi> us in this chapter. But, according to our ſenſe, the Apoſtolical compariſon is as apt and happy as poſſible. The <hi>bare grain</hi> is <hi>ſown,</hi> diſſolves, and appears again under a new modification. <hi>So alſo is the reſurrection of the dead.</hi> The body <hi>is ſown in corruption, it is raiſed in incorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It is ſown in diſhonour, it is raiſed in glory. It is ſown in weakneſs, it is raiſed in power. It is ſown a natural body, it is raiſed a ſpiritual body;</hi> a body ſubtilized and puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied; a body diſencumbered from that <hi>fleſh and blood which cannot inherit the kingdom of God,</hi> and, to adopt the high figuring of St. <hi>Paul, clothed upon with an houſe from heaven,</hi> and arrayed with <hi>immortality.</hi> And, all this while, in both caſes, <hi>God giveth a body</hi> as it <hi>pleaſeth him, and to every ſeed,</hi> and to every individual, <hi>his own body.</hi>

The learned authors we are concerned with, and their numerous admirers, ſeem to have forgot, or to wiſh us to forget, that they hold opinions declared to be heretical, and condemned as ſuch by an inſpired Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle. The author of the Epiſtle to the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews</hi> numbers the <hi>reſurrection of the dead</hi> among the <hi>principles</hi> of the <hi>doctrine of Chriſt.</hi>

It has been boldly maintained, that by the <hi>reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the dead</hi> we are only to underſtand

a <hi>reſurrection</hi> from <hi>ſin</hi> to a ſtate of <hi>grace;</hi> or a kind of <hi>reſurrection</hi> from <hi>ignorance</hi> to a <hi>knowlege</hi> of truth; or, in general, the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality of the Soul. <hi>Libertini,</hi> ſays <hi>Calvin,</hi> as quoted by Arch-biſhop <hi>Laud, rident ſpem omnem quam de reſurrectione habemus, idque jam nobis eveniſſe dicunt, quod adhuc expectamus, &amp;c. ut homo ſciat animam ſuam ſpiritum immortalem eſſe viventem in caelis.</hi> And ſays <hi>Peter Martyr,</hi> as cited by the ſame prelate, <hi>ſunt etiam hodie Libertini qui eam irrident, et reſurrectionem quae tractatur in Scripturis tantum ad animas referunt.</hi> The <hi>Gnoſtics</hi> and <hi>Valentinians</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed the fleſh to be incapable of incorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>Carnis ſalutem negant,</hi> ſays <hi>Irenaeus, dicentes non eam eſſe capacem incorruptibilitatis. Menander</hi> had the impudence to annex the privilege of immortality to his Baptiſm.

               <q>If Chriſt be preached that he roſe from the dead, how ſay ſome among you that there is no reſurrection of the dead?</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THAT the doctrine of the <hi>Reſurrection of the body</hi> was taught by the Apoſtles and by our Lord we have already ſeen; and that the Apoſtolical Fathers maintained it with the ſame preciſion will preſently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.</p>
            <q>Let us conſider, ſays St. <hi>Clement</hi> in his firſt Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> how the Lord does continually ſhew us that there ſhall be a future <hi>reſurrection;</hi> of which he

has made our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> the FIRST FRUITS, raiſing him from the dead. Let us contemplate, beloved, the <hi>reſurrection</hi> that is continually made before our eyes.

Chapter of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s firſt Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians.</hi> St. <hi>Clement,</hi> it muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, is not ſo happy in his elucidation of the doctrine of the <hi>reſurrection of the body</hi> from the ſuppoſed death and reviviſcence of the <hi>Phoenix</hi> from his own aſhes, according to a current opinion in thoſe days; the enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on which fabulous wonder has drawn a charge of ungenuineneſs on the Epiſtle it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.

But the judicious Editor and Tranſlator in his preliminary diſcourſe vindicates the good <hi>Father,</hi> and reſcues the work from this imputation in a moſt ſatisfactory manner; ſo that "with ſerious and ingenuous minds," (to borrow his own words,) this is a matter which will reflect no diſcredit on St. <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>'s doctrine, or on the pious zeal with which he maintained it. The reality of the doctrine is in no wiſe affected by the whim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicalneſs, or the weakneſs of the illuſtration.</p>

of the reſurrection <gap reason="foreign">

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Now if the paſſages I produced from St. <hi>Clement</hi>'s firſt Epiſtle, and from <hi>Ignatius,</hi> do not to all intents and purpoſes aſſert the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of the body,</hi> or <hi>of the fleſh;</hi> if St. <hi>Clement</hi>'s ſecond Epiſtle muſt abſolutely be pronounced ſpurious, becauſe the learned world is divided in its ſentiments relative to it; if the doctrine contained in this Epiſtle cannot poſſibly be agreeable to that of the other, or to that of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> or to that of the Apoſtolical and primitive Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is a matter of ſome doubt who the author might be; if theſe reverend fathers ſpeak in <hi>no</hi> place of the <hi>reſurrection</hi> of the <hi>body</hi> becauſe in <hi>ſome</hi> places they ſpeak of the <hi>reſurrection of the dead,</hi> or of the <hi>reſurrection</hi> in general, as the holy Scripture itſelf occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionally does; if this be the caſe, equivoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhall hereafter paſs for argument, and dogmaticalneſs for demonſtration.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="246" facs="tcp:1123800600:260"/>
One ſhould be apt to think, that the nearer the fountain, the clearer the ſtream; or, in plain terms, that the moſt antient Chriſtians are the moſt orthodox; that thoſe who lived in, or neareſt to the times of the Apoſtles, and Apoſtolical men, were like to underſtand their doctrine with readineſs, to embrace it with veneration, and to tranſmit it in purity. What can be more clear than the language of <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi> as it is quoted by Dr. S. himſelf? <q>
                  <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhall come a ſecond time, when <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>he ſhall raiſe the bodies of all men that have been?</hi>
               </q> Well; but ſays our author, <q>this was <hi>Juſtin</hi>'s opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, but it was not in any <hi>Baptiſmal</hi> Creed; he takes no notice of any article of any Creed as containing the notion of the <hi>reſurrection of the fleſh,</hi> whatſoever his own philoſophical notion of the reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion might be.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Will it follow then that the doctrine of the <hi>reſurrection of the fleſh</hi> was purely the perſonal, or philoſophical notion of <hi>Juſtin</hi>
               <pb n="247" facs="tcp:1123800600:261"/>
               <hi>Martyr,</hi> becauſe it was not in his time an article in any <hi>Creed?</hi> If ſo, it will follow, by parity of arguing, that almoſt all the other articles of our preſent <hi>Creeds</hi> were the private tenets or opinions of particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and not the common doctrine, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of the catholic Church. This muſt fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low upon Dr. S's own principles. For he has himſelf remarked in his preface, that <q>it is highly probable theſe, (referring to doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines he had been mentioning,) and other doctrines were taught, <hi>(viz.</hi> after baptiſm,) as circumſtances aroſe, either to explain ſome things inculcated in the Goſpels, or to avoid ſomething erroneous. And hence it was that the <hi>original Creed</hi> was enlarged, and more things inſerted into it; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed all that has been added to it ſeems to have been owing to theſe cauſes.</q> The juſt now cited declaration of <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> is therefore to be regarded as exactly coincident with a doctrine publickly received, and not as the bare reſult of his own judgment, for any thing Dr. S. has ſaid, or proved to the contrary. But if ſo, the doctrine of the
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:1123800600:262"/>
               <hi>Reſurrection of the body,</hi> or of the <hi>fleſh,</hi> was an article of faith from the beginning; and its ſubſequent date as an article of any <hi>Creed</hi> is a circumſtance of very inferior conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. What matters it to us <hi>when</hi> it was thought neceſſary to be required of the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church of <hi>Chriſt</hi> openly to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs they believed as the Apoſtles and primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Chriſtians did?</p>
            <p>But let me ſhew you how unfairly the author of the <hi>Enquiry</hi> deals by <hi>Polycarp.</hi> Of the two places in this <hi>father's</hi> epiſtle to the <hi>Philippians</hi> in which mention is made of the <hi>reſurrection,</hi> the principal, I think, is that I not long ſince quoted, and will here lay again before you. <hi>He that raiſed up Chriſt from the dead, ſhall alſo raiſe up us in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</hi> The words <hi>in like manner</hi> are by the no leſs faithful than judicious tranſlator printed in <hi>Italics,</hi> as not been literally contained, though neceſſarily implied in the original. This paſſage then, like many more parallel ones which I have had occaſion to produce, I mean, from the Scripture itſelf, manifeſtly
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:1123800600:263"/>
imports the <hi>reſurrection of the body;</hi> though ſhould any perſon affect to doubt what the good <hi>father's</hi> meaning may be <hi>here,</hi> they may ſoon learn what his idea of the <hi>reſurrection</hi> was, from a part of the prayer he preferred to God in the hour of his martyrdom, according to the account we have of it in the circular epiſtle of the Church of <hi>Smyrna.</hi> He <hi>there</hi> makes mention of the <hi>reſurrection</hi> both of <hi>ſoul</hi> and <hi>body.</hi> For though the <hi>ſoul</hi> cannot, properly ſpeaking, be ſaid to <hi>riſe again,</hi> yet as the ſoul and body conſtitute the ſame man, as theſe conſtituent parts are ſeparated by death, and reunited at the <hi>reſurrection,</hi> this reunion is not unfitly expreſſed by a term that may be truly predicated of one of the conſtituent parts.</p>
            <p>Dr. S. admits the genuineneſs of the above-mentioned narrative; and yet will not ſuffer us to conſider the <hi>letter</hi> in one place to be an explanation of the <hi>ſenſe</hi> in the other. There is more of art than honeſty in an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to ſlip out of this difficulty by ſaying, as the <hi>Enquirer</hi> does in the following words,
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:1123800600:264"/>
that <q>by the time this letter was wrote, the notion ſeems to have prevailed among Chriſtians, that the <hi>body</hi> was to be raiſed, though it was not yet got into any of their Creeds.</q> This is a ſort of ſpiritual juggle which inverts truth, and diſguiſes it in the ſame inſtant: it metamorphoſes the real ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent of <hi>Polycarp</hi> into a whimſical notion which began to gain ground in the Church!</p>
            <p>But this matter may be viewed in another light. The force of truth has drawn from our author an involuntary ceſſion of his own darling point. For immediately after the ſentence laſt cited from him, he acquaints us, that <q>ſoon after the middle of the ſecond century diſputes aroſe about the <hi>reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> the <hi>heathens</hi> objecting to the poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of it, and the CHRISTIANS endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to anſwer the objections they met with. The enquiry, ſays he, was, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there was to be a <hi>reſurrection</hi> of the <hi>ſoul</hi> alone, or of the whole man conſiſting of body and ſoul? And then a ſecond queſtion was, whether the <hi>fleſh,</hi> the <hi>very</hi>
                  <pb n="251" facs="tcp:1123800600:265"/>
                  <hi>fleſh</hi> which we now bear about us, was to be raiſed up again? The WRITERS of that time ſtill extant contended for the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of the fleſh</hi> together with the ſoul. But there does not appear to be any <hi>Creed</hi> which eſtabliſhed ſuch a doctrine. For whatever PRIVATE PERSONS might ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine to be true, was not inſtantly to be <hi>profeſſed</hi> as an article of faith, neceſſary to be believed in order to Baptiſm.</q> And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards he tells us, that <q>the controverſy about the <hi>reſurrection of the fleſh</hi> did not begin till the middle, or near the end of the ſecond century. And then as philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers objected to the <hi>reſurrection</hi> ITSELF, from the common topics, <hi>how could</hi> FLESH <hi>devoured by beaſts or fiſhes, and thus become</hi> PARTS <hi>of thoſe animals; or perhaps reduced by fire to aſhes, or diſperſt by ſeas and rivers, be reſtored? Athenagoras, Theophilus,</hi> and <hi>Tertullian</hi> undertook a defence of this no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and taught, that it was no ways be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the power of Almighty God to reſtore to every one the fleſh he once had.</q>

               <pb n="252" facs="tcp:1123800600:266"/>
Now I deſire to obſerve, in the firſt place, that theſe philoſophers objected to the <hi>reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection</hi> from the common topics juſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned becauſe they were the ſtrongeſt that occurred to them; and becauſe when they objected to the <hi>reſurrection of the body,</hi> they moſt unqueſtionably meant to object to the <hi>reſurrection</hi> ITSELF. In the next place, I would remark, that if by the CHRISTIANS, <hi>who endeavoured to anſwer the objections of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,</hi> and by the WRITERS of <hi>that time,</hi> we are to underſtand only a few PRIVATE PER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SONS who maintained an extraordinary opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; if <hi>Athenagoras,</hi> and <hi>Theophilus,</hi> and <hi>Tertullian</hi> did no more than defend their own perſonal tenets; it is paſſing ſtrange theſe ſame heathen philoſophers ſhould ſet their <hi>wits</hi> againſt them at all; and ſtranger ſtill, that the whole body of Chriſtians had not joined the outcry in their own vindication, and in public diſavowal of an enthuſiaſtic and ridiculous principle. Nay this is not all. The doctrine of the <hi>reſurrection of the body,</hi> if it was a mere private or perſonal opinion, was in fact contrary to the Goſpel of <hi>Chriſt,</hi>
               <pb n="253" facs="tcp:1123800600:267"/>
and the ſenſe of the Church; and therefore muſt have been regarded as a moſt groſs, if not dangerous hereſy. But as it moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly was never repreſented ſo to be, we are to conclude, I preſume, that it was true and catholic doctrine, notwithſtanding its non-appearance in any Creed, in the early ages, and though the acknowlegement of it was not a qualification for Baptiſm. We therefore inſiſt, that whenever it became an article of a <hi>baptiſmal Creed,</hi> it was inſerted with the moſt admiſſible pretenſions.</p>
            <p>It is, farther, very obſervable, that the doctrine of the <hi>reſurrection of the body</hi> is moſt expreſſly taught in many places of the <hi>Koran</hi> of <hi>Mahomet.</hi> Let us turn to a few. <q>
                  <hi>Man ſaith,</hi> ſays <hi>Mahomet, after I have been dead, ſhall I really be brought forth alive from the grave? Doth not man remember that we created him heretofore when he was nothing? The unbelievers ſay, when we and our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſhall have been reduced to duſt, ſhall we be taken from the grave? Man ſaith, who ſhall reſtore bones to life when they are rotten?</hi>
               </q> 
               <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, he ſhall reſtore them to life, who produced</hi>
               <pb n="254" facs="tcp:1123800600:268"/>
               <hi>"them the firſt time." (kk)</hi> The whole ſyſtem of <hi>Mahometiſm</hi> is, you well know, a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructure raiſed upon the foundations of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daiſm</hi> and <hi>Chriſtianity.</hi> The grand aim of the impoſtor ſeems to have been to concentre both in one faith; with which view, and that no romantic one, he in part adopted, and partly rejected the reſpective theories. In order to ingratiate himſelf with the <hi>Jews,</hi> he aſſerted, as we have ſeen, even to an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of zeal, the unity of the Godhead; and at the ſame time not to put the <hi>Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> out of all temper, as he frequently takes occaſion to ſpeak reſpectfully of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> ſo he declares probably in the moſt explicit terms for the great article we have been diſcuſſing. <hi>(ll)</hi> We may therefore fairly conclude from this circumſtance only, that the doctrine of the <hi>reſurrection of the body</hi> was not the ſentiment of a few individuals, but the profeſſion of the univerſal Church at the beginning of the ſeventh century. And after all, ſuppoſing it to be queſtionable whether this were really the plan of <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met,</hi> the leaſt that can be inferred from the
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:1123800600:269"/>
perſpicuity with which the doctrine of the <hi>reſurrection</hi> is taught and enforced in the <hi>Koran,</hi> is that he conceived it to be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently reconcileable with the common reaſon and apprehenſion of mankind; at the ſame time that, from this among other particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, we muſt ſee, and muſt deſire its adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries to take notice, that it is not a doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine peculiar to Chriſtianity.</p>
            <p>To come now to the <hi>concluſion of the whole matter.</hi> If <hi>theſe things are ſo,</hi> if the great doctrines we have been handling are defenſible upon ſound principles, and have a moſt firm foundation in Scripture, and in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive authority, abundant reaſon have we to <hi>hold faſt the profeſſion of our faith without wavering;</hi> in nothing diſmayed by adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries who trifle with us upon the moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſubjects; who render the word of God of none effect, by perverſe interpretation; who cannot, or will not ſee the plain ſenſe of the plaineſt expreſſions; who will not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowlege <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> to be the Creator of the world though <hi>all things were made by him;</hi>
               <pb n="256" facs="tcp:1123800600:270"/>
or that he made ſatisfaction for ſin, though he was <hi>ſacrificed for us,</hi> and <hi>gave his life a ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom for all.</hi> I know not any thing that can equal this ſtubbornneſs and ſlowneſs of heart except the inſolence of ſuch as gravely tell us, we muſt not hope to propagate the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel among <hi>Jews, Mahometans,</hi> or heathens, while the ſtrange doctrines contained in our Creeds are retained in the Church. Is not this to all intents and purpoſes ſaying, we muſt not hope to eradicate infidelity till we have renounced the capital articles of our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief; or, in other words, muſt not expect to make converts to Chriſtianity, till we ceaſe to be Chriſtians?

enlarged "as circumſtances aroſe," or oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions called; though that it has been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged in ſome inſtances beyond all reaſon he ſtrongly inſiſts, with many <hi>others with</hi> him. But be this as it may, and even if <hi>theſe things</hi> were not <hi>ſo</hi> as we have repreſented them, it is abundantly ſufficient that they appear to be <hi>ſo</hi> to us.

Catholics alſo, ſet up as many judges, as there are men and women in the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian world. For do not your men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men judge your religion to be true before they believe it, as well as the men and women of other religions? Oh! but you ſay, <hi>they receive it, not becauſe they think it agreeable to Scripture, but becauſe the Church tells them ſo.</hi> But then, I hope, they believe the Church, becauſe their own reaſon tells them they are to do ſo. So that the difference between a Papiſt and a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant is this, not that the one judges, and the other does not judge, but that the one judges his guide to be infallible, the other his way to be manifeſt.</q> The fact is, every man's attachment to any thing, to this or that Church, to this party, or to that principle, &amp;c. is ultimately reſolvible into his opinion of its excellence, its truth, its propriety, or its expedience; or of its conduciveneſs on the whole to his welfare, comfort, and ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,  i. e. it is reſolvible into his own private judgment. This judgment, it is true, may be warped by paſſion, biaſſed by prejudice, clouded by ignorance, and blinded
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:1123800600:274"/>
by perverſeneſs; it may be intoxicated by voluptuouſneſs, enervated by indolence, or inverted by frenzy; or it may be influenced by wiſdom, by folly, or by caprice. But, at the ſame time, whether we judge well, or ill; or of whatever differences or degrees human judgment may admit; we ſhall ſtrictly and properly be found in all caſes and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances to judge for ourſelves.

            <p>It was the concurrence of private judgment which firſt formed the Chriſtian Church; it was the ſame concurrence which gradually compounded the enormous maſs of popery; it was the ſame that effected the <hi>Reformation;</hi> and it was the ſame that conſtituted the nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous ſects and parties into which this <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation</hi> has been moſt deplorably ſplit and ſubdivided. It is to nothing more or leſs than this that the Church of <hi>England</hi> owes her exiſtence. And upon this ground it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, her requiſition of aſſent to her public offices, and of ſubſcription to her <hi>articles,</hi> the meaſure of juſt policy, and common pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence for her ſecurity, are no more to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:1123800600:275"/>
as invaſions of the <hi>right of private judgment,</hi> than the open attempts, or the ſecret machinations of her enemies, for her deſtruction. Upon this ground, in ſhort, her declarations of faith in what ſhe holds to be evangelical truth; and indeed the whole ſcheme of her doctrine, diſcipline, and polity, are perfectly intelligible, and manifeſtly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent. But is not the inference drawn from the acknowleged <hi>right of private judgment</hi> by a late famous author, and his aſſociates, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together chimerical, and totally incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible? Their inference is, that every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual Chriſtian may, if he thinks fit, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw himſelf from all the Churches upon the face of the earth, ſtand abſolutely ſingle in the profeſſion of his faith, or, as this au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor expreſſes it, be a <hi>Church to himſelf.</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">See Confeſſional. Ch. 2. p. 34.

Is it not to all intents and purpoſes to aver, that a ſociety may ſubſiſt without members, without eſtabliſhment, or
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:1123800600:276"/>
conſtitution? We deny not that a man may judge he has a claim to this ſpiritual inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence; and indeed our principle ſuppoſes him ſo to judge; but then we muſt beg leave to think in our turn, that he is groſſly miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken in that judgment. <hi>(pp)</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I wiſh to remark, that if the capital truths of the Goſpel are diſcoverable any where, they are moſt indiſputably to be found in the Catholic Church; the great repoſitory of Chriſtian doctrine. Our bleſſed Lord's aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances of ſuperintendency, ſupport, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection are out of all queſtion given to his diſciples, and to believers in general, as to a body, or ſociety. <hi>Upon this rock,</hi> ſays he, <hi>I will build my Church, &amp;c. Lo! I am with you always, even unto the end of the world.</hi> When he promiſed his Apoſtles that he would ſend the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> to them, who ſhould <hi>guide them into all truth,</hi> he muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily mean that truth which they were to communicate to their ſucceſſors, and theſe to others, and ſo on, through all generations. When the ſacred penmen ſpeak of the <hi>truth,</hi>
               <pb n="263" facs="tcp:1123800600:277"/>
or the <hi>faith,</hi> &amp;c. they undoubtedly ſpeak of the truth embraced, and the faith profeſſed by all ſound Chriſtians; and when St. <hi>Paul</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts the <hi>Corinthians</hi> to <hi>examine</hi> themſelves, and to <hi>prove</hi> themſelves, <hi>whether</hi> they were in the <hi>faith,</hi> he moſt certainly means the faith of the catholic Church. In a word, we muſt look for ſpiritual truth in its native ſimplicity, though we <hi>ſearch</hi> for it as for <hi>hid treaſures;</hi> we muſt look for it within the pale of ſome communion or other: which ſurely will be acknowleged by every man, who does not, in defiance of Scripture, and in contempt of all the world, ſuppoſe that the infallibility which he juſtly denies to appertain to any Church upon earth, is really and truly lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in himſelf.</p>
            <p>The principle of the <hi>Confeſſional</hi> leads, we apprehend, to theſe abſurd conſequences; but at the ſame time we aſſert no <hi>dominion</hi> over the <hi>faith,</hi> or the conſciences of others; we leave every one to <hi>ſtand or fall to his own maſter;</hi> we conceive, that, by the immutable conſtitution of things, every one will think
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:1123800600:278"/>
and act for himſelf, though we imagine all men to be accountable to God as well for their opinions as for their practices; we nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do, nor wiſh to <hi>compel</hi> men to <hi>come in</hi> that our Church <hi>may be filled,</hi> perſuaded as we are at the ſame time that this Church is, in reſpect of all eſſentials, an apoſtolical one; that ſhe <hi>holds faſt the things which become ſound doctrine,</hi> and teaches the <hi>words of eternal life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It may with great truth be affirmed, that the Church of <hi>England</hi> aſſerts the <hi>right of private judgment</hi> in the ſame ſenſe, and to the ſame latitude that every party or body of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants does. For how does the management of the ſeveral leaders and teachers of the Sectaries accord with this univerſally avowed principle? How do <hi>they</hi> leave men to their own judgments in matters of religion? Do <hi>they</hi> not find ways and means to become maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the underſtandings, and the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of their followers; and accompliſh that by indirect artifice which they load us with obloquy for doing under the ſanction of law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful authority? The fact is, in caſe of ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority,
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:1123800600:279"/>
any ſect that you may name would think itſelf, not barely empowered, but bound to ſtrengthen and ſecure itſelf by legal fences and eſtabliſhments, and by authorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive conſtitutions; i. e. by thoſe very means and methods againſt which it now ſo vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently exclaims. Experience will juſtify our ſuppoſition that ſuch would be the caſe; as we know the moſt conſiderable branch of the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> to have changed its language, and its ſentiments, with its ſituation. The firſt article of the memorable <hi>ſolemn League and Covenant</hi> declares the intention of its fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers to be, <hi>to</hi> 
               <q>
                  <hi>bring the Churches of God in the three kingdoms to the neareſt conjunction and uniformity in religion,</hi> CONFESSION OF FAITH, FORM OF CHURCH-GOVERN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MENT, and DIRECTORY FOR WORSHIP and CATECHISING; <hi>that they and their poſterity after them might as brethren live in faith and love.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>It is pleaſant enough to obſerve, that, notwithſtanding the fine flouriſhes and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lourings of certain authors, who plauſibly
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:1123800600:280"/>
profeſs themſelves to be advocates for the common rights and privileges of Chriſtians, we find them ſometimes driven out of their track by the irreſiſtible force of truth, and inſenſibly advancing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or admitting eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical notions: we find them after all their efforts and ſtruggles to climb over the pale of the Church, unwarily, or rather unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably ſlipping back, as I may ſay, into her fold, and undermining their own principles. The words of a late famous prelate <note n="*" place="bottom">Bp. Hoadley.</note>upon this ſubject will verify the obſervation. <q>As it is abſurd, ſays he, to ſuppoſe that any man can be ſaved by the faith of another, or by any belief but what is truly his own; ſo there is no poſſible method of having a faith of his own, properly ſo called, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out building it entirely upon what appears right to his own judgment, ſuch as it is, after his beſt endeavours for INFORMA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TION.</q> That is to ſay, in other words, a man cannot properly be ſaid to judge for <hi>himſelf</hi> till he has received information, or inſtruction from <hi>others.</hi> In ſhort, let privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges be as ſacred, or conſciences as tender
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:1123800600:281"/>
as you pleaſe, I affirm that the erection and eſtabliſhment of a national Church, whether the doctrines ſhe teaches are in themſelves orthodox or otherwiſe, true or falſe, is as fairly defenſible upon rational and proteſtant grounds, as the inſtitution of any religious ſect, or ſociety whatſoever.</p>
            <p>True it is that men, inflamed with falſe zeal, or miſled by wrong judgment, may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part both from proteſtant and Chriſtian prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples; and at their peril it will be. The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> endeavoured to extirpate what ſhe <hi>called hereſy</hi> by the very ſame means which in early days Paganiſm employed for the overthrow of the Chriſtian faith itſelf. And what was the conſequence? The inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity of perſecution afforded to every think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mind a very ſtrong argument of the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of that Church in which it was countenanced; it frightened men <hi>into</hi> their <hi>Senſes;</hi> it helped to open their underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; and Popery may upon the matter be ſaid to have been burnt out of the kingdom. I undertake not to prove, that in our own
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:1123800600:282"/>
Church zeal has always been ſufficiently governed by prudence, or tempered with charity. There is no occaſion to recur to a few diſagreeable inſtances, or the tranſactions of untoward times. But, I truſt, I ſhall be abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly warranted in aſſerting, that he who at this day ſhall charge the Church of <hi>England,</hi> or any conſiderable number of her members, with a want of due moderation, <hi>knows not of what manner of Spirit we are of.</hi> And yet, if the author of the <hi>Confeſſional</hi> is to be cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited, we are relapſing gradually into Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, both in our doctrines and our prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices. We are given to underſtand, in the ſeventh Chap. of that work, that <q>Some competent obſervers have grounds for more than a ſuſpicion, that the Church of <hi>England</hi> has been, and ſtill is, though by degrees imperceptible to vulgar eyes, edg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing back once more towards Popery.</q> Sure theſe <hi>obſervers</hi> are much more <hi>ſharp-ſighted</hi> than their neighbours! I do not well know what theſe Gentlemen are afraid of; but I know true Chriſtianity to be moſt in danger from the diametrically oppoſite quarter; not
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:1123800600:283"/>
ſo much from men of too great, as from people of too <hi>little faith;</hi> not ſo much from the triple-mitre of the <hi>Roman</hi> pontiff, as from the many-headed <hi>hydra</hi> of infidelity. The truth of the matter is, the author before us and his friends do not ſpeak out, as our <hi>open enemies</hi> have done, and as themſelves were called upon to do, by every maxim of juſtice, candor, and generoſity. They are in no dread of <hi>fire</hi> and <hi>faggot;</hi> they are offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, not by the <hi>diſcipline,</hi> but by certain doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which we hold in common with her, (even the <hi>doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines</hi> I have been defending,) and which they moſt inſidiouſly and induſtriouſly labour to confound with the abſurdities which are juſtly had in deriſion, or in abhorrence among us, and of which the credit viſibly diminiſhes every day. Errors may be grafted upon the ſtock of truth; which in itſelf is not the leſs pure, or the leſs amiable, becauſe it may be <hi>holden</hi> in folly as well as in <hi>unrighteouſneſs.</hi> To an ardent longing to ſee theſe common doctrines expunged from our <hi>Articles</hi> and <hi>Creeds,</hi> we are unqueſtionably to aſcribe that
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:1123800600:284"/>
profuſion of ſpleen, malevolence, and ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour with which ſo many pages, of the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſional,</hi> and of other treatiſes are ſhamefully defiled. But for theſe doctrines, I am tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly perſuaded, the reaſonableneſs, and utility, not to ſay neceſſity of Church-eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhments, would generally be admitted, and even contended for. That nicety of human wiſdom which ſtrains at two or three of our <hi>Articles</hi> could, I am apt to think, well enough digeſt the remainder of the <hi>thirty nine.</hi> But as matters are circumſtanced, the principle I have been combating is far from being an unpopular one. The privilege, or right of private judgment, in the ſenſe of our adverſaries, reduces in ſome ſort all men to an equality, and is extremely ſoothing to vain and to weak minds. The fact is, there is no difficulty in declaiming from ſtanding and ſpecious topics either of eulogy, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vective. An affected zeal for reformation, and an avowed anxiouſneſs for the revival of goſpel ſimplicity, have a verv ingratiating ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency with the bulk of mankind. <hi>Liberty of conſcience, Freedom of ſentiment, (qq) eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical</hi>
               <pb n="271" facs="tcp:1123800600:285"/>
               <hi>tyranny, violence of bigotry, arbitrary injunctions, ſpiritual impoſitions,</hi> &amp;c. are, I grant, expreſſions ſufficiently ſonorous and amuſing, and may paſs with many for argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; though at the ſame time, <hi>looſeneſs of principle, ſtubbornneſs of ſchiſm, rankneſs of hereſy, arrogance of ſelf-ſufficiency, perverſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of oppoſition, and petulance of temper,</hi> &amp;c. are phraſes which muſt be allowed by "competent" judges to ſound quite as well, and to mean full as much.</p>
            <p>To conclude. That there is nothing in the leaſt exceptionable in our whole eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical ſyſtem; nothing that might reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably be retrenched; nothing that could poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly be amended even in our <hi>Articles,</hi> as well as worſhip, rites, and uſages, we by no means affirm: but reſpectfully leaving <hi>theſe things</hi> to the conſideration of them that <hi>are over us in the Lord,</hi> we utterly deny that there is any thing fundamentally wrong, or eſſentially erroneous in our ſpiritual conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>(rr)</hi> Men may be, and we find them to be bigots in the cauſe of infidelity; nor
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:1123800600:286"/>
can it afford the leaſt matter of wonder, if no regard is paid to the complaints, or rather the <hi>railing accuſations</hi> of ſuch as under fair ſhews and pretences have manifeſtly <hi>evil will at Sion;</hi> and while they profeſs themſelves to be actuated by the <hi>Spirit of liberty,</hi> appear to be really poſſeſſed with the <hi>Daemon of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiouſneſs.</hi> I profeſs I ſee not what we can do for, or with theſe determined enemies of our holy faith except praying, in the ſpirit of <hi>fervent charity,</hi> that God would be pleaſed "to bring them into the way of truth." <hi>The Spirit ſpeaketh expreſsly,</hi> ſays St. <hi>Paul, that in the latter times ſome ſhall depart from the faith, giving heed to ſeducing Spirits, and doctrines of devils.</hi>

Trinity, &amp;c. in the Church's infallibility, roundly deny that this great doctrine can be proved, either from Scripture, or by <q>conſent of the ancient fathers.</q> This, as that great author obſerves, is <q>doing the principal and proper work of the <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> for them.</q> I find the following extract from the <hi>Racovian Catechiſm,</hi> made by the anonymous author of <hi>Four Treatiſes concerning the Doctrine, &amp;c. of the Mahometans:—Sententia eorum, qui Chriſto naturam divinam tribuunt, eſt repugnans non ſolum ſanae rationi, verum etiam Divinis Literis,</hi> &amp;c." Hereunto the author ſubjoins two other ſimilar paſſages, the firſt from <hi>Smalcius,</hi> a famous <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian;</hi> and the latter from <hi>Socinus</hi> himſelf.

            <p>Let us ſee then how Bp. <hi>Jewel</hi> manages this matter againſt his antagoniſt Mr. <hi>Hardinge,</hi> who, in his pretended confutation of the <hi>Apology for the Church of England,</hi> confidently aſſerts, that <q>the Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Holy Ghoſt cannot be proved by any expreſs authority from Scripture.</q> We find that illuſtrious prelate taking the wiſeſt method of putting his adverſary to ſilence and confuſion, by producing teſtimonies and opinions, and not barely
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:1123800600:291"/>
conceſſions, but ſtrong aſſeverations of a directly contrary tendency, from the writers of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church itſelf. One quotation from <hi>Nazianzen</hi> is extremely remarkable, and runs as follows. <q>
                  <hi>Dicet aliquis non eſſe ſcriptum, Spiritum Sanctum eſſe Deum. Atqui proponetur tibi</hi> EXAMEN <hi>teſtimonio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, ex quibus oſtendetur, Divinitatem S.

               </q> In ſhort, the various methods which have been taken by Papiſts to evince the neceſſity of admitting the infallibility of the Church, and to diſcredit the authority of the evangelical writings, are equally ſcandalous and pitiful. You have them particularly enumerated by an author juſt now quoted; and it will be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to ſelect one of them, as it is a flagrant one; I mean that of the Cardinal <hi>Perron,</hi> who, in the laſt century, in order to render the Scriptures ſuſpected and contemptible, aſſerted, that <q>ſome things in them ſound like fables, others are apt to raiſe in the mind indecent and diſhoneſt imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, as ſome expreſſions in <hi>Solomon's ſong;</hi> the hiſtory of <hi>Balaam's Aſs</hi> which ſpoke; and the <hi>jaw-bone</hi> of an <hi>Aſs,</hi> with which <hi>Sampſon</hi> ſlew a thouſand <hi>Philiſtines.</hi>

            <p>Page 13. <hi>(c) Errors of integrity.]</hi> One of Mr. <hi>K.</hi>'s arguments, or rather one argument urged by him in the name of his Church, is the following. <q>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retics would ariſe after the Apoſtles time, and after the writing of Scriptures: theſe cannot be diſcovered, condemned, and avoided, unleſs the Church be infallible; therefore there muſt be a Church infallible.</q> To which Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi> replies in theſe words. <q>I pray tell me why can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not hereſies beſufficiently diſcovered, condemned, and avoided by them which believe Scripture to be the rule of faith? If Scripture be ſufficient to inform us what is the faith, it muſt of neceſſity be alſo ſufficient to teach us what is hereſy; ſeeing hereſy is nothing but a manifeſt deviation from, and an oppoſition to the faith. That which is ſtraight will plainly teach us what is crooked, and one contrary cannot but manifeſt the other. If any one ſhould deny that there is a God, that this God is omnipotent, omniſcient, good, &amp;c,  that Jeſus Chriſt is the Saviour of the world, and the Son of God; if any man ſhould deny either his birth, his paſſion, or reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,  or <hi>ſitting at the right hand of God;</hi> his having <hi>all power given him,</hi>  that it is he whom God hath appointed to be <hi>Judge of the quick and the dead;</hi> that all men ſhall riſe again at
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:1123800600:293"/>
the laſt day, &amp;c,  if a man ſhould hold, that either the keeping of the <hi>Moſaical</hi> law is neceſſary to Salvation, or that <hi>good works</hi> are not neceſſary; in a word, if any man ſhould obſtinately contradict the truth of any thing plainly delivered in Scripture, who does not ſee that every one which believes the Scripture hath ſufficient means to diſcover, and condemn, and avoid that hereſy, without any need of an infallible guide? If you ſay, that the <hi>obſcure places of Scripture contain matters of faith,</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that it is a matter of faith to believe that the ſenſe of them, whatever it is, which was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by God, is true; for he that doth not ſo, calls God's truth into queſtion. But to believe this or that to be the true ſenſe of them, or to believe the true ſenſe of them, and to avoid the falſe, is not neceſſary either to faith, or ſalvation.</q>
            </p>
            <p>It may be aſked, however, whether this gives us ſatisfaction to the full? Do not our <hi>Creeds</hi> and <hi>Articles</hi> contain particulars which we ſhall look for in vain in M. <hi>C.</hi>'s liſt of the objects of faith? Are not many whom we conſider as heretics ready to ſubſcribe to this liſt? Was Mr. <hi>C.</hi> inadvertently, or deſignedly ſilent with regard to theſe particulars? Or are we to conſign them to the claſs of obſcurity? Whatever might have been his motive to the word<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his paragraph in this manner, or whatever was his perſonal perſuaſion in reſpect to the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental articles of the faith profeſſed by the
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:1123800600:294"/>
Church of <hi>England,</hi> the momentous import of the interrogatories I have juſt put muſt be viſible to every reader.</p>
            <p>When Mr. <hi>C.,</hi> or any body elſe tells us, that <q>God does not require any more of any man than this, to believe the Scripture to be God's word, and to endeavour to find the true ſenſe of it, and to live according to it;</q> or, that <q>he that believes the Scripture ſincerely, and endeavours to believe it in the true ſenſe, cannot poſſibly be an heretic,</q> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">See Relig. of Proteſt. p. 335; and end of Preface.</note>he muſt be underſtood with qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; as aſſerting, not abſolutely that an honeſt man cannot poſſibly <hi>err concerning the faith,</hi> but that error, or hereſy will not be imputed to invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary ignorance, or to ſincerity of perſuaſion.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Hereſy, ſays Bp. <hi>Taylor,</hi> is not an error of the underſtanding, but of the will;</q> and elſewhere, <q>it is not the opinion, but the impiety that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns and makes the heretic.</q> On this princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple this ſagacious and moderate writer condemns the <hi>Hereſiarch</hi> whoſe error <q>commences upon pride and ambition, &amp;c. and excuſes thoſe who follow him in ſimplicity of heart.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Agreably to all this, Dr.</hi> Potter, <hi>(author of the Anſwer to</hi> Charity Miſtaken, <hi>whoſe cauſe</hi> Chilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth <hi>eſpouſes,) and after him Dr.</hi> Waterland <hi>quotes the following remarkable paſſage from</hi> Salvian, <hi>an antient Biſhop of</hi> Marſeilles, <hi>reſpecting the truly</hi>
               <pb n="282" facs="tcp:1123800600:295"/>
               <hi>ſincere of the</hi> Arian <hi>perſuaſion.</hi> They are heretics, but do not know that they are ſo. In ſhort, they are heretics in our judgment, not ſo in their own; for they eſteem themſelves ſuch good Catholics, that they even throw upon us the infamous charge of hereſy. Such therefore as they are to us, we are to them. We know aſſuredly that they are injurious to the divine generation of the Son of God, in making him inferior to the Father. They, on the other hand, think us injurious to the Father, in believing them both equal. How they ſhall be puniſhed at the day of judgment for this their error, &amp;c. no one can know except the Judge.</p>
            <p>It may be proper to take Mr. <hi>K.</hi>'s argument, and Mr. <hi>C.</hi>'s anſwer into re-conſideration. <q>Hereſies, ſays the former, would ariſe after the Apoſtles' time, and after the writing of Scriptures: theſe cannot be diſcovered, condemned, and avoided, unleſs the Church be infallible; therefore there muſt be a Church infallible.</q> The ſubſtance of Mr. <hi>C.</hi>'s reply is, that <q>without any need of an infallible guide,</q> the great truths of the Goſpel are diſcoverable, and conſequently hereſies avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, by all ſuch as <q>believe Scripture to be the rule of faith:</q> and that with reſpect to thoſe obſcure places of Scripture," which Mr. <hi>K.</hi> tells us "contain matters of faith," we have nothing to do but <q>believe that the ſenſe of them, whatſoever it is, which was intended by God, is true,</q> without being ſolicitous to avoid miſtakes concerning them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="283" facs="tcp:1123800600:296"/>
By this anſwer 'tis certain this celebrated diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant ſeems to lay his own faith rather open to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion. For does he not admit what he might, and in fact ought to have conteſted? Take them in the groſs, the <q>places of Scripture which contain matters of faith,</q> are not by any means <hi>obſcure,</hi> but altogether plain and intelligible. <hi>I ſpeak con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning</hi> the faith of <hi>the Church.</hi> What the ſenſe of theſe places is, according to the eſtabliſhed laws of interpretation, and according to the belief of the Chriſtians of the firſt ages, is a queſtion, to the determination of which we ſurely need not have recourſe to infallibility. Though therefore, with reſpect to paſſages really ambiguous, or <hi>obſcure,</hi> it will be a ſafe and excellent rule, <q>to believe that the ſenſe of them, whatſoever it is, which was intended by God, is true,</q> yet it will be unfair, unreaſonable, and unſafe to apply this rule to places which are no otherwiſe ambiguous, or <hi>obſcure,</hi> than as they "contain matters of faith;" eſpecially when we remember how frequently, and how ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly we are required to <hi>ſtrive for the faith,</hi> to <hi>contend for the faith,</hi> and to <hi>examine</hi> and <hi>prove</hi> our <hi>own</hi> ſelves <hi>whether</hi> we <hi>be in the faith.</hi> Truth is not leſs truth becauſe it is held in a Church that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends not to be infallible. God <hi>only knows the hearts of the children of men:</hi> but at the ſame time it will be no breach of charity to intimate, that <hi>every man</hi> ſhould <hi>be fully perſuaded in his own mind,</hi>
               <pb n="284" facs="tcp:1123800600:297"/>

            <p>Page 14. <hi>(d) of inſanity.]</hi> I cannot bring myſelf to recall theſe words by the high reſpect which on many accounts is due to the names of certain perſons, eminent for their ability, and ſome of them for their piety too, who have advanced notions not a whit leſs eccentric or extravagant than theſe. The late worthy Biſhop of <hi>Cloyne,</hi> who denied, or at leaſt doubted the exiſtence of matter, is not without his numerous admirers. In fact, he ſeems to have confounded all, though he has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced none. But whatever purpoſe was intended to be ſerved by ſuch a doctrine, ſurely its real con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences muſt be detrimental to the cauſe of Chriſtianity. If all about us is mere mockery and illuſion, the very foundations of all evidence, all faith, and all practice are undermined; nor will it be poſſible to determine which poſition moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicts my ſenſes, or offers moſt violence to my conceptions, <hi>that</hi> which avers the non-exiſtence of matter, or <hi>that</hi> which maintains the <hi>tranſubſtantiation</hi> of it in the holy Sacrament. The followers of Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> will be apt to laugh this notion to ſcorn,
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:1123800600:298"/>
under a perſuaſion that they deny, or doubt the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence of Spirit, and conſequently of God, with a much better grace. It may be obſerved, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to both extremes, that there is no ſuch thing as demonſtrating beyond a poſſibility of doubt, or contradiction. For, to uſe the words of an author of the laſt century, <q>it is poſſible that <hi>mathematical evidence</hi> itſelf may be but a conſtant undiſcovera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble deluſion, which our nature is neceſſarily and perpetually obnoxious unto, and that either fatally or fortuitouſly there has been in the world time out of mind ſuch a being as we call <hi>Man,</hi> whoſe eſſential property it is to be then moſt of all miſtaken when he conceives a thing moſt evidently true.</q> There is no ſhutting the door againſt ſcepticiſm. We meet with doubters and diſputers of all ages and nations. <hi>Marcus Antoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> makes mention of one <hi>Monimus,</hi> a <hi>Cynic</hi> philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher, who averred that all is fancy, and that there is abſolutely no ſuch thing as a <hi>criterion</hi> of truth. <hi>Pyrrho,</hi> though not the firſt ſceptic, was famous enough to give an appellation to ſcepticiſm. But notwithſtanding all this, a man of ſenſe and of common prudence will liſten to rational evidence, and yield aſſent to moral certainty. He will ſoon be convinced upon enquiry, that both body and ſpirit exiſt, and that mind is neither matter nor motion; that if chance, or nature, if you pleaſe, made the world, it is that which preſerves it too;

and may diſſolve it; and, after its diſſolution, may reſtore it to its original ſtate, or reduce it to one infinitely worſe than the preſent. This ſure is at beſt but uncomfortable philoſophy. Not that I would hereby inſinuate immorality to be neceſſarily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with infidelity. <hi>Plato</hi> diſtinguiſhed long ago between the "ranting" and ſober atheiſt; and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that a man whoſe ſentiments are impious may be virtuous from conſtitution. Accordingly he very juſtly reſolves atheiſm into not barely depravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of manners, but ſometimes into an affectation of ſingular wiſdom. <note n="*" place="bottom">See Letters on Infidelity. p. 35.</note>One ſource of atheiſm in his opinion is, <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>Dr. <hi>Cudworth</hi> ſeems unwarily to give ſome ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to the atheiſt, where he ſays, that <q>when we affirm that God is incomprehenſible, we only mean, that our imperfect minds cannot have ſuch a conception of his nature as doth perfectly maſter, conquer, and ſubdue that vaſt object under it, &amp;c.</q> The caſe is, we comprehend by our reaſon <hi>that</hi> God is, though not <hi>what</hi> he is, in reſpect of his eſſence in the abſtract. But that he is ſelf-exiſtent from all eternity, that he is a <hi>Spirit,</hi> that he is the Creator and Governor of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, that he is all perfect, are certain truths,
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:1123800600:300"/>
notwithſtanding the darkneſs which ſurrounds them. <hi>Sophocles</hi> may be imagined to have had theſe truths in his eye, when ſpeaking of the divine edicts, and the immutable decrees of heaven, he puts this fine ſentiment in the mouth of <hi>Antigone,</hi>

Such language is at no rate to be tolerated in a ſtate.</q> The judicious reader will ſee how little a way this theory goes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards clearing the difficulty; but he will, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume, acknowlege it goes far enough to convince us, that <hi>Plato</hi> had, <q>to ſpeak modeſtly, as preciſe ideas of the Divine nature as any modern philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher,</q> according to the tranſlator's expreſſion.

               <hi>The general way both among Jews and Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians of accounting for the origin of evil, is to derive it from the abuſe of human liberty. Let us turn to the ſentiments of the learned</hi> Grotius <hi>upon this ſubject.</hi>

            <p>The very learned and equally pious Dr. <hi>Barrow</hi> expreſſes himſelf on this ſubject in the following words. <q>As for thoſe real imperfections and evils, (moral evils, habitual diſtempers, irregular ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, &amp;c.) we need not ſeek any one eternal cauſe for them; (though order and uniformity do, diſorder and confuſion do not argue any unity of cauſe whence they ſhould proceed:) the true cauſes of them are notorious enough: the voluntary declining of men, &amp;c, from the way God doth preſcribe them; their abuſing their own faculties, &amp;c. &amp;c. As for other evils of griefs and pains incident to the nature, or conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent upon the actions of any being, they are ſuch as God himſelf, (without any derogation to his goodneſs,) may in his wiſdom, or juſtice be author of, for ends ſometimes apparent to our underſtanding, ſometimes ſurpaſſing its reach. It may ſuffice, that God challengeth to himſelf the
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:1123800600:309"/>
being the cauſe of them. <hi>Shall there be any evil in the city, and the Lord hath not done it? Doth not evil and good proceed out of the mouth of the Moſt High? I am the Lord, and there is none elſe; I form the light, and create darkneſs; I make peace, and create evil.</hi>
               </q> (See Amos. 3. v. 6. Lamen. 3. v. 38. Iſa. 45. v. 7.)

Infidelity is always on the watch, and will take advantage in a moment of the leaſt ambiguous, or inaccurate, or obſcure expreſſion, which may fall from our lips, or our pens. Some of the Fathers themſelves, and indeed of our own moſt able writers, ſometimes ſpeak unguardedly, and inconſiſtently on theſe ſubjects. For the ſake of perſpicuity and diſtinction, as it ſhould ſeem, it has been ſaid, the <hi>Father</hi> is <hi>ſelf-exiſtent,</hi> and the

               <q>The Father, (ſays another able advocate for the doctrine of the Trinity,) is firſt in our conception of God; and therefore when we ſpeak of the Almighty, or the eternal God, and the reaſon is the ſame for the only God, we primarily and principally mean the Father, tacitly including the other two Perſons.</q>

But is the language of the author laſt quoted of a piece with this ſentence, when he talks of ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exiſtence, or <hi>unoriginateneſs,</hi> as the peculiar mode of the exiſtence of the <hi>Firſt</hi> Perſon? Or is the writer firſt quoted perfectly conſiſtent with himſelf, when he concurs in ſentiment with thoſe whom he calls "the moſt zealous defenders of the <hi>Nicene</hi> faith;" and agrees with <hi>all</hi> the antient writes, who, he tells us, <q>hold the Son to be in ſome ſenſe inferior to the Father, and that even with regard to his divine nature?</q> 
               <q>The Father, ſays he, is the firſt Perſon, the Son, the ſecond. The Father they <hi>all</hi> repreſent as unbegotten, receiving his being and attributes from none but himſelf; the Son they teach to be God of God; begotten of the Father, and receiving his nature, &amp;c, from the Father, but yet coeternal and coequal with the Father, receiving from him from all eternity the ſame intire and individed eſſence.</q> Is not this language inaccurate, incongruous, and ſelf-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory?"

And St. <hi>Auſtin, argute pro more ſuo,</hi> according to Bp. <hi>Bull's</hi> remark, obſerves, in a diſcourſe on a paſſage in St. <hi>Matthew</hi>'s goſpel, (if I miſtake not,) as follows: <hi>Inſinuatur nobis in Patre auctoritas, in Filio nativitas, in Spiritu Sancto communitas, in tribus aequalitas.</hi> It is Bp. <hi>Bull</hi>'s own remark, <hi>unicum eſſe in Trinitate principium, principii expers, nempe Patrem, dogma fuiſſe in primaeva eccleſia tam fixum,—ut in quadrigeſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo nono Canonum, qui dicuntur Apoſtolorum, damnetur quiſquis baptizaverit in tres principii expertes;</hi>

Dr. <hi>Fiddes</hi> gives us a paſſage from St. <hi>Hilary,</hi> in which that Father aſſerts, that <q>our making the Son God is no objection againſt the Father's being the one God. He is the one God, ſays he, becauſe the only underived God.</q> Surely Bp. <hi>Pearſon</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, who in the main is wonderfully exact, does not ſpeak in the moſt proper terms, when he tells us, that <q>the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt is originally God, as not receiving his eternal being from any other; that therefore it neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily followeth, that Jeſus Chriſt, who is certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly not the Father, cannot be a Perſon ſubſiſting in the Divine Nature originally of himſelf; and conſequently, it having been already proved, that he is truly and properly the eternal God, that he muſt be underſtood to have the Godhead communicated to him by the Father, who is not only eternally but originally God; that in him (Chriſt) is the ſame fulneſs of the Godhead, more than which the Father cannot have, but yet that in that perfect and abſolute equality there is notwithſtanding this diſparity, &amp;c. &amp;c.</q> To adduce only one example more; even the judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious <hi>Hooker</hi> is off his guard in the following paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage. <q>Seeing therefore the Father alone is origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally that Deity which Chriſt originally is not, (for Chriſt is God by being of God, light
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:1123800600:315"/>
by iſſuing out of light,) it followeth hereupon, that whatſoever Chriſt hath common unto him with his heavenly Father, the ſame of neceſſity muſt be given him, but naturally and eternally given him, not beſtowed by way of benevolence &amp;c.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The priority implied in the term Father, in its common acceptation, accounts for all this incoherency; but where, I would gladly know, do the terms <hi>auctor, fons, origo, principium,</hi> &amp;c. occur in the Scriptures, or in the writings of the apoſtolical Fathers, <hi>Clemens, Polycarp,</hi> and <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius?</hi> Or where are any terms to be found importing ſubordination and inferiority, except ſuch as evidently refer to the humanity of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt?</hi> And after all, and all this put together notwithſtanding, the common reſemblances by which the great myſtery has been faintly illuſtrated by the Fathers, eſpecially by <hi>Juſtin Martyr, Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian,</hi> and <hi>Origen,</hi> as light from the ſun, or a ſtream from a fountain, are produced to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe as proofs of a ſubordination, &amp;c. For let light be ſuppoſed to have iſſued from the ſun, or a ſtream from a fountain, from all eternity; on this ſuppoſition it is plain, cauſality and originality are merely nominal; the fountain neceſſarily im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies the ſtream, and the ſun, light: and in like manner, in the caſe before us, the exiſtence of the Father neceſſarily ſuppoſes the exiſtence of the Son,
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:1123800600:316"/>
and of the Holy Ghoſt. The Father can no more exiſt without the Son than the Son without the Father.</p>
            <p>The truth is, the Fathers of the Church, whoſe ſentiments Bp. <hi>Bull</hi> lays before us, apparently grant much, but really yield nothing. If <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> e. g., aſſerting the eternity and Divinity of the Son of God, meant not ſuch an abſolute co-equality as en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely excludes all dependence and inferiority, he flatly contradicts the Creed which goes under his name, in which it is expreſsly ſaid, that in the Trinity, <q>none is afore or after other, none is greater or leſs than another;</q> and if he did mean this, we cannot argue againſt his faith from the careleſſneſs, or the impropriety, or even the abſurdity of his expreſſions. Elucidation has before now been the parent of entanglement. The <hi>Arians</hi> themſelves are ſenſible they cannot admit the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the Son of God, without acknowleging at the ſame time his abſolute co-equality; and therefore affect to underſtand every paſſage or phraſe ſeemingly derogating from the dignity of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> as a direct aſſertion, or tacit conceſſion that he is a creature. Through a moſt ſtrange in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advertence, the writers we have been extracting from appear to have confounded the idea of tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral with that of eternal generation.</p>
            <p>It has been frequently and well obſerved, that moſt of the Fathers, before the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi>
               <pb n="304" facs="tcp:1123800600:317"/>
ſpeak ſometimes of a temporal generation of the Son by the operation of the Holy Ghoſt on the bleſſed Virgin; and ſometimes, by a ſort of <hi>cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chreſis,</hi> give the name of generation to the miſſion of the Son from the Father, for the purpoſe of creating the world; and that, by directing our whole attention to the paſſages relative to both theſe, the enemies of our faith have artfully attempted to prevent our notice, or acknowlegment of other numberleſs places in the writings of theſe Fathers, wherein they plainly and unequivocally aſſert the eternal generation of the Son of God.</p>

Whether St. <hi>Barnabas,</hi> who was St. <hi>Paul's</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion and fellow-labourer, was the author of the catholic Epiſtle to which his name is prefixed, is a queſtion undecided at this day. Much has been urged on this ſubject <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con</hi> by learned men; nor am I concerned to inquire, on which ſide the arguments preponderate. It will ſuffice to ſay, that many have thought the allegorical interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Scripture with which the performance abounds, by far too imaginary, or indeed too tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling for the pen of one of the <hi>Minor</hi> Apoſtles, as <hi>Voſſius</hi> calls him. This able critic is however a ſtrong advocate for him, and the primitive fathers in general; and gives it as his clear opinion, that nothing of this kind in him, or in St. <hi>Clement,</hi> (from whom he extracts the particulars above no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed,) ought in reaſon to be alledged to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credit of their writings.

            <p>I would take this opportunity to obſerve, that the doctrine of types and ſymbols, as it has been revived by many moderns, ſo has it by ſome been upheld with a zeal which, in going beyond the bounds of judgment, has, it may be, done diſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to Chriſtianity. Let me aſk the moſt ſanguin advocates for ſymbols and prefigurations, how they reliſh this mode of ſpeculation in the <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> when, among the arguments which they adduce in pretended proof of St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s primacy, they tell us his SHIP, out of which the Lord taught the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, was an emblem or type of the Chriſtian Church? In ſhort, the doctrine of types in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral is, in my opinion, too often at beſt more inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious than ſolid, and has a ſtronger foundation in fancy than in fact. Perhaps the reader may be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained as well as convinced by two or three ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect inſtances.

nature: firſt, as this was of one ſtuff with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out mixture, ſo that without ſin, &amp;c. ſecondly, as this was put on after an extraordinary manner, ſo Chriſt put on humanity by an extraordinary conception; thirdly, as was the edge about the hole to keep it from rending, ſuch was the unſeparable union of Chriſt's two natures; fourthly as were the bells and pomegranates, ſuch were his life and doctrine.</q> Another learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed writer, Mr. <hi>Mede,</hi> ſpeaking of the <hi>manna</hi> and the <hi>rock</hi> in the <hi>wilderneſs,</hi> which are mentioned by St. <hi>Paul</hi> as types of Chriſt, 1 Cor. 10. v. 3, 4. expatiates in the following words. <q>As <hi>Manna</hi> came from heaven beſide the ordinary courſe of nature, ſo Chriſt's birth was wonderful, &amp;c. As <hi>Manna</hi> was of a moſt ſweet taſte, ſo is Chriſt unto the ſoul, &amp;c. As <hi>Manna</hi> was of a white co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, ſo our Saviour was white and pure. As <hi>Manna</hi> before it was eaten was brayed in a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, &amp;c. ſo was Chriſt our heavenly manna bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken upon the Croſs, &amp;c.

the leſt diſturbed by the diſagreement betwixt the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Church, with reſpect to the <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion</hi> of the Holy Ghoſt. The doctrine of the former was, that the <hi>Holy Ghoſt proceeds from the Father by the Son, and is the Spirit of the Son;</hi> non ex Filio, ſed ſpiritum Filii <hi>eſſe dicimus, et Patris per Filium.</hi> This doctrine is erroneous indeed, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocently ſo. For, as Archbp. <hi>Laud,</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">See Laud againſt Fiſher. p. 24.</note>and many others have obſerved, the queſtion, whether the Holy Ghoſt proceeds <hi>a Filio,</hi> or <hi>per Filium,</hi> is but a queſtion <hi>in modo loquendi;</hi> a mere difference in words, and affects not the faith. And therefore I cannot think Bp. <hi>Taylor</hi> argues candidly, or logi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, in the following paſſage. <q>The proceſſion of the Holy Ghoſt from the Son, which is an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle the <hi>Greek</hi> Church diſavows, derives from the Tradition Apoſtolical, as it is pretended; and yet before St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> we hear nothing of it very clearly or certainly, foraſmuch as that whole myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery concerning the bleſſed Spirit was ſo little explicated in Scripture, and ſo little derived to them by tradition, that till the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> you ſhall hardly find any form of worſhip, or perſonal addreſs of devotion to the Holy Spirit, as <hi>Eraſmus</hi> obſerves, and I think the contrary will very hardly be verified.</q>

is expreſsly ſtyled by St. <hi>Peter</hi> the <hi>Spirit of Chriſt</hi> which, in the next ſentence, is ſaid to have been <hi>ſent down from heaven;</hi> 1 Pet. 1. v. 10, 12. and I take it to be fully as preſumeable that the article of the <hi>proceſſion</hi> in queſtion was grounded in the conſtruction which this paſſage naturally admits, as that it "derived from tradition Apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal;" notwithſtanding the immaterial diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment above-mentioned. But whether this differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence with reſpect to the mode of <hi>proceſſion</hi> took its riſe from different conſtruction, or from dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erent tradition, the faith both of the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Church in the third Perſon of the Trinity was ſtill built on a ſure foundation. Eternity of generation, and proceſſion, and exiſtence, is equally inexplicable; and though nothing was, or, in the nature of things, could be <q>explicated in Scripture</q> in reſpect of the whole myſtery, yet, I apprehend, enough was <hi>revealed.</hi> Even if the firſt Chriſtians had not addreſſed the bleſſed Spirit in any form of devotion at all, this could not have been owing to their want of comprehenſion of the mode of <hi>proceſſion,</hi> but to their diſbelief of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonality, and eternal exiſtence. But that the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Chriſtians, and the <hi>ante-nicene</hi> fathers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved the perſonality and eternal exiſtence of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and conſequently his coequality with the <hi>Father</hi> and the <hi>Son,</hi> ſufficiently, I truſt, appears from the teſtimonies produced; and therefore ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:1123800600:339"/>
that moſt of the prayers of the Church were addreſſed to the <hi>Father,</hi> and few only to the <hi>Son,</hi> and fewer to the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> (which is far from being a matter unaccountable,) we have ample proofs that Chriſtians worſhipped <q>one God in Trinity, and Trinity in Unity.</q> 
               <hi>Eraſmus</hi> does not venture to aſſert, that no addreſſes were made to the Holy Ghoſt; and, if he had, we might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front him with the above cited declaration of <hi>Juſtin Martyr;</hi> which at leaſt ſuppoſes this Divine Perſon to have been included, and frequently named in the ſupplications of the firſt Chriſtians. <gap reason="foreign">

            </p>
            <p>The paſſage quoted from this father in the former part of this note is ſo ſtrong and explicit, that it probably gave occaſion to ſome <hi>Socinians</hi> to aver, that HE was the firſt who taught the doctrine of the Trinity. I ſaid, <hi>ſome Socinians,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, as we have already noted, moſt <hi>Socinians</hi> and <hi>Socinus</hi> himſelf fathers this doctrine upon the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Nice,</hi> with an abſurdity which is expoſed at large by Bp. <hi>Bull</hi> in his Defence of that Council. This duplicity is no ſmall argument of <hi>Socinian</hi> diſtreſs.</p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Middleton,</hi> in reſentment, I preſume, of that explicitneſs with which <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> in the place referred to, and in many other, aſſerts the doctrine of the Trinity, and with a view to counteract it, takes much pains to repreſent his interpretation of Scripture as frequently abſurd, and his doctrine as neither more nor leſs than refined <hi>Platoniſm.</hi> But
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:1123800600:342"/>
the unfairneſs, or rather the falſity of both impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations has often been ſhewn. The <hi>triad</hi> of <hi>Plato,</hi> (whoſe admirer, &amp;c. this holy father, it is well known, before his converſion was,) the <hi>mundane, animative,</hi> and <hi>intelligent</hi> nature of God, although it has been mentioned by ſome, improperly but ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly enough, to illuſtrate the doctrine in queſtion, with an intention to adapt it in ſome degree to our apprehenſions, could not poſſibly give riſe to it. It is as clear as words can make it, that <hi>Juſtin</hi> the <hi>Martyr</hi> was a <hi>Trinitarian</hi> on principles very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from thoſe of <hi>Juſtin</hi> the <hi>philoſopher.</hi> Dr. M. moſt uncandidly vilifies the typical and allegorical repreſentations, which occur often in this primitive writer, and in which probably he gratified not ſo much his own taſte as that of thoſe early ages.</p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Whitby,</hi> in his treatiſe entitled, <hi>An Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to evince the certainty of Chriſtian faith,</hi> &amp;c, cites hiſtorians of credit, who acquaint us, that when <hi>Julian</hi>'s deſign of falſifying the predictions of our Saviour, by rebuilding the Temple of <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> was defeated by miraculous eruptions of balls of fire, &amp;c, (as the ſtory is told by <hi>Ammianus Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellinus,</hi> and many others,) almoſt all the <hi>Jews,</hi> who were eye-witneſſes of this wonderful ſcene, were converted to the Chriſtian Faith, and acknowleged Chriſt to be God. The writers referred to are <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zomen, Nazianzen,</hi> and <hi>Socrates,</hi> and the following paſſage ſeems to be as plain and deciſive as can be

            <p>It ſeems evident enough from theſe words, that the <hi>Jews</hi> who were converted on this occaſion, and conſequently Chriſtians in general, at that time acknowledged Jeſus Chriſt to be abſolutely God.</p>
            <p>Indeed the truth of this great doctrine is in ſome meaſure inferrible from the incredibility formerly objected to it by its adverſaries. <gap reason="foreign">

the Supreme God. Theſe ſubaltern Deities were ſuppoſed to act as his inſtruments, and under his direction. Some of the wiſer heathens however were aſhamed of this latitudinarian ſyſtem; and pretended to reſolve their theology into allegory, &amp;c, as <hi>Zeno, Chryſippus,</hi> and other Stoics; and phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers of later date found it neceſſary to have recourſe to the ſame expedient to elude the charge brought againſt the multitude of the heathen Gods by Chriſtians. With reſpect to the Pagan notion of a ſubordination of Deities, we may affirm in the words of Dr. <hi>Heylin,</hi> that God is not only <hi>unus,</hi> but <hi>unicus,</hi> or in the phraſe of Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi>

            <p>It will be well worth remarking, that the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of the Trinity has often been repreſented as having no little colour or countenance both from <hi>Jewiſh</hi> and <hi>Pagan</hi> principles. A. <hi>Roſs,</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">See Note at No. 38.</note>in his <hi>View of all religions,</hi> &amp;c. undertakes to ſhew, that <q>the doctrine of the Trinity was not unknown even by the light of nature to the Gentile philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, poets, &amp;c. <hi>Zoroaſtres,</hi> ſays he, ſpeaks of the Father, who, having perfected all things, hath delivered them to the ſecond Mind, which Mind hath received from the Father knowlege

and power. Here is a plain teſtimony of the firſt and ſecond Perſon. Concerning the third, <hi>Zoroaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tres</hi> ſaith, that the Divine Love proceeded from the Mind or Intellect; and what elſe is this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Love but the Holy Ghoſt?</q> He then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds to lay before the reader the principles of the <hi>Chaldean Magi,</hi> who <q>acknowleged three begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, to wit, <hi>Ormaſes, Mitris,</hi> and <hi>Ariminis,</hi> i. e. God, the Mind, and Soul." He obſerves that <hi>Pythagoras</hi> was not ignorant of this myſtery, when he placed all perfection in the number THREE, and made Love the original of all things.</q> He gives us the ſentiments of <hi>Zeno, Socrates, Numenius, Plotinus,</hi> and many others, <q>who write very plainly of the <hi>Hypoſtaſes,</hi> &amp;c, ſo that <hi>no Chriſtian can write more fully.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Let us hear now what a much better known, and an univerſally admired author has to offer upon the ſame argument. From the three divine attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes of infinite Goodneſs, Wiſdom, and Power, the <hi>Pythagoreans</hi> and <hi>Platoniſts</hi> ſeem to have framed their <hi>Trinity</hi> of what Dr. <hi>Cudworth</hi> calls <hi>Archichal Hypoſtaſes:</hi> to which he ſuppoſes <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> may be thought to allude in the following paſſage in his book <hi>de caelo.</hi> l. 1. c. 1. <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>.</p>
            <p>In another place, this learned author gives us to underſtand, that <hi>Zoroaſtres,</hi> and the ancient <hi>Magi</hi> acknowleged the Supreme Deity under the different
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:1123800600:347"/>

This writer obſerves elſewhere, that <hi>Pagan</hi> theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy in general maintained a <hi>Trinity</hi> of univerſal principles, or Divine <hi>hypoſtaſes</hi> ſubordinate; the <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, the third God. According to the ſame author, the <hi>Crocodile</hi> was a ſymbol of the firſt God of the Aegyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians; <q>an animal which when in the water ſees without being ſeen:</q> and among the ſame people <hi>a winged globe with a ſerpent ſpringing out of it,</hi> was the <hi>Hieroglyphic</hi> of a triform Deity, or Trinity of Divine <hi>Hypoſtaſes.</hi> By the globe was ſignified the firſt incomprehenſible Deity, without beginning or end, ſelf-exiſtent,  by the <hi>Serpent,</hi> the Divine wiſdom and creative vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; and by the <hi>wings,</hi> that active Spirit which quickens, enlivens, and cheriſhes all things.</p>
            <p>Let us ſee now what was the theology of <hi>Julian,</hi> and the latter <hi>Platoniſts.</hi> This famous Apoſtate main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, that the inferior Gods were miniſters of a ſupreme God. He aſſerted, that this Supreme God, or firſt Deity, and fountain of all things, produced
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:1123800600:348"/>
from himſelf, an eternal mind, and a corporeal, or "ſenſible animated Sun," as a great God in the viſible world. The latter <hi>Platoniſts,</hi> in oppoſition to Chriſtianity, held, that before the Trinity there was another ſupreme and higheſt <hi>Hypoſtaſis,</hi> exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and remaining in the <hi>ſolitude of his own unity,</hi> as Dr. <hi>Cudworth</hi> literally tranſlates the words of <hi>Jamblicus.</hi> This muſt at leaſt be allowed to be language ſomewhat more intelligible than that of thoſe old <hi>Platoniſts</hi> who taught, that there is a ſubſtance, a principle "in the order of nature ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior to intellect." They ſuppoſe this firſt and higheſt principle of all, to be, by reaſon of its abſolute and tranſcendent perfection, not only above underſtanding, knowlege, and reaſon, but above eſſence itſelf; which, by the way, was the hereſy of <hi>A. Joachim,</hi> condemned by the fourth <hi>Lateran</hi> Council. Our Author very juſtly calls this viſionary doctrine <hi>myſterious Atheiſm;</hi> and it ſeems to have been adopted by that fantaſtic heretic <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentinus,</hi> whoſe thirty Gods, or <hi>Aeons,</hi> were the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction or offspring of a ſelf-originated Deity, whom he calls <hi>Bythus,</hi> or <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, i. e. unfathomable <hi>profundity;</hi> or, according to ſome, of <hi>profundity</hi> and <hi>ſilence.</hi> Even the theory of <hi>Heſiod,</hi> whether li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terally, or phyſiologically underſtood, is much more agreeable to truth, and the <hi>Moſaic</hi> hiſtory.

            </p>
            <p>At beſt, little ſolid or conſiſtent can be extracted from this medley of principles; and if we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand by <hi>a Trinity,</hi> what in reaſon we ought to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand by it, <hi>viz. a Trinity of three efficient, living, intelligent Perſons, the ſovereign cauſes and rulers of all things,</hi> (to uſe the words of a learned <note n="†" place="bottom">See Extract from an anonymous Author quoted by Dr. RANDOLPH in his Vindica. p. 51. &amp;c.</note>writer,) we ſhall look in vain for ſuch a doctrine properly and preciſely taught before the epoch of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity. It is certain, the antient Pagan Theology derived partly from tradition, and partly from <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daiſm.</hi> In the doctrines of the latter we are to look for the riſe and foundation of the principal tenets of the Philoſophers whoſe names have been men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; of whom ſome are known to have had communications with the <hi>Jews.</hi> What then were the ſentiments of theſe deſcendants of <hi>Abraham</hi> heretofore with reſpect to the great doctrine before us? The queſtion is a material one; and, unleſs I greatly miſtake, the ſolution of it will terminate in a very ſatisfactory concluſion.</p>
            <p>Chriſtian writers differ but little in what they
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:1123800600:350"/>
have advanced upon this head. To take a few of them as they fall in our way. <hi>Wollebius</hi> lays down the following principle as an indubitable one. <hi>Etſi Veteris Teſtamenti tempore doctrina S. S. Trinitatis obſcurior fuerit, non tamen plane ignota fuit.</hi> He then quotes the firſt <hi>Chap.</hi> of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> and other paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages in the Old Teſtament, in common with other authors, in ſupport of his poſition, or his <hi>Canon,</hi> as he calls it, and finiſhes the paragraph in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing words; <hi>quae teſtimonia tametſi pertinaces Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daei eludere ſatagunt, Chriſtianae tamen menti ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciunt.</hi> The learned Dr. <hi>Lightfoot</hi>'s ſentiments on this ſubject, which Mr. <hi>Parkhurſt</hi> has adopted, or rather with particular warmth eſpouſed, are as follows.</p>
            <p>
               <q>The very firſt thing, ſays he, that is taught in all the Bible <note n="*" place="bottom">See Geneſis 1. 1, 2, 3, &amp;c.</note>is this very myſtery.</q> God <hi>created;</hi> God, i. e. the Word <hi>ſaid;</hi> and the Spirit, i. e. the Holy Ghoſt <hi>moved.</hi> 
               <q>So <hi>Moſes</hi> alſo when he is to teach concerning the creation of man, he firſt teacheth that it was the Trinity that created him. <hi>And God ſaid, Let us make man after our image.</hi> He ſaith <hi>Let us,</hi> to ſhew the Trinity of Perſons; and he ſaith <hi>in our image,</hi> not <hi>in our images,</hi> to ſhew the unity of eſſence.</q> The Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity is ſuppoſed by Dr. L. to be declared in many places; even at v. 4. of Deut. 6. <hi>Hear, O Iſrael, the Lord, our God, the Lord is one.</hi> Dr. L. gives
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:1123800600:351"/>
this as the true reading, which, ſays he, <q>teaches the Trinity in Unity and Unity in Trinity. Three words anſwer the three Perſons, and the middle word our God, deciphering fitly the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, who aſſumed our nature.</q> This learned writer ſuppoſes the ſame myſtery to be imported in the following among many other texts. <hi>Exo.</hi> 34. v. 6. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6. v. 3. <hi>Pſalms</hi> 50. v. 1. 136. v. 1, 2, 3.</p>
            <p>Indeed, Jeſus Chriſt is by the almoſt unanimous ſuffrage of writers the <hi>Jehovah</hi> of the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The <hi>Angel of the Covenant,</hi> the <hi>Angel</hi> who appeared to <hi>Moſes</hi> at the <hi>buſh,</hi> the chief of the <hi>Angels</hi> who were entertained by <hi>Abraham,</hi> &amp;c, is generally ſuppoſed to have been the Second Perſon in the <note n="†" place="bottom">See particularly ALLIX. BULL. JUSTIN MARTYR. IRENAEUS, and TERTULLIAN.</note>Trinity. A ſenſible writer endeavours to prove, that the doctrine of the Trinity is contained in the <hi>Law,</hi> and that it is in fact acknowleged and aſſerted by the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Rabbies, by <hi>Philo</hi> and <hi>Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monides,</hi> &amp;c. The <hi>Jewiſh Cabaliſts,</hi> ſays he, <q>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh God into three Lights; and ſome of them call them by the ſame names, as the Chriſtians, of the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit; and yet ſay that this does not at all break the Unity of God. Your famous <hi>Philo,</hi> ſays he, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes the ſame in many places.</q> And he produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces a conſiderable number of inſtances, by which it appears that this celebrated Rabbin at leaſt lays
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:1123800600:352"/>
himſelf open to the attacks of every Chriſtian adverſary.</p>
            <p>To the ſame effect Dr. <hi>Randolph</hi> quotes a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable paſſage from <hi>Euſebius,</hi> in which it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that, according to the doctrine of the <hi>Jews,</hi> 
               <q>there is, after the Eſſence of God, &amp;c, a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple begotten of no other but the Father, being firſt-begotten, &amp;c, being the image of God, the power of God, the wiſdom of God, and the word of God; the true light, the <hi>Sun of righteouſneſs,</hi> &amp;c, &amp;c.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>There are two ſtriking paſſages, the one in the book of</hi> Proverbs, <hi>and the other in the</hi> apocryphal <hi>book entitled the</hi> Wiſdom of Solomon, <hi>which have been pretty generally conſidered as deſignative of the Second Perſon in the Chriſtian Trinity.</hi> I was ſet up from everlaſting, or ever the earth was. When he prepared the heavens, I was there; when he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed the foundations of the earth, then was I by him, as one brought up with him, &amp;c. <hi>(Prov. 8. v. 22.</hi> &amp;c.) When all things were in quiet ſilence, thine Almighty Word leapt down from heaven out of thy royal throne, &amp;c, &amp;c. <hi>(Wiſd. 18. v. 15.</hi> &amp;c.)</p>
            <p>The anonymous Author of the teſtaments of the twelve Patriarchs, (who, as Dr. <hi>Grabe</hi> ſuppoſes, wrote at the latter end of the ſecond century,) makes every one of them foretell the coming of the Meſſiah, and moſt of them, in the plaineſt terms, the incarnation of the Son of God, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſimply of God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="340" facs="tcp:1123800600:353"/>
All this put together, intricate or incoherent as it may appear, will be thought moſt clearly to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port a Trinity of ſome kind in the Godhead; and we may accordingly diſcern in a moment wherein lies the preciſe difference between the <hi>Pagan,</hi> the <hi>Jewiſh,</hi> the <hi>Arian,</hi> and the true Chriſtian theory. By the hypotheſis of each of the three former, the Supreme God neither is nor can be more than One Perſon; by that of the latter, the Deity conſiſts of three Perſons and one undivided eſſence. This as manifeſtly reſiſts the idea of dependence and infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority, as the other is compatible with it, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, under the notion of a Trinity, ſuppoſes it. In ſhort, it will, I preſume, be no eaſy matter to ſay what objection of weight <hi>Jews,</hi> and <hi>Gentiles, Pythagoreans,</hi> and <hi>Platoniſts,</hi> could have made to the Goſpel, what obſtacle there was to their <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming obedient to the faith without delay,</hi> except that the univerſally adopted principle of SUBORDINA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TION was ſuperſeded, and effectually deſtroyed by the peculiarly Chriſtian doctrine of EQUALITY.</p>

But if what has been offered does not exactly coincide with the notions of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, it will at leaſt in the reſult be ſubverſive of the principles of the latter. The Chriſtian doctrine of an equal Trinity will be eſtabliſhed by the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowlegement

               <hi>It is obſervable, in conformity herewith, that the Fathers in general conſider the doctrine of the Trinity, in the ſenſe of the Catholic Church, as that which characteriſtically diſcriminates Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity both from Judaiſm and Heatheniſm.

               </q> This,
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:1123800600:356"/>
I conceive, muſt be underſtood with ſome reſtric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſuppoſes no apoſtacy ſubſequent to the atteſtation in queſtion. For the famous <hi>Mahometan</hi> Doctor, <hi>Algazali,</hi> in his comment on theſe two capital articles of their faith, delivers himſelf in the following words. <hi>He ſhall alſo believe that they that confeſs one God ſhall at length go out of the fire, after they have underwent the puniſhment due to their ſins; ſo that by the favourable mercy of God, no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſhall remain in hell who acknowleged the Unity of the Godhead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt <hi>Muſſulmen</hi> gloried in the title of <hi>Unita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> upon every occaſion. Some of them carried their zeal for the grand article of their religion to a degree of ſavage ferocity. We have a notable example of this in the hiſtory of the <hi>Saracens.</hi> At the ſiege of <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> in the reign of <hi>Omar,</hi> the ſecond <hi>Caliph</hi> after <hi>Mahomet, Abu-Obeidah,</hi> the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander of the <hi>Saracen</hi> army, had granted quarter to certain citizens; which was a piece of lenity ſo exaſperating to <hi>Derar,</hi> an officer of very high rank, as to draw from him a declaration, ſeconded by the ſolemnity of an oath, that, for his part, <hi>he would never have mercy upon any that ſaid that God had a ſon, and joined a partner with God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We learn from the anonymous author of <hi>Four Treatiſes,</hi> &amp;c, (who aſſures us he derives his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities from writers of the firſt claſs,) that the <hi>Mahometans</hi> carry this <hi>unitarian</hi> principle with them
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:1123800600:357"/>
literally to their graves. His account of their fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral ſolemnities is entertaining enough; but the following are the only particulars with which we are at all concerned. At the interment of a <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulman</hi> the <hi>Muezzin,</hi> or Cryer, muſt go before the corps, reciting with a loud voice, <hi>there is no God but very God.</hi> At the cloſe of the whole ceremony, the defunct is addreſſed by the prieſt in theſe words. <hi>Be mindful of the covenant with which thou haſt gone out of this world; bearing witneſs that there is no God but very God alone, and that Mahomet is his prophet, and that Paradiſe is for certain, and fire for certain, and the reſurrection for certain;</hi> &amp;c, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>How ſhall we reconcile all this with Mr. <hi>Locke's</hi> aſſertion, that <q>to the light which the Meſſiah brought into the world with him, we muſt aſcribe the owning and profeſſion of one God, which the Mahometan religion hath derived and bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed from it.</q> Strange aſſertion! The <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometan</hi> faith is this, that there is one Perſon in the Godhead; the Catholic faith is this, that there are three Perſons in one Godhead.

Lowth</hi> from the <hi>Ductor Dubitantium.</hi> 
               <q>If we be ſent to read the laws of nature in the tables of our own hearts, where ſome things are diſordered by paſſion, many more
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:1123800600:359"/>
are written by intereſt; ſome are indited by cuſtom, and others imprinted by education; and amongſt ſeveral men theſe are the authors of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary inſcriptions; I ſay, if we have no better director than this, whereby to ſquare our actions, we ſhall find ourſelves at a loſs for the managing our behaviour in ſome of the weightieſt concerns of life.</q> The <hi>inſcriptions</hi> of paſſion, intereſt, and cuſtom, &amp;c, are not thoſe <hi>original</hi> impreſſions which are ſtill legible, and ſufficiently diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able by a candid and inquiſitive mind. The law of nature, abſtractedly conſidered, is ſtill what Bp. <hi>Cumberland</hi> calls it.</p>
            <p>That obnoxiouſneſs to error from which men of the brighteſt parts, and the greateſt profeſſional abilities, are not exempt, is to writers in general at once an encouraging and an humbling circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
            <p>The corruption of human reaſon, and the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and error incident to our underſtandings, <q>has, ſays a moſt excellent author, given manifold occaſion for the benign interpoſition of Divine Providence, which in compaſſion to the frailty, the imperfection, and the blindneſs of human reaſon, hath been pleaſed at ſundry times, and in divers manners, to diſcover and enforce its laws by an immediate and direct Revelation. The doctrines thus delivered we call the revealed or Divine law, and they are to be found only in the
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:1123800600:360"/>
Scriptures. Theſe precepts when revealed are found upon compariſon to be really a part of the original law of nature, as they tend in all their conſequences to man's felicity. But we are not from hence to conclude, that the knowlege of theſe truths was attainable by reaſon in its preſent corrupted ſtate; ſince we find that, until they were revealed, they were hid from the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of ages. As then the moral precepts of this law are indeed of the ſame original with thoſe of the law of nature, ſo their intrinſic ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation is of equal ſtrength and perpetuity. Yet undoubtedly the revealed law is of infinitely more authenticity than that moral ſyſtem which is framed by ethical writers, and denominated the natural law. Becauſe one is the law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, expreſsly declared ſo to be by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; the other is only what, by the aſſiſtance of human reaſon, we imagine to be that law. If we could be as certain of the latter as we are of the former, both would have an equal authority; but till then they can never be put in any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition. Municipal law is a rule of civil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct. This diſtinguiſhes municipal law from the natural, or revealed; the former of which is the rule of moral conduct, and the latter not only the rule of moral conduct, but alſo the rule of faith.</q>

Theſe periods ſeem to have ſlipped from the pen. The Scriptures are the Revelation of divine or ſupernatural truths, but of the <q>original law of nature</q> they are only the revival, or republica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. THEY plainly declare that to be the will of God which, in <hi>the times of ignorance</hi> and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, might rather be ſaid to have been obtruded upon the world, than recommended to it, as the will of God, by the philoſophers; <hi>they</hi> teach that by authority which, before, reaſon only dictated, or opinion eſpouſed; ſo that now every ſpecies of immorality is totally without excuſe. Properly ſpeaking, it is not the Divine Will, but the Divine Nature, "which was <q>hid from the wiſdom of ages.</q> For though we have in Scripture only the <hi>ſure word</hi> of morality, yet <hi>Socrates, Plato,</hi> and <hi>Tully,</hi> as far as they taught truly, taught the mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Scripture. In a word, Revelation is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily the rule of conduct, but directly and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately the rule of faith.</p>

It is to be found in Dr. CAVE<hi>'s Prim.

               </q> which even in Scripture, ſays Dr. C., is "a common periphraſis of the Holy Spirit." If we may believe <hi>Socrates</hi> in his Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory, (as the ſame author

refers to him,) <hi>Ignatius</hi> heard the angels in a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion praiſing the Trinity in alternate hymns,  which introduced alternate hymns into the Church. Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> ſeems inclined to ſuſpect the authority of this ſtory; and it is certain nothing is ſaid rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to ſuch a viſion in all the genuine epiſtles of this antient Father, which are ſeven; though in one of them, viz. that to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> he talks of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt's being ſung, and of ſinging to the Father by Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Sect. 4.</note>which makes the omiſſion more extraordinary.</p>
            <p>The abſolute Divinity of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> has, with more haſte than judgment, been aſſerted by ſome from our Saviour's words to the <hi>leper, I will; be thou clean:</hi> and by others from his <hi>power to forgive ſins;</hi> nothing in all this implying a ſelf-inherent au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. Dr. <hi>Whitby</hi> quotes the following paſſage from a no leſs illuſtrious Father than <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> with reſpect to the <hi>remitting power.</hi> 
               <q>By remitting the ſin, &amp;c, he ſhewed who he was; for if none can remit ſins but God, and yet our Lord did remit them, &amp;c, it is manifeſt that he was both the <hi>Word of God,</hi> and the <hi>Son of man,</hi> receiving the power of remiſſion from his Father, as God and Man.</q> Surely he could <hi>receive</hi> this power as man only.</p>
            <p>It is not my intention to derogate in the leaſt from the merit of Mr. <hi>Jones</hi>'s performance, (the
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:1123800600:369"/>
               <hi>Catholic Doctrine of a Trinity,)</hi> which upon the whole is admirable and ſatisfactory. His ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural parallels are for the moſt part happy; and his mode of reaſoning is always ingenious, and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally concluſive. Perhaps it rather fails in the application of the following text; <hi>God was</hi> IN CHRIST, <hi>reconciling the world to</hi> HIMSELF. 2 Cor. 5. 19.</p>
            <q>It is allowed on all hands, ſays Mr. <hi>Jones,</hi> that the <hi>world</hi> was reconciled by Chriſt Jeſus to the <hi>one, only, great and ſupreme God.</hi> But, this very <hi>ſame God</hi> (for the word is but once uſed in the whole ſentence) was <hi>in</hi> Chriſt; manifeſt <hi>in</hi> the fleſh, and <hi>reconciling the world to himſelf.</hi> And were there no other paſſage of Scripture to be found, this alone is ſufficient to overthrow the whole doctrine of <hi>Arianiſm;</hi> which, as far as the Scripture is concerned, depends upon this one aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion, that <hi>the word</hi> GOD, <hi>in Scripture,</hi> NEVER <hi>ſignifies a complex notion of more perſons than one; but</hi> ALWAYS <hi>means one perſon only, viz. either the perſon of the Father ſingly, or the perſon of the Son ſingly.</hi> Which is abſolutely falſe: for here it ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies <hi>both.</hi> The text conſiders God as agent and patient at the ſame time, and upon the ſame oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion; as the <hi>reconciler</hi> of the world, in the <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> of the <hi>Son;</hi> and the object to whom the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation was made,</hi> in the <hi>perſon</hi> of the <hi>Father;</hi> yet there is but one word (GOD) to expreſs them
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:1123800600:370"/>
both. So that the word God, though of the <hi>ſingular</hi> number, is of a <hi>plural</hi> comprehenſion. And thus I find it to have been taken by ſome of the moſt eminent writers before the council of <hi>Nice; Plaſmatus in initio homo per manus</hi> DEI, id eſt, FILII et SPIRITUS, ſays <hi>Irenaeus;</hi> putting the ſingular name of God for the <hi>two perſons</hi> of the <hi>Son</hi> and <hi>Spirit.</hi> And the ſame word, in the language of <hi>Origen,</hi> (if we are allowed to take the verſion of <hi>Ruffinus</hi> as genuine,) includes the whole <hi>three</hi> perſons: <hi>igitur de</hi> DEO, <hi>id eſt,</hi> de PATRE, <hi>et</hi> FILIO, <hi>et</hi> SPIRITU SANCTO. And our excellent church has uſed the word <hi>God</hi> in the ſame comprehenſive ſenſe; as in the <hi>Bleſſing</hi> after the communion ſervice, GOD ALMIGHTY, <hi>the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
            </q>
            <p>I am afraid this is not ſo full an anſwer to the above aſſertion as was to be wiſhed; and that it is not abſolutely ſufficient for the "overthrow of the whole doctrine of <hi>Arianiſm."</hi> In the firſt place, Dr. <hi>Clarke's</hi> proſelytes will be apt to inſiſt, that the whole doctrine of <hi>Arianiſm</hi> does not depend upon this one aſſertion; and in the next place, that, if it did, Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> has advanced nothing here forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble enough to overthrow it. It is true, they will ſay, <hi>God was in Chriſt;</hi> but in what ſenſe? why, by his grace, his influence, and ſpiritual commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications; as he is likewiſe ſaid to be <hi>in</hi> us; and as Chriſt is ſaid to be <hi>in</hi> us; and as we are ſaid to
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:1123800600:371"/>
be <hi>in</hi> God, and to be <hi>in</hi> Chriſt, by the purity of our hearts and affections. This, they will tell us, is plain ſimple theory, without any wanton refine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or imaginary diſtinction of "agent and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, &amp;c." And with regard to the authorities of <hi>Irenaeus, Origen,</hi> and the <hi>Bleſſing</hi> in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion ſervice, they will add, that they cannot admit either a private ſentiment, or a public doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine to be the ſtandard of true Chiſtianity.</p>
            <p>As this is ſpecious enough, it may be proper to diſencumber ourſelves from the weight of this ſame <hi>Arian</hi> aſſertion, by other conſiderations. <hi>Hac non ſucceſſit, alia progrediamur via.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt then let it be obſerved, that though the <hi>Engliſh</hi> word <hi>God</hi> be "of the <hi>ſingular</hi> number," yet the <hi>Hebrew</hi> word <hi>Elohim,</hi> of which it is the tranſlation, is confeſſedly "of a <hi>plural</hi> compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion." Accordingly it has been demonſtrated over and over again, that the ancient <hi>Jews</hi> held a plurality of ſome kind in the Deity. <hi>(Vid. Supr.)</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, ſecondly, we may recur to conſiderations ſtill more internal, and indiſputable. If it has been abundantly made to appear, that the Son is God, and the Holy Ghoſt is God, as properly and truly as the Father is God, the term God muſt unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably be acknowleged to include, or to "ſignify a complex notion of <hi>more perſons than one,"</hi> in many places of holy writ. It will ſuffice to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:1123800600:372"/>
a few inſtances. The Father is ſaid to be <hi>in</hi> us, 1 John. 4. 13. or to <hi>dwell in</hi> us, or <hi>abide</hi> with us, and the Son is ſaid to be <hi>in us,</hi> &amp;c, Rom. 8. v. 10. and the Holy Ghoſt is ſaid to be <hi>in</hi> us; and, in a caſe which he mentions, St. Paul tells the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians,</hi> it would be reported, that <hi>God</hi> was <hi>in them of a truth.</hi> 1 Cor. 14. 25. Now can any man aſſign a tolerable reaſon why the word <hi>God</hi> in this paſſage ſhould not be regarded as incluſive of the whole bleſſed Trinity? <hi>Another Scripture ſaith, every one of us ſhall give account of himſelf to God;</hi> Rom. 14. 12. but if in the term, <hi>God,</hi> Jeſus Chriſt is not comprehended, what will become of the text which aſſures us <hi>we muſt all appear before</hi> HIS <hi>judgment-ſeat?</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 10. The great Apoſtle of the Gentiles puts the <hi>Elders</hi> of the <hi>Church of Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> in mind, that he had <hi>not ſhunned to declare unto them all the counſel of God:</hi> and if he who <hi>purchaſed</hi> this <hi>Church with his own blood,</hi> and he who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed <hi>overſeers over it,</hi> are to be conſidered as parties in this <hi>counſel,</hi> (and ſurely they are to be ſo conſidered,) the word, God, has manifeſtly a <hi>complex</hi> ſignification here, and <hi>means</hi> more than <hi>one perſon only.</hi> Acts 20. 27, 28. The <hi>Kingdom of God</hi> is a phraſe which, in moſt places where it occurs, will, I preſume, not barely admit but require the ſame latitude of application. The <hi>Word of God</hi> may be regarded in the ſame light. Laſtly I ſhall cloſe theſe examples with one which is the more eligible,
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:1123800600:373"/>
becauſe it is contained in a text which has already undergone examination, and to which our adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries are for ever putting in their claim. I mean v. 28th. of the 15th. Chapter of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s firſt Epiſt. to the <hi>Cor.</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">See Diſc. 6. ſub fin.</note>
               <hi>When all things ſhall be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued unto him, then ſhall the Son alſo himſelf be ſubject unto him that put all things under him, that God,</hi> i. e. the complement of the Deity, the Trinity in Unity, <hi>may be all in all.</hi> Every critical eye ſees clearly that, in this paſſage, for the complex word—God—we muſt read the ſingle term Father, before we can with any ſort of propriety accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate it to the purpoſe of the anti-trinitarians. In this caſe indeed, there would be an obvious ſenſe, and a natural antitheſis, and both in their favour.</p>
            <p>The other text—<hi>I am in the Father, and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in me,</hi> John 14. 11., which Mr. J. produces as ſynonomiſing with the preceding, may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained away by ſimilar means. The <hi>Arian</hi> has the following paſſages to oppoſe to them. <hi>That they all may be one, as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee; that they alſo may be one in us; that they may be one, even as we are one. I in them, and thou in me,</hi> &amp;c. John 17. 21, 22, 23. I am far from ſaying, or even inſinuating, that there is any real difficulty in all this; or that the orthodox conſtruction of
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:1123800600:374"/>
the paſſages adduced by Mr. J. does not fairly and properly belong to them. I only take leave to obſerve, and have an obvious view in obſerving, that, with regard to the defence of Chriſtian doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine in general, and particularly to the confuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the aſſertion above-mentioned, this truly reſpectable author might have ſelected texts leſs equivocal, leſs liable to prevarication.</p>
            <p>It is obſervable, Dr. <hi>I. Watts</hi> makes the texts <hi>I am in the</hi> FATHER and <hi>the</hi> FATHER IN ME, &amp;c, ſubſervient to his doctrine of the inherency, or <hi>indwelling</hi> of the Father, i. e. of the godhead in the MAN <hi>Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>

            <p>It has been remarked, that by a ſmall alteration in the punctuation, the 3d. v. of the 17th. Chap. of St. <hi>John, that they might know thee the only true God,</hi> &amp;c, may be thus rendered, <hi>that they might know thee, and Jeſus Chriſt, whom thou haſt ſent, to be the only true God.</hi> This reading is ſupported by the authorities of <hi>Novatian,</hi> St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> and St. <hi>Ambroſe.</hi> But it will be prudent, I believe, to wave theſe authorities. Theſe Fathers ſeem to have been <hi>in great fear, where no fear was.</hi> We may ſafely abide by the ſenſe of the text before us in its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſtate.

               <q>We find in our nature, ſays a celebrated writer, which is ſaid to be made after the image of God, a very near reſemblance of the Holy Trinity, and of the different operations of each of the Divine Perſons. For example; to know a thing preſent, and to remember what is paſt, and to love or hate, are different operations of our mind, and performed by different faculties of it. Of theſe, the underſtanding is the <hi>Father</hi> faculty, and gives being to things, as to us; for what we know not, is to us as if it were not: this anſwers to creation. From this faculty pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds the <hi>ſecond,</hi> that of <hi>memory,</hi> which is a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving of that the underſtanding has created to us. Then the <hi>third</hi> faculty, that of the will, which loves or hates, proceeds from both the
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:1123800600:376"/>
other; for we cannot love or hate what is not firſt created by the underſtanding, and preſerved to us by the memory.</q>

            <p>The plaſtic power of a warm imagination, or a ſanguine zeal, will form emblems and adumbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Trinity in all countries, and in all ages of the world.

            <p>The <hi>Valentinians</hi> taught, that Chriſt's body was in a manner purely ſpiritual, and paſſed through the Virgin as through a pipe, or conduit.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Cainites</hi> worſhipped <hi>Cain</hi> as the author of much good to mankind; as alſo <hi>Eſau, Corah, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than,</hi> &amp;c,  and <hi>Judas,</hi> aſſerting that he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knew what happineſs ſhould accrue to mankind by Chriſt's death, and therefore betrayed him.</p>
            <p>It was the doctrine of <hi>Apelles,</hi> that there was but one chief God, to whom was ſubordinate a fiery
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:1123800600:389"/>
God, who appeared to <hi>Moſes in the buſh,</hi> who made the world, gave the law, and was the God of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael.</hi> He gave to Chriſt a body compacted of the ſtarry and elementary ſubſtance, which appeared in the ſhape only of man. This body, when he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended, he left behind him, every part thereof re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to their former principles: Chriſt's ſpirit only being in heaven. This heretic lived, ſays <hi>A. Roſs,</hi> about 150 years after Chriſt, in the reign of the Emperor <hi>Commodus.</hi>

            <p>We have already exhibited to the reader many ſtrange Pagan notions relative to the nature, &amp;c, of the Deity; but perhaps the moſt extraordinary, the moſt eccentric of them all, has not yet been remembered. It is not properly a hereſy indeed, but it is an error which may fitly occupy this place. The heathen myſtical theologiſts often call God <gap reason="foreign">

Agreeably hereunto, <hi>Varro</hi> quotes from <hi>Soranus,</hi> an eminent poet, (according to our author,) the verſes following:

                  <pb n="377" facs="tcp:1123800600:390"/>
                  <l>Jupiter omnipotens, regum rex ipſe Deûmque.</l>

            </p>
            <p>Methinks this ſentiment becomes the heathen theologiſt, or poet, much better than the Chriſtian Divine.</p>
            <p>Far from meaning to rank a late very eminent writer, Dr. <hi>I. Watts,</hi> in the number of notorious heretics, or in the leaſt to detract from the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of his character, I think myſelf bound in duty to my ſubject to take notice here of the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity of his ſentiments. <q>His idea of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity of Chriſt was, that <hi>the Godhead, the Deity itſelf, perſonally diſtinguiſhed as the</hi> FATHER, <hi>was united to the man Chriſt Jeſus, in conſequence of which union, or indwelling of the Godhead, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came properly God.</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">It ſeems theſe were likewiſe Dr. DODDERIDGE'S ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note>He conceived this union to have ſubſiſted before the Saviour's appearance in the fleſh, and that <hi>the human ſoul of Chriſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſted with the Father from before the foundation of the world;</hi> on which ground he maintains the real deſcent of Chriſt from heaven to earth, &amp;c.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In theſe ſentiments there is not ſo much as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the Holy Ghoſt. But we are not to conſider them as final. We ſhall find the Dr. to have had more enlarged notions reſpecting the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of the Trinity.</p>

In his SOLEMN ADDRESS TO THE GREAT AND EVER-BLESSED GOD, on a review of what he <hi>had written in the Trinitarian Controverſy,</hi> he puts the following queſtions with all that <hi>humble reverence,</hi> (his own words,) and that <hi>holy awe</hi> WHICH <hi>becomes a creature in the preſence of his God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Haſt thou not, O Lord God Almighty, haſt thou not tranſacted thy divine and important af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs among men by thy Son <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and by thy holy Spirit? And haſt thou not ordained that men ſhould tranſact their higheſt and moſt momentous concerns with thee, by thy Son, and and by thy Spirit? Haſt thou not, by the mouth of thy Son <hi>Jeſus,</hi> required all that profeſs his religion to be waſhed with water in the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt? Is it not my duty then to enquire, who or what are theſe ſacred names,</q> and what they ſignify?</p>
            <p>
               <q>Haſt thou not aſcribed divine names, and titles, and characters to thy Son and thy holy Spirit in thy word, as well as aſſumed them to thyſelf? And haſt thou not appointed to them ſuch glorious offices as cannot be executed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſomething of divinity or true Godhead in them? And yet art not thou, and thou alone the true God? How ſhall a poor weak creature be able to adjuſt and reconcile theſe claſhing ideas, and to underſtand this myſtery? Or muſt I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and act blindfold,</q> without underſtanding?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="379" facs="tcp:1123800600:392"/>
               <q>Holy Father, (he proceeds,) thou knoweſt, how firmly I believe with all my ſoul, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever thou haſt plainly written and revealed in thy word. I believe Thee to be the only true God, the ſupreme of beings, ſelf-ſufficient for thine own exiſtence, and for all thy infinite af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs and tranſactions among creatures. I believe thy only Son <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> to be all-ſufficient for the glorious work of mediation between God and man, to which thou haſt appointed him. I believe he is a man, in whom dwells all the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Godhead bodily. I believe he is one with God; he is God manifeſted in the fleſh; and that the man <hi>Jeſus</hi> is ſo cloſely and inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably united with the true and eternal Godhead, as to become one perſon, even as the ſoul and body make one man.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I believe alſo thy bleſſed Spirit hath almighty power and influence to do all thy will, to inſtruct men effectually in divine truths, &amp;c. I yield up myſelf joyfully and thankfully to this method of thy ſalvation, as it is revealed in thy goſpel. But I acknowlege my darkneſs ſtill. I want to have this wonderful doctrine of the all-ſufficience of thy Son and Spirit for theſe divine works made a little plainer.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Hadſt thou informed me, gracious Father, in any place of thy word, that this divine doctrine is not to be underſtood by men, and yet they
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:1123800600:393"/>
were required to believe it, I would have ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued all my curioſity to faith, &amp;c. But I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not find thou haſt any where forbid me to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it, or to make theſe enquiries. My con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is the beſt natural light thou haſt put within me, and ſince thou haſt given me the Scriptures, my own conſcience bids me ſearch the Scriptures to find out truth, &amp;c. I have, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, been long ſearching into this divine doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, that I may pay thee due honour with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding. Surely I ought to know the God whom I worſhip, whether he be one pure and ſimple being, or whether thou art a threefold deity, conſiſting of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Dear and bleſſed God, hadſt thou been pleaſed, in any one plain Scripture, to have informed me which of the different opinions about the Holy Trinity, among the contending parties of Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, had been true, thou knoweſt with how much zeal, ſatisfaction, and joy, my unbiaſſed heart would have opened itſelf to receive and embrace the diſcovery. Hadſt thou told me plainly in any ſingle text, that the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are three real diſtinct perſons in thy divine nature, I had never ſuffered myſelf to be bewildered in ſo many doubts, nor embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſed with ſo many ſtrong fears of aſſenting to the mere inventions of men, inſtead of divine
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:1123800600:394"/>
doctrine; but I ſhould have humbly and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately accepted thy words, ſo far as it was poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for me to underſtand them, as the only rule of my faith. Or hadſt thou been pleaſed ſo to expreſs and include this propoſition in the ſeveral ſcattered parts of thy book, from whence my reaſon and conſcience might with eaſe find out, and with certainty infer this doctrine, I ſhould have joyfully employed all my reaſoning powers, with their utmoſt ſkill and activity, to have found out this inference,</q> and ingrafted it into my ſoul.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Thou haſt called the poor and the ignorant, the mean and fooliſh things of this world, to the knowlege of thyſelf and thy Son, and taught them to receive and partake of the Salvation which thou haſt provided. But how can ſuch weak creatures ever take in ſo ſtrange, ſo diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, and ſo abſtruſe a doctrine as this; in the explication and defence whereof, multitudes of men, even men of learning and piety, have loſt themſelves in infinite ſubtilties of diſpute, and endleſs mazes of darkneſs? And can this ſtrange and perplexing notion of three real perſons going to make up one true God, be ſo neceſſary and ſo important a part of that Chriſtian doctrine, which, in the old Teſtament and the new, is repreſented as ſo plain and ſo eaſy, even to the meaneſt underſtandings?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>O thou ſearcher of hearts who knoweſt all
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:1123800600:395"/>
things, I appeal to thee concerning the ſincerity of my enquiries into theſe diſcoveries of thy word.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I humbly call thee to witneſs, O my God, what a holy jealouſy I ever wear about my heart, leſt I ſhould do the ſlighteſt diſhonour to thy ſupreme Majeſty in any of my enquiries or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations. Thou ſeeſt what a religious fear, and what a tender ſolicitude I maintain on my ſoul, leſt I ſhould think or ſpeak any thing to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh the grandeurs and honours of thy Son <hi>Jeſus,</hi> my dear Mediator, &amp;c. Thou knoweſt how much I am afraid of ſpeaking one word which may be conſtrued into a neglect of thy bleſſed Spirit, from whom I hope I am daily receiving happy influences of light and ſtrength. Guard all the motions of my mind, O Almighty God, againſt every thing that borders upon theſe dangers. Forbid my thoughts to indulge, and forbid my pen to write one word, that ſhould ſink thoſe grand ideas which belong to thyſelf, or thy Son, or thy Holy Spirit. Forbid it, O my God, that ever I ſhould be ſo unhappy as to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorify my Father, my Saviour, or my Sanctifier, in any of my ſentiments or expreſſions concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Bleſſed and faithful God, haſt thou not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed that the meek thou wilt guide in judgment, the meek thou wilt teach thy way? Hath not
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:1123800600:396"/>
thy Son, our Saviour, aſſured us, that our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father will give his holy Spirit to them who aſk him? And is he not appointed to guide us into all truth? Have I not ſought the gracious guidance of thy good Spirit continually? Am I not truly ſenſible of my own darkneſs and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, my dangerous prejudices on every ſide, and my utter inſufficiency for my own conduct? Wilt thou leave ſuch a poor creature bewildered among a thouſand perplexities, which are raiſed by the various opinions and contrivances of men to explain thy divine truth?</q>
            </p>
            <q>Help me, heavenly Father, for I am quite tired and weary of theſe human explainings ſo various and uncertain. When wilt thou explain it to me thyſelf, O my God, by the ſecret and certain dictates of thy Spirit, according to the intimations of thy word?</q>
            <p>Now, for truth's ſake, I deſire to aſk any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent, impartial, and candid reader, whether we have not in theſe paſſages ſtrong indications of a wavering, though pious mind? Whether ſuch language as this does not rather tend to encourage ſpecious ſcepticiſm, than ſound faith? Whether it is not chargeable with inconſiſtency between reverence and remonſtrance, between declarations of acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſcence and expoſtulations of diſcontent? Whether, according to Dr. <hi>W</hi>—'s ideas, all eccleſiaſtical au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority is not as ſuch altogether odious, or contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible;
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:1123800600:397"/>
and whether, for what appears to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary from theſe periods, Chriſtianity might not flouriſh without the exiſtence of Church, paſtor, or teacher? Whether we have not in this illuſtrious Diſſenter an extraordinary inſtance of the compati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of radical and invincible prejudice with an <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt and good heart,</hi> and a ſolid underſtanding? Whether Dr. <hi>W.</hi> had any thing like ſufficient grounds for his ſuſpicion that the orthodox received doctrines are reſolvible into mere <q>explainings, inventions, or contrivances of men?</q> Whether he does not appear to be unreaſonably, though ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely anxious to <hi>underſtand all myſteries,</hi> while at the ſame time he could not but know, that the capital doctrines of the Goſpel are delivered AS myſterious, and that Chriſtians are ſuppoſed and required to <hi>walk by faith, and not by ſight?</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he does not moſt erroneouſly convert a <hi>particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar</hi> promiſe into a <hi>general</hi> one; not recollecting that, though, for obvious and very important purpoſes, our <hi>heavenly Father will give his Holy Spirit to them that aſk him,</hi> yet that Spirit was by no means <q>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed</q> to <hi>guide</hi> every individual Chriſtian into <hi>all</hi> ſpiritual <hi>truth?</hi> Whether, had we been told "plainly;" in ſo many words, <q>in any ſingle text, that the Father, Son, and holy Spirit are three real and diſtinct perſons in the divine nature,</q> it had been poſſible for D. <hi>W.</hi> to have miſunderſtood it; or whether he, or any body elſe, could have
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:1123800600:398"/>
been "bewildered in any doubts," with reſpect to this doctrine? Whether ſuch a "diſcovery" of it would not have been received every where with "unbiaſſed hearts," and with univerſal <q>zeal, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction and joy,</q> a few inſtances perhaps of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duracy, &amp;c, excepted? Whether, had it been <q>ſo expreſſed and included in the ſeveral ſcattered parts</q> of Scripture, that the Doctor's <q>reaſon and conſcience could with eaſe have found it out, and with certainty inferred it,</q> there would have been the leaſt occaſion for the "ſkill and activity of his rational powers?" Whether, after all, the doctrine in queſtion be not expreſſed, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in the ſacred pages ſufficiently to warrant any man's firm aſſent to it; eſpecially when we take into the account the whole weight of that evidence by which we prove its correſpondency with the ſenſe of antiquity, and the belief of the primitive Church? Whether the wiſeſt and the weakeſt are not equally incapable of "taking in ſo difficult, and ſo abſtruſe a doctrine" as that of the Trinity? Whether the Chriſtian doctrine concerning things ſpiritual and myſterious is really "repreſented," either in the Old Teſtament or the New, as <q>plain and eaſy even to the meaneſt underſtanding?</q> Whether, granting that <q>multitudes even of men of learning and piety have loſt themſelves in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite ſubtilties of diſpute, &amp;c, in the explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and defence</q> of the doctrine before us, all
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:1123800600:399"/>
this ſhould not be principally attributed to anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinitarian artifice, and to a gradual departure from that ſimplicity in which it was originally taught and received in the world? Whether, if this <q>perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing notion of three real perſons going to make up one true God</q> be a part of Chriſtian doctrine, it is not <hi>prima facie</hi> the moſt "neceſſary and the moſt important?" Finally, whether the doctrine of the Trinity, as held in the Church, has not at leaſt as much countenance from Scripture, and even from reaſon, as Dr. <hi>W</hi>—'s notion of the <hi>indwelling of the Deity in the Man Chriſt Jeſus;</hi> and whether this is not in effect acknowleged by himſelf?</p>
            <p>As to the notion itſelf, it is, I truſt, to all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents and purpoſes refuted in the foregoing pages; and I ſhall content myſelf with expreſſing my aſtoniſhment at the force of prejudice in one who ſo ſtrongly recommends, or more properly inculcates an "indifference for every thing but truth," <note n="*" place="bottom">See Improvement of the Mind. p. 285.</note>and cenſures ſo ſeverely all domeſtic, national, or party attachments.

            <q>Since, ſays he, holy Scripture is the repoſitory of divine truths, and the great rule of faith, to which all ſects of Chriſtians do appeal for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of their ſeveral opinions, and ſince all agree in the articles of the Creed as things clearly and plainly ſet down, and as containing all that which is of ſimple and prime neceſſity; and ſince on the other ſide there are in Scripture many other myſteries, and matters of queſtion upon which there is a vail; ſince there are ſo many copies with infinite varieties of reading; ſince a various interpunction, a parentheſis, a letter, an accent may much alter the ſenſe; ſince ſome places have divers literal ſenſes, many have ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, myſtical, and allegorical meanings; ſince there are ſo many tropes, metonymies, ironies, hyperboles, proprieties and improprieties of lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, whoſe underſtanding depends upon ſuch circumſtances that it is almoſt impoſſible to know its proper interpretation, now that the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of ſuch circumſtances and particular ſtories is irrecoverably loſt; ſince there are ſome myſteries which, at the beſt advantage of expreſſion, are not eaſy to be apprehended, and whoſe explication,
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:1123800600:403"/>
by reaſon of our imperfections, muſt needs be dark, ſometimes weak, ſometimes unintelligible; and laſtly, ſince thoſe ordinary means of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding Scripture, as ſearching the originals, conference of places, parity of reaſon, and ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy of faith, are all dubious, uncertain, and very fallible, he that is the wiſeſt and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence the likelieſt to expound trueſt in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability of reaſon, will be very far from confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, becauſe every one of theſe and many more are like ſo many degrees of improbability and incertainty, all depreſſing our certainty of finding out truth in ſuch myſteries, and amidſt ſo many difficulties. And therefore a wiſe man that conſiders this, would not willingly be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to by others; and therefore if he alſo be a juſt man, he will not impoſe upon others; for it is beſt every man ſhould be left in that liberty from which no man can juſtly take him, unleſs he could ſecure him from error. So that here alſo there is a neceſſity to conſerve the liberty of propheſying, and interpreting Scripture; a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity derived from the conſideration of the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty of Scripture in queſtions controverted, and the uncertainty of any internal medium of interpretation.</q>
            <p>Now if this be the caſe, we are but mocked, when we are told the Scriptures are the "repoſitory of divine truths;" or that <hi>any</hi> articles of faith
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:1123800600:404"/>
can be "clearly and plainly ſet down" in any Creed whatſoever. Under the above circumſtances, in what formulary, or ſyſtem, ſhall we look for <q>all that which is of ſimple and prime neceſſity?</q> Is it not ſtrange too, that there ſhould be <hi>many other myſteries</hi> in Scripture diſtinct from thoſe <hi>divine truths</hi> of which it is the repoſitory; and ſtranger ſtill, that matters of <hi>queſtion</hi> ſhould be put under a <hi>vail?</hi> Upon all matters of <hi>faith</hi> there is indeed a vail; I mean, upon all myſterious matters, which cannot poſſibly be "apprehended at the beſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of expreſſion." The explication of <hi>theſe</hi> is abſolutely impracticable; and every attempt for that purpoſe, <q>by reaſon of our imperfections, muſt needs be dark, ſometimes weak, ſometimes unintelligible.</q> Perhaps he will bid as fair as any man to be an expounder of myſteries who ſhall diſentangle the ſeveral clauſes of this paragraph. I know not whether any thing can be found ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing this, either in the ſtyle, or in the ſpirit of preſent moderation. <note n="*" place="bottom">See a curious vindication of this author, (Bp.

the title of <hi>Free Thoughts on the ſubject of a farther Reformation,</hi> ſpeaks of our Reformers in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing terms. <q>One no ſmall diſadvantage which they unhappily laboured under, and which from their time to this has been matter of juſt regret to true friends of <hi>Divine Revelation,</hi> was their <hi>defect</hi> of knowlege in ſacred matters, above all in the <hi>true ſenſe of Scripture,</hi> &amp;c. If (ſays he in another place) we would form our judgments of the abilities of our Reformers to frame for us a ſyſtem of doctrines which ſhould remain a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual ſtandard of belief and profeſſion in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church, and by which all our Clergy in all future ages ſhould be ſummarily concluded, we ſhall, I ſuppoſe, ſee juſt reaſon to wiſh that they had been more equal than they appear to be, to ſo weighty an undertaking. Thoſe who are well acquainted with their writings will ſee, in a variety of inſtances, evident marks of their inſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency for ſuch a taſk; and be fully convinced of the truth of that obſervation of a learned and worthy Doctor of our Church, that they were but <hi>bad interpreters</hi> of the Scriptures.</q>

            <p>In ſupport of all this derogation, which is oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly qualified with a few introductory common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place compliments, our author has given us a number of extracts, relative to certain religious topics, from Arch-Biſhop <hi>Cranmer</hi>'s Catechiſm, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed in 1543, and dedicated to King <hi>Edward</hi> VI.
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:1123800600:407"/>
We may ſee, it ſeems, from theſe extracts, how greatly diſproportioned the abilities of this famous Prelate and his colleagues were to the work of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, &amp;c. To what concluſions this will lead, I need not inform the reader. But I take leave to offer a remark or two upon the occaſion. In the firſt place, if the intellectual weakneſs of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers was really ſo great as is here repreſented, Proteſtants to a man have reaſon enough to be aſhamed of themſelves. What anſwer ſhall they make to any ſenſible <hi>Roman-Catholic</hi> who ſhould teaze them with theſe mortifying truths? To my thinking, as none of the exceptionable contents of the paſſages cited from the Arch-Biſhop's Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſm make a part of the doctrine of our Church, they might, in reverence to <hi>his</hi> memory, and for <hi>her</hi> credit, have much better been ſuppreſſed. Had this Gentleman contented himſelf with obſerving, that the Reformers of the Church were fallible men; and conſequently, that the Forms and Offices they have delivered down to us may be capable, in ſome inſtances, of alteration and improvement, he had ſpoken more agreeably to truth, though leſs adequately to his purpoſe. For what he has alledged has a plain tendency to ſhew the neceſſity rather of <hi>pulling down</hi> than <hi>repairing</hi> our ſpiritual <hi>building.</hi> On the whole, as he has conducted mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, I know not any one perſon upon earth under ſo many obligations to him as the Pope of <hi>Rome.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="395" facs="tcp:1123800600:408"/>
I ſhall take this opportunity to animadvert on certain dirty aſperſions in a late performance from the hand of a rigid non-conformiſt, and perhaps an avowed unbeliever, and perhaps both.</p>
            <p>The anonymous editor of Dr. <hi>Johnſon</hi>'s Life of Dr. <hi>I. Watts</hi> with Notes, ſacrifices to the virulence of his dipoſition every regard to decency, charity, and truth. It will be proper to trace this calumny to it's ſource. <q>Happy, ſays the celebrated Biogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, will be that reader (viz. of the works of Dr. <hi>W.)</hi> whoſe mind is diſpoſed by his verſes or his proſe, to imitate him in all but his Non-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity, to copy his benevolence to man, and his reverence to God.</q> Is there any thing in this to put a man of candour, or a man of ſenſe out of humour? Yet our Editor aſks, <q>is not this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, and even the mention of this circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, a ſtriking proof of Dr. <hi>Johnſon</hi>'s bigotted attachment to the national eſtabliſhed mode of worſhip?</q> It is really no proof at all. How far Dr. <hi>J.</hi> was in fact a bigot to eſtabliſhments, I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake not to determine; but the period juſt quoted by no means proves him to have been ſo. The moſt moderate Churchman breathing has not the better opinion of Dr. <hi>W.</hi> for his Non-conformity. I cannot think ſuch an one could have "mentioned this circumſtance" more tenderly, had he mentioned it at all; and with what propriety Dr. <hi>W</hi>—'s Bio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grapher could have left it unmentioned, I muſt
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:1123800600:409"/>
leave it to this Gentleman to explain to us. <q>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence to God, he proceeds, and benevolence to man, are the two grand eſſentials of religion. He that poſſeſſes theſe is a true Chriſtian, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever be the external mode of worſhip which he adopts. Neither his Conformity nor his Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformity will exclude him from the divine fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, nor ought it to be matter of cenſure to his fellow-creatures. If a man in uniting with any Chriſtian community, appears to follow the dictates of his own conſcience, &amp;c, he deſerves the eſteem of all parties, and to object to his peculiarity of religious profeſſion is the mark of a little mind.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Now this is partly true, partly falſe, but, you ſee, as far as Dr. <hi>Johnſon</hi> is concerned, wholly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent. There is as little as poſſible of cenſure, or of objection in the ſentence above quoted from him. As to ſincerity of perſuaſion, no body de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies the validity of it's pretenſions; but at the ſame time what will make an honeſt man will by no means conſtitute a "true Chriſtian." <q>Reverence to God and benevolence to man are indeed the two grand eſſentials of all religion;</q> and, to bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row our author's term, they MAY be <hi>poſſeſt</hi> by Jews, Turks, Infidels, and Heretics.</p>
            <p>"That Dr. <hi>W.</hi> was conſcientious in his Non-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity," will be readily admitted; but ſurely this will not juſtify the unfairneſs, or the duplicity,
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:1123800600:410"/>
or the malignity, or the falſhood of the following paragraph. <q>Conſidering what the terms of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterial conformity are, ſays our annotator, it may be juſtly queſtioned, whether if all the clergy were equally conſcientious, one half of them would not be Diſſenters. To declare an <hi>aſſent and conſent</hi> to ALL and EVERY THING <hi>contained in the Thirty-nine Articles, the book of Common Prayer,</hi> &amp;c, (which comprehend ſuch a prodigious num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of particulars; many of them very diſputable, ſome of them unintelligible, and others exploded by the wiſeſt and beſt of men;) is ſuch a requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition as it is hard to be conceived the generality of the clergy can <hi>bona fide</hi> approve. It is indeed WELL KNOWN that MOST of them, and even of the BISHOPS themſelves, diſbelieve ſome of the doctrinal articles of the Church, as appears from the general ſtrain of their preaching and of their writings, and that they profeſs to ſubſcribe them only as articles of peace. If the terms of conformity were a declaration that they <hi>did not believe</hi> "all and every thing, &amp;c," it is unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable that many (not to ſay the moſt) of thoſe that conform might very conſcientiouſly make it. Whether therefore their ſubſcription to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent terms be conſiſtent with ſimplicity and godly ſincerity, it behoves them ſeriouſly to enquire. If others think that ſuch a ſubſcription would, in them, be a groſs prevarication, and rather than
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:1123800600:411"/>
be chargeable with it, willingly forego the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of being in the Church, they ought at leaſt to be reſpected as honeſt men. And if Dr. <hi>Johnſon</hi> had ſtudied the grounds of Non-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity (which he appears not to have done) he might have entertained a better opinion of the underſtandings of Proteſtant Diſſenters as well as their integrity. But this is not the place for entering into that controverſy.</q>
            </p>
            <p>If theſe repreſentations are juſt, and theſe aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions true, the controverſy is abſolutely decided with a vengeance; and the bulk of the clergy of of the Church of <hi>England</hi> are as great a ſet of ſc—ndr—ls as can be produced in the annals of the human race. I ſhall not waſte a moment in vindicating them from imputations ſo palpably ſcandalous; but content myſelf with declaring my firm belief, that Dr <hi>Johnſon</hi> would not <q>have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained a better opinion either of the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings or integrity of Proteſtant Diſſenters</q> from theſe ſamples of BOTH; and that were Dr. <hi>W.</hi> reſtored to life, he would, for viſible reaſons, think himſelf under much greater obligations to the Bio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grapher than to the Annotator.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, we are not to wonder at any thing which is advanced by one who maintains, as this writer does in another page of this very perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, that <q>in the Scripture-plan no traces of a national Church, or eccleſiaſtical authority, are to be found.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="399" facs="tcp:1123800600:412"/>
It may be pertinent to remark farther, that <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly mad</hi> as the Puritans and their friends in the laſt century were <hi>againſt</hi> the governors of the Church, and our whole eccleſiaſtical polity, THEY appear to have been more than ordinarily ſolicitous to expreſs their full <hi>aſſent</hi> and <hi>conſent</hi> to the moſt material articles of our faith. Their <hi>quarrel</hi> was not <hi>againſt</hi> our doctrine but our diſcipline. I have by me a juſt and literal tranſlation of the <hi>Confeſſion of Faith,</hi> together with two <hi>Catechiſms,</hi> a larger and a leſs, drawn up by the <hi>Aſſembly of Divines at Weſtminſter,</hi> in 1651, under the authority, and with the concurrence and approbation of Parliament, (ſo called,) and of the Kirk of <hi>Scotland.</hi> The 3d clauſe in the ch. <hi>de Deo et Sacro-ſancta Trinitate</hi> runs <hi>verbatim</hi> as follows. <q>In Deitatis unitate perſonae tres ſunt unius ejuſdemque eſſentiae, potentiae, ac aeternitatis; Deus Pater, Deus Filius, ac Deus Spiritus Sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus. Pater quidem a nullo eſt, nec genitus nempe nec procedens: Filius autem a Patre eſt aeterne genitus: Spiritus autem Sanctus aeterne procedens a Patre Filioque.</q> In the 23d ch. <hi>de ſtatu hominum poſt mortem, deque reſurrectione mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuorum,</hi> we find this clauſe: <q>Noviſſimo illo die, qui comperientur in vivis non morientur quidem ſed mutabuntur; qui mortui fuerint reſuſcita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buntur omnes, ipſiſſimis iis corporibus quibus viventes aliquando fungebantur, ac non aliis, ut
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:1123800600:413"/>
ut qualitate differentibus; quae denuo animabus quaeque ſuis aeterno conjugio unientur.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe doctrines are held out almoſt in the ſame words in both <hi>Catechiſms.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From which circumſtances I take occaſion to aſk, whether, as far as we may reaſonably collect from the ſtyle and the ſentiments of the Editor of Dr. <hi>Johnſon</hi>'s Life of Dr. <hi>I. Watts</hi> with Notes, the views and the diſpoſitions of the Proteſtant Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters of this age have not a tendency more ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical and deſtructive, than were thoſe of theſe ſame Anceſtors of theirs who "triumphed in the ruin" both of Church and State?</p>
            <p>But is there not after all an inveterate difficulty, which we have rather met than encountered, and much leſs overcome, and which furniſhes Popery with its ſhrewdeſt argument, and Infidelity with its ſtrongeſt handle? The proteſtant principle aſſerts the right of private judgment in matters of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. And yet precepts relative to obedience to ſpiritual authority, &amp;c, are as plain as thoſe direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which require us to <hi>prove all things, and to hold faſt that which is good,</hi> &amp;c. How ſhall we reconcile theſe things? In conſequence of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertion of this perſonal right, differences ariſe in the world, and controverſies, the natural iſſue of them. How are theſe to be decided? Is it not a ſoleciſm in religion to ſuppoſe a controverſy with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a judge? Nevertheleſs we ſay, and demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:1123800600:414"/>
too, that the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> the only Church which pretends to infallibility, has erred, and that even in fundamentals. Accordingly we refer to no arbitration; we acknowlege no rule of faith, no judge of controverſy but Holy Scripture. <hi>Supremus judex</hi> (ſay the <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> Divines above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned) <hi>a quo omnes de religione controverſiae ſunt determinandae, omnia conciliorum decreta, opiniones, &amp;c, nullus alius eſſe poteſt praeter Spiritum Sanctum in Scriptura pronunciantem.</hi>

            <p>But are not theſe <hi>vain words?</hi> Doth any man, or any body of men pretend to the <hi>gift of diſcerning of Spirits</hi> at this day? Or if they do, are their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions admiſſible? Or can Scripture, with any propriety, be ſaid to be the judge of controverſy, when it is the whole and ſole ground of it?

            <p>With a view to the ſolution of this difficulty, and by way of Supplement to the contents of the foregoing ſheets, let us ſee whether a little enquiry will not enable us ſufficiently to aſcertain what he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſy of the worſt ſort was in the days of the Apoſtles themſelves, and according to the conception they muſt by fair conſtruction be underſtood to have entertained of it.</p>
            <p>In his 2d general Epiſtle St. <hi>Peter</hi> foretells that there would be <hi>falſe teachers</hi> among Chriſtians, <hi>who</hi> ſhould <hi>privily bring in damnable hereſies,</hi> EVEN <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying the Lord that bought them.</hi> (ch. 2. v. 1.) From which paſſage we can do no leſs than infer, that the denial of the <hi>Lord that bought</hi> us is of all <hi>he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies</hi> the moſt <hi>damnable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now whether we do, or do not abide by Dr. <hi>Whitby</hi>'s interpretation, who apprehends we are to underſtand God the Father by the word <hi>Lord</hi> in this paſſage, <q>Chriſt being never ſtyled <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> (the original word) in the New Teſtament,</q> the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:1123800600:416"/>
will inevitably be one and the ſame. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> was confeſſedly the purchaſer of the <hi>Church with his own blood.</hi> In point of nature, or attribute, there can therefore be no difference betwixt theſe two Perſons; the hereſy which denies either will be equally damnable, according to Dr. <hi>W</hi>'s ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But if we reject it, the Divinity of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour is not leſs implied in the text before us. For in moſt evident alluſion to this very purchaſe, <hi>Ye are bought with a price,</hi> ſays St. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians; therefore,</hi> continues he, <hi>glorify God,</hi> i. e., out of all queſtion, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> who <hi>bought</hi> you, <hi>in your body and in your Spirit,</hi> which are God's; i. e., which are Chriſt's. (1 Cor. 6. 20.) It may be a ſatisfaction to the reader to compare this paſſage with the following in the next Chapter. <hi>He that is called being free, is Chriſt's ſervant. Ye are bought with a price; be not ye the ſervants of men.</hi> (v. 22, &amp;c.)</p>
            <p>In his laſt and farewell addreſs to the <hi>Children of Iſrael,</hi> which is called his <hi>Song,</hi> their great Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlator puts this queſtion to them, <hi>is not he thy father that hath bought thee?</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Deutero. Ch. 32. 6.</note>God is ſaid to have <hi>bought</hi> his people by his deliverance of them from the <hi>bondage of Aegypt;</hi> which was only a type, but indiſputably a type of the <hi>eternal redemption obtained for us</hi> by the precious blood of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> And is it

not juſt to infer the equality of theſe Divine pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſers from the nature and value of their reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive purchaſes? The denial of the <hi>Lord that bought</hi> us is therefore in effect the denial of the Divinity of our Saviour.</p>
            <p>There is a paſſage in St. <hi>Jude,</hi> parallel to this which we have had in conſideration, that will not be found conſiſtent with it, or with its context, without ſuppoſing the ſame equality. This Apoſtle complains of certain <hi>ungodly men,</hi> who <hi>denied the only Lord God, and our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> They <hi>denied our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> as one with the Father, not as in eſſence diſtinct from him. I ſay, the affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of this paſſage to the other, and its own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text, not barely warrant, but demand this ſenſe. <hi>Jude the Servant of Jeſus Chriſt, &amp;c, to them that are ſanctified by God the Father, and preſerved</hi> BY <hi>Jeſus Chriſt, and called.</hi> We are very ſufficiently authoriſed to read <hi>by</hi> for <hi>in,</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">See Hammond, &amp;c, &amp;c.</note>in this paſſage; and if ſo, it is moſt undoubtedly as much the attribute, or property of the Supreme God to <hi>preſerve,</hi> and to <hi>call,</hi> as it is to <hi>ſanctify;</hi> which indeed is the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criminative office of the Holy Ghoſt: whoſe Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, by the way, is here plainly aſſerted by implica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But we are under no neceſſity of diſturbing the preſent verſion. In the 3d verſe, the Apoſtle exhorts Chriſtians to <hi>contend earneſtly for the faith which was once delivered unto the Saints.</hi> That from the beginning ſome ſhould <hi>depart from the</hi> faith, or
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:1123800600:418"/>
a belief in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> as the <hi>Son of God</hi> by eternal generation, on principles, and for reaſons, by which infidels and ſceptics are influenced at this day, is by no means matter of aſtoniſhment. But ſuppoſing the faith of the primitive Chriſtians, the <hi>faith which was once delivered unto the Saints,</hi> to have been merely a faith in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> as a <hi>prophet,</hi> or as the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> or as a <hi>creature</hi> of a more or leſs <hi>excellent name,</hi> there would, I preſume, have been little room for <hi>contention</hi> about it, or danger of its being <hi>denied.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If we take into examination that impious and ſtrange doctrine of which St. <hi>John</hi> ſpeaks in terms of ſtrong cenſure and reſentment, in his <hi>firſt</hi> and <hi>ſecond general Epiſtle,</hi> this reſearch will likewiſe ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate in an unqueſtionable proof of our Lord's Divinity; and convince us, that in the denial of it the error conſiſted. <hi>Every Spirit that confeſſeth not that Jeſus Chriſt is come in the fleſh, is not of God: and this is that Spirit of anti-chriſt, whereof ye have heard, &amp;c. Many deceivers are entered into the world, who confeſs not that Jeſus Chriſt is come in the fleſh. This is a deceiver and an anti-chriſt.</hi> (1 John. 4. v. 3. 2 John. v. 7.) Or, as ſome read theſe paſſages, <hi>that confeſs not Jeſus Chriſt which is come in the fleſh.</hi> The import of theſe texts will not be in the leaſt affected by this variation. That the <hi>man Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> the perſon who was known by the name of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> lived and converſed in the world, did <hi>many won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful</hi>
               <pb n="406" facs="tcp:1123800600:419"/>
               <hi>works,</hi> was contumeliouſly treated, and at length put to a painful and ignominious death, were facts too recent, and too generally known, to be diſputed by any at the time when our Apoſtle wrote theſe Epiſtles. That the <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> of theſe Epiſtles was the very identical perſon whom the Apoſtle ſtyles in his Goſpel the <hi>Son of God,</hi> the <hi>Word</hi> that <hi>was in the beginning with God,</hi> and really and truly <hi>was God,</hi> cannot with the leaſt appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of reaſon be queſtioned. But that <hi>God</hi> was indeed <hi>manifeſt in the fleſh,</hi> took our nature upon him, and <hi>bare our ſins in his own body on the tree,</hi> this was a <hi>ſaying</hi> too <hi>hard</hi> for the acceptation of thoſe <hi>deceivers, falſe prophets,</hi> and <hi>anti-chriſts,</hi> as St. <hi>John</hi> calls them, and whom, at the 6th v. of Chap. 4. he repreſents as poſſeſt with the <hi>ſpirit of error.</hi> Accordingly they were weak, and at the ſame time bold enough to reſolve this great truth into mere ſemblance and deception; and to affirm that the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man perſon of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> was a phantom, and lived, and ſuffered, and died, not really, but in appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance only: which abominably ridiculous notion was, as has been obſerved, in a great meaſure adopted afterwards by <hi>Mahomet,</hi> who was offended at thoſe indignities and ſufferings which he conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as altogether unworthy of that prophetic character which he acknowleged <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> as his predeceſſor, to have been veſted with. This doctrine is delivered in the <hi>Koran</hi> in general terms; but the
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:1123800600:420"/>
followers of <hi>Mahomet</hi> differ in their ſentiments re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting it. According to ſome, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> was not nailed to the Croſs, but a malefactor who in perſon much reſembled him. The perſon crucified, ſay others, was <q>a ſpy that was ſent to intrap our Saviour;</q> and others aſſert him to have been <hi>Judas;</hi> and others, <hi>Simon the Cyrenian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Or if we ſuppoſe St. <hi>John</hi> to have had in his eye another heretical tenet of a ſimilar nature and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, which was very early diſſeminated in the Church, <hi>viz.</hi> that of the <hi>Carpocratians,</hi> &amp;c, who made a diſtinction betwixt <hi>Jeſus</hi> and <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and maintained, that the former ſuffered, and roſe again, but that the latter was impaſſible, as being purely of a ſpiritual nature; (agreeably to the idea ſuggeſted by <hi>Webſter</hi>'s tranſlation of Father <hi>Simon,</hi> which for <hi>every Spirit which confeſſeth not,</hi> &amp;c, reads which <hi>ſeparateth Jeſus;)</hi> the reſult will neceſſarily be found to be one and the ſame. For to what can we reaſonably attribute the denial of our Lord's humanity, or its ſeparation from the divinity, but to an averſeneſs to acknowlege the union of God and Man in the perſon of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt?</hi> And if ſo, it will naturally follow that this union was the doctrine of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and the belief of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church.</p>
            <p>It is well worth obſerving, that <hi>Polycarp,</hi> in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Philippians,</hi> quotes word for word the 3d v. of the 4th Ch. of St. <hi>John</hi>'s firſt Epiſtle,
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:1123800600:421"/>
               <hi>Whoſoever does not confeſs</hi>  and that <hi>Ignatius,</hi> who converſed with the Apoſtles, and, upon the death of <hi>Evodius</hi> was appointed Biſhop of <hi>Antioch</hi> by as many of the ſacred College as were then living, not barely mentions, but moſt expreſsly cenſures and condemns this whimſical opinion of the <hi>Phantomiſts,</hi> if I may take liberty ſo to call them. <q>Stop your ears, ſays he, in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Trallians,</hi> as often as any one ſhall ſpeak con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> who was of the race of <hi>David,</hi>  who was truly born, and did eat and drink; was truly perſecuted under <hi>Pontius Pilate;</hi> was truly crucified, and dead.</q> And a little after, if, ſays he, <q>ſome who are Atheiſts, that is to ſay Infidels, pretend that he only SEEMED to ſuffer, (they themſelves only ſeeming to exiſt,) why then am I bound? Why do I deſire to fight with beaſts?</q> In the Epiſtle of the ſame Father to the <hi>Smyrnaeans,</hi> we have the following paſſage. <q>And he ſuffered truly, as he alſo truly raiſed up himſelf; and not, as ſome unbelievers ſay, that he only SEEMED to ſuffer.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Though therefore neither the Apoſtles, nor the Apoſtolical Fathers particularly ſpecify what he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſy is, it appears by juſt and natural inference from many paſſages in their writings originally to have conſiſted in denying the perfect Godhead, and perfect manhood of our Saviour; and that hereſies in general deſerve to be conſidered as ſo many eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:1123800600:422"/>
of theſe fundamental truths. There is another paſſage in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Trallians</hi> which, ſimply aſſerting the Divinity of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> puts this out of all reaſonable doubt. <q>I exhort you, ſays the venerable Author, or rather not I, but the love of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> that you uſe none but Chriſtian nouriſhment; abſtaining from paſture which is of another kind, I mean hereſy. <hi>For</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">See the references in the Margin.</note>
                  <hi>they that are heretics confound together the doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt</hi> with their own poiſon, &amp;c. Wherefore guard yourſelves againſt ſuch perſons. And that you will do if you are not puffed up, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue inſeparable from <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> our GOD, and from your Biſhop, and from the commands of the Apoſtles.</q> In ſhort, all theſe circumſtances concur to the eſtabliſhment of our firſt Hypotheſis. If the Catholic faith of the primitive Chriſtians was the ſame which is held in the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> at this day, at and before the publication of the Holy Scriptures of the New Teſtament, as well as the writings of the Apoſtolical Fathers, their doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine on the ſubjects we have been handling is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently uniform and explicit; if otherwiſe, it is by far too conſiſtent, and too perſpicuous.</p>
            <p>Agreeably to what has been advanced, we may farther obſerve the ſacred authors frequently refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to ſome ſtanding doctrines, ſome capital arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:1123800600:423"/>
of belief, which had been by them taught, and were by the Church univerſally received. It will be a hard matter to comprehend the meaning of many paſſages in the Scriptures, without ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing them to import, or to allude to ſome ſuch doctrines or principles. The firſt converts to Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity are ſaid to have <hi>continued ſtedfaſtly in the Apoſtles, doctrine and fellowſhip;</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Acts ii. 42.</note>and whatſoever that doctrine might be, it was then no WRITTEN doctrine. St. <hi>Paul</hi> thanks God, that the <hi>Roman</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts had <hi>obeyed from the heart that</hi> FORM OF DOC<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TRINE <hi>which was delivered to them.</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Rom. vi. 17.</note>He exhorts the <hi>Theſſalonians to ſtand faſt, and hold the</hi> TRADI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIONS which <hi>they had been taught, whether by word, or by</hi> his <hi>Epiſtle;</hi> 
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">2 Theſſ. ii. 15.</note>and recommends it to <hi>Timothy,</hi> to <hi>keep that which was committed to his truſt;</hi> and to <hi>hold faſt the</hi> FORM <hi>of ſound words which he had heard of</hi> him. <note n="§" place="bottom">2 Tim. i. 13.</note>He injoins <hi>Titus</hi> to <hi>reject a man that is an heretic, after the firſt and ſecond admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> 
               <note n="**" place="bottom">Titus iii. 10.</note>It will be ſufficient to add to this the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of St. <hi>Jude</hi> to Chriſtians in general, which juſt above fell under notice, <hi>viz.</hi> that they ſhould <hi>earneſtly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the Saints.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was doubtleſs with an eye to this <hi>faith,</hi> to the preſervation of the ſame in purity, and to the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture peace and proſperity of the Church, that <hi>Jeſus</hi>
               <pb n="411" facs="tcp:1123800600:424"/>
               <hi>Chriſt gave ſome, Apoſtles;</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> informs us; <hi>and ſome, Evangeliſts; and ſome, Prophets; and ſome, Paſtors and Teachers:</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Epheſ. iv. 11.</note>nor could the purpoſe of ſuch appointments have been anſwered but by a regular ſucceſſion of ſome of theſe characters through all ages.</p>
            <p>For the ſame purpoſe moſt unqueſtionably, <hi>God hath ſet in the Church, helps, and governments,</hi> &amp;c, as the ſame Apoſtle declares to his <hi>Corinthian</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts in the 12th Chapter of his firſt Epiſtle to them.</p>
            <p>Now how all this could be done; or how either <hi>Evangeliſt, Prophet,</hi> or <hi>Teacher,</hi> or Governor could at <hi>any</hi> time, or in <hi>any</hi> manner, exerciſe his function, without invading the right of private judgment, as it has of late days been contended for; or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out departing from the <hi>ſimplicity</hi> of the Goſpel in its original ſtate, I pretend not to have ſufficient penetration to diſcover.</p>
            <p>Matters appear then to ſtand thus.—That <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> conſtituted no arbitrator, no infallible judge, or decider of controverſy, &amp;c, in his Church, is demonſtrable from the differences, the diſputes, and diſſentions, relative to <hi>circumciſion,</hi> &amp;c, which ſubſiſted in its very infancy. At the ſame time it is certain the Holy Scriptures ſpeak of a <hi>common faith, and of the common ſalvation.</hi>

what grounds we have for our perſuaſion that ſuch <hi>common faith</hi> was nothing more or leſs than a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief in the doctrine of the Holy Trinity, and the other articles contained in our Creeds. Under this perſuaſion, the Church of England, as a national Church, as a Church reformed from the groſs errors, corruptions, and ſuperſtitions of <hi>Rome,</hi> has not only "power to decree rites, or ceremonies, but authority in controverſies of faith;" <hi>viz.</hi> au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, not to determine, but to declare. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly we do not anathematiſe, or moleſt them that renounce our Doctrine, or ſeparate from our Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, upon principles avowed by ourſelves. We maintain our own rights without encroaching upon the privileges of others. We "diſcover, condemn, and avoid" what we call and believe to be hereſies, without aiming, or wiſhing to prevent them by coercion. We conceive ſpiritual government to be as compatible with religious liberty, as temporal juriſdiction is with civil; and that when the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers aſſerted the right of private judgment in matters of religion, the natural right of all men to make uſe of their own faculties, <q>they could not poſſibly mean to inveſt every individual with the privilege of working out his own ſalvation by his own underſtanding and endeavours,</q> inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendently on any extraneous aſſiſtance, or inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whatever; and much leſs to intimate, that he
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:1123800600:428"/>
is under an indiſpenſable obligation ſo to do. Were this the caſe, the Apoſtle's queſtion, <hi>are all Teachers</hi> muſt be anſwered in the affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive; and the neceſſary conſequence would be, that EVERY BODY, and yet NO BODY would be a <hi>Teacher.</hi> Which is abſurd. Neither the juſteſt claim, nor the moſt reaſonable exemption can alter the nature of things. If it be true, that this Church derives her exiſtence from the exertions of human reaſon, emancipating itſelf from ſpiritual ſlavery; it is as true, that ſhe owes her preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to decent order, and legal eſtabliſhment. If it be true, that the bulk of the people naturally wiſh to act, to think, and to judge for themſelves; it is as true, that they naturally take advice or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction from others, ſubmit to controul, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence authority. In ſhort, to whatever cauſes we are to aſcribe that diverſity of opinion which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts the world; how perplexing ſo ever the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent conſtitution of things may be; or for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever reaſons it has pleaſed infinite wiſdom to place us in a ſtate of trial, infirmity, and imperfection; one general truth muſt univerſally be ſubſcribed to; <hi>viz.</hi> that, with reſpect both to faith and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, <hi>the Lord knoweth them that are his,</hi>
