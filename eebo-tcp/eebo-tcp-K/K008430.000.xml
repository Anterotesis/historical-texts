            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>AN INVESTIGATION OF THE NATURE AND ORIGIN OF SCROPHULOUS DISEASES.</head>
            <p>THE difficulties attending the treatment of Scrophula although daily occurring in the practice of almoſt every medical man, are ſo great, that this diſeaſe is juſtly ſtiled the <hi>Oppro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brium Medicorum.</hi> Hence a variety of remedies have at different periods been recommended for this diſeaſe<note n="*" place="bottom">The hanging of Vervain-root round the neck, the ſurrounding the diſeaſed parts with particular precious ſtones, the ſtroaking the part with a dead perſon's hand, and many ſimilar acts, are ſaid by different perſons to be ſpecifics in the cure of Struma.
<bibl>WHITE on SCROPHULA.</bibl>
               </note> In the earlier ages, recourſe
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0306800500:7"/>was had to charms, and the royal touch<note n="*" place="bottom">The term King's-evil, applied to Scrophula, aroſe from the pretenſions which King Edward, ſurnamed the Confeſſor, profeſſed to have in curing this diſeaſe by the touch, and his example was followed by all the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Kings of both England and France. But when theſe mortals were convinced of the abſurdity of this practice, they gave up this fooliſh pretenſion; and when the idea prevailed of its being hereditary, this appella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion became very obnoxious, and complaints of this kind have been moſt frequently called Scrophulous from the latin word <hi>Scrofula,</hi> a ſow-pig, from theſe animals being oftentimes affected with this diſeaſe. But from the above circumſtance of royal ſuperſtition and ignorance does it really owe its <hi>Engliſh</hi> appellation.</note> but the ſucceſs attending theſe modes of cure is highly incredible, and doubtleſs in a great meaſure to be attributed to a want of ſufficient inveſtigation, which would enable us to aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the difference between thoſe modifications of thoſe diſeaſes, which are really ſcrophulous, and thoſe, which depend upon ſome other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutional affection.</p>
            <p>The perplexities of our profeſſion which are glaringly manifeſt to every perſon the leaſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0306800500:8"/>in it; the trivial advantages which have accrued to it, from the laborious efforts of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical writers; the endleſs folios which have been written on the diſtinction and cure of diſeaſes, often more with a view of acquiring popularity and gain to their authors, than of extending knowledge; to which may be added the continual embarraſſments and acknowledged difficulties attendant on the practice of medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, muſt have convinced us of this melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly fact, that we are travelling in a wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs where there exiſt but faint glimmerings for extrication, and where the proſpect leads to deſpair,—were it not, that a new hope has ariſen, that from the happy induſtry of a few enlightened men, the torch of chemical phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy will finally conduct us through this labyrinth of error.</p>
            <p>No diſeaſe occaſions more diſtreſs to the unhappy patient, than the one in queſtion,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0306800500:9"/>and when we reflect for a moment, how ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral a diſeaſe it is in this country, and how many are cut off by its ravages, who might otherwiſe have been ornaments in ſociety, it is ſomewhat ſurpriſing that more attention has not been beſtowed to acquire a more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and effectual mode of treatment of a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady of ſuch a nature than that which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly employed.</p>
            <p>Some practitioners have attempted to ſhew, that it is an hereditary diſeaſe, and cannot be cured without ſome important change produced in the conſtitution. Mr. White in his <hi>Treatiſe on Scrophula</hi> has refuted the arguments which have been brought forward in favour of this he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary diſpoſition in parents, by ſaying, that as no form, age, or ſex are exempted from Struma, it cannot be conſidered then as an hereditary diſeaſe. For my own part, I deny the doctrine of hereditary diſeaſes altogether, for it is founded on a want of obſervation,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0306800500:10"/>and has nothing to ſupport it, but obſtinacy and prejudice. A taint tranſmitted from pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents to their offspring and celebrated under the appellation of hereditary, ſays the learned Doctor John Brown<note n="*" place="bottom">Elementinae Medicinae.</note>, is a mere tale. The ſons of the rich, who ſucceed to their father's <hi>eſtate,</hi> ſucceed alſo to his <hi>gout:</hi> thoſe who are excluded from his <hi>eſtate,</hi> eſcape that diſeaſe, unleſs they bring it on afterwards, by their own conduct. This ſuppoſition makes the noxious powers ſuperfluous, which have been proved to be every thing reſpecting diſeaſe, and as it is therefore nugatory and abſurd, ſo the truth of the latter opinion muſt be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted<note n="‡" place="bottom">Even the learned Doctor Cullen has fallen into ſome miſtakes reſpecting the doctrine of hereditary diſeaſes. He ſays, "Scrophula is very commonly and very gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally an hereditary diſeaſe, and although it ſometimes may happen, yet this is very rare, but in children whoſe parents had at ſome period of their lives been affected with it. Whether it may not fail to appear in the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of ſcrophulous parents and diſcover itſelf afterwards in their offspring in the ſucceeding generation, I cannot certainly determine; but believe that this has frequently happened. It appears to me to be more commonly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from fathers than from mothers: but whether this happens from there being more ſcrophulous men than women married, I am not certain."

               <p>IT will be unneceſſary to give a long and tedious deſcription of ſcrophulous tumours and ulcers, ſince as the late Mr. Hunter obſerves, theſe are ſo characterized, as to be eaſily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed from all others. They begin at firſt generally in the neck, affecting the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>globate</hi> glands<note n="*" place="bottom">The conglobate glands are alſo lymphatic. As to their ſtructure they are ſometimes round, at other times oval, oblong, or flat. They vary in ſize, ſometimes as large as an acorn, and at other times as ſmall as peas. Their ſtructure is made up of blood-veſſels, lymphatic veſſels, nerves and cellular texture—the blood veſſels are both arteries and veins. In young ſubjects there is an appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of an intermediate body, containing a whitiſh liquor—they are principally ſupplied with nerves and lympha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics. It appears from injection that in their inward ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face they are cellular. When many grow together they form a cluſter or maſs. They are more numerous in the texture of the lungs or teſticles, in the neck, bronchia, inteſtines, axilla, under the fat, above the inner con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyle, and along the dorſal Vertebrae. They are placed in ſituations of the body, where they are ready and fit to receive preſſure. There is an excretion into their cells from the exhalent arteries. When theſe glands in the Meſentery are hardened or enlarged, an atrophy uſually follows. Alientery is alſo connected with the diſeaſe of theſe glands.</note>, feel hard, are colourleſs and

The abſorbed fluids, in their courſe to the veins, in <hi>Scrophula,</hi> are arreſted in the lymphatic glands, which ſwell, and after a great length of time in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame and ſuppurate. Doctor Darwin<note n="*" place="bottom">ZOONOMIA, Vol. 2.</note> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves that theſe indolent tumours of the lym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatic-glands which conſtitute Scrophula, originate from the inirritability of thoſe glands; which therefore ſooner fall into torpor after having been ſtimulated too violently by ſome poiſonous material: as the muſcles of enfee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0306800500:17"/>perſons ſooner become fatigued and ceaſe to act when exerted, than thoſe of ſtronger ones. On the ſame account theſe ſcrophulous glands are much larger in acquiring increaſe of motion, after having been ſtimulated into ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, and either remain years in a ſtate of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolence, or ſuppurate with difficulty, and ſometimes only partially.</p>
               <p>It has been noticed by Doctor Beddoes that ſcrophulous tumours ariſe from a deficiency of oxygene, occaſioning inirritability of the ſyſtem, and when we remark the ſallow ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of the countenance, the ſlowneſs of the pulſe, and the torpor of the tumours in ſuch patients, we ſhall readily aſſent to this doctrine. The tumours when they break oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion ulcers, whoſe edges are pale and flabby, and naturally diſinclined to heal, ſeldom yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a good diſcharge. At firſt they afford a viſcid, glairy, and ſometimes whitiſh curdly
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0306800500:18"/>matter, which afterwards changes into a thin, and aqueous ſanies. After continuing in this ſtate for ſome length of time, the edges of the ſores become irregular, and ſmooth, ſometimes however theſe are elevated, and at other times are very flat. When they are healed up quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they ſoon break out upon ſome other parts of the body, where there is local debility, or in other words, diminiſhed action of the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorial power. For this reaſon it appears, that vital-air, by invigorating the ſyſtem, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing the excitability both local and general, and by keeping up a gentle and univerſal ſtimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus, which pervades the whole frame, very frequently have effected a cure, when even all other remedies have failed.</p>
               <p>At a certain age, that is between infancy and puberty, theſe tumours ſometimes diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, and ulcers have healed up ſpontaneouſly, though very rarely.</p>

                     <p>SOME time ago I was witneſs at Dr. Thornton's houſe, to the cure of a remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble caſe of ſcrophulous tomours in a young lady. Theſe had exiſted above ten years, during which time (for her father was an opulent merchant) ſhe had been under the care of the moſt eminent practitioners in this town. She had taken mercury until the teeth began to drop from her head, and bark and ſteel in large quantities, and laſtly the cicuta under the late celebrated John Hunter, until blindneſs had come on. Having been repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly at the ſea-ſide, this laſt eminent practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0306800500:26"/>informed her parents, that the diſeaſe was ſo fixed in her habit, that it would be in vain any longer to try medicine, and this was alſo the opinion of ſeveral practitioners who had been conſulted on the ſubject. The tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours extended over the jaw-bones, which could not be felt, and made reſpiration diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, and concealment impoſſible. After a month's trial of the vital-air in conjunction with ſtrengthening remedies, and the applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſtimulants to the inirritable glands, a viſible decreaſe took place, and this plan being purſued for ſome months, the diminution has been five inches in the neck by meaſurement, and nearly a total diſappearance of the diſeaſed glands. The effects of oxygene-gas in this caſe were the moſt remarkable I ever witneſſed. The young lady enjoyed good ſpirits, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced no inconvenience from the quantity of elaſtic fluids ſhe had inhaled.</p>

                     <p>THOMAS Francis, aged five years, about three years ago had ſeveral Ulcers broke out about him, for the cure of which he was put under the care of ſeveral Surgeons in Wales, who ordered him to be dipped in the ſea. He took a variety of medicines, and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charotics were applied to the ſores. But his health declining very faſt, his parents brough him up to Briſtol, with a view of getting him admitted an in-patient to the Infirmary, in hopes of his there obtaining a ſpeedy and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent cure. Three weeks after his arrival in Briſtol, he became an in-patient. He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued only three days in, and was then diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged as incurable. Under theſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances I was urged to go and ſee him, and upon examination found three very large ſcro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phulous
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0306800500:28"/>ulcers, with flat irregular edges, the diſcharge very thin, acrid and foetid. One was on the <hi>pectoral bone,</hi> another over the <hi>vaſties internus</hi> muſcle, and a third behind the ear. He had a bad cough, and diſturbed nights. The glands of the neck were hard and enlarged. He had a very ſmooth ſkin, thin upper lip, with an inelaſtic feel, and a blueneſs at the ends of his fingers. From want of clothes, and plenty of food, together with the abſorption of this purulent diſcharge from the ulcers, he was reduced almoſt to ſkin and bones. He was very ſubject to coſtiveneſs, and always in great pain. I applied powder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed charcoal to all the ſores, over which I put the leaves of the oxalis acetoſella ſimply bruiſed. A doſe of calomel was given him that night to evacuate the bowels. When I called upon him next moring I found he had been in great pain, occaſioned by the oxalis. He had only one ſtool during the night. The
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0306800500:29"/>doſe of the calomel was increaſed from ſeven to twelve grains, which before night, procur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed four copious ſtools. The ulcers were this day, April 14, waſhed with diluted citric-acid. The oxalis was again applied, the oxygene gas diluted with atmoſpherical air, five quarts of the former to ſix of the latter, was given him out of filken bags, not having at that time a pneumatic apparatus. A pint of wine was allowed him daily, and exerciſe and clean clothing ſtrictly enjoined. Forty drops Vini: opiat. (Pharm, chirurg.) were given him at bed-time.</p>

He had no pain from the application of the ſorrel. The glands behind the ears are of their former ſize. His ſpirits are very good, and his general health mends faſt. The oxalis was now omitted, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but lint dipped in a weak ſolution of the vitr. coerul applied to the ſores.

                     <p>MISS A. T. aged 20 years, a very beautiful and accompliſhed young lady, had been afflicted with ſcrophula for three years. When I firſt ſaw her ſhe laboured under Ph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiſis Pulmonalis. The glands about the neck, and behind the ears were much enlarged and felt hard. She had two very deep and exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive ulcers, one under her left ear, and the other under her right arm. She was ſubject to cold tremors every night about ten o'clock, with fever, heat, and fluſhing. She expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torated every day, half a pint of put ſtreaked with blood.

               <head>SECTION III. Of the PULMONARY CONSUMPTION.</head>
               <p>WHEN Phthiſis-Pulmonalis ariſes from a ſcrophulous affection, the ſeat of this diſeaſe is found clearly to exiſt in the cellular ſubſtance of the Lungs, where round firm bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies named tubercles are formed ſimilar to the ſwelling of the lymphatic-glands on the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal ſurface: they are of different ſizes from the ſmalleſt granule, to half an inch in dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter and often in cluſters—They adhere pretty cloſely to the ſubſtance of the lungs, and have no particular covering or capſule.— In proportion to the ſmallneſs of their ſize, is their firmneſs, and when cut into, in this ſtate, are of a white colour with a conſiſtence nearly approaching to cartilage: in ſome part of them there is always a ſmall pit or hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0306800500:35"/>where as they increaſe, the formation of the matter begins, and at length they paſs into vomicae. But the formation of matter is not always determined by their ſize. In ſome it begins very early. when in ſmall quantity. the conſiſtence of the matter is thick and cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: when in greater quantity it is thinner, and more reſembling the matter of a common fore. From this view of the diſeaſe, which diſſection affords, tubercles and vomicae con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute the cauſes of this diſorder with its ſeveral attendant ſymptoms, and its difficulty of cure may be hence readily accounted for. Each of theſe tubercles is to be conſidered in the ſame light as that of an external lymphatic ſwelling, which in order to its termination, muſt be liable to all the ſubſequent conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that either attend this, or any rupture of the teguments in other ſituations, while an additional obſtacle to the proceſs of healing is
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0306800500:36"/>here preſented from the conſtant motion of the lungs<note n="*" place="bottom">NISBIT on SCROPHULA.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The accurate inveſtigations of Doctor Stark<note n="‡" place="bottom">De Tuberculis Pulmon.</note> have thrown more light upon the ſubject of tubercles than all the labours of preceding phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians. He ſays that tubercles whilſt ſmall are always ſolid; when large, they are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſo. They approach to the hardneſs of cartilage, and when cut through appear ſmooth, ſhining, and uniform. No veſſels are to be ſeen in them, even when, after injecting the pulmonary artery and vein, they are examined with a microſcope. They are always in the cellular ſubſtances, never in the air veſſels, in which the extremities of the bronchial ramifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations terminate. They are at firſt extremely ſmall, numerous and in cluſters; but never in
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0306800500:37"/>the leaſt inflamed. When they become vomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cae, it is always in the ſuperior and poſterior part of the lungs, where they form ſtrong ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heſions to the Pleura.</p>
               <p>Thoſe perſons liable to tubercles<note n="*" place="bottom">The experiments of the very ingenious and learned Doctor Paſcal-Joſeph Ferro of Vienna throw a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable light upon ſome diſeaſes to which he has made an extenſive application of the principles of Pneumatic me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine. From his experiments he draws the following rational concluſions, that the inſpiration of oxygene-gas diſſipates the ſpaſm of the veſicles of the lungs; prevents the acceſſion of thoſe ſpaſms, diminiſhes and removes the diſpoſition to inflammation in the lungs; diſſolves the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travaſated lymph which obſtructs the pulmonary veſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles; produces good effects in the dropſy of the cheſt; is a good remedy in the <hi>Tuberculous Conſumption,</hi> dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes hectic fever; relieves the oppreſſion which ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts after inflammation of the cheſt; cures ſpeedily and effectually the periodical aſthma and hooping cough, aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments the ſecretion of urine, eſpecially in affections of the breaſt; produces no effects in Rheumatiſm, but is <hi>a ſovereign remedy in Scrophula.</hi>

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0306800500:38"/>tumours. Some other circumſtances of a local nature in addition to what has been ſaid on the ſubject, may add to the fatality of the diſeaſe in this climate, and tend to bring it on where otherwiſe there was no prediſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the patient to become ſo. One cauſe which may aſſiſt greatly, is that paſſion, which manifeſts itſelf among our females, but which daily grows out of faſhion, of wearing tight ſtays<note n="*" place="bottom">Another great cauſe, ſays the ingenious Dr. DARWIN, to the ſhape of young ladies is, "from the preſſure of ſtays, or other tight bandages, which at the ſame time cauſe other diſeaſes by changing the form of ſituation of the internal parts." Some time ago I aſſiſted in open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the body of a young woman in this city, who died of Phthiſis-chlorotica—She had always, I learnt, been in the habit of wearning tight ſtays with a view of giving the body a fine ſhape. I found the lungs full of tubercles, moſtly in a ſtate of ſuppuration. One remarkable ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance in this caſe was, that the whole of the lungs was found on the right ſide of the <hi>Mediaſtinum:</hi> the heart with its appendages occupying the left. The liver was enlarged, the other viſcera were ſound. The ingenious and learned Author of <hi>Medical Extracts</hi> ſays, "The preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the abdomen by ſtays impedes the action of the ſtomach and bowels, and the motion neceſſary for reſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and conſequently the juſt circulation of the blood. Hence a train of dreadful diſorders enſue. The pliancy of the body, and the natural grace of the female form, is prevented by this rigid coat of mail." The imprudent zeal of the mother for a fine ſhape, performs another moſt unkindly office to the child. She frequently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes either incapacitated for marriage (and what a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious reflection that is) or dies in child-birth. The mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in favour of ſtays ſeems, however, to be ſomewhat abated; and it is hoped the world will in time become wiſe enough to know, that the human ſhape does not ſolely depend upon <hi>whale-bone</hi> and <hi>leather.</hi> But prejudices once deeply rooted (particularly in the female ſex) are only gradually obliterated.</note>, by which the circulation of the blood
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0306800500:39"/>through the lungs is impeded, the capacity of the thorax leſſened, and the ſpace which in a ſtate of health is required for the free action of the lungs, is diminiſhed. A narrow cheſt, a long neck, and prominent ſhoulders, though not occurring in all caſes of ſcrophula, may be conſidered as unfavourable marks of this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe. Mr. Townſend in his Guide to Health,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0306800500:40"/>Vol. 2, obſerves, "that when medicines fail to effect a cure in Phthiſis Pulmonalis, a change of climate muſt be recommended, and no cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, in his opinion, can be ſuperior to that of Valencia." Should the ſcrophulous or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptive patient be inclined to make the trial, he will have an eaſy route by Paris, Lyons, Montpellier, and Barcelona, and for leſs than fifteen guineas he will find himſelf tranſported into a paradiſe, in which nature exhibits an everlaſting ſpring. (Vide Townſend's Travels through Spain, Vol. I. and II.) The fame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious author obſerves, that he never met with this diſeaſe in Spain, owing as he thinks to the uniform ſtate of the weather, and heat of the climate; but I ſhall have occaſion here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after to ſhew, that it is a diſeaſe incident to very warm and extreme cold climates, and that contrary to the opinion of a celebrated Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor, is not influenced by the ſtate of the weather.</p>

               <head>SECTION V. OPHTHALMIA TARSI.</head>
               <p>THE eye-lids are very commonly ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſeat of this diſeaſe: it is very difficult to make a patient labouring under the Opthalmia Tarſi believe ſo. A very ſlight cold frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly brings on inflammation of the eye-lids, which ultimately terminates in a diſorder of the eye, and there is no form of the diſeaſe ſo tedious to remove, or more painful in its at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack, or in which a relapſe is more liable to occur than in this.</p>
               <p>After the inflammation of the eye-lids com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mences, a ſwelling of the ſobaceous glands im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately follows, which terminates in ulce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and this ulceration is generally of a troubleſome nature. A better deſcription of the progreſs of this ſpecies of Scrophula can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0306800500:43"/>well be given than in the words of Doctor Niſbit, who obſerves, "that an acrid diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge conſtantly takes place from it, which irritaing the eye itſelf renders it weak, and unable to bear much impreſſion either of light or heat." Frequently it is of a more viſcid na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and glues the lids together in the night-time, leaving a gorey appearance on the lid through the day.</p>
               <p>This form of the diſeaſe is not often acute, it is of a more chronic ſpecies, and gives a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable appearance to the ſight. The eye-lids continue always more or leſs inflamed, thickened, and raw, and the ulcerations are with difficulty healed up, or if they are, break out afreſh on any ſudden cauſe of irritation. On leaving one eye the inflammation is liable in ſuch caſes to attack the other; and wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever one attack has taken place to a degree of violence, the patient is expoſed to its recurrence
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0306800500:44"/>from the ſlighteſt cauſe. I have never found any difficulty in effecting a cure in the worſt caſes, and that even after all other remedies have failed, by directing patients to take ſmall doſes of calomel at bed-time, rubbing a little of the ung. Hydrargy. nitrat. between the lids the laſt thing at night, and inhaling the vital<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>air in the day-time in doſes ſuited to the age and conſtitution of the patient. This new mode of treatment I ſhall illuſtrate, by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.</p>
               <p>A gentleman of my acquaintance had labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under an ulceration of both eye-lids for nearly three years, and on which account he had the advice of the moſt able oculiſts in this city. A variety of applications at different times had been uſed, and the materia-medica ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all over for various alteratives. He had been at the ſea-ſide for four months, and had taken the Aqua-marin. internally during the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0306800500:45"/>whole of that time every other morning with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out intermiſſion, but had derived no advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. I recommended him ſtrongly to inhale oxygene-gas, which he did regularly every day for three months, in the proportion of eight quarts, to twelve of atmoſpherical air. As he could bear no ſharp application to the eye-lids, ſimple ſpermaceti ointment, melted in a ſpoon over a lighted candle, was introduced by means of a camel's-hair pencil between the Palpebrae every night. Under this plan of treatment in four months he was quite reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, and has ſince had no relapſe. Change of air, plenty of exerciſe, with chalybeats, and the ung. hyd. nit. will ſeldom fail of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving this diſeaſe, and their good effects will be augmented, if the patient inhales the <hi>vital<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>air.</hi> Nouriſhing diet, with generous port<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wine, will give vigour to the ſyſtem. Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the eye-lids with cold water of a morning, is highly injurious.</p>

                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. BRYAN CROWDER, Surgeon to Bethlehem and Bridewell Hoſpitals, has in a late publication on White Swellings, availed himſelf of an opinion delivered by the late Mr. POTT, which he has applied more extenſively in his practice, that of keeping up a purulent diſcharge from the neighbourhood of the diſeaſed joint, which he has found highly efficacious, by the application of the <hi>ceratum Sabinae</hi>

Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the concluſions which Mr. CROWDER draws "that an iſſue in any part of the body, may be ſucceſsfully em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in all caſes of Scrophula, and may probably be ſufficiently powerful when it is applied in time, to prevent an attack of this diſeaſe in conſtitutions prediſpoſed to it," future experience muſt determine. I have obſerved that long continued drains generally accelerate the progreſs of hectic fever, which in time ſeldom fails of having a fatal tendency, and where a long continued perſeverance in the uſe of the vital-air, with change of air, and corrobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants fail of ſucceſs, I ſhould have but little opinion of other remedies.</note> THE Hydarthus is uſually reckoned as another ſpecies of Scrophula, which begins in the lymphatic glands about the knee-joint,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0306800500:47"/>and is very painful and ſlow in its progreſs. It commences with a ſlight tumefaction of the cellular membrane, without any diſcolouration of the ſkin, attended with great heat and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent pain. The ſkin appears clear and ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, the joint becomes finally enlarged, the ſurrounding parts feel elaſtic, the limb gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally waſtes, abſceſſes form in the vicinity of the joint, and a diſcharge takes place, being, as a late writer obſerves, ſometimes a viſcid glairy fluid, at other times more purulent and
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0306800500:48"/>ſometimes entirely ſanious and foetid matter. If the diſeaſe be not in this ſtage detected, and its progreſs ſtopped, it proceeds on and extends itſelf to the bone itſelf. Thus the cartilages take on ſymptoms of inflammation, and are diſſolved. The bone itſelf is not exempted from undergoing the ſame change; and the ſtructure of the joint on diſſection is found melted down, more or leſs, into one hetero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geneous maſs, conſiſting of a white glairy fluid mixed with matter, with pieces of carious bone of different ſizes. The patient in this laſt ſtage dies if amputation is not had recourſe to, and even the operation itſelf will not at all times prove ſalutary, as the hectic attending theſe caſes will frequently have too far reduced the ſtrength of the patient.</p>
               <p>It will be neceſſary to diſtinguiſh properly between the Scrophulous white ſwelling and that which ariſes from a Rheumatic affection,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0306800500:49"/>for reaſons that muſt appear obvious to the practitioner. From the unfavourable diagnoſis which Mr. Bell in his Treatiſe on Ulcers gives, a practitioner might be intimidated from uſing his utmoſt endeavours in ſaving the limb; for he obſerves, page 475, <q>that in the <hi>ſcrophu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous white ſwelling,</hi> it is not probable that art will ever be able to afford much aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</q> Since the publication of Mr. Bell's Treatiſe, our hopes are revived from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits to be derived from inhaling the <hi>vital air</hi>

               <p>BRONCHOCELE though not uſually ranked under the head of Scrophula, partakes in every reſpect of the nature of that diſeaſe.

It comes on with a ſmall ſwelling externally about the middle of the throat, unattended with pain, and gradually increaſes in ſize till it renders both reſpiration and deglutition laborious and difficult. It has long been called the Derbyſhire neck from its
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0306800500:52"/>frequent occurrence in that country, but ſuch appearances are now very common every where.

Upon the very reſpectable authority of Mr. Townſend, we are informed that in the vale of Pewſey, where it is very frequent, he never fails of curing it, in all who apply to him for advice, by giving lozenges of burnt ſponge well powdered, and made up with the Syr. Altheae. (Vide Guide to Health, Vol. II. page 462.) Finding, however, the uſual remedies preſcribed for this ſpecies of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe ſo often fail, I was reſolved ſome time back to try the effects of the vital-air, and a caſe to try the effects of the vital-air, and a caſe ſhortly afterwards coming under my care, gave me a favourable opportunity of obſerving a very rapid progreſs under this plan of treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>Miſs M. P. aged 18 years, about three years ago perceived a ſmall ſoft tumour grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about the middle of her throat, which continued gradually increaſing in ſize till the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0306800500:54"/>latter end of the year 1797. It gave her no pain, but ſometimes affected her ſwallowing, and looked very unſightly. A variety of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications had been made to the part, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the care of ſeveral eminent men in this city, ſhe had taken the cicuta, burnt ſponge, and latterly ſea-watar. A ſolution of common ſalt in diſtilled water was alſo applied to the part by means of folds of linen cloth, dipped in this mixture and renewed every eight hours. But this rather did harm than good<note n="*" place="bottom">It is now pretty much the faſhion for practitioners in Surgery to apply ſea-water, and ſolutions of common ſalt in various forms, to indolent glandular ſwellings. There is reaſon to believe that this practice is ſometimes attended with ſucceſs; but I have myſelf always preferred a ſolution of the common crude ſal. ammoniac. May not the efficacy of ſuch applications be attributed rather to the ſaline particles being taken into the ſyſtem by ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorption, and giving acrimony to the general maſs of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culating fluids, than to their acting merely as topical ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications?

               <p>HYDROCEPHALUS is ranked by ſome as a ſpecies of Scrophula. The firſt ſymptoms are great reſtleſſneſs, violent pain in the head, generally confined to one ſide, eſpecially above the eyes and in a direction between the temples; ſickneſs at ſtomach, an itching of the noſe, loſs of appetite, a ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low and ſometimes very white complexion. The bowels are in general coſtive, and it is with difficulty that ſtools can be procured. Theſe are generally of a dark greeniſh colour, with an oilineſs, or glaſſy bile, rather than the ſlime which accompanies worms, and they are for the moſt part extremely offenſive. Febrile ſymptoms enſue which exacerbate towards
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:0306800500:61"/>evening, great drowſineſs, languor and pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhneſs. As the diſeaſe advances, the pulſe is uſually ſlow and heavy. In the commence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the diſeaſe the pupils are very much contracted, but as the diſeaſe advances a dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the pupil takes place, chiefly in that eye, on which ſide the fluid is collected. The child will at intervals ſcream out, and have frightful dreams. It will pick the bed-clothes, have <hi>ſubſultus tendinum,</hi> and talk incoherently. In this ſtate I have known children to linger out a fortnight and ſometimes three weeks, occaſioning the moſt poignant diſtreſs to thoſe around. Doctor Percival obſerves that Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drocephalus derives its origin ſometimes from inflammation, but moſt frequently from ſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma and laxity of fibre, inducing glandular obſtruction and feeble action of the lymphatic ſyſtem, all which diſpoſe to an effuſion of water in the brain.

The theory of dropſy as eſtabliſhed by Doctor John Brown and adopted by his pupils, and thoſe who practiſe on what is vulgarly called the <hi>Brunonian Syſtem,</hi> is moſt generally found to be ſucceſsful except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a few inſtances where it has been inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciouſly applied, for it is now proved by ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional practitioners that until the excitement is increaſed by ſuch remedies as will be here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after pointed out, that no juſt expectations of cure can be entertained. Accumulations of water in the brain, producing thoſe ſymptoms which characterize Hydrocephalus, are the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0306800500:63"/>ſame with every other caſe of Aſthenia, or Idiopathic affection, depending upon pure de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, which though extended to the whole ſyſtem is more prevalent in the exhalent and abſorbent parts of it, and more eſpecially af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting the exhalents and abſorbents of the brain.</p>
               <p>It is in the early ſtage of the diſeaſe that medicines can alone be of ſervice. When the affected ſide can be diſtinguiſhed, the tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phine ſhould be applied. When the water is ſuppoſed, from the mildneſs of the ſymptoms, and their gradual progreſs, to be effuſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the dura and pia mater, and when a very evident fluctuation can be felt, chiefly at the bregma, we ought to puncture without heſitation the dura mater: as this can be done without danger, it may give immediate relief, and may have ſome chance of producing a cure. Should it be thought expedient to perform the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0306800500:64"/>operation, the dura mater ſhould be punctured cautiouſly with a lancet, at the ſide of the bregma, or as far as poſſible from the ſuperior longitudinal ſinus. Thoſe who are attentive to the commencement and progreſs of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, will with the greateſt facility diſtinguiſh it from worm fever, to which in its early ſtage it bears a ſtrong analogy, and for which it is frequently miſtaken.</p>
               <p>Hydrocephalus is diſtinguiſhed from Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexy by its being attended with fever, and from nervous fever by the paroxyſms being very irregular, with perfect intermiſſions many times a day. In nervous fevers the pain of the head generally affects the middle of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head: in Hydrocephalus it is generally on one ſide of the head. Doctor Darwin, whoſe opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion carries the greateſt weight, ſuppoſes that the great diſpoſition in perſons labouring under the diſeaſe, to lie down immediately after hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:0306800500:65"/>raiſed their heads from off the pillow, is owing to the preſſure of the water on the large trunks of the blood-veſſels entering the cavity, being more intolerable than on the ſmaller ones: for if the large trunks are compreſſed, it muſt inconvenience the branches alſo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but if ſome of the ſmall branches are compreſſed only, the trunks are not ſo immediately in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commoded. I think it is highly probable that where one eye is affected the diſeaſe exiſts in the ventricle of that ſide. Some authors aſſert that this diſeaſe ſeldom appears after the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth year, whereas it daily occurs in all ages from two years to thirty <note n="*" place="bottom">Vide MONRO'S three treatiſes on the Brain, the Eye and the Ear. The Doctor mentions the caſe of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man who had Hydrocephalus in her twenty-ſixth year.</note>, though it attacks chiefly children.</p>
               <p>A woman in the pariſh of St. Giles's Bloomſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury was ſeized with Hydrocephalus in her
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0306800500:66"/>twenty-ſixth year. She was treated by the medical attendants in the uſual way, by having recourſe to bleeding, purging and other evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations. She died on the twelfth day. Upon opening the head, I found the veſſels of the brain very turgid, though ſhe had loſt thirty ounces of blood. The anterior ventricles were filled with a diaphanous fluid. The foramen in the ſeptum lucidum was ſo diſtended as to admit the top of my little finger. The tuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca arachnoidea was opake and thickened. In all there were about four ounces and a half of water in the ventricles. In the pericardium there was found more fluid than is uſual in a healthy ſtate.</p>
               <p>It is a melancholy fact, that hundreds of children die annually of this diſeaſe who might perhaps under the care of ſkilful perſons have recovered.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:0306800500:67"/>The remedies which have been moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly reſorted to for the cure of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, are Mercury, bliſters applied on the head, calx zinci, ſquills, opium, and digita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis, and of late the fol. doron. German. Now as all theſe remedies generally fail, it is proper to propoſe ſome others.</p>
               <p>So ſoon as this diſeaſe aſſumes the character of Hydrocephalus, the head ſhould be imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately ſhaved, and from eight to a dozen leeches applied. After they fall off, bliſters in the direction of the ſutures ought to be laid on, and electrical ſparks ſhould be paſſed through the head in all directions. The bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els are beſt emptied with large doſes of hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drarg. muriat. mitis. A generous diet ſhould be enjoined to invigorate the ſyſtem, and the alimentary canal in particular.</p>

                     <hi>CASE I.</hi> Caſe of Mary Watkins.</head>
                  <p>MARY Watkins aged fourteen years was ſeized March 4th 1798 with a violent pain acroſs her forehead as ſhe was ſat at work, attended with great ſickneſs at ſtomach, and ſudden languor. She had felt herſelf ſlightly indiſpoſed a few days before, and upon a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition that it aroſe from worms, an Electuary of ſulphur and treacle had been given her. She had on the preceding night been expoſed to great cold.</p>
                  <p>On the 6th ſhe complained of vertigo, acute pain in her head, particularly above the eye-brows —during the night ſhe talked incoherently and called frequently for ſomething to drink. On the 7th the pupil of her left eye was much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:0306800500:71"/>and ſhe vomited up a quantity of ſlime. The gentleman who attended her bled her largely in the left arm, and gave her a doſe of calomel and rhubard—at night one dram ung. hyd. F. was directed to be rubbed in between the thighs—ſhe was denied animal food, and allowed nothing but barley-water to drink.</p>
                  <p>On the 8th her pulſe was very feeble, ſhe had been comatoſe during the night, and had ſubſultus tendinum; ſhe picked the bed-cloaths and frequently tried to get out of bed—Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the whole of the night ſhe conſtantly kept her hand to her head. Bliſters were applied between the ſhoulders, and to the calves of the legs.</p>
                  <p>One the 9th I ſaw her for the firſt time. When I entered the room, ſhe had a wild ſtare with her, and muttered ſomething in a low voice—at times ſhe was delirious. I
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:0306800500:72"/>emptied the bowels with ten grains of calomel ppt. and after ſhaving the head applied twelve leeches to the affected ſide, after which nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row ſtrips of emp. veſic. were applied in the direction of the ſutures. In the evening I paſſed ſeveral electrical ſhocks in various directions through the head, and gave her three drams of Aether vitr. c. with one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred drops Tinct. opii in a glaſs of rum and water; ſhe had a very good night.</p>
                  <p>In the morning her pulſe was ſixty-four— ſhe knew and converſed with her friends, and appeared much relieved.</p>
                  <p>March 10th Electricity was repeated—the bliſters ordered to be kept open with the cerat. canth. Directed the Pul. Sternut. (as before mentioned) to be ſnuffed up three different times during the day—the calomel was repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at ſix o'clock in the evening. She was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:0306800500:73"/>any thing to eat or drink ſhe wiſhed for. Rum and water was given her for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon drink. At bed-time ten grains of the Amm. praep. with eighty drops of laudanum was given her in a ſaline draught.</p>
                  <p n="11">11th. She is ſurpriſingly better to-day, is got out of bed, and ſits up in an arm chair— has little or no pain in her head—complains of numbneſs in her legs—directed them to be put into the warm bath—at night gave two grains of opium in a pill with the volatile alkali in rum and water.</p>
                  <p n="12">12th. She mends very faſt: has had a good night, and all the other ſymptoms are allevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated. Gave her twelve quarts of oxygene-gas and fifteen of atmoſpherical air, which ſhe inhaled with eaſe.</p>

                     <pb n="76" facs="tcp:0306800500:74"/>The electricity omitted; repeated her opium and volatile at night. From this time ſhe gradually regained her ſtrength, the ſymptoms ſubſided, and by the firſt of April ſhe was quite recovered. She continued the vital-air till the 29th of March.</p>

                  <head type="sub">For the particulars of this Caſe, I am obliged to DOCTOR THORNTON.</head>
                  <p>MARY Durand, aged nine years, living at No. 53, in Jermyn-ſtreet, laboured under Hydrocephalus. Among other ſymptoms, ſhe had an heavy oppreſſion in the head, which obliged her frequently to recline it on a pillow: complete blindneſs of the right eye, and fits, which would frequently ſeize her ſo ſuddenly that ſhe would fall down from her chair and remain convulſed often for near half an hour, but without foaming of the mouth, as in Epilepſy. Doctor T. being applied to gave her the vital air with ſteel and bark
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:0306800500:76"/>internally, but the only alteration produced was an amendment of health. As her pulſe was remarkably ſlow, not more than 64 beats in a minute, on the tenth day, he gave her thirty quarts of oxygne gas, moderately diluted, the effect of which was an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate return of viſion, and ſhe has remained free from head-ache and fits, with diſtinct viſion now above a year.</p>
                  <p>The uſual method of treating dropſies, by repeated bleeding, vomiting, purging, cliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering, evacuation by urine and the ſkin; in one word, opening and relaxing all the excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories and weakening the activity of the abſorbents every where, which is the unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable practice for the cure of a diſeaſe, the cauſe of which is that very ſtate of veſſels which theſe remedies produce, is ſo abſurd and contradictory, that I do not wonder that dropſy in all its forms, and particularly in the
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:0306800500:77"/>preſent (Hydrocephalus) ſhould baffle the art of practitioners. The cauſe of dropſy ſo far as its reſpects the collection of water, is eaſily explicable upon the doctrine of Doctor Brown<note n="*" place="bottom">Elementinae Medicinae, Chap. 627, Editio Nova, a THOMAS BEDDOES, M. D.</note> but altogether inexplicable upon any other. For the univerſal debility, and exhauſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed excitability, followed by laxity and atony, are chiefly predominant in the extreme red arteries, and the exhalents immediately continued from theſe, as well as in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencements of the abſorbent veins: and it is often urgent in a particular ſet of theſe veſſels only.</p>
                  <p>Repeated ſucceſsful trials of the mode of cure I have recommended, ſufficiently vouch its propriety. <q>A caſe ‡ given up by the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary<note place="bottom">Vide JONES'S Inquiry into the State of Medicine.</note>

This patient laboured under univerſal anaſarca and aſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic dropſy. His legs were ſo oedematous as to be ſwelled to an enormous bulk—No evacuation <note n="*" place="bottom">It is a fact that the new ſyſtem of medicine intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by the late Doctor JOHN BROWN, has produced a more remarkable revolution, both in the theoretical and practical departments of this branch of ſcience than is to be found throughout the whole hiſtory of medicine. Under all the former doctrines of this art, and under al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt every modification of diſeaſe, we find an univerſal ſameneſs in the method of cure. Bleeding, purging, vomiting and every other mode of evacuation, were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcriminately applied in almoſt every diſeaſe: and even in thoſe caſes in which ſtimulants were employed or an invigorating plan of cure purſued, they were frequently alternated with evacuants, as if certain diſeaſes could not be eradicated, except by the oppoſite means of inducing debility and vigour at the ſame time in the body—the practice founded on the new theory, in one reſpect re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembles the old, as the ſame method of cure is employed in the far greater number of diſeaſes; the old theoriſts univerſally applied evacuants, and endeavoured to debili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the ſyſtem by every means. The application of ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulants is nearly as univerſal, on the principles of the new Theory.—HERDMAN'S ESSAY on the CAUSES and PHAENOMENA of LIFE.</note> of any kind was adminiſtered
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:0306800500:79"/>to this patient.

To thoſe however who will take the trouble of making themſelves ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:0306800500:80"/>with its principles, it will be only neceſſary to ſtate, that ſuch perſons do not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the ſubject. I make no doubt but I ſhall incur the diſpleaſure of thoſe, who with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ingenuity to invent, or candour enough to acknowledge the merits due to others, haſtily condemn new doctrines before they have beſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>towed the neceſſary pains, which are required to underſtand them. I every day ſee with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret, the power of prejudice in favour of old erroneous ſyſtems; and how great the reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance is even to the moſt certain and luminous experiments. Prejudice has certainly a great ſhare in this repugnance; but above all ſelf-love dreads to adopt new truths, becauſe they carry with them conviction, and a tacit avow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al of ignorance: hence ariſes the difficulty of bringing thoſe who are advanced in years, and men of learning who have already acquired re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, to admit of new diſcoveries. <q>It appears to me, ſays Lord Bolingbroke,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:0306800500:81"/>that the author of nature has thought fit to mingle from time to time, among the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties of men, a <hi>few,</hi> and but a <hi>few</hi> of thoſe, on whom he is graciouſly pleaſed to beſtow a larger portion of the aetherial ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, than is given in the ordinary courſe of his providence to the ſons of men. Look about you from the palace to the cottage: you will find that the bulk of mankind is made to breathe the air of this atmoſphere, to roam about this globe, and to conſume like the courtiers of Alcinous the fruits of the earth—Nos numerus ſumus et fruges conſumere nati.

               <p>The author proves by experiments and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations in the firſt place, that alkaline lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to the parts affected with rachitis, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to their cure<note n="*" place="bottom">See alſo NICHOLSON'S Journal of Chemiſtry, No. 4.</note>, next that the calcareous phoſphate taken internally is really tranſmitted by the lymphatic paſſages and contributes to oſſification; and laſtly, that the internal uſe of calcareous phoſphate, whether alone or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined with the phoſphate of Soda, powerfully contributes to reſtore the natural proportions in the ſubſtance of the bones, and accelerate the cure of rachitis.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="90" facs="tcp:0306800500:88"/>The effect of the action of acids upon bones, was long before known; that is to ſay, that when deprived of calcareous phoſphate and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to the gelatinous parenchyma which forms one of their elements, they loſe their conſiſtence and become flexible. Hence it was already conjectured by various Phyſicians, that the rachitis was the effect of a peculiar acid.</p>
               <p>Every one who is attentive to the diſeaſes of children muſt have obſerved a diſpoſition to aceſcence in the primae viae. The odour which characterizes aceſcence is often manifeſt in their breath, and even their perſpiration. The bile which is the natural cathartic of the body corrects this diſpoſition; but we gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally find a deficiency of this ſecretion in ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitic infants. It does not colour their excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and the acids accordingly are develop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a very decided manner. They diſturb
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:0306800500:89"/>the circulation and attack and ſoften the bones. As it is by defect of animalization that theſe acids develope themſelves, it follows that their character is analogous to the fermenteſcible vegetable acids, and more or leſs to the oxalic acid: and that on the contrary, the animal acid of phoſphoric acid ceaſes to be formed, and to unite with the animal calcareous earth; whence they are deprived of the principle of their ſolidity.</p>
               <p>In order to eſtabliſh the doctrine of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur Bonhomme upon preciſe experiments, it is requiſite to analyze rachitic bones compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively with thoſe of healthy individuals of the ſame age: and as it is known that the urine of rachitic ſubjects depoſits a great quantity of a ſubſtance of ſparing ſolubility and earthy ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, it would be advantageous to make a
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:0306800500:90"/>complete analyſis of this urine and its ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.<note n="*" place="bottom">It is known that when the urine contains diſengaged phoſphoric-acid, as happens to aged individuals, and in ſome peculiar circumſtances of the ſyſtem, if lime water be poured in, there is a ſpeedy depoſition of calcareous phoſphate. It is alſo known that when a ſolution of the nitrate of mercury is poured on the freſh urine of adults, a roſe-coloured precipitate is formed, which is a phoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phate of mercury produced by the decompoſition of the phoſphates contained in the urine. Theſe two proofs are therefore extremely proper to aſcertain the preſcence of phoſphoric-acid, whether free or combined, in a fluid which in its natural ſtate contains a remarkable propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Beſides this principle, the urine depoſits more or leſs of ſediment, either gelatinous or an earthy appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; and laſtly by evaporation, a ſaponaceous and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line extract, in greater or leſs abundance is obtained by evaporation.</note>.</p>
               <p>Doctor Darwin is of opinion that if the Theory of Monſieur Bonhomme were juſt, the ſoft parts of ſuch bones ſhould ſhew evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent marks of ſuch acidity after death, which he believes has not been obſerved. Nor is it,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:0306800500:91"/>adds he <note n="*" place="bottom">DARWIN'S ZOONOMIA.</note> analagous to other animal facts, that nutritious fluids ſecreted by the fineſt veſſels of the body ſhould be ſo little anamalized, as to retain acetous or vegetable acidity.</p>

<pb n="94" facs="tcp:0306800500:92"/>being obſtructed by mucus; from a deficiency of bile, and the diſengagement of an elaſtic gas in the inteſtines during the proceſs of fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation. The digeſtion then becomes im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired, and a laxity and debility pervade the whole ſyſtem.

               <p>Of the benefits ariſing from the vital-air I have ſeen ſeveral inſtances, but the following
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:0306800500:95"/>caſe the firſt in which I recommended it, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves notice.</p>
               <p>Miſs G. A. aged two years, very thin and tall of her age, about nine months ago, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of a pain in the back about the third lumbar vertebra. She was ſo weak in that part as always to require ſupport behind. A moſt ſingular enlargement took place, which was particularly conſpicuous in the extremities con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiguous to the articulations, and in the bones of the cranium. Her countenance became pale—ſhe had a very craving appetite, and ſhewed a great diſpoſition to eat chalk. Her belly became tumid and hard, and her breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing laborious, which laſt ſymptom aroſe from a very ſmall thorax, much flattened in before, and at its ſides.—Emetics, cathartics, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorbents were the chief medicines preſcribed as occaſion required, and in the mean time an infuſion of the Cinchonae with Tinct. Ferri
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:0306800500:96"/>was given three times a day. Notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhe grew daily worſe, and was ſo emaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated as ſcarcely to be recognized by her friends.</p>
               <p>Under theſe circumſtances I recommended the vital-air which ſhe inhaled daily four quarts to ſix of common air. At night ſhe took pills compoſed of Ferr. Vitr. and Ext. Cinchonae, and five grains of Calomel at bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time once a week. This plan being purſued four months in conjunction with exerciſe, nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tritious diet, and a fine open air, ſhe quite recovered, and is now a healthy girl.</p>
               <p>This caſe I related ſome time back a one of our Medical Societies in this City, where the cure was attributed by the Anti-Pneumatics (if I may be allowed the expreſſion) to the ſteel medicine, diet, &amp;c. but as this medicine when given <hi>per ſe,</hi> is ineffectual from the ſmall
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:0306800500:97"/>quantity of oxygene it depoſits in the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, it certainly muſt be acknowledged that it was the ſupply by the organs of reſpiration, that reſtored the young lady to health.</p>
               <p>There appears a propenſity in human nature to reſiſt conviction, and that propenſity is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly conſpicuous in the preſent inſtance, in which prejudice oppoſes palpable evidence. <q>And although like Naaman the Aſſyrian I cannot tell why the waters of Jordan ſhould be better than Abana and Pharpar, rivers of Damaſcus,</q> yet ſince experience has proved them ſo, no reaſoning can change my opinion of the good effects the <hi>airs</hi> have on this and a variety of other diſeaſes.

               <p>An impaired digeſtion I before mentioned as one of the primary ſymptoms of rachitis: this,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:0306800500:98"/>as the late ingenious Phyſiologiſt Mr. Hunter proved by experiments on various animals, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſes from the diminution of animal heat, which quickens the proceſs of digeſtion. Now the generation of animal heat, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Doctors Goodwin and Crawford, and the Rev. Mr. Townſends, is from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compoſition of oxygene-gas in the lungs dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reſpiration<note n="*" place="bottom">A Theory different from this has been offered by Mr. Rigby, who obſerves, <q>that the ſenſe of ſuperior heat which is obviouſly felt in the region of the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, is a proof that if that be not the immediate ſource of all animal heat, that at leaſt a conſiderable portion is generated there, and confirms the foregoing opinion, that heat is generated during the decompoſition of our food in the ſtomach. <bibl>RIGBY on ANIMAL HEAT.</bibl>
                     </q>
                  </note>: thus as I ſuppoſe a part of the oxygene unites with the iron contained in the blood, and converts it into an oxyd; ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and a greater proportion unites with the carbon brought by the venous blood to the lungs, and forms carbonic-acid gas, while
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:0306800500:99"/>another portion of the oxygene unites with the hydrogene brought in the ſame manner, and forms water.</p>
               <p>A portion of this oxygene which unites with the iron and hydrogene, becomes fixed on theſe ſubſtances, and gives out the heat which ſupported it in a gaſeous ſtate, while the remainder forming carbonic-acid gas which has a leſs capacity for heat than oxygene-gas, gives out a part of its caloric. Thus reſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is the cauſe of a continual extrication of heat in the lungs, which being conveyed by the blood to all parts of the body, is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant ſource of heat to the animal. We may therefore conſider reſpiration as an operation in which oxygene-gas is continually paſſing from the gaſeous to the concrete ſtate: it will therefore give out at every inſtant, the heat which it held in combination.</p>

                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:0306800500:100"/>Theſe important facts enable us to explain the reaſon, why the inhalation of a larger pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of oxygene-gas than what is received from the atmoſphere during the proceſs of reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piration, by raiſing the temperature of heat in the body, thereby accelerating digeſtion, or aſſiſting it when impaired, is of ſo much ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice in Rachitis<note n="*" place="bottom">As there is a ſcarcity of oxygene in many of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes to which children are incident, all ſuch as are rachi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic, badly nurſed, potbellied, or diſpoſed to hydrocepha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus internus, or water on the brain, ſhould paſs the greater part of the middle of the day in fine weather in the nurſe's arms, or at play according to their age and other circumſtances in the neighbourhood of ſhrubberies, or more extenſive plantations.—ARCHER's Miſcellaneous Obſervations on the Effects of Oxygene, page 88.</note>. And is not the coſtiveneſs attendant on the rickets to be attributed to a deficiency of oxygene, as well as the paleneſs and ſallow complection? Doctor Thornton obſerves, that when he made his dyſpeptic pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients breathe ſuper-oxygenated air, they not
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:0306800500:101"/>only acquir'd appetite and ſpirits, but became more regular in their bowels, and roſy health appeared in their cheeks. I never inhale the vital-air myſelf but it gives me a voracious ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, and raiſes my ſpirits much above the uſual ſtandard. We know alſo from experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that oxygene increaſes the ſecretions in general, and therefore may increaſe the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of bile, which is proved to be the natural cathartic of the body, and at the ſame time gives tone and vigour to the ſecreting veſſels; it is highly probable therefore that it may im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the quality of the ſecreted fluid. The effects alſo before ſtated well oxygenated air has in raiſing the ſpirits, is another deſireable ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject attained in this new mode of treatment; and the caſe of Mr. Atwood communicated to Doctor Beddoes, and by him preſented to the public in the ſecond edition of his ineſtimable work, entitled <q>Further Conſiderations on the Medicinal uſe, and on the production

Of late years ſeveral kinds of machinery have been introduced into prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice with a view of giving ſupport to the ſpine, by taking off the preſſure of the head and ſhoulders. Monſieur Vacher, an ingenious Frenchman, invented ſome years ago a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chine of which he has given an account in the Memoires de l'Academie Royale de Chirurgie, tom. iv. accompanied with a plate. The principle upon which this machine acts is, the keeping of the head in an erect poſture, and the ſpine in as ſtraight a line as it naturally
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:0306800500:105"/>does, or as it poſſibly can admit of in a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſed ſtate; and in ſupporting the ſuperin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent weight of the head, ſhoulders and upper extremities, from preſſing downwards on the diſtorted ſpine, and increaſing the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vature of it. Since that another machine, or rather an improvement on Monſieur Vacher's, has been invented by Mr. Jones, an ingenious ſtay-maker of this city, and I believe it has been of ſervice in ſome caſes. Mr. Wilkin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, the ingenious lecturer on Experimental Philoſophy at St. Bartholomew's Hoſpital, has lately recommended to our notice a ſpinal ſtay which poſſeſſes many advantages over all the reſt, by taking off in a very adequate degree, all weight, by giving greater ſupport to the ſhoulders, neck and head.

               <p>Our ſchools of phyſic lay great ſtreſs on parthology, or certain appearances in the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, by which they ſuppoſe the nature, the ſtage, and reſult of the diſeaſe may be pointed out. Thoſe criterions are to be ſought after in the eyes, the noſe, the ſkin, the tongue, the pulſe<note n="*" place="bottom">A knowledge of the pulſe, is highly neceſſary to a good Phyſician; though it is the ſource of a number of errors in practice, from the falſe inferences, and haſty concluſions, which medical men draw upon the ſlighteſt deviation or irregularity in this thermometer of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man body. To the attainment of this object, many and conſiderable obſtacles oppoſe themſelves: for the pulſe not only varies in quickneſs, at different periods of life, but different temperatures, and even ſtatures, have cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſponding varieties of pulſe. Thus the pulſe in women is ordinarily found to be about one ſeventh quicker than in men; the proportion is ſtill greater in women during courtſhip: in men of a ſhort ſtature, it is quicker than in thoſe who are tall; and in children than in adults. The pulſe is ſaid to become ſlower from forty-five to fifty or ſixty years of age, but afterwards to become quicker; a kind of hectic being ſuppoſed to be the uſual concomitant of age, which makes the pulſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantine pulſe. Thus the pulſe, which at the moment of birth, beats 134 ſtrokes in a minute, decreaſes in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locity to the period of manhood, when its medium may be reckoned at 75; is ſtationary at 50 or 60, according to the degree of health, or firmneſs of conſtitution of the ſubject; and then increaſes again as the body becomes enfeebled by age—the pulſe varies alſo at different times of the day. In the morning before breakfaſt it is ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt; it becomes quicker after every meal, and that in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to the quantity and quality of the food taken in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſtomach, and becomes ſlower again at night dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſleep, if the ſtomach has not been too much loaded, or defrauded of its neceſſary proportion of food. The different paſſions operate ſtrongly on the pulſe; as fear, anger, joy, love, ſorrow, &amp;c. Thoſe who would wiſh to be acquainted with this important branch of Phyſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy, muſt conſult the writings of Falconer, Adair, Sir John Floyer, Dr. Bryan Robinſon, Dr. Heberden, Rumball and other writers of merit.</note>, and the geſtures.

                  <q>The infinite variety of complaints an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure or infected ſtate of the blood induces, almoſt exceeds belief; and hence the new and deceptive forms a ſcrophulous taint puts on, which often deceives the moſt eminent of the faculty, and baffles the beſt intention
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:0306800500:111"/>towards a cure. An impure or ſcrophu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous taint will invade the nobleſt organs of the human frame, before the patient can be aware of his danger. In the firſt ſtage of its invincible attack, a weary pain ſeizes the joints and muſcles, attended with a waſting of the legs and loins. In the ſecond ſtage the gums ſwell, grow painful, hot and irritable, and bleed upon the ſlighteſt preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: the roots of the teeth become looſe and bare, and the breath nauſeous. In the third ſtage, the gums grow putrid, and the teeth black and rotten, the ſublingular veins become varicoſe, and the breath ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daverous; foetid blood diſtils from the lips, gums, mouth, noſe, and lungs, ſtomach, liver, ſpleen, pancreas, inteſtines, womb, kidnies, &amp;c. Scabs and ulcers break out over all parts of the body, and the joints, bones, and vifcera, become morbid. In the fourth ſtage, putrid, eruptive, and ſpot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:0306800500:112"/>fevers enſue, which end in atrophy, or elſe follow diarrhoeas, dyfentery, dropſy, conſumption, palſy, contraction, melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly and all the long and direful train of nervous diſeaſes, which to deſcribe would fill a volume.<note n="*" place="bottom">A patient ſo grievouſly afflicted might well exclaim with the Royal Pſalmiſt, <q>For my loins are filled with a ſore diſease: and there is no whole part in my body. <bibl>

               <p>At what period Scrophula firſt made its ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance in this country, I cannot preciſely fix; the hiſtory of all diſeaſes is involved in a deal of obſcurity, but particularly this. A late writer is of opinion that the <hi>morbus coxen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicis</hi> of Hippocrates, is the ſcrophulous hip of the preſent day: and that thoſe particular diſeaſes mentioned by ancient authors, as hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their origin in (what they term) cold <hi>pitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itous humour,</hi> falling on a joint, and which ſometimes occaſioned luxation; as alſo the complaints denominated <hi>ſpina ventoſa, melice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria, Hydarthus,</hi> and <hi>fungus articuli,</hi> are in their ſymptoms and effects very analogous to the different ſpecies of the diſeaſe which is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally denominated white ſwelling.</p>

                  <pb n="119" facs="tcp:0306800500:117"/>The commencement and progreſs of Scro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phula in this country are generally as follow. The lymphatic glands become diſeaſed, and rendered inert and paralytic from the action of
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:0306800500:118"/>ſome poiſonous material, probably an acid, generated during the proceſs of digeſtion. Slime by little and little adheres to the inteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines, and plugs up the mouths of the lacteals and renders them torpid and ſchirrous. The glands then become large externally and inirrita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble from being over ſtimulated. The digeſtive faculties of the ſtomach grow languid. The mouths of the lacteals will often inflame and turn to ulcers—a general relaxation and atony pervade the whole ſyſtem—Small oval or ſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical tumours form under the ſkin, which at firſt appear like a ſmall knot, ſmooth and move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, with ſome elaſticity, and they gradually increaſe in number and ſize till they form one
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:0306800500:119"/>hard, large fixed tumour, chiefly in the neck and behind the ears—they do not give much pain, or is the colour of the ſkin changed—the joints of the elbows and ancles as well as of the fingers and toes become ſtiff and painful, and it very frequently happens that an anchy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſis of ſome principal joint remains, though the other ſymptoms be abated. In ſome a very bad cough haraſſes the patient, which I think proceeds from a morbid ſtate of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. The ſour eructations ariſe from a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing acidity in the ſtomach and the tumid abdomen from the diſengagement of elaſtic-gas in the inteſtinal canal. The firſt effect of viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid mucus in the alimentary canal is ſedative, as appears by the ſlow and feeble pulſe, lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guor, and depreſſion of ſpirits, coldneſs of the extremities and deficiency of perſpiration, which it conſtantly produces, and which are attendant ſymptoms in the latter ſtage of the diſeaſe. Hence if proper advice is not had,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:0306800500:120"/>an atrophy enſues, and the unhappy patient will ſink under his load of grief and pain, a victim to the want of application of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of philoſophical analyſis to the ſubject of the Materia Medica.</p>
               <p>The diſeaſe ſometimes creeps on flowly for a number of years without producing much derangement in the health of the patient, and inſtances are not wanting where it has been ſpontaneouſly cured, the ulcers healing up, and no new tumours appearing; and as Doctor Cullen has obſerved <q>that thus at length the diſeaſe ceaſes entirely leaving only ſome inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible eſchars, pale and ſmooth, but in ſome parts ſhrivelled, or where it had occupied the joints leaving the motions of theſe impared or entirely deſtroyed.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Such is the hiſtory and progreſs of this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, which adds more to the bills of mortality
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:0306800500:121"/>than almoſt any other, and disfigures the moſt beautiful of our ſpecies.</p>
               <p>Having before ſhewn how ineffectual thoſe remedies are, which are uſually preſcribed for Scrophula, I ſhall ſuggeſt ſome others, reſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from our more extenſive knowledge of the principles of philoſophical Chemiſtry. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is to the labours of thoſe, who have ſo extenſively applied thoſe means which reſult from the cultivation of this branch of natural philoſophy, that medicine owes its rapid ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, and when we reflect upon the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant diſcoveries, which have reſulted to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind from the happy induſtry of the preſent age, we are to look forward with the pleaſing hopes, that the time is not far diſtant when inſtruction concerning the cauſes of the health and diſeaſe will be acknowledged to form a neceſſary part of all rational education; and the nearer w approach to this period, with
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:0306800500:122"/>leſs hazard may the analyſis propoſed by John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, with the plan ſo enlarged, and the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſo ennobled, be executed<note n="*" place="bottom">BEDDOES'S Edition of Brown's Elementinae Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicinae, Vol. I. page 115.</note>.</p>
               <p>If we take a ſurvey of the progreſs of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man knowledge from the earlieſt times to the revival of learning in Europe, we ſhall diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in the mind of man, a ſpirit of inquiry and a zeal for emulation which nothing can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain.

The cleareſt and
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:0306800500:123"/>moſt doubtful, the moſt reaſonable and the moſt abſurd propoſitions meet equally with their aſſent, provided they have been handed down from remote ages of antiquity or have obtained a currency in the world<note n="*" place="bottom">Vide BROWN'S Eſſays on Dogmatiſm and Scepticiſm.</note>—With them an opinion once adopted muſt never be changed, and every opinion muſt be adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which has been eſtabliſhed by preſcription, and is hung round with awful and ſacred trap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings—with a view to avoid this unmanly and pernicious exceſs, other run directly into the oppoſite: They object to the plaineſt and ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleſt truths, doubt where there is not the leaſt ſhadow of ambiguity, and ſuſpect and even condemn as guilty where there is no fraud; they refuſe to aſſent but upon the ſtricteſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration, overturn every principle upon which juſtice or demonſtration can be built,

Thus while many are ſtraining every nerve to ſanction error and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, under the deceptive appearance of truth and piety, others are equally active and ſedulous in undermining thoſe truths which Philoſophy<note n="‡" place="bottom">I do not mean that Philoſophy which has reared its head in France, which teaches that there is no God, no Providence, which countenances rapine and murder; but that rational Philoſophy with which the writings of Mr. Godwin, Mr. Burke, and other ſuch great charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, abound with—that which teaches us, <q>to do un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all men we would they ſhould do unto us.</q>

               <p>Let us hope that the time is not far diſtant, when the eyes of men will be opened, and they will be able to judge for themſelves and exerciſe their own reaſon, without putting an implicit confidence in others, who will rejoice to ſee error uſurp the throne of truth—when thoſe narrow prejudices which now obſcure their underſtanding will be done away, and they will be ready to confeſs, that upon the
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:0306800500:126"/>only principle on which we can be of eſſential ſervice to our profeſſion is, by accumulating uſeful facts, which are indiſputably much wanted, and in forming juſt and natural de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions from them. In compliance with this precept we ſhall unite the obſerving and rational faculties, and accommodate our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct to that of the bee; for as Lord Bacon ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves in his Nov. Organ. <q>It appears that thoſe who have treated the ſciences were either empirics or rationaliſts. The empirics, like ants, only lay up ſtores and uſe them; the rationaliſts, like ſpiders, ſpin webs out of themſelves; but the bee takes a middle courſe, gathering her matter from the flowers of the field and garden, and digeſting and preparing it by her native powers.</q> That in like manner is the true office and work of Philoſophy, which not truſting too much to the faculties of the mind, does not lay up the matter afforded by rational
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:0306800500:127"/>hiſtory and mechanical experience, entire or unfaſhioned in the memory; but treaſures it, after being firſt elaborated and digeſted in the underſtanding; and therefore we have a good reaſon to hope, from the ſtrict union of the experimental and rational faculty, which have not hitherto been united.</p>
               <p>To return to the ſubject of Scrophula, we find that an acrimony and acidity were long ago ſuſpected to be the proximate cauſe of this diſeaſe—indeed late writers trace the whole train of ſymptoms to a prevailing acid with which children in particular are more af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected than adults. Doctor Ruſſel in his Oeconomia Naturae has undertaken a very uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful work, viz. to give a hiſtory of the changes that happen to the different parts of the ſyſtem through the different ages of life; but unluck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily, when conſidering the alterations of the
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:0306800500:128"/>glands, from the effects of the acid with which as I before ſaid children were particularly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to, he has neglected the conglobate or lymphatic&amp;What he has ſaid reſpecting any of the different ſtages of life, has been the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of a fanciful imagination.</p>
               <p>In infancy, the lymphatic ſyſtem bears a large proportion to the other parts of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. This proportion gradually diminiſhes, as we advance in years. Hence we muſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally conclude that it has a peculiar uſe in children.</p>
               <p>Galen's theory of Scrophula was, that it aroſe from a cold pituitous humour: others attributed it to a redundancy of fluids; and as ſoon as chemiſty was cultivated, it was traced to a prevailing acidity; and this has, with ſome little difference in expreſſion, been embraced
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:0306800500:129"/>by almoſt all writers on the ſubject down to the 18th century.</p>
               <p>The theory of Boerhaave was, that it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended upon a ſpiſſitude and lentor of the flu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ids. Then came to be adopted the doctrine of peculiar acrimony<note n="*" place="bottom">"The ſolidiſts," Doctor Valli, "have declaimed much againſt this doctrine and practice, but even amongſt thoſe who have moſt exerted themſelves in attempting to reform the ſcience of medicine, we find ſeveral who have retained ſome of their ancient prejudices, and talked of acrimony in the blood, in the ſame way as it was ſpoken of in the old ſchool. I cannot avoid comparing theſe Phyſicians to Apoſtates in Religion, who always retain ſome maxim of that in which they were educated. I do not mean to deny the exiſtence of acrimony altogether. Acrimonies exiſt, but they are always in their origin the reſult of a vitiated ſecretion.—Analogy, and a great number of facts and obſervations ſerve as a baſis for this opinion. My Eſſay on Chronic diſeaſes (Saggio ſopra diverſe malattie croniche—edizione di pavia, anno 1792) has this principle for its foundation. Thus I am of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, that in Phthiſis Pulmonalis, the lungs themſelves form an acrimony of a particular kind: that in the rick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets, the blood veſſels, which are intended to nouriſh the bones, ſecrete a menſtruum or ſolvent for that portion which conſtitutes their baſis: that the ſcrophulous acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony is likewiſe prepared by the lymphatic glands. Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor Cullen is of this opinion, although he at firſt ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a peculiar acrimony in the blood; that all the ſcro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phulous affections, ſuch as the Tinaea capitis, eruptions in the ſkin, indolent ſwellings, &amp;c. are the effects of a morbific humour originally elaborated in the lymphatic ſyſtem, provided theſe affections are not hereditary or acquir'd by way of contagion; that other acrimonies which affect the ſkin, have likewiſe their origin in the lymphatic-ſyſtem; that the ſpleen, under certain circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, ſecretes a fluid which attacks the gums, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces ulcers on the ſkin." <bibl>VALLI on Animal Electricity, page 303.</bibl>
                  </note> Doctor Cullen was

                  <pb n="133" facs="tcp:0306800500:131"/>Scrophula, according to Sir Clifton Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tringham, conſiſts not only in a diſeaſed ſtate of the veſſels in the part affected, but alſo in a lentor and acrimony of the fluids which paſs through them. For the cure he adviſes calo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel mel pp<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. taken in ſmall quantities and at pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per intervals with dilutent and ſedative decoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of china-root, ſarſaparilla, ſaſſafras, or guaiacum.</p>
               <p>He directs that mild cathartics ſhould be given at times, and on thoſe days which are free from purging, that the patient ſhould uſe the warm bath or emollient fomentations with friction of the part affected, in order to drive the mercury to the obſtructed veſſels. When theſe remedies have been uſed for ſome time, we are to have recourſe to mineral waters, and in order to prevent a relapſe the Peruvian Bark and ſteel ſhould be taken after the cure is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated.</p>

                  <pb n="134" facs="tcp:0306800500:132"/>Doctor Fordyce (the learned reader on the practice of phyſic in this city) conſiders Scro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phula as an affection of the <hi>mucus membrane,</hi> which in conſequence of matter forming from inflammation, often indeed ſo ſlight, as to be little noticed, part is abſorbed by the next lymphatic-glands, and the diſeaſe then aſſumes its real glandular form.</p>
               <p>Mr. White conſiders a peculiar tenuity of ſurface, or firmneſs of ſkin as the cauſe of ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptibility to the diſeaſe, which is confirmed by the effect that changes of weather have on it. He obſerves that two kinds of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution are diſtinguiſhed by this ſort of ſurface; the firſt is marked by large ſuperficial veins, a paleneſs of countenance, a languor in the eye and what is in general termed a want of vivacity, or conſtitutional torpor. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is diſtinguiſhed by a florid complexion,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:0306800500:133"/>ſkin eaſily varying its appearance on the ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt changes, vivacity of eye, ſprightlineſs of manner, and great irritability and acuteneſs.</p>
               <p>Doctor Neſbit, the next writer after Mr. White <note n="*" place="bottom">It was not till after theſe pages went to the preſs, I had an opportunity of ſeeing <hi>Hamilton on Scrophula,</hi> and I was then obliged to Doctor Hooper, the learned author of the OECONOMY OF PLANTS, for the loan of that very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious work. He coincides with the writers of his day, that Scrophula is an affection of the lymphatic ſyſtem, and is to be cured by tonics and ſea-bathing.</note> offers it as his opinion that Scrophula is a diſeaſe, ariſing from a peculiar morbid ſtate of ſurface, moſt prevalent in the early pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod of life.

<pb n="136" facs="tcp:0306800500:134"/>ulcer being abſorbed by the next lymphatic glands, the peculiar from of the diſeaſe or the lymphatic ſwelling next takes place; and this matter then elaborated in the lymphatic gland, acquires the peculiarity which renders the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge ſcrophulous, or conſtitutes the pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar acrimony of the diſeaſe. This inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the mucus membrane is often ſo ſlight, as hardly to be noticed, and the fucceeding ſwelling of the lymphatic gland is conſidered as the firſt ſymptom of the diſeaſe, and never thought to ariſe from the former cauſe. The affection of the lymphatic gland then, is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly the ſecond ſtage of the malady; and as this matter orginally abſorbed is not ſo acrid as the venereal and others, nor the gland itſelf endued with much ſenſation, the progreſs of the diſeaſe, in it, is for a long time tardy, till it acquires a certain ſize, and affects the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal teguments. When the diſeaſe arrives at its height, and a rupture of the teguments

               <p>All writers agree that it is an affection of the lymphatic ſyſtem, producing laxity of fibre, and univerſal debility: and it is of very little conſequence what the cauſe is capable of ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting this, ſince neceſſity points out the plan of treatment, that of giving tone to the fibre and reſtoring the general health of the patient<note n="*" place="bottom">The Rev.

When uſed as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy for diſeaſe, it is always exhibited in form of a calx. Chemiſtry teaches us that metals are formed into calces by combination with oxygene, or the principle of acidity, termed alſo pure or vital-air, which enters in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of about a fourth part into the compoſition of our atmoſphere. This ſpecies of gas is known to be a very active agent in many proceſſes in the animal oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy; it is that part of the air, which eſſentially main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains combuſtion, and which, taken into the lungs, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports life; it imparts the florid colour to arterial blood, and is by ſome ſuppoſed to be the principle of irritability itſelf. With oxygene mercury eaſily combines, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily ſeparates from it: or in other words is eaſily calcin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: but not retaining the oxygene very firmly, is readily reſtored to its metallic form.</note> which

I have proved," adds he, "by ſuch arguments as I do not for a moment heſitate to aſſert are abſolutely concluſive, whatever therefore may be the fate of my own Theory, theirs to a certainty are falſe." (Peart's Phyſiology).—To avoid the inconſiſtencies of their Predeceſſors, they have run themſelves into greater and have been obliged to attribute new and unknown properties to matter. Thus inſtead of ſolving the Gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian knot, they have raſhly cut it aſunder, and have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved the ſubject in greater obſcurity than ever—ſuch men may have ſacrificed more than hecatombs, and may have laboured for many years in the inveſtigation of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiological enquiries, and all the time have been arguing and writing on principles ſpecifically erroneous, a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbed imagination, and with ſtrong prejudices—their opinions then are very far from being entitled to reſpect or attention.—I will not ſay that theſe are the men; but the peremptorineſs of their language, their dogma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical mode of argument, the haughty complacence with which they ſpeak of themſelves, and the uncharitable and unmanly cenſures which they paſs upon others, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>dead</hi> or <hi>living,</hi> render their opinions to me of little value, and their aſſertions of no authority. It might not in this place be amiſs, to inform theſe philoſophers of a truth they do not either comprehend or diſbelieve, that where the quantity of oxygene in organized bodies is diminiſhed, there is alſo a diminution of irritability, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citability, or ſenſorial power, and that this irritability is again reſtored by the reſtoration of the oxygenous prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple. The irritability thus ſupplied to the body through the medium of the lungs, is continually waſted by muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular exertion, and the action of different ſtimuli— <hi>Magna veritas eſt, et prevalabit!</hi>
                  </note>, a fact of which there does not remain a doubt in my mind; and as it has been before ſhewn that in ſcrophula under all its ſhapes and modifications, there
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:0306800500:141"/>is a deficiency of this principle, the principle of life; is it therefore not wonderful, from this inference reſpecting its qualities (mercury) that means of a ſimilar nature, ſuch as the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halation

               <p>Cicuta has been a very faſhionable medicine with phyſicians in this complaint. Like new cloaths it has its admirers for a time. I have given it to ſeveral patients and never found it do any good. I believe myſelf that it never did any good in any one complaint. The hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of this article exhibits to us a curious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of neglect and inattention to the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances accompanying its exhibition; as we have demonſtrable proofs of its being ſolely

In other hands it has failed of its boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed virtue, nor have I in five caſes in which I have given it, ſeen any good derived from it.</p>
               <p>Doctor Ruſſel ſent his patients to the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, and ordered them to rub their glandular ſwellings with the alga marina; a <hi>cabbage

               <p>Doctor Cullen and the late Doctor Fother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gill both gave Cicuta, but never without join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mercury with it, upon which its ſucceſs principally depended. Doctor Cullen chiefly recommends the chalybeate waters, cold-bath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, cicuta, and common water in prefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to ſea ſalt-water. He condemns the cinchona, and ſpeaks in ſtrong terms of exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, friction, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>In reſpect to ſalt-water, I never ſaw it do any good in this complaint; on the contrary I think with Doctor Neſbit, that by carrying it too far, the ſyſtem has been weakened by the diſcharge it has produced, and the diſeaſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther aggravated than relieved. Doctor Buchan ſays <q>that ſea-water ſhould be only given in
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:0306800500:145"/>groſs habits, and then only with a view of its acting as a purgative.</q> Like many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies it poſſeſſes for ſome time an undeſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed reputation; and if it ever does ſervice it muſt rather be as a preventive, than when the diſeaſe is formed.</p>
               <p>Steel medicines have been univerſally given and with ſucceſs; this muſt be attributed to ſomething more beſides their tonic powers. "Chalybeates," ſays the ingenious author of the Guide to Health, Vol. II. <q>have certainly a two-fold effect, for as the natural vehicle of oxygene, and the conſtituent principle of red blood, they ſtrengthen the digeſtive organs, and excite the abſorbents.

By ſtrengthening the ſolids, and promoting a free perſpiration, it gives livelineſs, warmth, and vigour to the conſtitution, and nature ſeems to have pointed out this remedy, both to the ancient, and new world. Virgil in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms us, that it was a cuſtom in Italy, long before the Roman times, to dip perſons af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted with Scrophula in the cold ſtreams:
<q>
                     <l>Durum aſtirpe genus, Natos ad flumina primum,</l>
                     <l>Deferimus, ſaevoque gelu duramus et undis.</l>
                     <bibl>AEN. Lib. 9. lin. 63.</bibl>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>On the ſubject of diet I have before ſpoken, but here I muſt again obſerve that the moſt nutritious food ſhould be allowed children who ſhew a tendency to Scrophula; but at the ſame time, they ſhould not be allowed to gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandize. Repletion carried too far in any diſeaſe, is as bad as inanition. When their appetites have been imprudently indulged, an emetic ſhould be given; for independent
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:0306800500:153"/>of its clearing the ſtomach, it will have a good effect on the conſtitution. The wiſe ſon of Sirach confirms this precept and ſays, <q>If thou haſt been forced to eat, go forth and vomit, and thou ſhalt have reſt.</q> Ecclus. chap. xxxi. ver. 21; and moſt certain it is, that hundreds have loſt their lives, and thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands have ſuffered ſickneſs and pain, from their ignorance or neglect of this rule.</p>
               <p>Both Hippocrates and Celſus give it as their opinion, that men ſhould ſometimes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge themſelves at feaſts <note n="*" place="bottom">Great diſputes have ariſen, ſays the learned Doctor Mackenzie concerning this rule of Celſus: his words are, "modo plus juſto, modo non amplius aſſumere." Some approve of the full latitude he gives, others highly blame it. Lord Verulam thinks, that exceſs in eating and drinking ſhould now and then be indulged. "Epulae profuſae porpotationes non omnio inhibendae ſunt." Hiſt. Vitae et Mort. page 341. Melchior Sebizius, on the other hand affirms, that by this advice Celſus gives full ſcope to intemperance, and ſets himſelf up for a patron of gluttons and drunkards.—"Quibus verbis comedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num, bibonum, helluonum, patronum agere videtur: et latam quoad aiunt, feneſtram, aſotiae et confuſioni aperire: nam ſi quod dicit verum eſt, videntur ſane re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulae Hygieines inverti, quae opportunum tempus, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centem quantitatem, et debitam qualitatem requirunt.

                     <q>And Sanctorius ſays, that it is not ſafe for all healthy perſons to obſerve this rule "Celſi ſententia non eſt omnibus tuta." <bibl>Sec. 3. Aph. 42.</bibl>

               <p>Salt meats ſhould be forbidden where there is the leaſt diſpoſition to enlarged glands; and perſons in years who lead lives of drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs <note n="*" place="bottom">Hard drinking, excluſive of war, peſtilence, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, thoſe dreadful ſcourges of nations, is perhaps the moſt deadly and inſidious foe that ever infeſted this country. For this evil ſpirit, like a deſtroying angel, ſtalks through the land with a ſteady though ſilent ſtep, every where ſpreading its baneful influence over our ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and villages, particularly among our poor infatuated ſoldiers, ſailors, manufacturers and day-labourers. Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, ſays the juſtly celebrated L'Abbé Raynal (Hiſt. of the Eaſt and Weſt Indies) one of the moſt conſpicuous characters in the commencement of the French revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, were the gift the moſt fatal the old world ever made to the new.—It was ſoon obſerved, that it diſturbed their domeſtic peace, deprived them of their judgment, and made them furious.—In vain did ſome worthy French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men expoſtulate with them, and endeavoured to make them aſhamed of thoſe exceſſes. "It is you," anſwered they, <q>who have taught us to drink this liquor, and we cannot do without it; you have done the miſchief, and it admits of no remedy.</q>

               <p>It is conjectured by ſome writers, that large draughts of cold water bring on a torpid ſtate of the lymphatics; and hence it has been deem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:0306800500:156"/>prejudicial as common drink for children. Hudibras, who was no bad Phyſician ſays,

                     <l>Water's by far the beſt I think.</l>
                     <l>But then its qualities ſhould be,</l>

                     <l>Dulcis et exigui pondus et gelida:</l>

               <p>Aretaeus, alſo a Phyſician of the firſt rank among the ancients, commends wine no leſs than for the cures which it performs. I ſhall cite his own words from the elegant latin verſion of the learmed Doctor Wiggan. De morb. acut. curat. Lib. i. Cap. I. <q>Sed quum metus

               <head>SECTION IX. LUMBAR-ABSCESS.</head>
               <p>THE lumbar-abceſs moſt commonly is ſeated in the lumbar or the ſacral lymphati glands, and always in a ſcrophulous conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Eight caſes have fallen under my obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, all of which were in ſcrophulous ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. After the matter is formed, it deſcends, and preſents itſelf, below Poupart's ligament, in the form of a tumour, along the courſe of the crural veſſels. It not unfrequently hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, that it makes its appearance in the form of a tenſe tumour under the glutaei muſcles, and from this ſituation of the diſeaſe we are to apprehend a fatal termination. Every oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity I have had of inſpecting the bodies of
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:0306800500:162"/>who have died of lumbar-abſceſs, confirms me in an opinion I have long held, that the whole thoracic viſcera are diſeaſed in common with the ſacro-lymphatic-glands.</p>
               <p>I opened the body of a man laſt winter, who had lingered out nearly two years with this melancholy diſeaſe. The lungs were full of tubercles, the liver was ſchirrus; the air-ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicles were attached to the edge of the lungs.</p>
               <p>Mr. Abernethy, the ingenious lecturer on anatomy and ſurgery at St. Bartholemew's Hoſpital, has recommended a new mode of treatment, by gradually evacuating the matter. This practice has been adopted all over Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, with various ſucceſs. Scrophulous ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſceſſes ſhould be treated juſt in the ſame way<note n="*" place="bottom">The opening of ſcrophulous abſceſſes in general when attended with circumſcribed hardneſs has been found to be productive of harm: for theſe require, after artificial opening, a longer time to recover than when they are permitted to burſt of themſelves: but an aper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is indiſpenſibly neceſſary in thoſe collections of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which cannot be diſcuſſed and are attended with no ſurrounding hardneſs—for here if the matter be not let out, it will often diffuſe itſelf into the cellular membrane, and cauſe a number of extenſive ſinuſes.</note>.
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:0306800500:163"/>When hectic fever has much haraſſed the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, I have found a decoction of the Lichen-Iſlandicus of ſervice. For a more particular account of this diſeaſe I muſt refer my readers to Hamilton on Scrophulous affections, and Abernethy's Surgical and Phyſiological Eſſays, Vol. I.</p>
               <p>Indulging the perſuaſion, that I have traced an outline of a new branch of the Materia Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dica, I ſubmit theſe obſervations to the public eye; and in the words of Seneca ſhall for the preſent take leave of the ſubject, claiming it as a piece of juſtice at the hands of mankind,
