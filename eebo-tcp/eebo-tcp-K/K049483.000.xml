            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IF thoſe Cares in which the Service of a Great QUEEN, and the Love of Your Country, have ſo juſtly Engag'd Your Lordſhip, would allow any Leiſure to run back and remember thoſe Arts and Studies, which were once the Grace and Entertainment of
<pb facs="tcp:0048202100:4"/>
Your Lordſhip's Youth; I have Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption enough to hope, that this Tragedy may, ſome Time or other, find an Hour to Divert Your Lordſhip. Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, which was ſo venerable to former Ages, as in many Places to make a Part of their Religious Worſhip, and every where to be had in the higheſt Honour and Eſteem, has miſerably languiſh'd and been deſpis'd, for want of that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and Protection which it found in the Famous <hi>Auguſtan</hi> Age. Since then, it may be aſſerted, without any Partiali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the Preſent Time, it never had a fairer Proſpect of lifting up its Head, and returning to its former Reputation, than now: And the beſt Reaſon can be given for it, is, that it ſeems to have a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Hope from, and Dependance upon Your Lordſhip, and to expect all juſt Encouragement, when thoſe Great Men, who have the Power to Protect it, have ſo Delicate and Polite a Taſte and Underſtanding of its True Value. The Reſtoring and Preſerving any Part of Learning is ſo Generous an Action in it
<pb facs="tcp:0048202100:5"/>
ſelf, that it naturally falls into Your Lordſhip's Province, ſince every Thing that may ſerve to Improve the Mind, has a Right to the Patronage of ſo Great and Univerſal a Genius for Knowledge as Your Lordſhip's. It is indeed a Piece of good Fortune, upon which I cannot help Congratulating the preſent Age, that there is ſo Great a Man, at a Time when there is ſo great an Occaſion for him. The Diviſions which Your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip has heal'd, the Temper which You have reſtor'd to our Councils, and that indefatigable Care and Diligence which You have us'd in preſerving our Peace at Home, are Benefits ſo virtuouſly and ſo ſeaſonably conferr'd upon Your Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, as ſhall draw the Praiſes of all Wiſe Men, and the Bleſſings of all Good Men upon Your Lordſhip's Name. And when thoſe unreaſonable Feuds and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimoſities, which keep Faction alive, ſhall be bury'd in ſilence and forgotten, that great Publick Good ſhall be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally acknowledg'd, as the Happy Effect of Your Lordſhip's moſt Equal
<pb facs="tcp:0048202100:6"/>
Temper and Right Underſtanding. That this Glorious End may very ſuddenly ſucceed to Your Lordſhip's Candor and Generous Endeavours after it, muſt be the Wiſh of every good <hi>Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</hi>
