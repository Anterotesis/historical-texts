            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <l>LAſt of the months, ſevereſt of them all,</l>
            <l>Woe to the regions where thy terrors fall!</l>
            <l>Hail to thy tempeſts, which the deep deform,</l>

            <l>Let earth and ocean feel thy potent ſway,</l>
            <l>And give thy blaſts their full impetuous way:</l>
            <l>For lo! the fiery horſes of the ſun</l>
            <l>Thro' the twelve Signs their rapid courſe have run,</l>
            <l>Time, like a ſerpent, bites his forked tail,</l>
            <l>And Winter on a Goat beſtrides the gale;</l>
            <l>Rough blows the north wind near Arcturus' ſtar,</l>

            <l>Thy flooding deluge, and thy drenching ſhower;</l>
            <l>Yes—we acknowledge what thy proweſs can,</l>

            <l>Oft tinctur'd with the blueſt tranſmarine,</l>

            <l>Stains the bright luſtre with an inky hue;</l>
            <l>Then a black wreck of clouds is ſeen to fly,</l>

            <l>Like Myra's face appears the vivid ſcene,</l>

            <head type="sub">A POEM INSCRIBED TO THE RIGHT HON. THE EARL OF RADNOR.</head>

            <lg>
               <l>THE deeds of diſcord, or in proſe or rhyme,</l>
               <l>Let others tell. 'Tis mine (the better theme)</l>
               <l>Concord to ſing; and thus begins the ſong:</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Congenial things to things congenial tend:</l>
               <l>So rivulets their little waters join</l>
               <l>To form one river's greater ſtream: ſo haſte</l>
               <l>The rivers, from their different climes, to meet,</l>
               <l>And kindly mix, in the vaſt ocean's bed:</l>
               <l>So earth to earth down goes; and upwards ſlies</l>
               <l>To fires etherial, each terreſtrial blaze,</l>
               <l>Such elemental Concord.—Yet not here</l>
               <l>Confin'd the ſacred ſympathy, but wide</l>
               <l>Thro' plant and animal diffuſely ſpread.</l>
               <l>How many myriads of the graſſy blade</l>
               <l>Aſſemble, to create one verdant plain?</l>
               <l>How many cedars towering heights conſpire,</l>
               <l>Thy tops, O cloud-capt Lebanon! to deck?</l>
               <l>Life-animal ſtill more conſpicuous gives</l>

               <l>We trace, aſcending from th' ignoble ſwarms</l>
               <l>Of inſects, up to flocks and grazing herds;</l>
               <l>Thence to the polities of bees and ants,</l>
               <l>And honeſt beavers, bound by friendly league</l>
               <l>Of mutual help and intereſt.—Cruel man!</l>
               <l>For love of gain, to perſecute, to kill,</l>
               <l>This gentle, ſocial, and ingenious race,</l>
               <l>That never did you wrong.—But ſtop, my Muſe,</l>
               <l>Stop thy ſad ſong, nor deviate to recount</l>
               <l>Man's more inhuman deeds; for man too feels</l>
               <l>Benign affection, nor dares diſobey,</l>
               <l>Tho' oft reluctant, Nature's mighty voice,</l>
               <l>That ſummons all to harmony and love.</l>
               <l>Elſe would to Nature's Author foul impute</l>
               <l>Of negligence accrue, while baſer things</l>
               <l>He knits in holy friendſhip, thus to leave</l>
               <l>His chief and laſt work void of ſweet attract,</l>
               <l>And tendence to its fellow. But not ſo,</l>
               <l>Not ſo, if truly ſings the heaven-born Muſe:</l>
               <l>And ſhe can tell; for ſhe the limpid fount</l>
               <l>Of truth approaches; rumours only reach</l>
               <l>Our earth-born ears. Then mark her tale divine.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Ere yet creation was, ere ſun and moon</l>
               <l>And ſtars bedeck'd the ſplendid vault of heaven,</l>
               <l>Was God; and God was Mind; and Mind was Beauty,</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:0579800312:57"/>And Truth, and Form, and Order: For all theſe</l>
               <l>In Mind's profound receſs, and union pure</l>
               <l>Together dwelt, involv'd, inexplicate.</l>
               <l>Then matter (if then matter was) devoid,</l>
               <l>Formleſs, indefinite, and paſſive lay;</l>
               <l>Myſterious Being, in one inſtant found,</l>
               <l>Nor any thing, nor nothing; but at once</l>
               <l>Both all and none; none by privation, all</l>
               <l>By vaſt capacity, and pregnant power.</l>
               <l>This paſſive nature th' active Almighty Mind</l>
               <l>Deeming fit ſubject for his art, at once</l>
               <l>Expell'd privation, and pour'd forth himſelf;</l>
               <l>Himſelf pour'd forth thro' all the mighty maſs</l>
               <l>Of matter, now firſt bounded. Then was beauty</l>
               <l>And truth, and form, and order, all evolv'd,</l>
               <l>Was open'd all, that lay enwrapp'd and hid</l>
               <l>In the great mind of Godhead. Forth it went,</l>
               <l>Forth went the pure quinteſſence far and wide</l>
               <l>Thro' the vaſt whole; nor did its force not feel</l>
               <l>The laſt of minim atoms. So (great things</l>
               <l>It we compare with ſmall) in ſable cloud</l>
               <l>Invelop'd, lies the lightning: mortal men</l>
               <l>Look up, and dread th' event: When, lo! illum'd</l>
               <l>All in a moment, the ſmall nitrous ſeeds</l>
               <l>Expanding, fill heaven's mighty vault, and quick</l>
               <l>From pole to pole the fiery terror flies.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Thus Mind thro' all things paſs'd, eſſence and worth</l>

                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:0579800312:58"/>Giving and limiting to each in bounds</l>
               <l>Proportion'd to its kind. To clods and ſtones</l>
               <l>It gave coheſion; to things vegetant</l>
               <l>Nutrition, and the power of growth; to brutes,</l>
               <l>Senſe, appetite, and motion: but to man</l>
               <l>All theſe it gave, and join'd to theſe the grace,</l>
               <l>The choſen grace, of reaſon, beam divine!</l>
               <l>Hence man, allied to all, in all things meets</l>
               <l>Congenial being, effluence of mind.</l>
               <l>And as the tuneful ſtring ſpontaneous ſounds</l>
               <l>The anſwer to his kindred note; ſo he</l>
               <l>The ſecret harmony within him feels,</l>
               <l>When aught of beauty offers. This the joy,</l>
               <l>While verdant plains and grazing herbs we view,</l>
               <l>Or ocean's mighty vaſtneſs; or the ſtars,</l>
               <l>In midnight ſilence as along they roll.</l>
               <l>Hence to the rapture, while th' harmonious bard</l>
               <l>Attunes his vocal ſong; and hence the joy,</l>
               <l>While what the ſculptor graves, the painter paints,</l>
               <l>And all the pleaſing mimickries of art</l>

               <l>He feels affection melt the ſocial heart;</l>
               <l>Feels friendſhip, love, and all the charities</l>

               <l>When Rome her laſt of heroes loſt (e'er ſince</l>

               <l>When Brutus, urg'd by faction, and a mob</l>
               <l>For baſeſt ſervitude now ripen'd, ſled</l>
               <l>From Latian ſoil, then, to attend her lord,</l>

               <l>" Thy mighty ſire's remembrance. His firm deeds</l>

               <l>" Fortunate virtue; ſhould we fail, 'tis ſtill,</l>
               <l>" Still, Portia, virtue: think on that; then turn</l>
               <l>" Thy mental eye to every worſt event:</l>
               <l>" And, by premeditating, learn to bear</l>

               <l>Yet he forgives—forgives? yet ſtill he loves,</l>
               <l>Loves thee, that thou forgetteſt all he ſaid;</l>
               <l>For well he knows the cauſe: 'twas faithful love,</l>

            <l>MIndleſs of fate, in theſe low vile abodes,</l>
            <l>Tyrants have oft uſurp'd the ſtyle of Gods:</l>
            <l>But that the Mortal may be thought Divine,</l>
            <l>The Herald ſtrait new-modell'd all his line;</l>
            <l>And venal Prieſt, with well-diſſembled lye,</l>

            <l>Not ſo great Saturn's ſon, imperial Jove,</l>
            <l>He reigns, unqueſtion'd, in his realms above;</l>
            <l>No title from deſcent he need infer,</l>
            <l>His red right arm proclaims the Thunderer.</l>
            <l>This, Campbell, be thy pride, illuſtrious Peer,</l>

               <l>FRiendſhip, how ſweet! how comely doſt thou ſeem!</l>
               <l>But art thou aught indeed, beſides a dream?</l>
               <l>A pleaſing dream, where mines of wealth we own;</l>
               <l>But, by diſtreſs awak'd, we find our comfort flown:</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Yet have I read amongſt the poets tales</l>
               <l>What mighty things have been by friendſhip done;</l>

               <l>Etherial flame, purg'd from each groſſer fire,</l>
               <l>Their boſoms throb'd with the ſame joys and woes,</l>

            <byline>BY MR. W.</byline>
            <lg>
               <l>O Night, dark Night! wrapt round with Stygian gloom,</l>
               <l>Thy riding-hood opaque! wove by the hands</l>
               <l>Of Clotho and of Atropos:—Thoſe hands</l>
               <l>That ſpin my thread of life,—how near its end!</l>
               <l>Ah wherefore, ſilent Goddeſs, ſhould'ſt thou thus</l>
               <l>Awake my terrors? ſilence ſounds alarms</l>
               <l>To me, and darkneſs dazzles my weak mind.</l>
               <l>Hark!—'tis the death-watch!—poſts themſelves can ſpeak</l>
               <l>Death's language!—ſtop, O ſtop, inſatiate worm,</l>
               <l>I feel thy ſummons; to my fellow-worms</l>
               <l>Thou bidſt me haſten!—I obey thy call;—</l>
               <l>For wherefore ſhould I live?—vain life to me</l>
               <l>Is but a tatter'd garment, a patch'd rag,</l>
               <l>That ill defends us from the cold of age.</l>
               <l>Cramp'd are my faculties, my eyes grow dim,</l>
               <l>No muſic charms my ear, no meats my taſte;</l>
               <l>The females fly me, and my very wife—</l>
               <l>Poor woman!—knows me not.—</l>
               <l>Ye flattering, idle vanities of life,</l>
               <l>Where are ye flown? the birds, that us'd to ſing</l>
               <l>Amidſt my ſpreading branches, now forſake</l>
               <l>This leafleſs trunk, and find no ſhelter there,</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="103" facs="tcp:0579800312:105"/>What's life?—what's death? thus coveted and fear'd?—</l>
               <l>Life is a fleeting ſhadow—death's no more:—</l>
               <l>Death's a dark lantern; life a candle's end,</l>
               <l>Stuck on a ſave-all, ſoon to end in ſtench—</l>
               <l>Foh! death's a privy; life the alley green,</l>
               <l>That leads to't; where, perchance, from either ſide</l>
               <l>A ſweet briar hedge, or ſhrubs of broader leaf,</l>
               <l>And more commodious, breathe their treacherous ſweets.</l>
               <l>Death follows life, and ſtops it ere it reach</l>
               <l>The topmoſt ſpoke of Fortune's envied wheel!—</l>
               <l>Wheel!—life's a wheel, and each man is the aſs,</l>
               <l>That turns it; oft receiving in the end</l>
               <l>But water and rank thiſtles for his pains.</l>
               <l>And yet, Lorenzo, if conſider'd right,</l>
               <l>A life of labour is a life of eaſe!</l>
               <l>Pain is true joy, and want is luxury!</l>
               <l>Vain mirth's an opera tune, a tortur'd ſigh,</l>
               <l>The breath of eunuchs; it diſmembers bliſs,</l>
               <l>Makes man not man, and caſtrates real joy.</l>
               <l>Would you be merry?—ſeek ſome charnel-houſe</l>
               <l>Where death inhabits, give a ball to death,</l>
               <l>A dooms-day ball, and lead up Holben's dance.</l>
               <l>How weak? how ſtrong? how gentle? how ſevere</l>
               <l>Are Laughter's chains, that gall a willing world!</l>
               <l>The noiſy Idiot ſhakes her bells at all,</l>
               <l>Not e'en the Bible, or the Night-Thoughts 'ſcape—</l>
               <l>Fools ſpare not Heaven itſelf, O Y—! nor thee.</l>

            <head>SOME ACCOUNT OF THE LIFE AND WRITINGS OF MR. WILLIAM COLLINS.</head>
            <p>MR. William Collins was born at Chicheſter in Suſſex, in the year 1721: in which city his father was a reputable tradeſman. He was admitted a ſcholar of Wincheſter college, Feb. 23, 1733. where he ſpent ſeven years under the care of the learned Dr. Burton. In the year 1740, in conſideration of his merit, he was placed firſt in the liſt of thoſe ſcholars who are elected from Wincheſter college to New college in Oxford: but no vacancy happening at the latter, he was entered, the ſame year, a commoner of Queen's college, Ox. and July 29, 1741. was elected a demy, or ſcholar, of Magdalen college in the ſame univerſity. At ſchool he began to ſtudy poetry and criticiſm, particularly the latter. The fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing epigram, made by him while at Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter-ſchool, diſcovers a genius, and turn of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, very rarely to be met with in juvenile compoſitions.</p>

               <l>CEaſe, fair Aurelia, ceaſe to mourn;</l>

            <p>His Latin exerciſes were never ſo much admired as his Engliſh.—At Oxford he wrote the epiſtle to Sir Thomas Hanmer, and Oriental eclogues, which were firſt publiſhed in 1742, under the title of Perſian eclogues. About the year 1743, he left Oxford, having taken the degree of bachelor of arts, weary of the confinement and uniformity of an academical life; fondly imagining that a man of parts was ſure of making his fortune in London; and ſtruck with the name of author and poet, without conſulting his friends, he imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately removed to town, and raſhly reſolved to
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:0579800312:111"/>
live by his pen, without undertaking the drudgery of any profeſſion. Here he ſoon diſſipated his ſmall fortune, to compenſate for which, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected the hiſtory of the revival of learning in Italy, under the pontificates of Julius II. and Leo X. His ſubſcription for this work not anſwering his expectations, he engaged with a bookſeller, to tranſlate Ariſtotle's Poetics, and to illuſtrate it with a large and regular comment. This ſcheme alſo being laid aſide, he turn'd his thoughts to dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic poetry, and being intimately acquainted with the manager, reſolved to write a tragedy, which however he never executed. In the year 1746 he publiſhed his odes; and ſhortly after went abroad to our army in Flanders, to attend his uncle, colonel Martin, who, dying ſoon after his arrival, left him a conſiderable fortune; which however he did not live long to enjoy, for he fell into a nervous diſorder, which continued, with but ſhort intervals, till his death, which happened in 1756. and with which diſorder his head and intellects were at times affected.</p>
            <p>For a man of ſuch an elevated genius, Mr. Collins has wrote but little: his time was chiefly taken up in laying extenſive projects, and vaſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, which he never even begun to put in execution.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="110" facs="tcp:0579800312:112"/>We have been favoured with the following ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of Mr. Collins by a gentleman, deſervedly eminent in the republic of letters, who knew him intimately well.</p>
            <p>Mr. Collins was a man of extenſive literature, and of vigorous faculties. He was acquainted not only with the learned tongues, but with the Italian, French, and Spaniſh languages. He had employed his mind chiefly upon works of fiction, and ſubjects of fancy; and, by indulging ſome peculiar habits of thought, was eminently delighted with thoſe flights of imagination which paſs the bounds of nature, and to which the mind is reconciled only by a paſſive acquieſcence in popular traditions. He loved fairies, genii, giants, and monſters; he delighted to rove through the meanders of inchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to gaze on the magnificence of golden pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laces, to repoſe by the waterfals of Elyſian gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens. This was however the character rather of his inclination than his genius, the grandeur of wildneſs, and the novelty of extravagance, were always deſired by him, but were not always at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. But diligence is never wholly loſt: if his efforts ſometimes cauſed harſhneſs and obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, they likewiſe produced in happier moments ſublimity and ſplendour. This idea, which he had formed of excellence, led him to oriental fictions, and allegorical imagery; and, perhaps,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:0579800312:113"/>
while he was intent upon deſcription, he did not ſufficiently cultivate ſentiment: his poems are the productions of a mind not deficient in fire, nor unfurniſhed with knowledge either of books or life, but ſomewhat obſtructed in its progreſs, by deviation in queſt of miſtaken beauties.</p>
            <p>His morals were pure, and his opinions pious. In a long continuance of poverty, and long habits of diſſipation, it cannot be expected that any cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter ſhould be exactly uniform. There is a degree of want by which the freedom of agency is almoſt deſtroyed, and long aſſociation with for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuitous companions will at laſt relax the ſtrictneſs of truth, and abate the fervour of ſincerity. That this man, wiſe and virtuous as he was, paſſed always unentangled through the ſnares of life, it would be prejudice and temerity to affirm. But it may be ſaid, that at leaſt he preſerved the ſource of action unpolluted, that his principles were never ſhaken, that his diſtinctions of right and wrong were never confounded, and that his faults had nothing of malignity or deſign, but proceeded from ſome unexpected preſſure, or caſual temptation.</p>
            <p>The latter part of his life cannot be remembred but with pity and ſadneſs. He languiſhed ſome years under that depreſſion of mind which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chains the faculties without deſtroying them,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:0579800312:114"/>
and leaves reaſon the knowledge of right, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the power of purſuing it. Theſe clouds, which he found gathering on his intellects, he endeavoured to diſperſe by travel, and paſſed into France, but found himſelf conſtrained to yield to his malady, and returned: he was for ſome time confined in a houſe of lunatics, and afterwards retired to the care of his ſiſter in Colcheſter, where death at laſt came to his relief.</p>
            <p>After his return from France, the writer of this character paid him a viſit at Islington, where he was waiting for his ſiſter, whom he had directed to meet him: there was then nothing of diſorder diſcernable in his mind by any but himſelf, but he had then withdrawn from ſtudy, and travelled with no other book than an Engliſh teſtament, ſuch as children carry to the ſchool; when his friend took it into his hand, out of curioſity to ſee what companion a man of letters had choſen, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"I have but one book," ſays Collins, "but that is the beſt."</q>
