            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

After the offering to Diana, a dance of female Trojans takes place, which is interrupted by the arrival of a meſſenger from Caſſandra, who wiſhes to come from her place of confinement <hi>(detained there as a lunatic)</hi> to expound a prophecy. Paris, after ſome deliberation, complies with the requeſt: the meſſenger retires, and, ſoon after, returns with Caſſandra, who deplores her ſituation, in conſequence of being treated as one deranged in mind: ſhe informs Paris of the approaching danger of Troy. Paris, the Prieſts, Prieſteſſes, &amp;c. ſhew every mark of diſbelief, which enrages, Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſandra, who, ſeizing her wand from her attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, invokes the Gods: informs Paris that ſhe has the power to perform a miracle, and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines that inſtant to put it to the teſt, then leave him to judge of the truth of her prophecy. Caſſandra ſtrikes the figures of the Gods, which change from gold to black marble.</p>
               <p>Paris and the reſt are ſeized with horror! The actions diſplayed by the various groups, expreſſive of fear, hope, and revenge, forms the moſt lively and intereſting picture of the various paſſions that agitate the human breaſt, which it is poſſible to convey through the medium of ſcenic effect.</p>

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0214001400:13"/>and while the unſuſpecting Trojans are buried in wine and ſleep, Ulyſſes and his party ſeize the gates of the city, let in the covering army, who enter with ſhouts, that ſeem to rend the ſkies; breaking open houſes, putting all to the ſword, without ſparing age or ſex; the confuſion becomes general; palaces and other magnificent buildings fall a ſacrifice to the fury of the flames.</p>
               <p>Helen is diſcovered in a tower, ſurrounded with fire, and no mode of eſcaping inevitable death.</p>
               <p>The dreadful claſhing of ſwords and ſhields, together with the conqueſt and deſtruction of Troy, terminate this grand ſpectacle; of which diſmal cataſtrophe, the poet gives the following emphatical deſcription:—

            <head>REMARKS.</head>
            <p>PERHAPS no ſubject ever afforded a greater ſcope for the painter's pencil, or the inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity of the machiniſt, in point of ſtage-effect, than the Famous SIEGE of TROY; nor has the compoſer had a leſs field for his muſical abilities. It will be ſeen, that the performers in general have each their ſhare of buſineſs in this ſplendid and heroic ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacle, and are not wanting in pantomimic action, to convey a proper idea of the nature of the ſiege, as well as the credulity of the beſieged, in admitting within their walls the grand Trojan War Horſe, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained five hundred Grecian ſoldiers, properly equipped for battle, &amp;c. within its body.</p>
            <p>☞ The pantomime will be given every evening till further notice.</p>
