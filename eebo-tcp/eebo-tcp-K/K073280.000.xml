            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Tribute of Duty, offer'd from a thankful Heart to a gracious Benefactreſs. Your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty has indeed the ſame Right to them, as You have to the Fruits of a Tree, which You have tranſplanted out of a barren Soil into a fertile and beautiful Garden. It was Your Generoſity which brought me out of Obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and ſtill condeſcends to protect me; like the Supreme Being, who continually ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports the meaneſt Creature, which his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs has produc'd.</p>
            <p>I have Room here to expatiate upon a very inviting Subject; but Your Majeſty has nobly prevented all Panegyric, even from the beſt Pens, by building Your <hi>Fame</hi> on a much more laſting Baſis, than that of <hi>Praiſe</hi> in <hi>Dedications.</hi> Your Encouragements of <hi>Arts</hi> and <hi>Sciences,</hi> Your Eſteem and Friendſhip for all Defenders of Truth, while they are living,

            <p>MAY Heaven long preſerve Your Majeſty to practiſe all theſe Virtues, to be a perpetual Source of Comfort and Joy to our glorious Monarch, a Bleſſing to the Nation, and a noble Pattern of Beneficence and Generoſity to future Queens. Your Majeſty's great Goodneſs to myſelf draws this Prayer from a Heart fill'd with Gratitude. As there is ſo

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>HAT I propoſe in this Preface, is only to beſpeak the Reader's Good-nature, and to ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which may incline him to pardon what he cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend. I have indeed but a poor Defence to make for the Things I have wrote: I don't think them good, and better Judges will doubtleſs think worſe of them than I do. Only this, I believe, I may ſay of them, That, if they have nothing to delight thoſe who may
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:0383800900:7"/>
chance to read them, they have nothing to give Modeſty a Bluſh; if nothing to entertain and improve the Mind, they have nothing to debauch and corrupt it.</p>
            <p>ANOTHER Motive, that I hope may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the Reader to overlook the Defects in this Volume, is, That the oldeſt Poem in it is little more than ſix Years of Age; and a conſiderable Part of the Time ſince that was writ, has been ſpent in endeavouring to learn a Language, of which I was then intirely ignorant; tho' I fear, the few Attempts I have made in Tranſlations, will too well convince the Public, to how little Purpoſe I have employ'd my Time. I confeſs myſelf guilty of a great Preſumption in publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Imitations of <hi>HORACE,</hi> when many eminent Hands have done it much better before me: But when I was only endeavouring to underſtand him, I found it difficult to conquer a Temptation I had to imitate ſome of his Thoughts, which mightily pleas'd me. If I may be forgiven this Experiment, I promiſe to trouble the World with nothing of this Nature again, at leaſt, till I may be able to do my Author more Juſtice.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="ix" facs="tcp:0383800900:8"/>
I have not myſelf been ſo fond of writing, as might be imagin'd from ſeeing ſo many Things of mine as are got together in this Book. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of them are on Subjects that were given me by Perſons, to whom I have ſuch great Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations, that I always thought their Deſires Commands. My want of <hi>Education</hi> will be too evident from them, for me to mention it here: And I hope, when the Reader weighs my Performances, he will put <hi>that,</hi> and other Diſadvantages into the Scale.</p>
            <p>I am afraid, the Letter relating to myſelf, wrote by a worthy and learned Gentleman, will be thought an improper Thing in a Publication made by myſelf: But, as I was deſir'd to prefix it, by Perſons whom I think it an Honour to obey, I hope it will be pardon'd; and the rather, becauſe a very falſe Account had been publiſh'd before, by a Perſon who ſeems to have had as little Regard for Truth, as he had for Honeſty, when he ſtole my Poems.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="x" facs="tcp:0383800900:9"/>
I would willingly here make known my Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations to thoſe worthy Perſons who firſt took notice of me in the midſt of <hi>Poverty</hi> and <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,</hi> were I not afraid, my Gratitude, thus publicly expreſs'd, would offend them more than my Silence. However, I muſt beg leave to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn my Thanks to a Reverend Gentleman of <hi>Wiltſhire,</hi> and to another of <hi>Wincheſter:</hi> The former made my Life more comfortable, as ſoon as he knew me; the latter, after giving me ſeveral Teſtimonies of his Bounty and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, preſented my firſt Eſſays to a Lady of Quality, attending on the Queen, who made my low Circumſtances known to Her <hi>Majeſty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I hope too, that all thoſe Honourable Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, whoſe <hi>Names</hi> do me ſo much Credit at the Beginning of my Book, will accept my Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments and Thanks for ſo liberal a Subſcription: And as this Volume, I fear, will tell them, they have not encourag'd a Poet, I will endeavour to let them ſee they have been generous to an honeſt Man.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Don't wonder that you ſhould deſire ſo diſtinct an Account, how <hi>Stephen Duck</hi> came to write Verſes, and how he manag'd in writing them. Philoſophers find as much Subject for their Admiration in the minuteſt Bodies, as in the largeſt; and a Poet from the Barn, tho' not ſo great a Man, is as great a Curioſity, as a Dictator from the Plow. I can be particular enough as to his firſt ſetting out in Poetry; and, ſince you ſeem to deſire it, ſhall give you all the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances I could learn from a Week's Converſation with him in all his Simplicity; without conſidering, that many of them, to a Perſon leſs curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, might appear too trifling to be mention'd even in a Letter.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="xii" facs="tcp:0383800900:11"/>
MY Friend <hi>Stephen</hi> had originally no other Teaching, than what enabled him to read, and write <hi>Engliſh</hi>; he had never taken a ſingle Step toward any other Language. As Arithmetic is generally join'd with this Degree of Learning, he had a little Share of that too. About his Fourteenth Year he was taken from School, and was afterwards ſucceſſively engag'd in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral loweſt Employments of a Country Life. This laſted for ſome Years; ſo long, that he had forgot almoſt all the Arithmetic he had learn'd at School: However he read ſometimes, and thought oftener. He had a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Longing after Knowledge; and when he reflected within himſelf on his want of Education, he began to be particularly uneaſy, that he ſhould have forgot ſomething of what he had learnt, even at the little School he had been at. He thought of this ſo often, that at laſt he reſolv'd to try his own Strength; and, if poſſible, to recover his Arithmetic again.</p>
            <p>HIS firſt Attempt of this kind I take to have been about Six Years ago. Conſidering the Difficulties the poor Fellow lay under, this Inclination for Knowledge muſt have been very ſtrong in him. He was then marry'd, and at Service; he had little Time to ſpare; he had no Books, and no Money to get any: But he was reſolv'd to go thro' with it; and accordingly us'd to work more than other Day-labourers, and by that means got ſome little matter added to his Pay. This Overplus was at his own Diſpoſal. With this he bought firſt a Book of Vulgar Arithmetic, then one of Decimal, and a third of Meaſuring of Land; all which by degrees he made himſelf a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable Maſter of, in thoſe Hours he could ſteal from his Sleep, after the Labours of the Day.</p>
            <p>WHERE there was ſuch a Deſire for Knowledge, there muſt be good Senſe at bottom, and a Soul, at leaſt, ſomewhat above the common Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation he muſt meet with in his poor State of Life. I have ask'd him, whom he had that he could talk and converſe with in the Country; and was pleas'd to find him, in this Particular, happier than I expected. He ſaid, he had one dear Friend, that he mention'd with uncommon Affection. They us'd to talk and read together, when they could ſteal a little Time for it. This Friend had been in a Service at <hi>London</hi> for two or three Years: He had an Inclination to Books; he had purchas'd ſome, and brought 'em down with him into the Country; and <hi>Stephen</hi> had always the Uſe of his little Library; which by this Time, poſſibly, may be increas'd to two or three dozen of Books. This Friend knew no more out of <hi>Engliſh</hi> than <hi>Stephen</hi>; but by talking together they mutually improv'd each other. <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen</hi>
               <pb n="xiii" facs="tcp:0383800900:12"/>
is all Simplicity: He ſays, <q rend="inline">"That his Friend can talk better than he, as having been more us'd to Company; but that he himſelf has been more us'd to Poetry, and in that can do better than his Friend."</q>
            </p>
            <p>HAD it not been for this, <hi>Stephen</hi> muſt have been plac'd in the ſame Claſs with <hi>Hai Ebn Yokdhan,</hi> and the young <hi>Hermes</hi> in Mr. <hi>Ramſay</hi>'s <hi>Cyrus:</hi> But the Story of their Improvements without any Aſſiſtance agrees only with Romances; and you know, what I am writing to you is a true Hiſtory. Our retir'd Philoſopher had his Friend; and it ſeems to have been the greateſt Happineſs of his Life, that he had one. They did not only read, but reaſon'd over Points together; and I have ſometimes thought, how agreeable a thing it would have been, to have been conceal'd within hearing of them, when they were in the midſt of ſome of their moſt knotty Debates. We may imagine 'em both to have had good natural Senſe, and a few good Books in common between 'em: Their Minds were their own; neither improv'd, nor ſpoil'd, by laying in a Stock of Learning: They were perhaps equally well inclin'd to learn, both ſtruggling for a little Knowledge; and, like a Couple of Rowers on the ſame Bottom, while they were only ſtriving perhaps, which ſhould out do his Companion, they were really each helping the other, and driving the Boat on the faſter.</p>
            <p>PERHAPS you would be willing to know what Books their little Library conſiſted of. I need not mention thoſe of Arithmetic again, nor his Bible: <hi>Milton,</hi> the <hi>Spectators,</hi> and <hi>Seneca,</hi> were his firſt Favourites; <hi>Telemachus,</hi> with another Piece by the ſame Hand, and <hi>Addiſon</hi>'s Defence of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, his next. They had an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Dictionary, and a ſort of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Grammar, an <hi>Ovid</hi> of long Standing with them, and a <hi>Bysſhe</hi>'s Art of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etry of later Acquiſition: <hi>Seneca</hi>'s Morals had made the Name of <hi>L'Eſtrange</hi> dear to them; and, as I imagine, might occaſion their getting his <hi>Joſephus</hi> in Folio, which was the largeſt Purchace in their Collection: They had one Volume of <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> with Seven of his Plays in it. Beſide theſe, <hi>Stephen</hi> had read Three or Four other Plays; ſome of <hi>Epictetus, Waller, Dryden</hi>'s <hi>Virgil, Prior, Hudibras, Tom Brown,</hi> and the <hi>London Spy.</hi> You may ſee I am a faithful Hiſtorian, by my giving you the Bad with the Good.</p>
            <p>WITH theſe Helps <hi>Stephen</hi> is grown ſomething of a Poet, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of a Philoſopher. I find by him, that from his Infancy, he has had a Caſt in his Mind toward Poetry. He has delighted, as far back as he can remember, in Verſes, and in Singing. He ſpeaks of ſtrange Emotions, that he has felt on the top Performances of the little Choir of Songſters in

a Country Chancel; and mentions his firſt hearing of an Organ, as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Epocha of his Life. He ſeems to be a pretty good Judge too of a muſical Line; but I imagine, that he does not hear Verſes in his own Mind, as he repeats them. I don't know whether you underſtand me. I mean, that his Ideas of the Notes in a Verſe, and his Manner of repeating the ſame Verſe, are often different: For he points out an harmonious Line well enough; and yet he generally ſpoils its Harmony by his way of ſpeaking it.</p>
            <p>WHAT firſt gave him a higher Taſte of Poetry, than he had been us'd to, was <hi>Milton</hi>'s <hi>Paradiſe Loſt.</hi> This came oddly enough into his Hands; and when I ſee you, I'll tell you the Hiſtory of it. <hi>Stephen</hi> read it over twice or thrice with a Dictionary, before he could underſtand the Language of it thoroughly. This, and a ſort of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Grammar they had, have been of the greateſt Uſe to him of any thing.</p>
            <p>INDEED it ſeems plain to me, that he has got <hi>Engliſh</hi> juſt as we get <hi>Latin.</hi> He ſtudy'd <hi>Paradiſe Loſt,</hi> as others ſtudy the Claſſics. The new Beauties in that Poem, that were continually opening upon his Mind, made all his Labour eaſy to him. He work'd all Day for his Maſter; and, after the Labour of the Day, ſet to his Books at Night. The Pains he has taken for the Pleaſure of improving himſelf, are incredible; but it has anſwer'd too beyond what one could have expected; for he ſeems to underſtand ſome of the great and deeper Beauties of that Poem tolerably well; and points out ſeveral particular Beauties in it, which it requires a good nice Eye to diſcover.</p>
            <p>'TWAS his Friend that help'd him to the <hi>Spectators</hi>; they read them often together, and often by themſelves. <hi>Stephen</hi> tells me, that he has frequently carry'd them with him to his Work. When he did ſo, his Method was to labour harder than any body elſe, that he might get half an Hour to read a <hi>Spectator,</hi> without injuring his Maſter. By this means he us'd to ſit down all over Sweat and Heat, without regarding his own Health, and often to the Prejudice of it. If this affects you, as it has me, I ought not to paſs it over, that you may not loſe the Pleaſure of ſo ſtrong an Inſtance of Honeſty and Induſtry mix'd together.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>Spectators</hi> improv'd his Underſtanding, he ſays, more than any thing. The Copies of Verſes, ſcatter'd in thoſe Pieces, help'd on his natural Bent that way; and made him willing to try, whether he could not do ſomething like 'em. He ſometimes turn'd his own Thoughts into Verſe, while he
<pb n="xv" facs="tcp:0383800900:16"/>
was at Work; and at laſt begun to venture thoſe Thoughts a little on Paper. What he did of this kind, was very inconſiderable; only ſcatter'd Thoughts, and generally not above four or five Lines on the ſame Subject; which, as there was nobody thereabouts that car'd for Verſes, nor any body that could tell him whether they were good or bad, he generally flung into the Fire, as ſoon as he had pleas'd himſelf enough in reading them.</p>
            <p>WHATEVER Care he took to burn theſe little Pieces, he found it not ſufficient to conceal them. The Thing took Air; and <hi>Stephen,</hi> who had before the Name of a Scholar among the Country People, was ſaid now to be able to write Verſes too. This was mention'd accidentally, about a Year ago, before a young Gentleman of <hi>Oxford,</hi> who ſent for <hi>Stephen</hi>; and after ſome Talk with him, deſir'd him to write him a Letter in Verſe. That Letter is the Epiſtle which ſtands the laſt in his Poems, but was the firſt whole Copy of Verſes that ever he wrote. This happen'd to fall into the Hands of ſome Clergymen in the Neighbourhood, who were very well pleas'd with it; and upon examining him, found the Man had a good deal of Merit. They gave him ſome Preſents, which, as Things ſtood then, were a great Help to him; and encourag'd him to go on as much as they could.</p>
            <p>THIS made him proceed with more Courage: And, as he had wrote ſome ſcatter'd Verſes on <hi>Poverty,</hi> before this happen'd, he carry'd thoſe Thoughts on, and fill'd it up, as it ſtands at preſent in the printed Collection I ſend you: So that this is his ſecond Copy. I am very careful in ſettling the Chronology of his Poems, that you may ſee how he has gone on Step by Step, if you pleaſe.</p>
            <p>THE Compoſition which was next in Order, is that on his own <hi>Labours:</hi> That Subject was given him by one of thoſe who firſt encourag'd him; and after this was finiſh'd, he was employ'd from the ſame Quarter in his <hi>Shunammite.</hi> As this exceeded any of the reſt, I think from hence we may date the Aera of his riſing in his Character and Circumſtances. Upon this it was that Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Diſtinction began to ſend for him different ways. In ſhort, it got him Fame enough to be pretty trouble ſome to him at firſt; tho' it is likely to end in a much happier Settlement of him and his Affairs, than could ever have been dreamt of by him at his firſt ſetting out.</p>
            <p>WHEN you have read his Poems, and conſider the Manner he has been bred up in, I doubt not you will think they have their Merit: But I aſſure you, they give an imperfect Idea of the Man; and, to know how much he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves,
<pb n="xvi" facs="tcp:0383800900:17"/>
one ſhould converſe with him, and hear on what Reaſons he omitted ſuch a Part, and introduc'd another; why he ſhortens his Style in this Place, and enlarges in that; whence he has ſuch a Word, and whence ſuch an Idea. I'll give you all I can recollect of this kind, in relation to what is generally reckon'd the beſt Thing he has wrote, <hi>The Shunammite.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IN the firſt Place, I found upon Inquiry, that he wrote by a Plan; he thought over all the Parts, as he intended to uſe them, before he made the Verſes. For a Poem of any Length, no doubt 'tis as neceſſary to do this, as it is to have a Draught of a Houſe, before you go to building it; and yet I believe, the common Run of our Poets have generally thought themſelves above it, or not thought of it at all. Tho' the <hi>Shunammite</hi> was written on a Story given to his hand, ſtill ſomething of this kind was convenient enough; becauſe, in forming it anew, he did not make uſe of all the Materials before him, and has brought in ſome of his own. He thought, the Stretching of the Prophet in ſo particular a manner, muſt ſound ſtrange. The Woman introduc'd to tell her Story, is a new Caſt of his own; ſo is her Doubting, and then Confirming herſelf again, by a particular Induction of all <hi>Eliſha</hi>'s Miracles; ſo the Bringing an Audience about her, and their Chorus's, when they join together in congratulating her Happineſs; the laſt of which cloſes the Poem in a good proper manner.</p>
            <p>UPON being ask'd, Why he introduc'd a Perſon to tell all the Story in the <hi>Shunammite,</hi> and why he could not as well tell it himſelf; he ſaid, he had read <hi>Prior</hi>'s <hi>Solomon</hi>; and that, in reading it, <hi>Solomon</hi>'s ſpeaking every thing touch'd him particularly. He was then ask'd, ſince it was to be ſpoken, why he did not rather chuſe the Prophet, as the Perſon of the greater Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, to ſpeak it. He ſaid to this, That the Woman was to be pity'd; That there ſeem'd to him to be <note n="*" place="margin">Such as theſe:
<q>Ver. 16. And ſhe ſaid; Nay, my Lord, thou Man of God, do not tye unto thy Handmaid.</q>
                  <q>Ver. 28. Did I deſire a Son of my Lord? Did I not ſay, Do not deceive me?</q>
               </note>ſome Expreſſions of the Woman in the Hiſtory, which, if not omitted, might leſſen our Regard and Compaſſion for her; That, if the Prophet had related the Thing, he could not have omitted a Word; but when the Woman did, ſhe might well be allow'd to ſoften her own Caſe; and to drop, when ſhe was cool, any thing wrong, that ſhe had ſaid in the Violence of her Grief and Paſſion. This is rather fuller in Words than he expreſs'd it; but nothing, I think, is added to his Meaning.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="xvii" facs="tcp:0383800900:18"/>
AS <hi>Milton</hi> had been his favourite Poet, you may wonder why none of his Pieces are in blank Verſe. I ask'd him about this too: Upon which he told me, That he had originally written the whole <hi>Shunammite</hi> in blank Verſe; That, upon reading it over, he found his Language was not ſublime enough for it; and that therefore he was forc'd to write it all over again, and turn it into Rhyme.</p>
            <p>UPON reading over the Chapter and his Poem together, you will ſee how juſtly he ſhortens and enlarges ſome of the particular Paſſages, in order to adapt them the more to Poetry. Beſides ſome Things already mention'd, he drops ſeveral little Circumſtances in it<note n="*" place="margin">See 2 Kings, Chap. iv. Verſes 10, 12, 14, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 34, and 35.</note>. On the other hand, he enlarges on the <note n="1" place="margin">Line 33 to 49.</note>Contentedneſs and Charities of the Woman; on the <note n="2" place="margin">55, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note>Look and Attitude of the Prophet; on her <note n="3" place="margin">76.</note>Thanks for bearing a Son; on <note n="4" place="margin">112 to 134.</note>the Death of the Child; on the <note n="5" place="margin">152, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> See 205.</note>Reaſons of her Confidence in the Prophet; in <note n="6" place="margin">211.</note>pointing out the Prophet, when ſhe comes to him; and in <note n="7" place="margin">219.</note>his Anſwer; in her <note n="8" place="margin">232.</note>preſſing the Prophet more earneſtly to aſſiſt her; in <note n="9" place="margin">246.</note>pointing out the dead Child; his being <note n="10" place="margin">258.</note>freed from Death; and her Thoughts <note n="11" place="margin">266.</note>upon receiving him again into her Arms.</p>
            <p>'TIS agreeable to ſee what Uſe he has made of the little Reading he can have had, and how he has improv'd the Thing, by obſerving ſome good Strokes in the Books he has met with. Upon my telling him, that I lik'd nothing better in it, than his altering <note n="†" place="margin">From Line 55 to 63.</note>the Prophet's Countenance as he does; he ſaid, he took that Hint from <hi>Telemachus</hi>; where the young Prince comes to <hi>Idomeneus</hi>'s Court, while they are ſacrificing. The Prieſt, on ſeeing <hi>Telemachus,</hi> breaks off from what he was about, aſſumes a more inſpir'd Air, and begins ſpeaking of his future Fortunes. This Alteration of the Prophet's Countenance, <hi>Stephen</hi> ſays, he took from thence; but that at the ſame time he thought himſelf oblig'd to drop the Wildneſs and Enthuſiaſm of it, in order to adapt it more to the Nature of a true Prophet.</p>
            <p>THE Chorus in the Cloſe of the <hi>Shunammite,</hi> he ſaid, was brought into his Mind by the <note n="‡" place="margin">
                  <hi>Paradiſe Loſt,</hi> Book 7. Line 565, and 602.</note>general Rejoicing of the Angels in <hi>Milton,</hi> upon God's
<pb n="xviii" facs="tcp:0383800900:19"/>
finiſhing the Creation of the World. The firſt Chorus was not in the Work originally; he inſerted it, when he new-form'd it all into Rhyme.</p>
            <p>HE had alſo been very careful as to ſingle Words; and had Authorities to produce in ſeveral little Particulars, where one would not expect it. For <note n="1" place="margin">The <hi>Shunammite,</hi> Ver. 210.</note>
               <hi>flow'ry Carmel,</hi> he quotes Mr. <hi>Pope</hi>; and the Prophet's Arbour on the Top of that Mount is cover'd with <note n="2" place="margin">212.</note>
               <hi>Vines,</hi> on the Authority of Mr. <hi>Sandys</hi> in his Travels: For the Words <note n="3" place="margin">177, and 249.</note>
               <hi>aduſt</hi> and <hi>ſupernal,</hi> he refers to <hi>Milton:</hi> 
               <note n="4" place="margin">56.</note>
               <hi>Fanatic</hi> he uſes according to the true, and not the vulgar Senſe of the Word; he had learn'd the proper Meaning of it from his Dictionary: <note n="5" place="margin">143.</note>
               <hi>Dilated Heart,</hi> as ſpoken of Sorrow, is certainly a Fault; but it is a Fault that <hi>Stephen</hi> was naturally enough led into by the common Notion and Expreſſions in the Country, of the Heart's <hi>ſwelling</hi> and being ready to <hi>burſt</hi> with Grief.</p>
            <p>HE owns his Faults very readily; and if he thinks a Line of his better than ordinary, he will ſay ſo without any Reſerve. He ſeems to be exceedingly open and honeſt in every thing he ſays; and 'twould be very difficult for you to be with him a Week, as I have been, without going away very much his Friend.</p>
            <p>THO' I have been ſo long in ſhewing you how critically he has proceeded as to his own Works; I ſhall add ſome of his Thoughts on the Works of others, to give you as full an Idea of him as I can.</p>
            <p>'TIS not yet three Years ago that he firſt met with <hi>Milton</hi>; and I believe, that was the firſt Poet of real Value, that he ever ſtudy'd in earneſt. He has aſſur'd me, with all his Innocence and Simplicity, that when he came after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to read <hi>Addiſon</hi>'s Criticiſms on <hi>Milton</hi> in the <hi>Spectators,</hi> 'twas a high Pleaſure to him to find many Things mention'd there, in the Praiſe of <hi>Milton,</hi> exactly as he had before thought in reading him. Here we muſt depend on his Credit, which I need not tell you with me is very good.</p>
            <p>THE Name of <hi>Milton,</hi> whom he admires and dotes on ſo particularly, has not prevail'd on him enough to make him like his <hi>Paradiſe Regain'd.</hi> In ſpeaking of theſe two Poems, he ſaid, <q rend="inline">"he wonder'd how <hi>Milton</hi> could write ſo incomparably well, where he had ſo little to lead him; and ſo very poorly, where he had more."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="xix" facs="tcp:0383800900:20"/>
THE <hi>Spectators,</hi> you know, he has read with great Pleaſure, and great Improvement. I remember particularly, that on ſomebody's calling them <hi>Proſe,</hi> he ſaid, <q rend="inline">"'Twas true, they were <hi>Proſe</hi>; but there was ſomething in 'em, that pleas'd almoſt like <hi>Verſe.</hi>"</q>—He mention'd, with more Regard than uſual, the critical Papers on Wit, thoſe on <hi>Milton,</hi> the <hi>Juſtum &amp; tenacem</hi> from <hi>Horace,</hi> Mr. <hi>Pope</hi>'s <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> and the ſeveral ſcatter'd ones written in the Cauſe of Virtue and Religion.</p>
            <p>UPON asking him what Plays he had read, he nam'd particularly <hi>Julius Caeſar, Hamlet, Cato, Venice Preſerv'd,</hi> and <hi>the Orphan. Venice Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd,</hi> he ſaid, gave him the moſt <hi>Horror</hi>; a Word which I took notice he us'd ſometimes for Sorrow, and ſometimes in its proper Senſe: He could not bear the comic Parts in it. <hi>Hamlet</hi> he lik'd better than <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi>; and in <hi>Hamlet</hi> pointed out that celebrated Speech, <hi>To be, or not to be,</hi> &amp;c. as having been his favourite Part, merely of his own Taſte. He did not admire <hi>Shakeſpear</hi>'s Comedy; and ſaid, <q rend="inline">"He was too high, and too low."</q> I read over to him ſome of <hi>Hamlet,</hi> and the celebrated Speeches of <hi>Antony</hi> to the People in <hi>Julius Caeſar.</hi> He trembled, as I read the Ghoſt's Speech; and admir'd the Speeches and Turns in the Mob round <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Body, more, he ſaid, than ever he had done before. As I was reading to him, I obſerv'd that his Countenance chang'd often in the moſt moving Parts: His Eye was quick and buſy all the time; and, to ſay the Truth, I never ſaw Applauſe, or the ſhifting of proper Paſſions, appear ſo ſtrongly in any Face as in his.</p>
            <p>HE had formerly read <hi>Tom Brown</hi>'s <hi>Letters from the Dead,</hi> and the <hi>London Spy,</hi> not without ſome Pleaſure; but, after he had been ſome time converſant with the <hi>Spectators,</hi> he ſaid, <q rend="inline">"He did not care much to look into them."</q> He ſpoke of <hi>Hudibras</hi> in another manner; he ſaw a great deal of Wit in it, and was particularly pleas'd with the Conjurer's Part in that Poem: But, after all, 'tis not a Manner of writing that he can ſo ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely delight in, as in the Moral, the Paſſionate, or the Sublime.</p>
            <p>INDEED what every body ſeems to admire him for, is, that he ſeems to have an excellent moral Turn in his Thoughts. He is, as I told you before, ſomething of a Philoſopher; and, what is better than a Philoſopher, a good honeſt-hearted Man. He has read, and ſpeaks highly of, the Archbiſhop of <hi>Cambray</hi>'s Demonſtration of the Being of a God, and Mr. <hi>Addiſon</hi>'s Defence of the Chriſtian Religion. He ſaid, <q rend="inline">"That they touch'd his Mind; and that nothing did ſo well, as when one's Reaſon is mov'd by what is ſaid."</q>
               <pb n="xx" facs="tcp:0383800900:21"/>
He had lik'd the little he had read of <hi>Epictetus</hi>; but 'twas <hi>Seneca</hi> that had made him happy in his own Mind. He ſeems as yet not to be hurt at all by any Applauſes that have been given him, and to have been perfectly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with his Condition before: When he had only receiv'd ſome Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents from Gentlemen in the Country, he was quite eaſy as to his Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. The only Thing then, that he was ſolicitous about, was, how he might ſucceed as to the Poetry he ſhould be employ'd in. This was his chief Concern: But even this ſeem'd to proceed not ſo much from any Deſire of Fame, as from a Principle of Gratitude; or, as he expreſs'd it, his Longing to pleaſe thoſe Friends that had been ſo generous to him. He was not lifted up with the Character ſome People gave him, and talk'd of Fame abſolutely like a Philoſopher. After his beſt Fortune, many of his Friends told him the Danger of being vain; and, if he ſhould once be ſo, that he would be as much deſpis'd as he had been applauded. He ſaid, <q rend="inline">"That he could not well tell what they meant; That he did not know what it was to be vain: But, ſince ſo many great Men, who knew the World ſo much better than he did, were apprehenſive for him on that head, he began to be terribly alarm'd at his Danger, tho' he had no ſettled Ideas of what it was."</q> He was told upon this, That he ſhould never ſpeak too highly in Praiſe of the Poems he had written. He ſaid, <q rend="inline">"If that was all, he was ſafe; that was a Thing he could never do, for he could not think highly of them: Gentlemen indeed, he ſaid, might like 'em, becauſe they were made by a poor Fellow in a Barn; but that he knew, as well as any body, that they were not really good in themſelves."</q>

A glorious Thought, and laudable! But then</l>
               <l>Think what illit'rate Poet guides the Pen:</l>
               <l>Ill ſuit ſuch Tasks with one who holds the Plough,</l>
               <l>Such lofty Subjects with a Fate ſo low.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>SIR, were your Eloquence and Learning mine,</l>
               <l>And I, like you, a Fav'rite of the Nine;</l>
               <l>I quickly would <hi>Parnaſſus</hi>' Summit climb,</l>
               <l>And find a Hero worthy of my Rhyme:</l>
               <l>Nor ſhould my Muſe the <hi>Grecian</hi> Monarchs trace,</l>
               <l>Nor would I celebrate the <hi>Trojan</hi> Race;</l>
               <l>Nor any of thoſe martial Sons of Fame,</l>
               <l>Pagans, unworthy of a Chriſtian's Theme.</l>
               <l>Far nobler Thoughts my grateful Voice ſhould raiſe,</l>
               <l>In lofty Strains, to great MESSIAH's Praiſe:</l>
               <l>I'd joyfully reſound his wond'rous Birth,</l>
               <l>And paint his Godlike Virtues, whilſt on Earth;</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:0383800900:45"/>
Then, with Reluctance, Horror, and Surprize,</l>
               <l>I'd mournfully relate his Agonies;</l>
               <l>I'd trace the heav'nly Hero to the Tree,</l>
               <l>Sing what he ſuffer'd there for you and me;</l>
               <l>Next, in heroic Numbers, would I tell,</l>
               <l>How ſoon he baffled Death, and vanquiſh'd Hell,</l>
               <l>Subdu'd the Grave, and ſhew'd the glorious Way,</l>
               <l>From Realms of Darkneſs, to eternal Day.</l>
               <l>Such noble Subjects ſhould my Lays excite;</l>
               <l>And you, my Patron, would in ſuch delight;</l>
               <l>Grateful to me, when you, well-pleas'd, ſhould view</l>

            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>BUT now I muſt omit MESSIAH's Praiſe,</l>
               <l>Leſt I degrade him with unworthy Lays;</l>
               <l>My Fate compels me ſilent to remain,</l>
               <l>For want of Learning to improve my Strain:</l>

By which no Thought, tho' well conceiv'd, can riſe</l>
               <l>To full Perfection, but in Embryo dies:</l>
               <l>Yet my unpoliſh'd Genius will produce,</l>
               <l>And bring forth ſomething, tho' of little Uſe.</l>

            <lg>
               <l>THUS, in the Country, often have I found,</l>
               <l>Thro' ſlothful Man's Neglect, a Plat of Ground,</l>
               <l>Waſte and uncultivated, void of Seeds,</l>
               <l>Producing nothing, but ſome trifling Weeds.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>BUT why ſtand I my Fate accuſing ſo?</l>
               <l>The Field calls me to Labour; I muſt go:</l>
               <l>The Kine low after Meat; the hungry Steed,</l>
               <l>Neighing, complains he wants his uſual Feed.</l>
               <l>Then, Sir, adieu: Accept what you did crave,</l>
               <l>And be propitious to your humble Slave.</l>

               <l>And ſtill are poor, for fear of being ſo.</l>

When firſt he to the Royal Palace came,</l>

               <l>A noble Lord there was, of great Renown,</l>
               <l>Rebell'd againſt the King, and claim'd his Crown:</l>
               <l>Great Preparations made he for the Fight;</l>

               <l>The Royal Army valiant FELIX join'd;</l>

Fix'd in the Front, the Foe he bravely dares,</l>
               <l>Like PALLAS prudent, and as bold as MARS.</l>
               <l>Say, Muſe, What Goddeſs, that tremendous Hour,</l>

               <l>Sharpen'd his Sword, and pointed ev'ry Dart:</l>
               <l>Fierce, as a Lion, thro' the Lines he ſprung;</l>
               <l>And forc'd his Foes, like trembling Stags, along.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>As when reſiſtleſs Winds ruſh o'er the Deep,</l>

               <l>The leafy Harveſt, tumbling, flies before:</l>
               <l>So ruſh'd the Hero on the adverſe Band,</l>
               <l>So fled the Legions from his pow'rful Hand;</l>
               <l>Till ſoon the rebel Lord he Pris'ner made,</l>

               <l>Thus, quickly FELIX gain'd a deathleſs Name;</l>
               <l>Thus, was his Labour crown'd with Wealth and Fame:</l>

               <l>To give them Taſte, he wants the lovely Fair;</l>
               <l>The lovely Fair, oppreſt with equal Grief,</l>

               <l>With pleaſing Wonder ſtruck CONSTANTIA's Ears,</l>
               <l>And fill'd her doubtful Soul with Hopes and Fears:</l>
               <l>For, tho' the wiſe PRISCILLA often ſtrove</l>
               <l>With prudent Counſel to ſuppreſs her Love;</l>

Her Love was only leſſen'd, not ſuppreſt;</l>
               <l>But glows again, again diſtracts her Breaſt.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>

               <l>The Fires again, with former Fury, riſe,</l>

               <l>So in her Boſom glows the am'rous Fire,</l>

               <l>No, no; I fear the flatt'ring Tale deceives;</l>

No; rather let me ſeek the <hi>Thunic</hi> Court;</l>
