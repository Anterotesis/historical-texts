            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>ANY attempt to inſtruct the bulk of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind in the Science of Medicine, by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to diſcuſs the Nature and Cure of Diſeaſes, muſt, at firſt view, appear equally ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd and impoſſible. But to explain the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Cauſes which affect Health and induce Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, to illuſtrate ſo much of the Animal Oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy as this intention requires, and, by theſe means, to render people leſs ſtrangers to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and more capable of preſerving Health and Life, (as, I believe, there is no other Treatiſe of the ſame Kind) ſeems to me a laudable Endeavour, and conſiſtent with every purpoſe of benevolence and humanity. Such is the deſign of this Eſſay, and ſuch the motives for its Publication. In this little Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction I have particularly ſtudied to be conciſe, and to convey, without entering into Detail, as much practical information as poſſible, on a ſmall, eaſy Scale. I have taken care not to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce any groundleſs theoretical ſpeculation, nor have I even hazarded a ſingle aſſertion, but what my own inquiry and obſervation have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peatedly proved and confirmed to my Satisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:1000500300:4"/>If my Analyſis and Explanation of the Mind be more compatible with fair reaſon and ſound philoſophy, if it be a more accurate inveſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigation of phyſical and moral analogy, and more clearly demonſtrative of all the Phaenomena of the human Syſtem, than any other that has yet appeared, it will not, I hope, be deemed vague or deluſive, becauſe it wants the ſanction of a greater name.</p>

            <p>THE Diſeaſes incidental to the human Body are correſpondent, to the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of external, and internal Cauſes which are capable of affecting it, and to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and State of the Animal Structure.</p>
            <p>All thoſe Things which act immediately upon the Body, or make Impreſſion on it, at a Diſtance, through the Medium of the Senſes, the Changes that happen in the Atmoſphere which ſurrounds us, and in the Air we breathe, conſtitute the general, external Cauſes that affect Health.</p>
            <p>The principal internal Cauſes may be reckoned Sleep, and the Quantity, Quality, and Modification of ſuch Things as are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into the Stomach.</p>
            <pb n="2" facs="tcp:1000500300:8"/>
            <p>The particular Cauſes of Diſeaſes depend upon the State of the Animal Oeconomy.</p>
            <p>Firſt, then, I ſhall make ſome general Obſervations, for the Purpoſe of Elucida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and afterwards conſider the Subject, as it naturally ariſes from theſe three Heads.</p>
            <p>The proper Standard of Health is that State, in which all the component Parts of the Body (as a Machine) are equally firm to reſiſt, pliant to yield, and proportionable to be regular. This conſtitutes an Equili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brium or proper Ballance. To preſerve, or reſtore this Ballance is Health, and every conſiderable Degree of Variation from it, is an equal Degree of Diſeaſe.</p>
            <p>The human Fabric may be divided into two different Syſtems. The one is the Syſtem of Veſſels or Tubes, which performs the Circulation of the Fluids, and is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted on plain mechanical Principles: and the other is the Nervous Syſtem, which
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:1000500300:9"/>conſiſts of all thoſe Parts that have Senſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and Motion, and whoſe Properties are more difficult to explain.</p>
            <p>When theſe two Syſtems are happily ballanced and proportioned, all the Powers and Functions of the Body, as well as of the Mind, come neareſt to a State of Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity and Perfection.</p>
            <p>In all my Reſearches into the Nature and Principles of the human Mind, I muſt confeſs that I can diſcern no one ſingle Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of it diſtinct from, and unconnected with the Body.</p>
            <p>That there moſt certainly is a prime Move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, general Senſory, or a concentrated Power, which is the Origin of all the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties and Offices of the Body, and that this Power reſides, or begins, within the Brain, Anatomical Diſſections, and the Obſervations of common Senſe unqueſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably demonſtrate. To define the Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, Quantity, or Proportion of this
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:1000500300:10"/>Power, is utterly impoſſible, and to ſay that it is immaterial, or that it is ſomething which has no Parts, is, poſitively, to ſay that it is Nothing at all.</p>
            <p>This Power is beſt known, and I think moſt happily deſcribed by the common Terms, Mind, Life or Soul. Now, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I profeſs, and indeed muſt treat of this Power or Mind as an eſſential and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganic Part of the human Structure, I am ready, at the ſame Time, to declare (leaſt I ſhould miſlead the weak or ignorant) that this Doctrine ought not, nor, by any Means, can be deemed repugnant to the Belief of Immortality, or a future State of Exiſtence. On the contrary, it places human Nature in a rational Light, and will be found to obviate and reconcile thoſe Difficulties which occur in conſidering this nice Point.</p>
            <p>For where is the Objection, in Reſpect of Reaſon or Philoſophy, againſt the Opinion that this Power, Soul, Mind, or animating Eſſence of the Body, immutable in its Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, may, at the final Hour, ſublime,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:1000500300:11"/>as it were, from the Caput-Mortuum, that is, ſoar aloft, and ſurvive the groſſer Materials, which the Laws of ſpecific Gravity fix to the Earth, and the Texture of Parts ſubjects to Separation and Diſſolution?</p>
            <p>The firſt, and leading Feature in the Phyſiognomy of the Mind is a Quality, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pability, or inherent Neceſſity of perceiving all Manner of Impreſſions whatever.</p>
            <p>From this ſimple Power of Perception, firſt, Similitude or Reſemblance of Things, then, Memory, Compariſon, Reflection, Deliberation, and in ſhort, all the regular and progreſſive Operations of the Mind (by Means of an intrinſic, or unceaſing Move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) may be eaſily conceived to proceed.</p>
            <p>The Paſſions, ſo called, form another Claſs of Operations, more energetic than the former, becauſe in them, the Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions are external, immediate, and impetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and the Perceptions, therefore, recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, more vigorous.</p>
            <pb n="6" facs="tcp:1000500300:12"/>
            <p>Thus, Anger proceeds from violent Agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, Fear is produced by ſuch as are ſtrong and quick, Joy ariſes from vivid, and Grief from deep Impreſſions. Hope is the Reſult of ſoft and agreeable Emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Which Circumſtance proves in the cleareſt Manner, that the Enjoyments of Life infinitely ſurpaſs the Miſeries of it, ſince Hope, by being conſtantly in Exerciſe, becomes habitual, and never leaves the Mind, except for very ſhort and almoſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perceptible Intervals. This Argument yields a good Leſſon for Patience and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment in every poſſible Situation. Love, the Miſtreſs of the Mind, differs from all the reſt. It is cloſely interwoven with the Animal Frame, and draws its Impulſe (of all others the moſt irreſiſtible) from Springs which act, within, as well as from Objects that excite, without.</p>
            <p>Images, which preſent to the Mind, Beauty, Harmony, and Symmetry, produce
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:1000500300:13"/>pleaſing Emotions; thoſe, which convey the contrary Qualities, are accompanied with painful Senſations. The former of theſe give a free and full Motion to the Nervous Power; a ſhort, quick, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted Movement is the Conſequence of the latter.</p>
            <p>This Obſervation may be applied with more Force and Conviction than all the ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borate and ingenious Arguments that can be adduced, (either in Favour, or in Oppoſition to the Doctrine,) in Teſtimony of the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Aſcendency of moral Virtue in the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Mind.</p>
            <p>It ſhews that Beauty, Order, Dignity and Happineſs are amiable to the Mind of Man, and illuminate with congenial Rays the elevated Faculties of the Soul; while Deformity, Turpitude, Vice, and Miſery compoſe the horrid Contraſt, that diſgraces Society, degrades the Mind, and brutalizes the Species.</p>
            <p>None of the Mental Affections or Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as long as they continue to create re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:1000500300:14"/>and pleaſing Senſations, by any Means, injure, but on the contrary, promote Health. The Paſſions or Affections of the Mind, therefore, affect Health, and diſorder the Syſtem, in Conſequence of, and in Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Impetuoſity, Pain and Duration of the Impreſſions or Images which actuate, or excite them, and in no other Way.</p>
            <p>Anger, Fear, Hatred, Shame, Grief, Anxiety, Jealouſy, Envy, Pride, Malice and Revenge (to which I may add Study) poſſeſſes each of them, a certain Modifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the characteriſtic Marks above deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed; and all of them produce ſimilar Effects upon the Animal Syſtem, different only, in Degree, and in Point of Continua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Love, Hope, and Joy muſt rank differently from the other Paſſions, as their Effects are injurious to the Syſtem, only when they are violent and exceſſive.</p>
            <p>The Paſſions of the Mind then, (agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Limitations pointed out) irritate the Nervous Syſtem, whoſe Tubes ſerve
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:1000500300:15"/>as Conductors from the Brain throughout the whole Body, in ſuch a Manner as to produce Spaſm. Now Spaſm is a Motion or Oſcillation (whether in the vaſcular or muſcular Parts, it makes no Difference) ſo extremely quick, in Point of Succeſſion or Alternation, that the Intermiſſions or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervals become imperceptible to the Senſes. This is a ſeeming Paradox, an Exceſs, and at the ſame Time, an Interruption of the nervous Influence.</p>
            <p>The ſpaſmodic Stimulus or Effort, thus produced by the Paſſions, particularly affects the Head, the Lungs, and the Womb. Hence Madneſs, Fainting, Convulſions, Hyſterics, Aſthma, &amp;c. It diſorders the Stomach and Inteſtinal Canal, occaſioning Colics, Flatulency and Indigeſtion. It conſtringes the Surface of the Skin, and all the nervous Parts and Tubes, and thus blocks up the Perſpiration, and the other Secretions; and by theſe Means, brings Fevers, Obſtructions, Scurvy, Nervous Diſorders, Melancholy, &amp;c.</p>
            <pb n="10" facs="tcp:1000500300:16"/>
            <p>Vehement and ſudden Paſſions, by means of Spaſm, ſometimes retard and check, for a Moment, the progreſſive Motion of the Nervous Influence in the Brain itſelf. Hence a general Relaxation, and involun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Diſcharge of the Faeces and Urine, a Circumſtance which happens not ſeldom, in Caſes of extreme Fright or Terror.</p>
            <p>The ſame Law paints the inward Feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings upon the Muſcles of the Face, by various Contractions and Relaxations, it gives the Pencil its fineſt Stroke, and fulleſt Expreſſion in the genuine Language of the Eyes, and thus confirms the Face the Index, or Proxy of the Mind.</p>
            <p>The immoderate or inordinate Paſſions and Agitations of the Mind are moſt effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually prevented, by avoiding, as much as poſſible, every exciting Cauſe, and cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivating Habits of Equanimity and Firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which, with every other valuable Accompliſhment of the Mind, are chiefly to be acquired from Education, or, in
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:1000500300:17"/>other Words, an extenſive, and well choſen Fund of Ideas.</p>
            <p>This is a Reſource which invigorates and exalts the Mind, expands the Reaſon, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes the Aids of Philoſophy, and ſupplies an inexhauſtible Store of different Thoughts and various Imagery.</p>
            <p>But no particular Management, nor any Mode of Acceſs or immediate Application whatever to the Mind, can counteract the Diſadvantages of an unhealthy and infirm Habit of Body. Pain muſt neceſſarily ſour the Temper, and make it haſty, moroſe and iraſcible. Relaxation creates Peeviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Imbecillity, and renders the Mind irritable, timid, too ſuſceptible of every Impreſſion, and liable to Miſconception; and Obſtruction, which is generally the Companion of Relaxation, adds Gloom, Melancholy, Anxiety, and a diſordered Imagination to the baneful Catalogue.</p>
            <p>On the other Hand, in thoſe Habits or Temperatures, in which the Powers and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:1000500300:18"/>Functions of the Syſtem riſe above the Line of Mediocrity, or Standard of Health, and occaſion Irregularity only on that Account, the Diſpoſition of the Mind receives the Stamp, and wears the Colours of Pride, Reſtleſſneſs, Vanity, and Deſire. Theſe, moreover, have not ſo ſad a Complexion, nor ſo ſickly an Aſpect as the former, and beſides are much more eaſily reduced to the proper Equilibrium.</p>
            <p>In all Caſes where the Paſſions are once excited, the beſt Antidote is the creation of new and oppoſite Impreſſions.</p>
            <p>Change the Objects, ſhift the Scene, ſooth the Mind, and compoſe the Body, and if Need be, fortify it alſo.</p>
            <p>Theſe Rules are applicable in ſudden Emotions, as Anger, Fear, &amp;c. and are equally appoſite in the Paſſions of ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended Love, Grief, Jealouſy, &amp;c. where there is always ſome Image permanently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented, and, in a Manner, ſettled upon
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:1000500300:19"/>the Mind. But to conquer the latter will require Time and Perſervance.</p>
            <p>Grief ought to be amuſed, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted by Hope, Fidelity and Conſolation muſt ſoften the edge of Jealouſy, and Love ſhould certainly be gratified, if poſſible; or if that cannot be done, (ſince as I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, it has a double Claim) it muſt be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed every reaſonable Indulgence, and ſhould undoubtedly meet Returns of Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy and Tenderneſs, ſomewhere.</p>
            <p>None of the Paſſions will admit of too ſudden a Check. It is much better to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to ſuperſede them, by Means of other, pleaſant, Senſations, than to attempt, all at once, to ſtifle and reſtrain them. The Irritation on the Nerves, when once excited, muſt have ſome Play. It ſeeks a Vent through one Channel or another, and if it burſt out in a Flood of Tears, a Fit of Laughter, or a Flow of Words, it may be reckoned a very favourable Termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
            <pb n="14" facs="tcp:1000500300:20"/>
            <p>The Air is an inviſible, elaſtic Fluid, which covers and encloſes the Earth, and preſſes upon the Surface of all Bodies, with an amazing Weight.</p>
            <p>The Air acts upon the Animal Syſtem, in various Ways. It ſtimulates, more or leſs, in all Circumſtances; it relaxes or braces according to the Degree of Heat, or Cold, which pervades it; the Lungs are inflated and expanded with a greater or leſſer Force, adequate to its Elaſticity or Purity; and it abſorbs and receives the diaphoretic Vapour from the Surface of the Skin as well as of the Lungs, in Proportion to its Dryneſs and Warmth.</p>
            <p>The Air, in general, is moſt ſalubrious, in high Situations, in thoſe Places where it has a free Circulation, and alſo near the Sea-Coaſt, and in the Vicinity of Rivers, and flowing Water. Air, impregnated with foreign Particles, overcharged with Moiſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>, or phlogiſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ated by the Heat of the Sun, the Action of Fire, by ſulphure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:1000500300:21"/>Vapours, the Breath of Animals, and ſuchlike, is moſt unwholeſome.</p>
            <p>In Aſthmas, Conſumptions, and Nervous Complaints, the Temperature of the Air is a material Conſideration, and of great Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance. A light, dry, and warm Air is beſt for weak, and diſeaſed Lungs, and a dry and cold, or temperate Air is fitteſt for relaxed, and nervous People.</p>
            <p>The Benefit of Change of Air is known to every Body, and many People find, by Experience, that a Change even to a more indifferent Air is ſometimes attended with Advantage. The Reaſon of which is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt from what has been already ſaid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Qualities and Effects of Air. The Changes of Air ought not, in any Caſe, to be too ſudden, or too much in the extreme; the more gradual they are, the leſs Danger is incurred.</p>
            <p>In all Fevers, but eſpecially thoſe of the putrid Kind, Ventilation, or the Admiſſion
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:1000500300:22"/>of freſh Air is highly neceſſary. In putrid Fevers, the Patient ſhould be removed, and the Apartments well waſhed with Plenty of warm Water, and dryed with a quick and ſtrong Fire, keeping the Windows open, at the ſame Time. This is a very ſafe and effectual Method of purifying noxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Air.</p>
            <p>In the advanced, as well as in the earlier Stages of phthiſical and conſumptive Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, it cannot he improper, after other Means have failed, to try a Sea Voyage and a warmer Climate.</p>
            <p>The Reaching and Vomiting occaſioned by Sea ſickneſs, which has been generally accounted hazardous, ought not, by any Means, to intimidate. If the Diſeaſe be ſeated in the glandular Parts of the Lungs, if it be of the ſcrophulous Kind, or of an hydropic Nature, or if a general Infarction, or local Plenitude of the Lungs give Riſe to it, (and thus circumſtanced indeed from one or more of theſe Cauſes, the Diſeaſe is
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:1000500300:23"/>moſt frequently to be met with) in either of theſe Caſes, I ſay, Sea Sickneſs and Vomiting muſt be undeniably uſeful. If even a Suppuration or Abceſs be forming, or already formed, the Caſe is then ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly dangerous, that there ſtill remain more Chances in Favour of, than againſt the Patient. Beſides there is a peculiar Kind of Relaxation prevailing in the Syſtem from the vertiginous Nature of that Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſo that the Action of Vomiting is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed with leſs Danger of rupturing any Veſſels, and the Ejections from the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach are more abundant than in Vomiting produced from any other Cauſe.</p>
            <p>It may likewiſe deſerve Notice, in this Place, that aged People, who may happen to be more ſolicitous to prolong their Exiſtence, than concerned in what Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude their Aſhes are to reſt, certainly have it in their Power, <hi>coeteris paribus,</hi> to add a few Years to the Period of their natural Lives, by removing in the Decline of Life, to a hot, tropical Climate.</p>
            <pb n="18" facs="tcp:1000500300:24"/>
            <p>The Neceſſities of Nature, and the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Order of Things demand Action in the human Species, and the Mechaniſm of the Body plainly ſhews that it is not only well calculated for that Purpoſe, but alſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrates that Exerciſe is even indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly requiſite to preſerve Regularity in the Wheels of Motion, and to fit them for the due Performance of their ſeveral Offices.</p>
            <p>Exerciſe is like a Main Spring to the Machinery. It promotes the Digeſtion, prepares the Blood for its various Deſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, diſtributes it through all the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels of Circulation, throws off the imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and offenſive Parts of the Fluids, braces the Nerves, gives a firm Tone to the Solids, and carries an even Flow of Spirits through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole Syſtem.</p>
            <p>Exerciſe is hurtful immediately after a full Meal, and in the Morning, when the Stomach is quite empty, much Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe is injurious.</p>
            <p>Frequent Walking relieves the Head, abates Rheumatic Pains, keeps the Bowels
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:1000500300:25"/>open, is favourable to all the deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Evacuations, and has a Tendency to prevent the Gout: It contributes to ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Health, and by increaſing the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation and Secretion in the Legs and Feet, (ſince the Extremities are the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Seat of the Gout) it may perhaps hinder the Formation and Aſſimilation of thoſe morbid Particles, which are found to exiſt, in a concreted State, in a fixed or ſettled Gout.</p>
            <p>Riding on Horſe-back is an excellent Exerciſe, and eſſentially beneficial in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed and nervous Habits, and in all Affections of the Lungs: But when, the Nerves or Bowels are very weak, the beſt Subſtitute is riding in an open Carriage.</p>
            <p>Thoſe who labour under Obſtructions and Nervous Diſorders, ſhould try the Effects of ſome mechanical or domeſtic Work, and particularly ſuch as requires Flexion of the Body, as that Attitude tends, in ſome Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, to give Motion to the ſtagnant Fluids, in the Viſcera. But when this is the cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomary
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:1000500300:26"/>Poſture in People's common Occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation, an Alteration in that Caſe is equally neceſſary, as Obſtructions and other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, may ariſe from, and be much ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated by daily Contortion, or ſtooping.</p>
            <p>Ploughing, and gardening are alſo very be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial Exerciſes for thoſe who are in a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chectic, nervous, or valitudinary State, as there can be no Doubt but the freſh opened Boſom of the prolific Earth muſt very copiouſly diffuſe ſalubrious Exhalations.</p>
            <p>Moderate Dancing, occaſionally, is a valuable Kind of Exerciſe. To the Powers of Muſic, and elevated Feſtivity, it unites the Charms of refined Sociability and At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction, and inſpires an Animation which moves the Syſtem in a more pleaſing and effectual Manner, and with happier Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects than the other common Exerciſes can boaſt.</p>
            <p>There are two prevailing Errors, in Regard of Exerciſe, which I muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark.
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:1000500300:27"/>People of relaxed, delicate and ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Habits, who ſhould always avoid too much Action, at one Time, often hurt themſelves by over Exertion, becauſe they judge it adviſeable to take Plenty of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe. There are others, again, who, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing confined within Doors, and leading a ſedentary Life, think to compenſate for the Want of regular Exerciſe, by a hard Ride, or Walk, once a Week. But this is a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken Notion. The Nerves of ſuch People, unaccuſtomed to bear ſo great a Degree of Agitation, are overſtrained and relaxed by it, while the Circulation of their Fluids, which is, in general, very ſlow and languid, is thrown into Diſorder, from the ſame Cauſe, and thus a Foundation is laid for thoſe very Complaints which it was meant to prevent.</p>
            <p>Hard Labour, and conſtant Exertion evaporates the Nervous Power, diſtends and relaxes the Nerves and Veſſels, (unleſs when Labour is habitual, and then indeed it
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:1000500300:28"/>has a contrary Effect upon the Solids,) throws off the nutritious Part of the Blood, and thereby waſtes and weakens the Syſtem.</p>
            <p>In all Caſes whatever, let this be an inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riable Rule, that real Wearineſs and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigue ſhould mark the preciſe Limits of every Species of Exerciſe and Labour.</p>
            <p>Cleanlineſs is accompanied with as much Utility as Comfort, and ſhould therefore be practiſed, as far as Circumſtances will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, by every one. It is a Matter of no ſmall Importance to keep the Skin clear and clean: both becauſe it is the moſt copious excretory Paſſage, of the whole Body, for the ſuperfluous Diatheſis of the Blood, and alſo on Account of its being a fine, ſenſible, nervous Expanſion, holding a high Degree of Sympathy, with all the principal Organs of the Syſtem. Hence the Skin is the principal Drain whereby the Circulation maintains an equal Diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the Nervous Syſtem preſerves its Equilibrium.</p>
            <pb n="23" facs="tcp:1000500300:29"/>
            <p>The Feet ſhould be particularly attended to. The bathing of them in warm Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter helps to relieve the Head-ach, all Sorts of Colics, and nephritic Pains, and is ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable in Fevers, and recent Colds.</p>
            <p>As to Clothes, it is always better, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in this Climate, to wear too many than too few. Emaciated People recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from Illneſs ſhould have Clothes made to fit cloſe. Theſe would help to brace and reſtore them, whereas their old looſe Clothes tend to keep them relaxed, and, at the ſame Time admit too much Air.</p>
            <p>It is really extraordinary, that any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, (yet one may meet ſuch every Day) either from Vanity or Ignorance, ſhould fall into a Cuſtom ſo repugnant to common Senſe, and his own private Feelings, as that of girding the Neck till the Eyes ſtart, or of wearing Apparel ſo very tight and faſhionable, that he can neither bend, walk, breathe, nor ſpeak.</p>
            <p>Heat relaxes the Nerves and Solids, and rarifies and volatilizes the Fluids, it alſo
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:1000500300:30"/>generates Bile, and prepares the Body for Fluxes, intermittent, putrid, and epidemic Fevers.</p>
            <p>Thoſe, who are much expoſed to ſtrong Fires, or to intenſe Heat of any Kind, ſhould wear coarſe Linnen, or Cotton next the Skin, ſhould ſhift often, and waſh the Face and Hands with cold Water, and a little common Salt diſſolved in it, twice a Day.</p>
            <p>In the Heat of Summer, a moderate Portion of Wine, or Spirits, is quite ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, both to ſupply the Conſumption occaſioned by the Increaſe of Perſpiration, and to recruit the exhauſted Strength, and alſo to ſharpen the greater Quantities of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luting Liquors, which Thirſt naturally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires. Therefore, one Way with another, there ought to be conſumed nearly as much ſtrong Liquor, in the Summer as in the Winter Seaſon.</p>
            <p>Cold gives Tenſion or Firmneſs to the Fibres, condenſes the Fluids, compacts the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:1000500300:31"/>Texture of the Blood, and prediſpoſes to inflammatory Diſeaſes.</p>
            <p>Warm Clothes, Motion, and ſufficient Nouriſhment are the moſt proper and effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Preſervatives againſt exceſſive Cold: And nothing is more prepoſterous, or more dangerous than the Uſe of too much ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituous Liquors in cold, ſevere Weather.</p>
            <p>There is hardly any thing more common than to hear People expreſs their Surprize at having got Cold, becauſe they are alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether at a Loſs to account for the Cauſe of it. They are not ignorant that damp Air, wet Clothes, the drinking cold Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors when the Body is very hot, or too warm Liquors when it is cold, and ſuch like, are the chief Cauſes; but do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that all ſudden Tranſitions from one Temperature, and one Extreme to another, are equally conducive to the ſame Effect, though the Circumſtances of it may not be ſo obvious to them.</p>
            <pb n="26" facs="tcp:1000500300:32"/>
            <p>Colds bring on Fevers, Inflammations of the Throat and Lungs, Pleuriſies, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptions, Rheumatiſms, Colics, Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rrhoeas, Piles, Palſy, &amp;c. and are often ſo ſerious in their Conſequences, that no Body ſhould venture to trifle with Colds, even in a ſlight Degree.</p>
            <p>In ſevere, recent Colds that affect the Breaſt, Bleeding ſhould be almoſt invari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably reſorted to, and the Perſpiration re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored by every Means, except ſuch as are of too heating a Nature: In Colds which attack the Head, the Regimen ought not be too low, leaſt the Complaint ſhould deſcend upon the Lungs.</p>
            <p>To wear ſoft Flannel next the Skin can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be too ſtrongly recommended to thoſe who labour under any Affection of the Lungs, or Weakneſs of the Bowels. The ſame Expedient will be found ſerviceable in the Rheumatiſm, and in all ſcorbutic, dropſical, hypocondriac and melancholic Complaints.</p>
            <pb n="27" facs="tcp:1000500300:33"/>
            <p>In each of the above Caſes, ſtrong Friction upon the Skin, eſpecially the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of the Stomach and Bowels, and along the Spine, may be employed with conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Effect.</p>
            <p>The Cuſtom of Sea-Bathing, and of drinking the Mineral Waters, on every Occaſion, derives more Support, I doubt, from the powerful Sanction of Faſhion, than from any decided Teſtimony of their being always ſalutary and efficacious.</p>
            <p>This much I may venture to ſay, that they ſhould be either ſeldom recurred to, or adminiſtered with much Diſcretion. Many of the Mineral Waters are impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated with very active Ingredients, and by too frequent Uſe, impair, and wear out the Conſtitution; and Cold-Bathing is inimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal to the Lungs, and in many Inſtances, has paved the Way for bilious Complaints, and Obſtructions of the Viſcera.</p>
            <p>To dip regularly in cold Water, in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy, is highly proper. It checks redun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:1000500300:34"/>Growth, ſtrengthens the ſoft Fibres, and confirms the Stamina.</p>
            <p>Sound Sleep, continued for ſeven or eight Hours, is, in general, quite ſufficient for the Purpoſe of Reſtoration, yet female, and delicate Conſtitutions require rather more.</p>
            <p>Too much Sleep weakens the Nerves, renders the Temper peeviſh, and prediſpoſes to Apoplexy and Palſy, it likewiſe creates a lethargic and indolent Diſpoſition, diſqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifies for Action, and blunts the Energy both of the intellectual and corporeal Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. On the other Hand, nothing can be more pernicious than the Loſs of Sleep, and Want of due Reſt. Watching, by exciting an artificial Fever, and by ſtimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating the nervous Syſtem, when its Powers are already exhauſted, effectually waſtes the Strength, debilitates the Body, and lays it open to every Attack, eſpecially to nervous and phrenitic Fevers.</p>
            <pb n="29" facs="tcp:1000500300:35"/>
            <p>The Duration of Sleep muſt be propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned rather to the Nature of the Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, than to the Degree of Exerciſe, or Labour. In lax and tender Habits, the natural Motion and Attrition in the Syſtem, exhauſt and diſſipate the vital Strength much ſooner than in thoſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiutions which are hardy and robuſt; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, the former require longer Sleep, to repair the Waſte and Conſumption, than what is neceſſary for the latter. Beſides, in thoſe who have much Exerciſe, or La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, the Powers of Circulation being more complete, and the Sleep more mature, the Buſineſs of Nature is ſooner performed.</p>
            <p>A Life of Labour, and conſtant Action is commonly accompanied with Vigour, and good Spirits; but it muſt be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that, from the ſame Cauſe, the Fibres grow rigid, and the fine Tubes become impervious and unfit for Motion and Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation, in a ſhorter Space of Time; hence the Period of Exiſtence is ſhortened, and yet the ſame Exiſtence, deprived of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutary
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:1000500300:36"/>Effects of continued Exerciſe, might have been prematurely terminated, by the Invaſion of ſome Diſeaſe generated from Eaſe, Indolence, or Retirement.</p>
            <p>Study, or intenſe Thought of any Kind, eſpecially if fixed on ſome individual and intereſting Object, very ſpeedily conſumes the Nervous Power, within the Brain, (while the reſt of the Syſtem is deſtitute of its Influence) and therefore requires as long, and indeed longer Sleep to recruit the Strength and repleniſh the Spirits, than hard Labour does.</p>
            <p>I have noticed that Animals of the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite Gender thrive better when they reſt or ſleep near each other, than thoſe of the ſame Gender do. I ſhall not make any Application, but only ſay, that, whatever that Circumſtance may be owing to, it is ſurely better to ſleep alone than with an unhealthy and diſagreeable Companion.</p>
            <pb n="31" facs="tcp:1000500300:37"/>
            <p>Heavy Suppers, much Reading, Study, or any conſiderable Agitation, or Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Mind, near the Hour of going to Bed, all tend to prevent ſound Sleep, and to occaſion Dreams. The drinking of Tea, Coffee, or any other thin, weak Liquor will alſo retard Sleep.</p>
            <p>Sound Sleep, properly ſpeaking, is that State of perfect Quiet in the Mind, which does not admit, or rather is not accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with any Perception whatever.</p>
            <p>Dreams, therefore, may be termed a Kind of half Sleep, and may be occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by any Irritation that excites the ſmalleſt Degree of Motion in the Syſtem, beyond that Point of Tranquillity which conſtitutes, real or ſound Sleep. If there be any ſuch Thing as preternatural Dreams, I confeſs myſelf entirely unable to account for them.</p>
            <p>Fulneſs and Flatulency in the Stomach, together with lying on the Back, in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of relaxed Nerves, are the Cauſes of
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:1000500300:38"/>the Night-Mare. Thoſe, accordingly, who are troubled with this unwelcome Gueſt, ſhould ſtrengthen the Nervous Syſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem, lie upon the Side, and drink a Glaſs of Wine, or ſtrong Spirits and Water, going to Bed.</p>
            <p>An Appetite for Food or Nouriſhment is an almoſt infallible Sign of Health: but if the Digeſtion be not, at the ſame Time, regular and perfect, it is a falſe Appetite, ariſing either from ſome preternatural Sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulus, or from luxurious Living, hence the Stomach craves more than is neceſſary. The Simplicity of Food has numerous Advocates, and there is no Doubt but, the more Variety the Stomach is accuſtomed to, the more Dainties, and perhaps the larger Quantities are needful. The Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Living ſhould, therefore, be regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated from the earlieſt Period. The Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren of poor People, who are likely to live hard, ſhould, from the firſt, be accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to plain and ſubſtantial Food, and ſeldom allowed many Rarities. They
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:1000500300:39"/>ſhould learn to take whatever is offered them, to prevent their Stomachs from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too nice; but nothing to which they ſeem to have a fixed Diſlike ſhould be forced upon them: it is as dangerous as it is unnatural.</p>
            <p>The Practice of cramming Children with Materials of every Kind, countenanced by ſome Gentlemen of the Faculty, with a View to ſtrengthen and corroborate their Stomachs, is too abſurd, in my Opinion, to challenge Animadverſion. Such Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment muſt load them with noxious and ſuperfluous Humours, train them up for Epicureans, and by over Diſtenſion of the Stomach, and Preſſure upon the Lungs, and the adjacent Bowels, it cannot but ſow the Seeds of a Multiplicity of Diſorders, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly of the nervous Kind. It muſt alſo contribute to weaken their Intellects, and incur the future Danger of apoplectic, epileptic, and paralytic Attacks.</p>
            <pb n="34" facs="tcp:1000500300:40"/>
            <p>Gormandizing, or immoderate eating, in grown People, is productive of ſimilar Conſequences, Conſequences proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly more immediate, and deſtructive, as the Effects of Repletion, in Maturity, are always more violent and fatal than in Infancy.</p>
            <p>Thoſe who eat plentifully ſhould drink liberally too, as that will promote the Digeſtion, and accelerate Chylification, and Ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nty Meal, but the laſt Alternative is, by far, the worſt; it is a Subſtitute that ſhould, on no Account, be employed, eſpecially as it always does moſt Miſchief, when the Stomach is moſt empty.</p>
            <p>The intemperate Uſe of ſpirituous Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors maintains a continual Fever, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys the Tone of the Nerves and Solids,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:1000500300:41"/>and at length makes them callous; it inflames the Blood, carries it through the Lungs, and towards the Brain, with great Rapidity, ruptures the Mouths of the ſmall Veſſels, indurates the Viſcera, or Bowels, and erodes the Kidneys. Hence a Train of complicated Maladies, too tedious to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe or enumerate.</p>
            <p>If Liquor be recurred to, with a View to keep up the Spirits, it ſoon evaporates with the increaſed Flow occasioned by it, if it be uſed to relieve Anxiety of Mind, the tranſient Serenity is quickly ſucceeded by a ſtill deeper Gloom, and if it be admitted to exhilarate the ſocial Hour of convivial Enjoyment, Moderation ſhould always fill the Cup, and not ſuffer one to affront his Friend, deſtroy his Health, or ſtupify his Senſes.</p>
            <p>Animal Food is certainly too freely uſed in this Country. The uſual Proportion ſtimulates too much, gives a denſe, or a putreſcent Craſis to the Blood, (according
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:1000500300:42"/>as the Habit is ſtrong, or weak,) and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces Acrimony, and thus it ultimately propagates the Cauſes of Obſtructions, of putrid, and nervous Diſeaſes: It generates Bile, is the leading Cauſe of the Scurvy, and foſters the Gout and Rheumatiſm. At the ſame Time it muſt be admitted, that the State of the Air is ſuch, in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, as demands a Diet rather warm and ſtimulating, to counteract the moiſt, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxing Quality of it.</p>
            <p>Low and abſtemious Living, and a thin, watery, vegetable Diet, robs the Body of competent Nouriſhment, unbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces the Stomach and Nerves, diſſolves the Blood, diminiſhes the Action of the Veſſels, and reduces the Syſtem below the Standard of Health: Hence a Prediſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to all the Diſeaſes which ariſe from Debility and Relaxation. Yet a very ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Diet, if the Habit has been accuſtomed to ſuch, will preſerve the Ballance, give Spirits and Vivacity, and ſupply all the Springs of Health: In ſhort, it is Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:1000500300:43"/>rather than Quality that repleniſhes the Waſte, and affords the true Nutrition of Animal Life. Simple Food (in ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Quantity) digeſts, circulates, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairs, gradually, ſmoothly, and with Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, whereas the rich, high ſeaſoned Repaſt occaſions Perturbation, Heat, and Excitement, and thus very frequently diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipates and carries off, by the different Diſcharges, a conſiderable Portion of nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tritious Juices, and leaves the Body weak, enervated, and collapſed, inſtead of nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing and recruiting the Syſtem, by its own Addition. Hence it is that high Living demands Luxury to ſcrew up the Nerves to their uſual Pitch, and hence it is alſo that, being over-ſtrained, they ſoon wear out and break.</p>
            <p>A Diet, conſiſting chiefly of Milk and Vegetables, has been found, in ſeveral In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, to renovate the Conſtitution, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move Sterility, and eradicate ſome of the moſt obſtinate, chronic Complaints.</p>
            <pb n="38" facs="tcp:1000500300:44"/>
            <p>Regimen, I am convinced, can produce the moſt ſalutary Effects, but it needs particular Skill to direct it. A Patient, in paſſing from a higher to a lower, or from a lower to a higher Regimen, muſt be carried, Step by Step, as Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances will admit, with great Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpection.</p>
            <p>Tea and Coffee have long been Subjects of Reprobation with the Faculty; but I am apprehenſive that theſe Articles of Living have been too raſhly condemned, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out proper Inveſtigation, or good Grounds. I look upon them rather as medicinal, than dietetic, and would, therefore, adviſe to uſe them ſparingly.</p>
            <p>Coffee is a warm, ſtimulating Cordial, and increaſes all the Secretions</p>
            <p>Tea ſeems, in general, to be rather irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating on an empty Stomach, but is very ſuitable, at a proper Interval after Dinner. It then dilutes, aſſiſts Digeſtion, quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:1000500300:45"/>Thirſt, and exhilarates the Spirits.—</p>
            <p>Porter, fortunately for this Metropolis, is a good, nutritious, wholeſome Liquor: yet I doubt there is ſomething of a narcotic Quality added to it, which ought not to be. It requires Exerciſe, and ſhould not, I think, be drank too new; it is doubtleſs more perfect, and more digeſtible, when moderately ſtale.</p>
            <p>The exceſſive Uſe of Tobacco, in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever manner it may be exhibited, heats the Blood, hurts Digeſtion, waſtes the finer Part of the Fluids, and relaxes the Nerves. It is moſt beneficial to People of groſs and corpulent Habits, who have but little Exerciſe, and breathe foul Air.</p>
            <p>Nothing can be more ridiculous, or more pernicious than the Practice of eating and drinking Things very hot. It ſpoils the Teeth, brings on the Tooth-Ach, weakens the Head and Eyes, ruins the Stomach, and does abundance of Miſchief.</p>
            <pb n="40" facs="tcp:1000500300:46"/>
            <p>It is, at all Times, hurtful to faſt too long, but more particularly in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. It admits a Redundancy of Air into the Stomach, and the whole Body ſuffers by it.</p>
            <p>It would be better, in my Opinion, if Breakfaſt were to become a more ſolid Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment than it is, in this Country. An Addition would afford a more durable Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port through the fatiguing Part of the Day, and whether it were to ſuperſede the Cuſtom of a Luncheon, or not, an equivalent De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction would be very properly ſubſtracted from Dinner, which is generally more plentiful than it ought to be, among thoſe who are not limited by Oeconomy.</p>
            <p>Supper ſhould be light, and proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Degree of Exerciſe that is to ſucceed. The Quantity of Supper ought juſt to be ſufficient to repleniſh the Waſte which the different Functions neceſſarily make. If any more be received into the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:1000500300:47"/>Stomach, too great a Portion of the Ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Power is determined to that Organ, and expended there in the Work of Digeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, while, at the ſame Time, the Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluity continues to excite an unſeaſonable Stimulus in the Syſtem, which ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main, as much as poſſible, in a quieſcent State, during Sleep, and leaves an unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Quantity of Materials in the Stomach, next Morning, which ought, then, to be nearly empty, and to contain little more beſides the gaſtric or common Liquor of the Stomach.</p>
            <p>Water, as being a Vehicle particularly connected with all the Departments of Nouriſhment, deſerves proper Attention. Pure, cold Water acts as a tonic or corrobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, internally, in the Stomach, as well as applied externally. It paſſes off gently by the different Excretions, it dilutes the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line, and corrects the bilious Part of the Blood. Bad Water muſt be inimical to Health, according to the Manner and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in which it happens to be impregnated
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:1000500300:48"/>with heterogenous Matter. Snow Water, and Water that freezes moſt readily into Ice, are found to be the pureſt of all; the next in Purity is Rain Water, which falls in moderate Weather, and then River Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which runs with a brisk Current. Spring Water, in paſſing through the Strata of the Earth, often imbibes mineral, and other Ingredients, and accordingly becomes more objectionable: Nevertheleſs it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly and very properly uſed, becauſe it is more readily obtained in a pure State, than any of the former generally are. The pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt Water is that which has neither Taſte, Colour, nor Smell; that which is lighteſt and moſt limpid; that which eaſily lathers with Soap: and that which does not effer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſce or bubble, nor form any Sediment when good Vinegar, or Spirits of Sal Ammo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niac is put into it. The moſt certain Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of purifying Water is by Diſtillation, and the moſt commodious and eaſy, is by boiling. The Influence of Fire deſtroys Animalculae, and by diffuſing the compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Parts of Water, it affords an Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:1000500300:49"/>for the fixed Air, and the too volatile Particles to evaporate, and by the ſame Means, decompoſes the Combinations, ſo that the earthy and foreign Ingredients fall to the Bottom. Filtration, the Mixture of Chalk or Sand, Expoſure to the open Air, and allowing it due Time to ſettle, are, indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidually, conducive towards the Purification of Water.</p>
            <p>The Influence of the Moon, in her differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Phaſes, upon the Earth, is a Matter well known: And authentic Obſervations ſeem to confirm the Opinion, that Commotions in the Animal Syſtem, and the Attack of febrile, epileptic, and other Diſeaſes, as well as periodical Alterations, are, in a certain Degree, coincident with the Returns of the new, and full Moon. For my own Part, although I have no Doubt about the Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of this Doctrine; yet my own Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations have not been ſo accurate on this Point, as to eſtabliſh any invariable Rules which I could preſume to offer as a Guide.</p>
            <pb n="44" facs="tcp:1000500300:50"/>
            <p>A Pendulum of any Kind, ſuſpended in ſuch a Manner as to receive no other Motion except that conveyed to it by the Pulſation of ſome of the large Arteries of a Perſon in Health, makes a certain Number of ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Vibrations than ordinary, correſponding to the Hour of the Day. If the Poſition be true, (which I have often proved, by reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Right Arm over a Cup, or common Beer Glaſs, holding one End of a Piece of Thread, between the Thumb and Finger, with a Ring, or ſuch like faſtened to the other End, which reached towards the Center of the Cavity) the Inference muſt be, that there is a certain Number of extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Pulſations in the Arterial Syſtem, within the Space of every Hour, varying with the Sun's Diſtance from the Meridian. This Experiment I only mention as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving further Inveſtigation, as it might lead to the Diſcovery of thoſe Periods when the Paroxyſms of Fevers, &amp;c. may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected; and thus aſcertain the moſt proper Time for the Exhibition of Medicines.</p>
            <pb n="45" facs="tcp:1000500300:51"/>
            <p>I have known In Inſtances where Muſic af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded effectual Relief in the moſt violent Pain; and believe that its Powers might be ſo managed as to be ſerviceable in ſome acute, and nervous Caſes.</p>
            <p>No virulent, infectious, or contagious Diſeaſe can poſſibly be communicated but by Means of ſome of the morbific Particles coming in Contact with, and finding Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion into the Body, which muſt alſo be, at the ſame Time, in a State adapted for the Reception, and Nouriſhment or Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation of the invading Particles.</p>
            <p>Therefore the general Plan of Defence againſt every Species of Infection muſt be, to avoid the Contact of its Effluvia, or to repel and diſſipate them, when in Contact.</p>
            <p>In the Lues Venerea, and Itch, where the infectious Matter is palpably depoſited, waſhing and cleanſing the Parts will often deſtroy the Infection.</p>
            <pb n="46" facs="tcp:1000500300:52"/>
            <p>In all infectious Diſeaſes, ſuch as the Small Pox, Meaſles, putrid, peſtilential, and epidemic Fevers, the Air is the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium, (except when they are communicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Means of infected Clothes, and ſuch like,) and conſequently the Skin, and the internal Surface of the Mouth, Noſe, Lungs, and Stomach, are the Points of Contact, and all theſe Parts have Pores of Admiſſion.</p>
            <p>The beſt Method then, in theſe Caſes, will be to chew aromatic and pungent Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances in the Mouth, to impregnate the ambient Air with volatile and correcting Particles, and to brace the Stomach with ſuch Things as are ſtimulating and anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſceptic.</p>
            <p>Almoſt every Year, and often at different Seaſons of the ſame Year, there happen pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing Fevers, which are very perplexing to the Relatives of ſuch as labour under them. The natural Duties of Humanity conſtrain their Attendance, their Appre henſions of Danger to themſelves and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies excite their Solicitude, and the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:1000500300:53"/>given by the attending Faculty to their anxious Enquiries whether or not the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe be infectious, are ſeldom ſatisfactory, and perhaps not always quite judicious.</p>
            <p>Let me then, in Regard of this Matter, obſerve, in few Words, that almoſt all the Fevers that occur between the Months of April and November, if they do not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from what is termed catching Cold; if they be not regular intermittent; if they ſeem different from any of the known Claſs of common Fevers; and if they be attended with peculiar Symptoms, ſuch as an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary quick Pulſe, extreme Debility, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive Sickneſs at Stomach, violent Pain in the Head, Sleepineſs, Deafneſs, and Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium; if Circumſtances and Appearances be ſuch, I ſay, there is too much Reaſon to believe that the Fevers in Queſtion are, more or leſs, of an infectious and epidemic Kind. Indeed, it is to be remembered, that morbid Effluvium of any Sort, whether infectious or not, when it comes in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tact frequently, and in conſiderable Quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, always carries Danger with it. It
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:1000500300:54"/>has a procreative Power, or Power of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating ſomething ſimilar to itſelf. No Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der then, that thoſe who are much expoſed to the Breath and Perſpiration of diſeaſed Perſons ſhould loſe their Health: neither is it ſtrange that thoſe Fevers, which have juſt been deſcribed, ſhould ſpread gradually from one Individual, and from one Family to another.</p>
            <p>Beſides the principal Cauſes already enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merated, there are many others which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Health and occaſion Diſeaſes. All the different Situations and Employments in Life, eſpecially of the mechanical Kind, are, more or leſs, productive of Diſeaſes pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to the Nature and Circumſtances of each. But as the Diſcuſſion of theſe would exceed my Plan, and perhaps be more te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious than deſirable, I ſhall ſatisfy myſelf with adding ſome promiſcuous Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on the Animal Oeconomy.</p>
            <p>The Laxity of the Fibres and the Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Circulation in Children, render
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:1000500300:55"/>them extremely ſuſceptible of Irritation and Diſorder from whatever is heating, or ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulating. The chief Buſineſs therefore muſt be to keep them cool and eaſy. They ſhould undergo (thoſe eſpecially who are weak or ricketty) the Cold-Bath, be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the open Air, and live upon a light, cool Diet. How pernicious then, muſt it be to habituate them to ſpirituous Liquors, which is too frequently offered to Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, and to pamper them with whatever their Fancy prompts them to aſk!</p>
            <p>The firſt Impreſſion on the human Syſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem in all Caſes, has the greateſt Effect, and the more it has been accuſtomed to Impreſſions of every Kind, the leſs liable will it be to Agitation and Diſorder, in future. The Advantage then, of carrying Children through the Small-Pox, Meaſles, and all the other infectious and endemical Diſeaſes which await them, as early as poſſible, cannot but appear evident. They undergo theſe Complaints with leſs Danger before their Fluids are contaminated, and
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:1000500300:56"/>alſo become leſs ſubject to the Attack of other accidental Diſorders, in Conſequence of their Habit being rather meliorated, and their Conſtitution, in ſome Meaſure, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by Emorbification, or the Abatement of morbid Tendency.</p>
            <p>If the firſt juvenile Senſations be ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive, of what infinite Importance muſt not prudent and judicious Management be, towards forming the Temper, inſpiring the Genius, bending the Propenſities, and directing the tender impulſive Movements, during the ſoft, flexible Period of dawning Years! It is true, the Miniature of the Frame is modelled by the Proceſs of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and receives the Texture, Lines and Proportion, which particularize it, from the ſame original Hand. This Baſis or Ground Work, it muſt ever be impoſſible to alter, with Regard to its firſt Principles of Struc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Organization. Nevertheleſs, the ductile Fibres are eaſily capable of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion and Modulation, therefore the brighteſt Springs of the Syſtem may be
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:1000500300:57"/>moved, cheriſhed and augmented, and alſo the Exuberancy and Diſproportion of Parts ſuppreſſed, faſhioned and amended. I do not conceive, that the Rudiments of a Fool can be refined into the Luſtre of a Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher, nor that the natural Endowments of Parts and Abilities can be debaſed and adulterated down to the Level of the moſt common Materials, or the meaneſt Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, but I am very certain that much Good, or Harm, may be done to the tender Plant of human Life, when it firſt begins to vegetate.</p>
            <p>In the ſame Path of Inveſtigation may be traced the Laws of Phyſiognomy, ſo far as they concord with ſolid Reaſon, and the Teſt of phyſical Knowledge.</p>
            <p>It is ſufficiently evident to common Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, that the Shape of the Head, of indeed every Animal, correſponds with the Nature of the Intellect. Hence it muſt follow, that a certain Conformation, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion or Extenſion of Parts or Lines (as
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:1000500300:58"/>well as Texture and Principles) is indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly requiſite for the Performance of the Faculty of Perception, and the ſeveral pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſive and combined Operations that ariſe from it. For the ſame Reaſon it is, that a ſquare, or angular Form of the Brain will not anſwer the Purpoſe, and that a circular or globular Figure is, conſequently, neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary. The Face and Head are the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Phyſiognomical Parts, as they imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately ſhew the true Mould and Meaſure which circumſcribe the prime Movement, or the Brain.</p>
            <p>A flat Face or Features, moſt probably, will not admit, or carry on a Motion in the Mind competently full and diſtinct, this therefore, may be the Indication of Defici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency or Weakneſs of Intellect. Pointed, prominent, and acute Lines, may, no Doubt, portend Exceſs, Depth, and Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowneſs of intellectual Motion; accordingly Ferocity and Obſtinacy may reſult from the former, Cunning and Sagacity from the next, and Malevolence and Peeviſhneſs from the latter.</p>
            <pb n="53" facs="tcp:1000500300:59"/>
            <p>Elevation of Lines may beſpeak Pride, and Iraſcibility; and Depreſſion may intimate Inequality or Fickleneſs of Temper. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuberance of Lines, I would alſo hope, may indicate an Extent of Talents, and Depth of Judgment, as well as Strength of Impulſe, and Propenſity.</p>
            <p>It is further obvious enough that the Faculties of the Mind cannot poſſeſs a full Perfection and Congruity of Powers, unleſs there be a concomitant Proportion and Symmetry in the corporal Organs. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, any great Inequality or Irregularity of external Parts muſt, in ſome Meaſure, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh the Uniformity and Harmony of the Whole. It muſt cramp and confine the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordance of Motion, if the Diſparity of Parts be defective, and render the Move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment awkward and ungraceful, if the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parity be ſuperfluous.</p>
            <p>There is alſo obſerved a Conformity and Alliance between different Parts of the Body, conſiderably diſtant from one another,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:1000500300:60"/>conſequently the different Parts muſt originally be proportioned, to each other, and likewiſe, to the Whole. But it is cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable to believe, at the ſame Time, that a happy, internal Compages may, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, take Place, and counterbalance the Diſadvantages of unfavourable outward Signs.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs, all theſe Congruities and Diſparities muſt often be variable and falla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, if it were for no other Reaſon, but becauſe Magnitude and Energy are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, tho' generally, correſpondent.</p>
            <p>Thus, Phyſiognomical Relation may be marked, and carried to a conſiderable Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, with tolerable Preciſion: But if one Fancy be built upon another, which has nothing better than Fancy to ſupport it, the airy Phantom may be raiſed to a prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Height, and the Bubble ſuſpended, till, at laſt, it burſt, inviſible, in the ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantic Wilds of metaphyſical Deluſion.</p>
            <pb n="55" facs="tcp:1000500300:61"/>
            <p>The Female Conſtitution, being of a more delicate Conformation, and having a finer Texture of Nerves than the other Sex, gives Women a Quickneſs of Senſibility, and great Promptitude of Expreſſion; it ſoftens their Manners, refines their Ideas, and produces a lively Senſation of Pleaſure and Pain. But while they enjoy theſe Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, and are deſervedly Objects of Affection and Eſteem, the Softneſs, and peculiar Conſtruction of their Frame ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject them to many painful and critical Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſſitudes, which, as they affect both their Health and Temper, fully entitle them to all poſſible Lenity and Indulgence.</p>
            <p>When the important Period of Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruation arrives, much depends upon proper Management. A ſedentary Life, Reſtraint, and Confinement, about that Time, are very unfavourable, while mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate Exerciſe, the open Air, chearful Society, and Indulgence are highly requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite. Hard Work, and Expoſure to much Cold, and to damp Air, are too dangerous
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:1000500300:62"/>to be hazarded, even among the pooreſt People.</p>
            <p>Equal Care, and ſimilar Means muſt be employed, towards that critical Time of Life, when the Tide of Circulation begins to ebb. The more ſlowly and gradually this ſalutary Evacuation is diminiſhed, the leſs is the Conſtitution expoſed to Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, on its final Termination. It is, therefore, always adviſeable (unleſs it be in ſome relaxed Habits, where the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge has been too copious) to take due Pains and proper Steps to prolong its Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance, and thus ſecure the Syſtem from the bad Conſequences of an abrupt and haſty Departure.</p>
            <p>It is a juſt Obſervation that thoſe, who grow up very faſt, are generally ſickly, and ſeldom live to a great Age. The Prime of their Life draws very ſoon towards the Verge of Declenſion, which Stage, like their Youth, is equally rapid in its Progreſs. The Caſe is this. Quick Growth draws
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:1000500300:63"/>out and elongates the Fibres and Veſſels to a greater Extenſion than the gradual In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of the vital Powers can nouriſh and ſupport; hence the Conſtitution becomes weakly and relaxed. This Error, in the Procedure of Nature, ſhould be remedied, if practicable, by the Cold Bath, and tonic Medicines.</p>
            <p>The premature Indulgence of amorous Deſires, in the early Bloom of Youth, is productive of the moſt ruinous Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences. At this Period, the Mind grows warm and well adapted to imbibe a proper Fund and Connexion of Ideas, through the favourable Diſpoſition of the Nerves; and the Body begins to germinate and gather Firmneſs and Vigour from the Matura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of its Juices, eſpecially thoſe of the Glands, which now unfold and afford a Repoſitory, for the lymphatic and nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Part of the Fluids, to anſwer the Emergencies of Nature. But the unſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Purſuit of unripe Enjoyment blaſts theſe promiſing Fruits, draws off Health,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:1000500300:64"/>and Genius from the Syſtem, through the Channel of Pleaſure, and inevitably ſhortens Life.</p>
            <p>When the Conſtitution approaches its Zenith or confirmed State, if the ſocial Impulſe occaſion Diſorder, and reject Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trol, its Effects are too important to be neglected, as they often have the greateſt Influence upon the whole Frame. An ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite Senſibility in the Nervous Syſtem united with ſufficient Powers in the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation, on the one Hand, and a full, and cold phlegmatic Conſtitution, on the other, are the two Extremes of Temperament which particularly require Indulgence; the former, in Order to diminiſh that Plenitude and Irritation, which (if not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved) might produce Frenzy, Fevers, Inflammations, &amp;c. and the latter, on Purpoſe to create that Excitement and Action in the Nerves and Veſſels, which are neceſſary to prevent Obſtructions, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptions, Hypocondria, &amp;c.</p>
            <pb n="59" facs="tcp:1000500300:65"/>
            <p>Continued Celibacy generally loads the Glands, retards the Circulation, and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions Fulneſs and Stagnation in the Veſſels. In this State, the Mind, unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panded by the ſoft Fire of mutual Rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, often becomes gloomy, ſelfiſh, and contracted, and all its Faculties, being confined within the narrow Compaſs of ordinary Gratifications, are devoted to Habits of parſimonious Care, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templative Amuſement.</p>
            <p>Temperance is the beſt Pledge for Longevity, nevertheleſs, young People ſhould, by all Means, inure themſelves to the Hardſhips and Aſperities of Life. Without ſome Share of theſe to temper the lethargic Effects of Indolence, the Body ſinks into a State of Effeminacy and Imbecillity, and the Mind ſoon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes as feeble and inſignificant as the Body.</p>
            <p>Little Irregularities may, now and then, be committed with Impunity, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:1000500300:66"/>with Benefit, but frequent Shocks of Revelry and Debauch overſtrain the Syſtem, indurate the Solids, block up the fine vital Channels, and haſten the Approach of rigid old Age.</p>
            <p>The Animal Machine, from the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of its Organization, poſſeſſes a Power of regulating itſelf, and is conſtantly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſing this Power; therefore all Diſeaſes, if fully underſtood, are curable in the Beginning. The moſt robuſt Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion cannot, at all Times, be equally healthy, but is rather in a State of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Variation; and when the Efforts of Nature are inadequate to the Purpoſe of Regulation, Diſorder, in a correspond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Degree, muſt enſue. Nature, then, reſiſts every Species of Diſeaſe; and it is at thoſe Times, when the Nervous Syſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem is relaxed and exhauſted by Heat, Fatigue, Watching, Exceſs, &amp;c. or irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated by any of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ons, that the Body is particularly ſuſceptible of the Cauſe of Diſeaſes. Fear and Dread of
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:1000500300:67"/>any infectious Diſtemper, accordingly, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver fail to render a Perſon more liable to receive it.</p>
            <p>In incipient, as well as in confirmed Diſeaſes, the Calls of Nature ſhould be aſſiduouſly watched and regarded, ſince her Dictates and Indications are hardly ever er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous or improper, whether they point to Warmth, Coolneſs, Sleep, Excitement, Abſtinence, Nouriſhment, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Any Part of the Syſtem, that is either naturally infirm, or has ſuffered any Kind of Injury, is always moſt liable to the Invaſion of Diſeaſe and Pain, and ſhould, on that Account, be more particularly guarded and defended.</p>
            <p>The Approach of all febrile Diſeaſes is marked with ſome extraordinary Agitation in the Syſtem. Languor, Loſs of Strength, flying Pains, hideous Dreams, &amp;c. indicate ſomewhat morbid acting on the Nerves; but if theſe be attended with Nauſea at
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:1000500300:68"/>the Stomach, Chills, and alternate Glows, or Sweats, ſome acute Malady is much to be apprehended. Indeed Chills, (except after Meals and Evacuations) as they come by a Conſtriction of the Skin, and a general Spaſm through the Syſtem, from Debility, or Irritation, always import ſome Degree of Danger. From theſe Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of acute Diſeaſes, Caution ought to take the Alarm, and as it is ever eaſier to prevent than cure, it would be moſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſeable to arm and oppoſe their firſt Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances.</p>
            <p>The Habit is that State of Body peculiar to each, and, according as it varies from the Standard of Health, is, in an equal Meaſure, ſubject to Diſeaſe.</p>
            <p>A ſtrong and full Habit, (which is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally indicated by a full and hard Pulſe) in which the Quantity of Blood and Force of Circulation are greater than ordinary, though it has a Tendency towards inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matory Complaints, is ſtill infinitely leſs
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:1000500300:69"/>dangerous than the oppoſite Extreme, where the Habit is relaxed, and all the vital Powers languid and imperfect. Under ſuch Circumſtances the Body is open to all the Train of nervous Diſorders, to Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, Dropſy and Scurvy, and expoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Attack of intermittent, nervous, bilious and putrid Fevers: and if there be a ſuperfluous Quantity of half ſtagnant, in active Fluids in the Syſtem, at the ſame Time, the Danger is, in all Reſpects, augmented by it.</p>
            <p>A fat and groſs Habit is always nearly allied to Diſeaſe. The contrary, or rather the middle Temperament, is, by far the moſt healthy: It ſhews that the Offices of Digeſtion, Circulation and Secretion are regular and effective.</p>
            <p>If the common Exerciſes of Life, the Cold Bath, and moderate Living will not prevent, nor reduce Corpulency, it would be better to try the Help of Medicine, than be obliged to carry about ſo unpleaſant a Burthen as ſome People do.</p>
            <pb n="64" facs="tcp:1000500300:70"/>
            <p>It may not be improper here to give a Caution againſt frequent and unneceſſary Blood-letting, as being a very abſurd and pernicious Practice. Some think it di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhes Fatneſs, but I muſt aſſure them it has the contrary Effect, and that Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulency is increaſed by it, others ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that it corrects bad Humours, but that is likewiſe impoſſible, and many have Recourſe to it as ſovereign Remedy, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they are any wiſe indiſpoſed, but they ſhould remember that they are bringing themſelves into a very bad Habit, a Habit which waſtes the vital Fluid, impoveriſhes the Blood and debilitates the Conſtitution.</p>
            <p>The Force or Power of Habit is ſtrik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly exhibited to ſuch as accurately watch its Influence. I have obſerved it as an almoſt invariable Rule, that all Percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, whether of a pleaſing or painful Nature, return pretty exactly at ſtated, or equal Intervals; I mean that Anxiety, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, Fancy, Levity and Penſiveneſs, as well as Sleep, Hunger, and the other
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:1000500300:71"/>common Solicitations of Nature, make their Approaches nearly about the ſame Time that they have been uſually gratified and indulged.</p>
            <p>Now as the Influence of ſuch Perceptions muſt operate on the mental Faculties, in the Way of Coincidence and Recollection, and on the corporal Organs, agreeable to the Laws of the Syſtem, it muſt follow, that the ſureſt Method (when Reſolution is inadequate to the Taſk) to ſubdue any Habit, or Cuſtom, is to preſent new Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to the Mind, and provide different Impreſſions for the Body. Yet, however proper this Remedy may be, it muſt be conducted with Diſcretion, for Fear it ſhould imperceptibly degenerate into a Courſe of Diſſipation, a moſt pitiable and unhappy Courſe, in which, the reſtleſs Mind, warm in the Purſuit of new Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, becomes intoxicated with Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and miſſing the Path of rational En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment, loſes itſelf, inextricable, in a Labyrinth of Folly, Madneſs and Vexation.
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:1000500300:72"/>Wiſdom ſhould ever preſcribe Bounds to Deſire, and ſtill keep ſome Reſource to ſatisfy the various Wants of feeble old Age. If Youth and Maturity be ſpent in Exceſs and Diſſipation, if all the richeſt Stores of human Bliſs be laviſhly and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maturely exhauſted, and the Conſtitution ſha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tered in the wild Career, what new Expedients can be deviſed, what poſſible Means can be found to prop the tottering Fabric, or chear the dull Winter of declin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Years.</p>
            <p>The Regularity and Proportion, which is eſſential to Health, will not ſuffer much Deviation, in any Reſpect, from the Track of eſtabliſhed Cuſtom. Hence a Diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or Alteration in any of the common and habitual Evacuations, Secretions, or even Perceptions, changes the Equilibrium of the Syſtem, and very materially affects the Health and Conſtitution.</p>
            <p>When Diſorder is the Reſult of ſuch Circumſtances, the Ballance muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:1000500300:73"/>by promoting the Excretions which are retarded, or have ceaſed; by inviting the defective Circulation to the Parts which it has deſerted, or towards the Extremities, in general, by Means of Warmth, Friction, Exerciſe, or Fomentation; and by renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe Senſations and Incentives, which the Nerves ſtand in Need of, to increaſe their Energy, and to give free Scope and previous Impulſe to their nice, progreſſive Motions.</p>
            <p>But when the cuſtomary Evacuations and Emotions cannot be exactly reſtored, they ſhould be ſubſtituted by others as ſimilar in their Nature and Effects as poſſible.</p>
            <p>The Nerves being the Medium of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication between the different Parts of the Body, thoſe Parts, which poſſeſs the greateſt Nervoſity or Senſibility, as the Head, Lungs, Stomach, Womb, and the Skin, have the cloſeſt Connexion and Sympathy with each other.</p>
            <pb n="68" facs="tcp:1000500300:74"/>
            <p>Thoſe, therefore, who labour under nervous and hyſteric Affections, ſhould carefully avoid whatever produces diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Impreſſions on the Mind, and every Kind of Irritation that may occaſion un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſant Senſations on any of theſe ſuſcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible Organs, and ſhould particularly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frain from flatulent and indigeſtible Food.</p>
            <p>Intellectual Sympathy is one of the moſt refined Emotions of the human Mind. It originates in ſome ſtriking Congruity and mutual Harmony, and is excited by fine concording Impreſſions made by ſome Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject which creates Partiality and Eſteem, and is only perfect, when accompanied with an Idea that the attractive Impreſſion is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocal. This ſympathetic Endowment ever deſerves Cultivation and Improvement. It renders one capable of all the Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of ſincere Friendſhip, and can give and receive Conſolation in the Hour of Anxiety and of Pain.</p>
            <pb n="69" facs="tcp:1000500300:75"/>
            <p>Antipathy proceeds from ſomething that ſhocks the Imagination, or offends the Senſes: and when this happens to take Place in the tender Years of Infancy, and the Impreſſion has been forcibly received, the Antipathy frequently continues through Life. Such Antipathies are extremely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſant, and, I ſhould think, might be corrected by gradually familiarizing the offending Cauſe, but if the antipathetic Matter affect the Senſe of Smell, it will probably be more difficult to reconcile it.</p>
            <p>Antipathy furniſhes an Exception to the general Law of the Syſtem, which, it was ſtated, did always receive ſecondary Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions with leſs Effect than primary ones. It is, therefore, neceſſary to remark that when Anger, Terror, violent Fevers, deep Intoxication, or any other Cauſe, have once thrown the Syſtem into vehement and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive Agitations, (whereby the Nerves are irrecoverably ſtrained) the ſame, or nearly the ſame Cauſe, in but a very ſmall Degree, will produce ſimilar Effects, in the higheſt
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:1000500300:76"/>Degree: and theſe Effects will more eaſily take Place, in Proportion to the Frequency and Repetition of the impelling Cauſe. From which Conſideration may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Neceſſity of guarding againſt all violent Shocks, and of obviating their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences, as ſoon and effectually as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Children, and People of weak Nerves and delicate Conſtitutions ſhould be parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly careful in this Reſpect.</p>
            <p>Nervous and hyſteric Complaints, faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Fits, Convulſions, Madneſs and ſuch like frequently ſpring from this Source, and in Time, become fixed, habitually, or periodically.</p>
            <p>The ſame Advice muſt alſo be extended to pregnant Women, whoſe Imagination, or Paſſions, when violently excited, ſometimes, mark and injure the Foetus. There are ſo many incontrovertible Proofs of this Kind of Influence, that it is impoſſible to doubt the Certainty of it: which appears to me nowiſe queſtionable, ſince I can ſee no
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:1000500300:77"/>Difficulty to account for it, in a clear and rational Manner.</p>
            <p>Imitation is a very operative Faculty in the Animal Syſtem. It is a natural and ſpontaneous Action, whereby, without Volition, or even Conſciouſneſs, one Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon imitates and reſembles the Motions, Geſtures, or Perceptions of another. Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, ſinging, coughing, Laughter, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſinging, walking and Credulity which communicate, and paſs from one Perſon to another, like Electricity, are obvious Proofs that Similitude, or the imitative Faculty, is one of the primary, leading Motions in the human Mind, and bring no ſmall Evidence in Confirmation of what has been already ſaid on that ſubject.</p>
            <p>Stammering, and other bad Habits, and even Convulſions may be contracted from this Cauſe. Which Conſideration ſuggeſts a Caution ſufficient to induce People to pay due Regard to ſuch Companions and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects as are ſuffered to have Intercourſe
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:1000500300:78"/>with Children, and Perſons in a weak, nervous and irritable State.</p>
            <p>Imagination is the Exerciſe of primary Perception, or Perception of the firſt Forms and Colours, in which Images ſtrike the Mind, unaccompanied with, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently unaltered by the deliberative or reaſoning Operations. Imagination, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, conſiders Objects in the Light they firſt appear, which Appearance does not always correſpond with Intrinſicneſs or Reality; though very frequently the firſt View of the Mind is as accurate and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive as ſeveral Reviews or Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons are. When Memory or uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded Reflection repreſents Images to the Mind, theſe Images ariſe merely from the Power of Recollection, which is only the Operation of the firſt Claſs of Similitudes: but Images, which proceed from Judgment, are faſhioned with all the Rays and Shades of nice and minute Analogy; and theſe are often created without any Aſſiſtance from Memory. Hence Verſatility or Quickneſs
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:1000500300:79"/>of Imagination is often found to be a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial Quality, and on a Level only with the Depth of Memory. But if a warm and teeming Imagination be united with Solidity of Judgment, and profound Pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration, it beſpeaks the happieſt and nobleſt Compoſition of the human Syſtem.</p>
            <p>The Mind is exceedingly ſuſceptible of the two oppoſite Perceptions, Hope and Fear. They are the quick-born Offspring of Imagination, begotten by the Idea of Pleaſure, or Pain, whoſe Familiarity and Intimacy always afford them eaſy Acceſs to her Embraces.</p>
            <p>It will then manifeſtly appear that the Influence of Imagination, ſo far as regards the Cauſe and Cure of Diſeaſes, is nothing but the Effect of Hope, or Fear. But theſe Effects have been already explained in treating of the Paſſions. It muſt, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, be obvious whence a healthy Man may be frightened into a Fever, and a dying Perſon, in a Manner, quickened into
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:1000500300:80"/>Life, by the Inſtillation and Continuation of either of theſe Influences upon the Mind. Hence the Effect of Animal Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netiſm, and of Noſtrums, Charms and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantments, in ſometimes curing Agues, Fits and other Diſorders, which, in Truth, have no Value nor Utility but what they derive from this Source.</p>
            <p>Volition, or the Will, Purpoſe, or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, is either intentional, or actual; that is, Deſign intended, or Deſign executed. Of which neither the one nor the other is inſtantaneous, or immediately perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; they require both of them ſeveral of the progreſſive Operations of the Mind. For no Man ever had an Inclination or Will to do an Act, before he had firſt reaſoned upon it, and conſidered the End or Purport of ſuch an Act. The Mind cannot p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſſibly direct the Nervous Influence into the right Arm, in Preference to the left, (except in the common and habitual Motions of Walking and Geſticulation) till it has firſt poiſed itſelf or deliberated, and
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:1000500300:81"/>then it can give the voluntary Impulſe. Hence it is manifeſt beyond Contradiction, that every Perſon, of a ſound State of Body, is abſolutely a free Agent, and may either commit, or not commit any particular Act. But ſtill the Exerciſe of Common Senſe muſt be preſent in Order to conſtitute Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nality. If a Perſon err from Paſſion, it is Madneſs, if from Ignorance, or wrong Ideas, it is Miſtake, Both Caſes, are entitled to Alleviation and Compaſſion, and ſhould be weighed in the Scales of Humanity, with the fair Ballance of Candour, placed in the Medium of Excitement, to aſcertain the intrinſic Quality, and compute the true Degree of Right, or Wrong.</p>
