            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>I BEGAN my purſuit at five minutes paſt eleven in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and I continued it till within a quarter of twelve at night; the cloth and dinner all that time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining untouched upon the table; for I ſent your ſiſter one way, while I went another: but the labour of both hath terminated in diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

               <p>I Received your packet, every ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of which was calculated to afflict me—ah forbear my beloved Charles—forbear to charm me into a relapſe! you accuſe me of barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, when you ought to encourage me in virtue. I have made a ſacrifice my dear friend—late as it is, I have made a ſacrifice to devotion, and to duty. That I may not however ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer any longer the imputation of cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty, I will frankly reveal to you the motive—the only motive that could prevail with me to quit the ſociety of Charles.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:0226500401:22"/>To tell you the whole matter in a ſingle ſentence—I have ſeen a perſon who hath a greater right to Charles than Charlotte—I have ſeen—your wife. Ah, ſir, what an interview—? unprepared for the ſcene, how could I ſuſtain it? I ſunk under it; and your lady triumphed in all the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of privilege, and advantages of argument.—Surely heaven threw her in my way to ſhew me in bluſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing colours to her and to myſelf.— We had never met before, and as the meeting was delayed for more than four years, it was by ſo much the more aweful and inſupportable. Yet do not blame her Charles. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever may have been your diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and however multiplied the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0226500401:23"/>
cauſes that led originally to your diſunion, ſhe hath ſtill the right of a married woman, and deſerves to be heard. Nor can I complain of her conduct even upon ſo trying an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion—ſhe did not inſult, ſhe did not execrate: but, purſuing a much nearer way to the heart, ſhe appeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from my paſſions to my ſenſe of juſtice, and from my tenderneſs, to my truth. Oh! Charles, Charles, her pleadings were too pathetic to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted—I took her hand and bathed it with my tears, and ſhe followed the advantage ſhe had gained till ſhe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained that promiſe, which I have at length had the fortitude to perform.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:0226500401:24"/>Severe, I confeſs to you—ſevere, even to the verge of diſtraction, has been the <hi>conflict.</hi> Long I heſitated, long I remained undetermined; and even at laſt I have been compelled rather to ſtifle the riſing emotions of tenderneſs precipitately, than act upon the calm principles of delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.—Yet I have now been almoſt a week abſent, and am alive: though there is a ſtand of coaches oppoſite my window (any one of which would carry me to the only man I love up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on earth) I have had the courage to ſee them drive off and return, without filling a place in any one of them myſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:0226500401:25"/>No longer therefore accuſe a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour that challenges your admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, even while it afflicts you. My trunk, you may, if you pleaſe, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to my apartment, and my ſiſter (who being ignorant of our real ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation had better be ſtill kept ſo) I would recommend you to ſend home to her mother in the country, where the news, neither of our ſeparation nor its motive, may ever arrive. Be this as it may, return to you again I never can; and indeed, to ſhew you the impoſſibility of it, I have paid a voluntary viſit to Cleora, your law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful lady, to aſſure her we are parted for ever.

               <p>IN the agony of my heart I have equity enough to praiſe your he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roiſm, though it is daſhed with a ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance that aſcends to the very ſummit of enthuſiaſm.

               <p>Think not, Charlotte, I laugh at laws, or ridicule inſtitutions held ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred and obligatory. Dear girl, I do not laugh at them, but, in my par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular caſe, and in others ſimilar to mine, an ample apology is found in the dictates of nature, reaſon, and common ſenſe. I will not, nor indeed am I yet calm enough, to ramble into the detail of original grievances—thoſe grievances which produced a ſeparation from the wife of the law, who hath now ſeparated the wife of the ſoul. Suffice it to
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0226500401:28"/>
ſay, it was a raſh marriage, and ſoon repented on both ſides: the bitterneſs of conjugal repentance is beyond every other poignant, and happy is it if <hi>diſunion,</hi> rather than perpetuated <hi>diſagreement,</hi> reſults from it. Is this ſophiſtry? — Is this caſuiſtry? no Charlotte, it is ſimple, didactic ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, ratified by unprejudiced rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and ſtampt with the ſanction of unbigotted ſenſe—I feel as nicely as yourſelf the force of virtue, and the elegant triumphs of unſpotted cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, but I ſee no reaſon why thoſe, who, upon the evidence of more than two years experience, are unſuited to each other, "join'd, not match'd," ſhould live janglingly together, merely to pull the tight cord of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion

at different ends, and exiſt miſerably under the ſame roof, for the meagre ſatisfaction of having it to ſay, we fight it out friendly, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out parting.</p>
               <p>Egregious folly! and ſuperſtition and ſlavery in their extremes! you know the whole matter: my ſituati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on has been often delineated to you, and I will only deſire you to reflect attentively upon it, before I obey your cruel requeſt in relation to your trunk. Ah, Charlotte, how can I bear to ſee thoſe ſeveral ornaments purchaſed by my own hand in the oſtentatious fondneſs of ſhewing you to the admiring public as the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of your conſtant protector—

how can I bear to ſee theſe depart into any other dreſſing-room but that which belongs to you, and in which they are now waiting the return of her who honours them in the wear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. My dear, dear companion, it muſt not be: the laws of love and life, and reciprocated conjunction of hearts and minds forbid it. Think better—oh, think better of it—throw aſide the rigour of thoſe reſolutions which can produce no good, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit thoſe receiv'd ideas which will ſoften this unneceſſary ſeverity, and direct you to the ſighing boſom, and open arms of</p>

               </opener>
               <p>I ASK your pardon for detaining any part of your property after it was ſo peremptorily demanded. I have however now, though late, made re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of every thing which either your ſiſter's induſtry or mine, could find about your apartments—I have ſeen, madam, the trunk containing your dreſſes, and decorations carried upon the ſhoulders of a porter, coffin like; and had it been <hi>indeed</hi> your cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin my deſpair would have been only one degree ſuperior. Heavy as it is,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0226500401:33"/>
with what a joy ſhould I have ſtooped to the burden, and been myſelf the meſſenger; while the inſenſible ath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letic animal who is now ſuch, will be intent only upon the profits of his meſſage, and view only with a vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar amazement, the form of the fair tyrant who rejects her conqueſt, and and yet holds in chains her captive.</p>
               <p>Your concluding ſentiment enters a caveat againſt further argument, and ſhortens my letter. It is not, I perceive, the force of virtuous prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples drives you from me only, but the poiſon of averſion you have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived for thoſe open arms to which you were ſo tenderly, though I confeſs ſo officiouſly invited. Fear not, I
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0226500401:34"/>
beſeech you madam, the ſhortneſs of your life upon my account; it is in no danger from that quarter, and I do not doubt but your health and ſpirits will continue to encreaſe in proportion to the length of your ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.</p>
               <p>The point is plain enough, and I am ſorry your delicacy and ingenuity have been put to ſuch a ſtrait for an expedient. How extremely-<hi>á-pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos</hi> was your interview with Cleora! and how ſincerely do I congratulate you upon the lucky criſis in which it has united inclination and duty. I perceive they have gone in this affair, like friends, well, but unexpectedly met, hand in hand together. Four

I again beg your pardon, and promiſe to treſpaſs no more upon that time, which you are no doubt employing in more agreeable engagements than reading the letters of a <hi>caſt</hi> lover— perhaps the preſent hour is enlivened by the charms of a new acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and it may be, in the delirium of female vivacity upon the dear ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of liberty reſtored—that <hi>paradiſe regained</hi> to the ſoul of a woman— the name, I ſay, and infirmity of the neglected Charles may give additional zeſt to ſprightlineſs, and enhance the

               <p>NOW, indeed, Sir, you have nobly exerted yourſelf, and I ought to expreſs to you my thanks for taking the only method that could make me forget you. Were I not inexcuſably weak I <hi>ſhould</hi> do this, but I own you have wounded me: I own that your ſeveral ſar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſms have gone where you directed them—into the receſſes of my heart. Moſt ungenerous Charles, to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret that action into the moſt mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenary meanneſs, which, I ſummon the great God that inſpired it, to witneſs, proceeded from principle.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:0226500401:38"/>No, Sir; my ſpirits and health (if I may judge of the future, by the preſent) are <hi>not</hi> likely to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to me in proportion to the length of my abſence: nor was the abruptneſs of my departure the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of ſo much ingenuity as you may be pleaſed to imagine.—</p>
               <p>If you are yet capable of doing juſtice, I deſire you to reflect on the various ſtruggles I have at different times had ſince the commencement of our connection, upon the point that now carried me for ever from you! Even before I ſaw the lawful Cleora I ſhed many a tear, and heaved many a ſigh at the thought of that injury I was every hour
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0226500401:39"/>
committing againſt her. Nay, did I not twice before, even in the warmeſt tranſports of our tenderneſs, bring myſelf to the reſolution of leaving you? You purſued, perſuaded, pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vailed, and brought me back to guilty pleaſures. Seeing the life of Charles bound up in the ſociety of Charlotte, I endeavoured again to reconcile myſelf to my ſituation. I even adopted, in ſome degree, the ſophiſtry of your own ſentiments. I argued, as an apology, the innocence of my intention; the hearty deſire I had to ſerve your family, the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude I owe to the man, who im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved my underſtanding and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned my manners: and, in ſhort, I took refuge in a thouſand plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibilities,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0226500401:40"/>
rather than be torn on the rack of reflection, and leave a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety ſo inexpreſſibly dear to me.</p>
               <p>Auſpicious to the ſcheme of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfulneſs, it was about this time you know, Sir, that we began our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſions, and took the different tours of England, Ireland, and Scotland. The improvements I made in the courſe of theſe journies, the ſerenity of the ſeaſons in which they were, for the moſt part, performed, and the attracting benefits of ſo inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious a companion as Charles, ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended for a while the kneener ſenſe of an illicit connection. Yet, in the very boſom of bliſs I was never ſo dull as not to know that it
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0226500401:41"/>
                  <hi>was</hi> an illicit one; and therefore, proper to be broken. To break it, nevertheleſs, was far beyond the fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs of my power. The idea of Charles and all his faſcinating qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, mixt with every image, and made the leading feature of every figure that was formed by the ſoul. In repugnance to the conduct I ought to have purſued, I called to my aid all the ſeductions of imagination, and, when <hi>they</hi> failed, I derived the comforts of ſelf-deluſion, even from the pictures of truth—Is he not, ſaid I, induſtrious to juſtify my error, while I ſoothed my paſſion; is he not the man, who took me up in a more than orphan ſtate, and proved himſelf to me a father and a friend?
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0226500401:42"/>
Did he not find me a ruined crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture—a poor unfortunate wanderer, who had been juſt deſerted by the villain lord, who, taking advantage of ſimplicity had robbed my inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, and turned me unprovided upon the world—? Ought I not to bleſs the accident then that threw me in the way of this affectionate protector? From what irremediable miſery may he not have ſaved me? How indefatigable has been his ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs? How aſſiduous his efforts to ſupport me? How anxious and unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting his wiſhes and labours to place me in a way of ſupporting myſelf, againſt that day in which he might want life to exert himſelf? Was not this my firſt preceptor?
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0226500401:43"/>
Wanting the attentions of a parent, and an early victim to my credulity, did he not find me ſtepping into the very border of female violation? Was not our firſt interview in the very momentous criſis of a woman's fate; and was I not weeping, in the bitter ſincerity of my heart, over the proſpects of deſtruction?</p>
               <p>Surrounded by calamities like theſe, did not providence direct Charles to ſave me, as the guardian angel of an unhappy girl? and has not this very Charles preſerved his friendſhip unbroken, and his fidelity conſummate ever ſince the day of my deliverance?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:0226500401:44"/>Arguments like theſe, ſtrongly ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded by the feelings of my heart, did I frequently exert, till, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operating with the refinements of your converſation, and the charm I never failed to find in your enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining company, I had almoſt brought myſelf to believe there was nothing extremely wrong in our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe.</p>
               <p>Lulled, however, by this pleaſing lethargy of the ſenſes, and ſung to repoſe by the ſyren of tenderneſs, I argued myſelf into a tranſient ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renity, and indulged the ſoftneſs which I perceived to be ſo ſoothing. We compleated our deſigns, and returned from our rambles in the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0226500401:45"/>
Engliſh nation and its neighbouring countries, in order to viſit together the continent of France. Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions you know, Sir, were making for our <hi>route</hi> ſoon after our arrival in London, and the beginning of the next week was fixed for our departure.</p>
               <p>In the interim I met with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured Cleora, who told me in the moſt affecting manner, that, though ſhe never wiſhed a re-union with you, it would give that peace to her heart which was long loſt, if I would tear myſelf from your embraces. Agonized by her pleadings, and ſtung by the ſenſe of having wronged her, I fell upon my knee, and, ſolemnly in that ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>engaged</hi> to do what I <hi>have</hi> done.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:0226500401:46"/>I have nothing to do with your family differences Charles, nor ſhall I liſten to the ſtory of either party. Duty and conſcience are both con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in the meaſure I have taken, and I ſhall not be made to repent of it, even by the ſeverity of your up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braidings. It was, nevertheleſs, too much deſcending from the native dignity of your diſpoſition—too un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like the candour of Charles's charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to ſuppoſe a connection of four years eſtabliſhment, every day of which produced ſome evidence of its ſincerity, ſhould be ſacrificed to the very groſſeſt purpoſes in the firſt week's ſeparation. A new acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance! What would you inſinuate? To what indelicacy do you allude? I
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0226500401:47"/>
have a tear now falling upon that part of your letter, and I wiſh it had the power to blot both the ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and the recollection of it out of my memory for ever! With great reluctancy ſhall I admit any ideas that diſgrace the elegance of Charles's ſenſibility. Though duty commands me to quit his protection, my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his many eminent virtues, incline me to cheriſh his idea, and ſtill love him for his excellencies. I would moſt gladly conſider him as a friend, a correſpondent, and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous character: and, though we ſhall never meet again, the ſenſe of my obligations to him, and his own merits, might be a conſtant ſource of innocent contemplation to me:
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0226500401:48"/>
why, Charles will you rob me of ſo agreeable a refuge, perhaps the greateſt the whole world has now to afford me. Do you think Sir, then that I can ſo ſoon make a transfer of my affections? can I, think you, in ſo very ſhort a ſpace of time, <hi>command</hi> them from Charles to any accidental object? have I ſo convenient a heart —ſo obedient a verſality? what do you take me for? but indeed I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it all; ſhe who can bring her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to ſleep upon an unſanctified pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, four long twelve months, may well be ſuppoſed to perpetrate any thing that is wrong; and therefore I forgive you: although, in juſtice to myſelf, I muſt obſerve how I ſhudder, and how the blood runs from my
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0226500401:49"/>
heart, at the bare ſuggeſtion of ſuch perfidy.</p>
               <p>Indeed you wrong me; and I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bear you to entertain ſuch ideas: even though by entertaining them yourſelf, <hi>my</hi> image would be the ſooner obliviated. Though you found me a fallen woman, I am not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutionally a wretch of purchaſe, Sir. Your many amiable leſſons of mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity have not been ſo egregiouſly miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>employed. The virtue you have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcated, and the volumes you have put into my hand, have produced effects more ſalutary: nay Charles, it is to your own inſtructions — to your own cultivation of my head and heart, that I have been induced to
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0226500401:50"/>
undertake the magnanimity of this action. With reſpect to reſources— ſuch I mean as are neceſſary, merely neceſſary to the preſervation of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man life, it is impoſſible that I ſhould be deſtitute of them, while I have health; and the power who encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged me to a good action will not, I truſt, ſuffer the ſharpneſs of pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to reſult from it. But even if he ſhould, I ſhall eat no longer the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter bread of adultery, and conſidering that puniſhment proportioned to the offence, ſhall kiſs the omnipotent rod without complaining, and ſupplicate the aids of penitence and patience till my ſentence is ſoftened, and the puniſhment remitted.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:0226500401:51"/>For the ſupport of life, I have no doubt but that induſtry will enable me to get a ſufficiency. You, Charles, have not ſuffered me to lead a life of idleneſs: I am ſkilled in the elegant labours of the needle: I can embroid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: I have ſome little knowledge of thoſe employments which may aſſiſt me from applying to the milliners— nay, and—ſuch has been the effect of your inſtructions—I am not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of undertaking the elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary principles of female education. Here, indeed Charles, I feel a ſevere ſtroke from reflection.

               <head>LETTER XVI. CHARLES to CHARLOTTE.</head>
               <opener>
                  <salute>Too amiable CHARLOTTE.</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>WHEREFORE do you thus officiouſly labour to extort my approbation? and wherefore have you not left it in my power to cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure you? were there any hard part in your character—had you cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritably left me but one ſingle cruelty, on which I might have founded a reaſonable complaint, ſo that I might have ruminated upon it till I had argued myſelf into averſion, it might
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0226500401:54"/>
have been more tolerable: but you are obſtinately bent upon murdering me by your goodneſs, and every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment increaſe the admiration which I ought to feel daily diminiſhing. The laws of the land and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions of cuſtom have thrown the arguments ſo abundantly on your ſide, that 'tis impoſſible to baffle them without ſeeming to ſophiſticate. Fool and idiot that I was, to run into the ſhackle that galls for life, and to bind it like a volunteer ſlave, on my own leg! and yet, Charlotte, you have aſſiſted Cleora in acting contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Does ſhe not by her own confeſſion militate againſt a re-union? does ſhe not declare the miſery, of which ſhe foreſees, it would be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive?
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0226500401:55"/>
to what end then—to what end, but the moſt cruel and unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary one, ſhould ſhe wiſh to effect a ſeparation between Charles and Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotte? Cleora and Charles entertain not for each other either hatred or love; indifference is the point be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them. And what virtuous purpoſe is likely to ariſe from the parting, in which ſhe has been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental.</p>
               <p>But you are, I ſee, too immerſed in eſtabliſhed ideas and the cuſtoms of a country, to admit a ſingle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception to a general rule: although a minute's reflection would convince you that <hi>my</hi> caſe and <hi>yours</hi> are ſuch
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0226500401:56"/>
as ſhould be abſolutely ſet apart from almoſt every other.</p>
               <p>Ah, inflexible Charlotte, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have you ſhielded your heart from the dear arrows of love under the bulwark of ſuch venerable max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims—maxims, which, be their gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral tenor ever ſo admirable, muſt always allow deviation in certain caſes. How eaſy were it to prove that, in ſtrict ſpeaking, it would be abſurd and irrational even to unite again with Cleora. Nay, to put our of the queſtion every other plea, and rely only on the energy of a ſingle argument: the argument of our mutual <hi>indifference,</hi> is it not (demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrably) ridiculous to live a love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0226500401:57"/>
life with any being? Peculiar circumſtances, of temporal diſtreſs at the firſt occaſioned my leaving Cleora: I left her with a heart ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly at liberty, and in ſituations in no degree worſe than before I hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily invited, and haſtily obtained her hand. Chance, or rather ſurely the contrivance of ſome pitying deity, ſoon afterwards preſented before my eye the image of Charlotte. Every thing in human nature that corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponds with the pathetic, united to favour our firſt interview. It was in the ſtill hour of midnight: 'twas in the hour of misfortune. We were both ſufferers: I mourned the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barity of a mother, embarraſſed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, and anxieties at home: you
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0226500401:58"/>
were ſinking under the ſenſe of an equal injury. Social ſorrows ſoon ſuit themſelves to the ſoul, and the impreſſion that is made in ſuch a criſis, is deep and delicate, indeed.</p>
               <p>I ſee, methinks, the firſt ſcene; and I feel what language and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent denies the power to deſcribe. Ah! Charlotte—Think a little up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it!—Prepare for a Picture ſo particularly intereſting. Invoke the powers of imagination, fidelity, and fondneſs to do it juſtice.—Lay aſide every formal, every unneceſſary pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctilio, and give, upon ſo important an occaſion, a full ſcope to the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs of nature.—That tenderneſs, my dear, which was beſtowed by the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0226500401:59"/>
great God of kindneſs to
<q>make the nauſeous draught of life go down.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I have, in preparing you for ſuch a portrait inſpired myſelf. The ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject is not to be withſtood.—I dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate it Charlotte to your ſenſibility. —I addreſs it to your Heart. Did I, in the firſt Scene, inſult you? Did I inſult you with any offer that could diſtreſs or confuſe you? No, Charlotte — ſome ſecret impulſe it was that withheld me from the deed: ſome god it was, which inclined me to be inquiſitively exact in drawing from you the hiſtory of your unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. The tale was told with a ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity and bewitching artleſſneſs, that might have gained credit from
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0226500401:60"/>
infidelity, and attracted attention from frolic. Let the tears that I then ſhed, let the kindneſs with which I have ſince cheriſhed you, witneſs the truth of my tenderneſs and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection. How were we both affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted? how did our ſympathy incline us to approach till our cheeks were as the repoſing, yet glowing cuſhions of each other's. Can you forget the trembling throbs that you felt as I preſſed your making hand upon my boſom.—I withdrew till you undreſt, and I appeal to you, if I did not ſit like the nurſe of your chamber by the ſide of your bed till morning. I found it abſolutely impracticable to treat your miſery in any other man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: even your beauty, dazzling as
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0226500401:61"/>
it was, and in the moſt trying of all ſituations, was not able to betray me: I paid my court to your heart— to your ſituation—to your pathetic circumſtances, and to every thing but your perſon: the charms of which, reſplendent as I acknowledge they were, I had no leiſure to reflect upon, till I had in ſome meaſure ſoothed the mighty anguiſh under which you were ſtruggling.</p>
               <p>I propoſed a retreat in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes of the country. Such a retreat, Charlotte, my vigilant affection, (ever wakeful, ever indefatigable) ſoon pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided; and when I had ſmoothed your own ſituation, and related to you in the undiſguiſe of my ſoul, the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0226500401:62"/>
particulars of mine, I then ventured (and not <hi>till</hi> then) to mention the wiſhes, which, after all the little de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laying reluctances that endear ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate conſent, were ſucceſsful.</p>
               <p>Tell not me, Charlotte, of the prude's unfeeling formality. Do not ſuggeſt to me the ſneer which out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rageous virtue would caſt upon ſuch a tranſaction. Spirits I know there are (terribly holy, and formidably devout—punctilious as to the minutiae of ceremonials, and negligent of eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentials) which would ridicule the delaying reluctances of Charlotte, as artful pretences — What—ſay they, piouſly violent—ſhall <hi>ſhe</hi> who aſcends the <hi>nuptial</hi> couch to ſupply unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0226500401:63"/>
the place of the lawful—to fill the arms that are awefully <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>occupied</hi>— who hath, moreover, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited her innocence to the ſeducer, and been reduced to irreputable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuges — ſhall <hi>ſhe</hi> aſſume the character of chaſtity and all its coyneſſes, or, indeed, any of thoſe marks of amiable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which ought to diſtinguiſh only married modeſty, and maiden deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum—? Fie upon her!</p>
               <p>Ah! hard of heart, and ſhallow of head! illiberal, contracted women! Is it not poſſible for virtue to <hi>be</hi> independent of forms? is it not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, in a caſe like Charlotte's, for the moſt unſpotted purity of mind to ſurvive an accidental violation of
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0226500401:64"/>
perſon?—But then, you reply, ſhe lived, after all, publicly with the huſband of another woman. In any other exigence but her's and mine, it might be impoſſible to offer a plea of palliation:
<q>
                     <l>Let wealth and honour wait the wedded dame;</l>
                     <l>Auguſt her deed, and ſacred be her fame.</l>
                  </q>
Far be it from me, far from the moſt unhappy Charles be it, to blaſt the laurels, or wither the roſes of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugal life. 'Twere impious, 'twere impracticable. I am not audacious enough to ſay with Eloiſa,
<q>
                     <pb n="59" facs="tcp:0226500401:65"/>Curſe on all laws but thoſe which love has made.</q>
Ah gracious, gracious heaven, that it had been permitted to blend in <hi>our</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection the laws of love, and of the land, natural, with moral inſtitutions! —May never any pair, Charlotte, who love as <hi>we</hi> love, be reduced by the tyranny of their ſituation, to equal meaſures: may thoſe whoſe hearts are equally tuned by <hi>nature</hi> into equal ſympathy, find a friend in <hi>fortune</hi> to facilitate their union! Happy—emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently happy they, who are thus aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted, and whoſe joys receive, in conformity to the cuſtom of nations,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0226500401:66"/>
their imprimatur of tenderneſs and poſſeſſion at the <hi>altar.</hi>—</p>
               <p>Our fates, Charlotte, were unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately peculiar, and our reſolution to run them together was natural, and, ſet off as they were by ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand delicacies, irreſiſtable. Let not our conduct be propoſed as an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to be adopted, where it is even poſſible for man and wife to live to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: but let not our fidelity, after we <hi>had</hi> united, be cenſured too vigour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, or too incautiouſly.</p>
               <p>Weigh theſe facts well, and they will tempt you to ſeek again your
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0226500401:67"/>
long accuſtomed pillow upon the boſom (the heart under which will ſwell to welcome your return) of</p>

               <head>LETTER XVII. CHARLOTTE to CHARLES.</head>
               <p>HOW often muſt I repeat— how often waft it on the wings of the poſt, that I muſt never more repoſe on the boſom of Charles. Ceaſe, ceaſe then, ah, my dear ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, for pity's ſake. Do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to croud upon me thoſe images which it is pernicious to entertain! Wherefore—oh thou ungenerous— wherefore do you oppoſe the moſt omnipotent of all human arguments, wherefore do you oppoſe <hi>yourſelf,</hi> betwixt the ſeverely contending pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:0226500401:69"/>
of duty and paſſion—Ah inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man! it is not without exertions the moſt violent, and pangs the moſt accumulated, that I am able to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the conduct I have for the laſt four days obſerved. Conſcious as you are of the <hi>propriety</hi> of that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, forbear, I ſolemnly conjure you, to addreſs my partiality again upon the only ſubject which it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſafely contemplate!</p>
               <p>The ſketch you have delineated of our intercourſe, in its firſt dear, but unfortunate beginnings, is too boldly coloured, and bears too viſibly the delicate touches of a maſter, for the eye of one, who can trace ſo lively a likeneſs betwixt the copy and the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0226500401:70"/>
original. If then you have any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the peace of my mind—any to my proſperity—never preſent to my view again, ſo animated or ſo dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous a picture: rather, I beſeech you, turn that moſt powerful pen of yours into a chaſter ſtyle: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge it in the diſplay of ſubjects more ſuited to our circumſtances. Direct your fine, but too perſuaſive genius into the proper channel, and let the ſtrength and vigour of Charles's underſtanding, rather prevent than debilitate the infirmity of Charlotte's; and beſides this, how unfair is it to avail yourſelf of that very feeling in your favour, which your reaſon tells you it is inequitable to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:0226500401:71"/>The copious effuſion of tender tears that flowed, as I ſuppoſe you cruelly intended they ſhould, in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the commanding ſentiments of your laſt, have a little relieved my heart, at the expence of exhauſting my ſpirits.</p>
               <p>I have acquired once more ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient compoſure to write to the man who ſeems reſolved to keep me in conſtant agitation.</p>
               <p>You <hi>did</hi> ſave me, Charles, from diſtreſs the moſt agonizing; from a ſtate the moſt dreadful: you <hi>did</hi> unite in your character, all the relations; as a father inſtructed—as a mother admoniſhed—as a brother protected
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0226500401:72"/>
—as a ſiſter entertained, and as a huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band cheriſhed. Oh Charles, Charles, it is all well, all great, all a noble climax, till we get to the laſt expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. It was only <hi>as</hi> a huſband: it was <hi>like</hi> one, that you cheriſhed me. 'Twas out of your power—oh, the malice of fortune—to <hi>be</hi> one, and as that was the caſe, we ſhould not have united. I ſhould have found that generoſity in your <hi>friendſhip,</hi> which you ought to have denied me in your <hi>tenderneſs.</hi> I might have been the object of your <hi>benevolence,</hi> without— I write the ſentence with a bluſh burning my cheek—without ſharing your bed. How would it have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dounded to the honour of my Charles, how officiouſly would the daughters
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:0226500401:73"/>
of diſtreſs have truſted his fame to the echo of poſterity, if his bounty had been totally unaccompanied by guilt: if he had reſcued an unhappy girl from miſery, without bringing her out of one error to lead her into another.</p>
               <p>Methinks I now ſee how Charles might at once have procured my honour, and my happineſs: and I, who know the goodneſs of his heart, wonder the ſcheme, or ſomething ſimilar to it, eſcaped him. Might he not have placed the unhappy fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male far from the deluſions of the metropolis, in ſome ſheltering part of the country, where the knowledge of her calamity might never arrive?
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0226500401:74"/>
There, might ſhe not, under the protection of ſome decent matron, have learned all the arts of uſeful life, even till the often tranſmitted bounty of her abſent friend Charles, might be no longer neceſſary to her ſubſiſtance. What room had here been for probation—what ſcope for innocence recovered: and what im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality—what undeſcribeable ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations muſt have attended an action ſo diſintereſted, ſo unmixt—ſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable! Inſtead of which — but I cannot, I ought not to upbraid you. I acknowledge the delicacy of your deportment when it was the moſt eſſential, and when very, very few would have therefore beſtowed it. But let us drop the ſubject: aſſiſt me
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0226500401:75"/>
not treacherouſly, to the recollection of ſcenes, which I wiſh, and ought to forget. Surely, ſurely it is not now a time to receive them in the memory. Ah, Charles, why did not heaven allow our firſt meeting to have preceded your union with Cleora: then, with what a tranſport, a tranſport ſanctified by religion, ſhould I—but it is unavailing to wiſh: we are parted eternally: nor can even ſuch an epiſtle as your laſt, adorned as it is with all the glowing graces of language, and artfully ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed to every paſſion that alarms the ſex, make me revolt from that ſteady principle I have fixt to my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, in the deliberation of my ſoul, as the rule of my future conduct. If
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:0226500401:76"/>
therefore you ſet any price upon the pleaſures of our continued corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence—for I will forfeit even your letters rather than read myſelf into a relapſe—let this ultimate, this repeated aſſurance, ſatisfy you once for all. In a word, Charles, let it teach your heart to be contented with a gratification, ſomewhat leſs terrible than that which would terminate in the perdition of the afflicted, but, alas! ſtill</p>

               <p>INVULNERABLE, and unrelent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as you are, I have the right of a painter to finiſh my picture. Hard would it indeed be, were I denied ſo trifling a liberty as that which the pen allows, when I obey your too rigid injunctions in keeping from the apartment which I know to
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:0226500401:78"/>
contain my treaſure. Think, madam —oh, that cold word—think, Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotte, of the ſevere reſtraint I impoſe upon myſelf! I know the very houſe in which you ſleep—if you indeed <hi>can</hi> ſleep—and yet I deſiſt from going to make enquiries in which I am ſo much intereſted.</p>
               <p>And are you alarmed by the faintly drawn ſketch of our firſt week's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion? Alas! how very poor, how very unequal was all which <hi>then</hi> paſt, when compared to the months, and years that ſucceeded it! a dew drop to the deep, and main world of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters! Carry your imagination in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troſpect to the time when we firſt yielded to the exigence, and agreed
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:0226500401:79"/>
to live in the ſame houſe; when, in all tender reſpects, we agreed to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ourſelves as—united people. Look back to the very night, ever precious to love-ſick remembrance, when you firſt indulged the ſolicited embrace. Till after the attention of many days, I did not dare to intimate the hopes of a conquered heart, nor even at laſt, till I had reconciled you to every part of my hapleſs ſituation—till we had both lamented the bar that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented a public ſanction. Paint to your fancy the joy that was then realized, when you firſt permitted me, half conſenting, half denying, to draw the curtain betwixt us and every interruption — I can ſay no more: I refer you to the powers of
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:0226500401:80"/>
imagination—It was not the <hi>unſoul'd</hi> debauch of a diſſipated pair: it was not the delirium of two young people, ſedulous to ſnatch the haſty revels of a night's voluptuouſneſs! but it was the unaffected tranſport of ſentiment and taſte, of body and mind, conſolidated: not a vein in our hearts that did not thrill to the emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of ſympathy: animated by the fire of real love, not a pulſe about us that did not leap to ſalute its hindred pulſation. Remember, above all things, our next morning meeting at breakfaſt: the ſighs which we then wafted over the tea-cup: the tears which were ſcarce contained within their ſluices of cryſtal: the various fluſhings of the countenance,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:0226500401:81"/>
and our aukward-enough endeavours to conceal the confuſion which was thus rendered the more apparent, all gave ſilent, but delicious teſtimony, that the mutual approbation was compleat.</p>
               <p>Perhaps you will ſay, that this might be the energy of juvenile deſire: the mere enthuſiaſtic riot of the agitated ſenſes—the tranſient fever of inflamatory ſpirits. How eaſy were it, in oppoſition to this, to prove its origin from a more pure and permanent ſource. Reflect, I prithee, fair fugitive, on the ſcenes which ſucceeded. Conſider what diverſity of events happened <hi>after,</hi> to cool the blood, and ſettle the ſenſes. Examine the train of misfortunes
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:0226500401:82"/>
which aroſe rapidly one out of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Did not my whole patrimony, and all my hopes of elevated circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, ſink ſuddenly before me? did not the hardened creditor then take his advantage of my calamity, and hunt me with a blood-hound induſtry, from to place? was not my health invaded in conſequence of my anxiety, and were we not both reduced to uncertain reſources? was not this aggregate of affliction enough to quiet the impetuoſity of mere animal inclination? ſurely it was; but they only rendered <hi>us</hi> ſtill dearer to one another: the burdens were heavy, and each was therefore emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous to carry the greateſt load of them: we had even a ſort of jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:0226500401:83"/>
leſt the one ſhould encroach upon the ſhare of the other. Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs and tranſport preſided over our very difficulties—Ah! how often in the deſolate moment, when the whole hemiſphere of hope was cloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, have we watched the fall of the tear upon the cheek, and kiſt it away? how frequently have we caught the ſigh while parting from the lips? great woes we reconciled into ſentiments of moderation; and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry gale of good fortune, from what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever corner of her compaſs it blew, was ſwelled by love into enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: the beauty of a flower; the paint of a tulip; the fragrance of a roſe; the ſudden luſtre of the ſun; an evening walk; or the morning pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:0226500401:84"/>
over our breakfaſt, painted by the gay pencil of imagination, were more than a match for the empty purſe, the ill-natured accident, or miſeries of the greateſt magnitude.

Of all paradoxes, it is to me the moſt irreconcilable.</p>
               <p>I conjure you then by the memory of our paſt misfortunes, than which even the recollection of extacies is not more endearing—I conjure you by the memory of our pleaſures, of which we have had our proportion— I conjure you by the wiſhes you cheriſh for my health; by the many
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:0226500401:85"/>
miſeries of a ſituation that calls aloud for conſtant attentions; in ſhort, Charlotte, I conjure, implore, and challenge you, by all that you hope, and all which you dread, to ſuffer me to enforce the pleadings of my heart at <hi>your own lodgings:</hi> I will obey every injunction—ah! thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful tyrant—impoſed upon me: the click of the clock ſhall bring me to the moment of your aſſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: I ſhall enter your apartment with all the tremors of a lover, and yet I will not, till you permit me, ſpeak of love: I will anticipate the commands of your tongue, and watch the time to depart from the waving of your finger, the nod of your head, or the turn of your eye—More than
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:0226500401:86"/>
than the power of a ſultaneſs ſhall attend you in this interview—Only admit me once—to tea, to break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt — to dine — to ſup — I cannot Charlotte—I ſwear by the heart you have carried forcibly away from me —I cannot, any longer, ſupport your abſence. Do not then hurry me into violence, but indulge, for this once, my paſſion, and truſt to my prudence, and my promiſes. Farewell, farewell.</p>

               <head>LETTER XIX. CHARLOTTE to CHARLES.</head>
               <p>IS this your ſolemn engagement? preſſing for an interview already. To what end do you think I left you Sir? Was it to give myſelf a few days unneceſſary agony, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve you in needleſs calamity, and then to repent upon my folly, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn again to the errors I have left? I am angry that you think me guilty of ſo much inconſiſtency. What a child muſt you believe me? and yet how do you oblige me to be even with you. For ſhame, Sir, for ſhame; you want the philoſophy of
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:0226500401:88"/>
an infant. You have devoted ſeveral of the years of your youth to the ſtudy of the ſciences, you are deeply read in virtuous compoſitions, and yet you are more feeble than the babe.</p>
               <p>To be outdone in a good action by a woman, by the very wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man whoſe undemanding and heart have been, as it were, the work of your own hands: whom you have made what ſhe is —To let <hi>her</hi> ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs you in fortitude! Bluſh, bluſh, and riſe into the ambition of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling her.</p>
               <p>From the very arguments that you draw as motives of my return,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:0226500401:89"/>
I can extract the moſt forcible rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for my deſiſting from a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>union, even ſuppoſing that there was no perſonal criminality attending it.</p>
               <p>Wherefore ſhould I hang as a clog at the foot of a man already op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by the heavy hand of cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity? whatever you may think, it is no real teſtimony of regard to ſhare your miſeries without being able to relieve them. To behold you ſtruggling with your fate, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the power to better it, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther adding <hi>to,</hi> than taking <hi>from,</hi> your embarraſſments. No, Charles; truſt me, we can both do more to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerably alone, at leaſt for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent: in the courſe of a little time, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:0226500401:90"/>
may be generous to one of us, <hi>which,</hi> is a point of no moment: our perſons only, and not our purſes, are divided: it will be the ſame thing whether the ſhower of proſperity falls upon Charles, or Charlotte: I hope neither of us ſhall at any time be capable of ſeparate intereſts, and that neither of us ſhall be too proud to receive aſſiſtance at the hand of the other. As to your part, your talents will recommend you, <hi>whereſoever</hi> or <hi>howſoever</hi> you exert them; and you cannot long fail of conquering the inconveniences which at preſent ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round you. Charlotte's ſociety, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever dear, was rather an impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment than any thing elſe, to Charles's advancement, and he will now be
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:0226500401:91"/>
admitted into connections which were before impenetrable. We may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſe ourſelves, my dear friend, with the idea of deſpiſing the cuſtoms of our country, and the forms of our church: nay, we may attempt to ſoothe ourſelves with the opinions of ourſelves, and a narrow circle of our private friends, but if the voice of the public, and the eſtabliſhed modes of religion are againſt us, it will be in vain that we receive a <hi>partial</hi> approbation. It is not only politic, but morally juſt, that the general clamour ſhould be raiſed againſt a couple in our ſituation. The diſagreements that paſs under a man's own roof, and the quarrels or feuds which divide the huſband from
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:0226500401:92"/>
the wife, do not authorize an open defiance of either the laws of man, or the commands of God: nor will the world, however proper the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, ever enter into the intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacies of circumſtance, or pathetic of paſſion that throws the divided huſband into the arms of another woman. I am ſtill willing to hope, Charles, that our offence will be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigated by the God of mercy, upon account of the many peculiar temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and exigences that belonged to it: in ſtrict ſpeaking, perhaps, there may not be any greater degree of guilt in our late connection, than if it had immediately ſucceeded a divorce from your Cleora: but when I am appealed to by a pleading wife,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:0226500401:93"/>
who charges me with ſeducing the the affections of a huſband; when I am branded by that wife, as the art<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and infamous cauſe of her child's miſery, and her own, amongſt all her friends and acquaintances; when I am held up as the terror of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried women, at the very time that I know I would have at any time yielded the ſociety of Charles to to more lawful claims; how do you think I can bear to live under this load of half-merited ignominy, and half-undeſerved reproach? the truth will break, like the ſun, through all diſguiſing interceptions: the delicacy of your paſſion for me, Charles, led you to conceal the fact in regard to my real ſituation. Wherever you
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:0226500401:94"/>
went, the brilliance of your wit and the poliſh of your genius, together with the public evidences you have given of it, attracted notice, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured popularity, and commanded curioſity—You took me by the hand, and preſented me in all our excurſions as your <hi>wedded wife:</hi> I did my beſt to ſupport the character, I would have given worlds to have realized it: but even in my happieſt moment, Charles, I felt a pang at my heart, and apprehended a diſcovery that would have overwhelmed me with the bluſhes of confuſion. In the courſe of our rambles, your ſanction pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for me ſeveral amiable friends. I had too much veneration for the <hi>name</hi> of wife to injure it by any
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:0226500401:95"/>
light, or unbecoming behaviour; and I have the felicity to reflect, that my deportment under this aſſumed character, was in all reſpects, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugal and exact: well was it for me, nevertheleſs, dear Charles, that our paſſion for travel, did not allow us to ſtay long in a place. Your ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation muſt ſoon have been pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licly known; even the political <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe</hi>
of your <hi>real</hi> name muſt have been ſeen through; your fatal pre-engagement with Cleora would have been detected, and the endearing coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance that was before ſhewn me, while I lay under the ſhelter of a charming impoſition, would be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominiouſly withdrawn. That this, in part <hi>has</hi> been the caſe, you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:0226500401:96"/>
but remember: I have occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally been met by an old acquaintance of yours, who hath officiouſly cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated the ſecret of our connexion, and my character became in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant ſuſpected, or at leaſt ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous.</p>
               <p>The induſtry with which I applied to thoſe accompliſhments in which it is the chief glory of women to excel, and the books and maſters which you recommended to me for that purpoſe, ſoon poliſhed ſimplicity into a degree of refined knowledge, and made me more deſerving my Charles's ſociety. And yet, my friend, the agonies of my heart increaſed with the inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of my head. Objects and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:0226500401:97"/>
ſoon preſented themſelves to me in a different light from that in which I had been accuſtomed to behold them: the days of girliſh giddineſs were paſt, and the ſedater reflections of the woman ſucceeded. From a ſtate of ruſticity and village igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, I was able to think profoundly and compare accurately; a nicer ſenſe of right and wrong began to take place; an aweful admiration for il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious characters, and a more than enthuſiaſtic ambition to reach them, ſeized upon my ſenſes: proportioned to the augmentation of my intellec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual powers, roſe into greater luſtre the ſenſibilities of my ſoul; and, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the influence of theſe cultivations, all flowing from the generous ſtream
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:0226500401:98"/>
of Charles's fondneſs, think what I muſt in the cool hour undergo, at the thought of living in a ſtate ſo palpably condemned by mandates above and below; and ſo forcibly reprobated by every law, divine and human.</p>
               <p>It was not, Charles, over the exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences of a precarious fortune, it was not for the loſs of your eſtate, nor was it even for the gradual de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinings of your health, that half thoſe tears were ſhed, which in different places, and at different periods, flowed from me. Studious of your ſerenity, how often have I repreſs'd the ſigh that was half ready to break its way through my boſom: arm in arm as
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:0226500401:99"/>
we walked affectionately together, amidſt the perfumes of the ſpring, or the fragrant profuſions of the ſummer; delighted too as I was with the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful teſtimonies of the warmeſt paſſion that ever nature rendered mutual, even then, in ſeaſons ſo ſacred to compoſure, the bitter idea would overtake me, and I have been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to complain of ſome tranſient pain of the perſon, to hide from my companion the anguiſh of the heart. Nay, Charles, I have often ſought out a hiding-place when my heart was overcharged, to relieve it by tears. That Cleora and you could not live amicably together, that I was the woman of your choice, that incidents perfectly uncommon united us, that
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:0226500401:100"/>
we both lived in the ſtricteſt fidelity, that our paſſion was as elevated as ever inhabited the human boſom, and that we were every thing that is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious to each other, were by no means counterballances to the cenſure of the world, the violation of moral obligations, the ſtrokes of my own conſcience, and the claims of Cleora, which my avow'd reſidence with you, <hi>ſeemed</hi> at leaſt to intercept.</p>
               <p>Collect yourſelf ſufficiently Charles, to put theſe ſeveral ſentiments toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: conſider them one by one, as you arrange them in due order, and form them into a whole. When you have done this, quiet I beſeech you the diſorders of every rebellious paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:0226500401:101"/>
and let reaſon, in her robes of ſobriety, ſit in judgment. The ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence which ſhe paſſes will command your attention: methinks I ſee her from her aweful throne, in the center of the human heart preparing to ſpeak —hark, Charles, I hear her voice, and it ſhall decide between us.— Perſevere Charlotte, perſevere in theſe reſolutions, ſhe ſays. "Forbear Charles, forbear to throw thy tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions again in the path of the peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent."</p>

               <p>YOUR laſt ſhort letter was as a cordial to the ſpirits of a ſwoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing creature. Noble, noble youth, how agreeably you flatter me! and is it poſſible that Charles can be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert to the ſentiments of Charlotte? has ſhe been ſo happy as to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate her own conduct, and kindle in his heart the ſparks of imitation?— imitation did I ſay? no; my dear friend has twice the power and ten times the goodneſs of Charlotte, if he will but exert them. Have I not
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:0226500401:105"/>
known him melt and ſoften into ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy at the pitiable circumſtances of a diſtreſſed enemy? have I not ſeen the tear of gratitude in his eye, and his hands folded together, for pain alleviated, danger eſcaped, differences accommodated, and comforts multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied? is he not the friend of all that want, of all that wiſh? hath not nature directed his hand to his purſe to divide with the indigent or the ſoliciting, the laſt efforts of his liberality? doth not his <hi>own</hi> miſeries teach him to feel for <hi>others,</hi> and ſuggeſt to him all the finer obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of morality?</p>
               <p>And can ſuch a character, can ſuch an exalted ſpirit, long remain inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:0226500401:106"/>
to a duty of the greateſt magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude? impoſſible, impoſſible! 'Tis I, only I, have been to blame, in wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my fatal image, and deſtructive affections, round his heart, till it became entangled beyond the power of extrication. Long ago would this excellent young man have recovered the dignity of his duty, had not I prevented it. I ſhould have ſlown before: ſince his delicacy was too great to quit <hi>me,</hi> my virtue ſhould ſooner have urged me to quit <hi>him.</hi> Perhaps by this time, he might have quite forgotten me, or only at moſt have recollected me with the indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence I deſerve.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="101" facs="tcp:0226500401:107"/>It is, however, ſome conſolation, that I have at laſt been equal to the impulſes of my reaſon, and I cannot but hope the moſt ſalutary effects will ariſe from them. Already my deareſt friend (for as ſuch I ſhall ever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider him) is open to conviction: to be <hi>ſo,</hi> is one great ſtep towards every thing laudable and deſirable: to ſee the path of virtue, and to be pleaſed with it, is a powerful induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to purſue it without any ſuture deviations. I riſe every morning more reconciled to my ſeparation, and I can command my thoughts from the image of Charles, when I find them wandering that way, with the coſt only of a few tears: my ſlumbers are not indeed ſound, nor
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:0226500401:108"/>
can I frequently cloſe my eyes; but I can meditate without diſtraction, and know the direction of the only man upon earth whom I—I—I whom —whom—I—I ſay I can reflect upon the very ſpot, where I ſuppoſe Charles to be ſitting, without paſſing by his door, or knocking at it for admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: for <hi>that</hi> admittance, which I now hope, and believe he will, after the lapſe of a few months, refuſe me, except upon the terms of an ordinary acquaintance. — No Charles, no: not an <hi>ordinary</hi> acquaintance neither. I could not bear to receive from <hi>you</hi> the forms of compliment, or the cold civilities of a mere well-bred deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum. If we ever do again ſee each other, let it be with kindneſs, with
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:0226500401:109"/>
attention, with friendſhip, and with any thing <hi>from</hi> the extremes either of relapſing fondneſs, or faſhionable diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regard: it would be extremely auk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward—perhaps it would be utterly impoſſible for Charles and Charlotte ever to meet upon ſo ceremonious a viſit: nor will it, I dare ſay, be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary. The paſſion will be altered, the ſenſibilities of love will be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed, but the ſentiments of a pure and eſtabliſhed friendſhip, may, and <hi>muſt</hi> remain.</p>

               <p>I AM juſt informed, Madam, that your circumſtances demand the attention of benevolence, and as I know the preſent ſituation of your huſband (were you both happily united) could not allow him to aſſiſt you, I have taken the liberty, as a very old friend to your family, to incloſe a modicum, which, though ſhamefully ſmall, is I proteſt to you, proportioned to the immediate abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of</p>

               <head>LETTER XXV. CHARLOTTE to CHARLES.</head>
               <p>A WEEK's ſilence, my dear Charles, muſt ſure have done great things: you certainly find it for your eaſe to lay down the pen which uſed ſo frequently to addreſs Charlotte; and, therefore, I ſubmit to the ſuſpenſion of your correſpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Poſſibly I am by this time an object only of friendly, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſturbed contemplation. I will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to rejoice at the ſuppoſition: 'tis what I ought to do.—Now then, my friend, ſummon yourſelf to the undertaking: I have made the <hi>firſt</hi>
                  <pb n="111" facs="tcp:0226500401:117"/>
ſacrifice to virtue; do you collect all your ſtrength to ſuſtain a <hi>ſecond!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Your wife is now in London, Charles, and the child, which you have ſo long and anxiouſly wiſhed to fondle in your arms, is now blooming in beauty, by the ſide of her. Your barbarous mother (vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuous in her age, and wicked in her weeds) denies any longer to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port or educate the babe, and the little fortune is at preſent locked up, and is likely to remain ſo till the ſale of that eſtate of which you have been iniquitouſly robbed, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated. In the worſt dilemma, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, your talents are always a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient reſource, for the ſubſiſtance of
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:0226500401:118"/>
human life. She who indeed loves, will love in all circumſtances: ſhe who feels as ſhe <hi>ought</hi> to feel, will follow her object into the worſt of all poſſible ſituations—What ſay you to an interview with Cleora? can you not obliterate the idea of the ſubjects which parted you, and viſit each other, without a paſt unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary reflection? I have been ſeveral hours in her company. There is nothing in her perſon but what might attract a huſband's attention: her underſtanding is even maſculinely ſtrong. She doats upon the child you have preſented to her. She denies the infamous charge that either malice, or wantonneſs brought againſt her fame: ſhe is young,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:0226500401:119"/>
handſome, accompliſhed, well born, your real wife, and in diſtreſs, oh, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens! can ſuch a heart as Charles's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main hardened, or can he cloſe his eye upon ſuch a picture— a picture, glowing with the two principal portraits of his own family?</p>
               <p>Admitting, however, that you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not feel upon this occaſion all the luxury of a love-match; admitting, that Cleora wants the power to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light; ought ſhe not to be received as a married wife? and though you may want ability to be tranſported, yet cannot you entertain enough of that friendſhip, which you always allow to our ſex, to live within the limits of propriety? in fine, Charles,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:0226500401:120"/>
if you can avoid abſolute averſion on the one hand, and altercation (to which I am ſure you are not by nature inclined) on the other, it is a plain point of honour and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, to invite her again to your arms.</p>
               <p>Believe me, my friend, ſhe is the only woman in the creation I could bear to ſee there: but I have been the <hi>ſeeming</hi> inſtrument of keeping you from her—the <hi>real</hi> one I am ſure I have not—and therefore it would give me a pleaſure inexpreſſible to bring you together, even before I have totally conquered my own par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tialities. Do Charles, do endeavour to give my vanity the gratification
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:0226500401:121"/>
of one diſtinguiſhed action: let me have one opportunity to ſhew thoſe who have aſperſed me, that I had ſomething like a ſoul at the bottom. Exert yourſelf, I charge you; and let it be ſaid, that Charles was capable of a dignity in conduct, which was not unworthily emulated by</p>

               <p>AM I never to ſee my beſt friend, the amiable Charles, permanently happy? is he for ever
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:0226500401:122"/>
to be ſubjected to theſe anxious viciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitudes? and is one of the nobleſt of human hearts thus conſtantly to be tortured on the wheel of misfortune? If you bear as ill the third elopement of Charlotte, as you did the firſt and ſecond, I ſhall dread to ſee you: ſure never did a young man poſſeſs ſo unfaſhionable a fidelity: and yet I cannot blame you: the value of the object juſtifies the conſtancy and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the paſſion.

The beauties of your Charlotte, both mental and bodily, are indeed too attractingly eminent to be eaſily worn from the memory of a man, who hath not only poſſeſs'd, but ſo great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contributed to poliſh them.</p>
               <p>I have long known her merit; long paid to it the tribute of my admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and as long lamented the bar that prevented the union of which ſhe is ſo truly deſerving. From the ripening refinements of her mind, however, and from the ardent preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitation of her temper, tinctured as it is with a little both of enthuſiaſm and romance, I apprehended ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of this ſort would enſue from

               <p>How unlucky is it that the point is on all ſides, too nice and critical to be ſpoken to. I moſt heartily wiſh all wives well, and all lovers happy: above all other things I have <hi>ever</hi> wiſhed it upon ſolid motives: their hearts were moulded for each other: the joys, ſorrows, evil, and good, they have mutually ſuſtained in the courſe of a long, and faithful interchange, muſt have bound them in chains of peculiar force.

The ſhades are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectious: rural objects, and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to a poetical mind, are abſolutely ſo many diſtractions. I would not have you by any means venture into thoſe parts of the country where you have of late been uſed to reſide. The idea that ſhould not be indulged, will obtrude itſelf in a moment: every thing you behold, from the leaves of the tree, to the huſbandman at his labour, will revive the treacherous image you ſhould eradicate.</p>
               <p>Rather, my good friend, purſue a different courſe: however reluctantly,

ruſh into mixt and multiplied ſociety. Indulge not the ſoftneſs of relaxing ſolitude. Engage for a ſhort time in all the frivolous ſcenes of buſy exiſtence. Let the great ſoul ſtoop a little, and condeſcend to be amuſed by innocent levities. Superior as you are, I would now adviſe you to fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent the places of public reſort — and, in ſhort, I would adviſe every thing gay and airy, except down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right diſſipation.

               </head>
               <p>FOR the ſecond time in my life I am abſolutely inebriated— Dead drunk, Templeton, in the vain effort of drowning my diſtraction, and your letter was delivered to me over the dizzineſs of the third bottle.</p>
               <p>Charlotte is fixt in the froſt of her reſolutions, and I have ceaſed to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs her on my ſubject. Heavy hung the hours upon my hand, and I have been endeavouring to ſhorten them by forgetfulneſs — Ah, Templeton!
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:0226500401:129"/>
I have gone ſuddenly from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes of melancholy to thoſe of madneſs. I called upon a vacant acquaintance, who never felt a poig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant woe in his life, who laughs at tenderneſs, and ſnaps his fingers at love, and, in the very ſtupor of my ſoul, ſtrolled with him into a tavern. I am this moment every thing but delirious, and I have compelled my colleague in diſſipation, to drink proſperity to every ſtep of Charlotte —at leaſt at every ſecond glaſs—In this ſtate of <hi>capital</hi> elevation, what will become of me for the reſt of the night, heaven knows; but as I am cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of being both ſick and ſorry to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrow, I am reſolv'd not to be either to night.—Heigh—heigh—oh! Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleton!
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:0226500401:130"/>
Templeton, what machines we are! obedient to the breath of every paſſion, toſt into tempeſt by every guſt of diſappointment or deſire. What a fever we are in from fifteen to five and twenty; what an ague overtakes us ſoon after that, till we are frozen to death and good for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing—Oh! theſe violent tranſitions —I lay down my pen to pledge you in a bumper of good wiſhes for the health of Charlotte. I would mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der my brother if he refuſed the toaſt of my heart—Never was I ſo ſtrongly inclined to break my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, and go abruptly to her apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. I could now talk to her like an angel: I could charm her with
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:0226500401:131"/>
claret-caught eloquence, were ſhe adamant from top to bottom.</p>
               <p>"Hot with the Tuſcan grape, and high in blood,"—by my ſoul, Templeton, I am juſt at this time a a match for every thing that could happen to me—I could ſmooth the wrinkles of her dear indignant brow— I could preſs her beloved hand with a tenderneſs ſo gentle—I could ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance to her roſy lip with ſo pathetic an humility, a countenance ſo touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and a ſigh ſo delicate, that I ſhould certainly conquer all her ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and allure her once more to the arms that are ever extending involuntarily, to embrace her. The fellow who has been the companion
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:0226500401:132"/>
of my revels, is both too headleſs and too heartleſs to continue any longer — His dull eye twinkles in drowſineſs, and he had rather, I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, hug his <hi>pillow,</hi> than the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſs of beauty—The wretch abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely yawns. Oh the negative—! Whatever becomes of me I will never pray, no Templeton, (though agony of ſoul were to mark every moment) I will never pray for the lethargies of inſenſibility—I will this inſtant go to the arms of <hi>willing</hi> beauty.</p>

               <p>YOU have directed to one friend, what was, I perceive, deſigned for another: the letter I return to you under cover, will explain the

matter. I ſhall only obſerve upon it, that the fair hopes I began to entertain are again deſtroyed, and I have the worſt conſequences to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend from your deſperate, and dreadful conduct. I do not doubt but you put into execution the ſcheme you projected, and practiced the odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous purpoſes at which you glanced in the concluding lines of your letter to Mr. Templeton! <hi>what,</hi> Charles, are you <hi>already</hi> capable of this? can you, with a more than brutal precipitation, ſubdue the boaſted feelings of tenderneſs for one woman, and hurry away to make an offer of your perſon to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?</p>

The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition you were in, would have, in ſome meaſure, excuſed you to me— I might have adviſed you to return home: I might have—as a friend, as a ſiſter—as a parent, pointed out to you the palpable ſin—guilt—im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriety—barbarity of ſuch an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion!
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:0226500401:137"/>

If you look cloſely you will perceive where it fell. But that is nothing; a friend's health muſt ever be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious—were it not for your health's ſake, the raſhneſs of your conduct would not ſo much vex me.

               <p>DEAR, and juſtly offended Charlotte, forgive me! The agonies I have felt, and ſtill feel from your reproaches, are even more inſupportable than the abſence which made me ruſh into the behaviour that deſerved them.

                  <pb n="135" facs="tcp:0226500401:141"/>Since the letter has fallen into your hands, I will religiouſly relate the unextenuated facts.</p>
               <p>The lunacy of diſappointed love, and the madneſs of wine, to which you know I am ſo little accuſtomed, hurried me, I muſt confeſs, into all the diſtractions of diſſipation.</p>
               <p>When the partner of my intoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation left me, I was in the ſtreet; ſcarce ſenſible in my head, and unable to keep my heels. I ſtood ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting myſelf for ſome time againſt the pillars of a door in a ſtate of irreſolution: even then, the image of the relentleſs Charlotte preſented itſelf; I would have died with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:0226500401:142"/>
the next morning, to have part that night in your company. The little likelihood of this drove me to deſpair, and calling a coach, I or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the driver to carry me to your lodgings. About twenty yards from the houſe I pulled the check-ſtring, and alighted: the moon was in her meridian, and I walked on till I came oppoſite your window. The ſhutters were cloſed; the ſtreets were quiet, and not an object near, except the watchman, whoſe night-box was ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned within five paces of your apartment. I twined my arms in a melancholy folding, and directed my eye, as I ſtood fixed, to that part of the manſion which I knew you occupied. There is a lane which
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:0226500401:143"/>
leads to the back of the houſe, and I got ſtaggeringly upon the wall that ſeparated the property. Here, Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotte, as I ſtood upright on the ridge, I commanded the adjacent apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.—The extreme warmth of the night had induced the inhabitant to ſuffer the ſaſh about a third part open, and the cooling breezes of midnight rewarded the deſign. Ah! God! what were my ſenſations, when, levelling my eye to the caſement, I ſaw, by the aſſiſtance of the moon-beams, (at this time uncommonly bright) a dreſs that I knew! At the edge of the toilet lay that very huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive which I preſented to you ſo very lately, and whoſe firſt employment was to contain the needles which aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:0226500401:144"/>
in making the ruffles you left unfiniſhed. The ſpotted handker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, the cap, the hat, and even the garters you yourſelf knitted, were there. Spread upon a chair, at a ſmall diſtance, was a packet of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, partly unfolded, perhaps the correſpondence of Charles—and the curtain on the female ſide of the bed was undrawn: at the foot it was impenetrably and enviouſly pinned cloſe together. Imagine, oh! ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, my ſituation! for I cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe it. The watchman neglected to inſpect the lane, though he ſat almoſt at the beginning of it. Love's auſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious god had ſurely charmed him to reſt, for he did not even call his hour after the clock had ſtruck. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:0226500401:145"/>
ſtill undiſcovered, and could not perſuade mvſelf to remove. How ſhall I paint what followed? ah! beloved woman, pardon and pity me! I brought my ear even with the edge of the window-frame, and liſtened: what did I hear? even the balmy breath of my Charlotte, heaving ſomewhat interruptedly in ſlumber. I opened my lips, if aught of the perfume would reach me, that I might inhale it. Five minutes, or more than five, did I continue in this attitude; and then — mighty love aſſiſt me — then did I hear the deareſt of women, ſtart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from her ſleep, exclaim— "This ſhould be <hi>his</hi> pillow—here ſhould his cheek repoſe—ah!
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:0226500401:146"/>
Charles, Charles, why did we ever meet? this parting will diſtract me" —My heart at this time prompted me to diſcover myſelf, and I trembling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly put my hand to the ſaſh, and heaved it higher—I could have ſtep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped into Charlotte's bedchamber with eaſe: another lift would have carried me into her arms; but the pullies rattled, you called loudly to know "who was there," and I was compelled to deſcend from the walls of paradiſe.</p>
               <p>The abruptneſs with which I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended, brought me headlong to the ground, I cut myſelf with pieces of broken glaſs, and other rubbiſh that had been thrown into the lane.
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:0226500401:147"/>
I had juſt riſen, when I once more looked at the window, where, to compleat my miſery, I ſaw the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>robed, lovely, and beautiful Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotte, pulling down the ſaſh.</p>
               <p>Agitated as I was, I dared not ſpeak. I kept my promiſe with you, even in drunkenneſs, and was ſilent under all theſe touching circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. But what did all theſe efforts of honour coſt me? I thought my ſenſes would utterly have left me!</p>
               <p>That nothing may remain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed, I will diſcloſe even the ſcenes which ſucceeded — And yet, why <hi>ſhould</hi> I? to what end do I make you acquainted with more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:0226500401:148"/>

               <p>FOR heaven's ſake, my dear Charles, be more guarded: you will deſtroy the happineſs both of Charlotte and yourſelf. She is
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:0226500401:149"/>
palpably jealous of you: every ſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable in her letter declares it. Her tenderneſs for you is even greater than ever. I conjure you, therefore, not to injure her: continue ſtill to conſider her ſilently as your ſiſter, and I prophecy that ſomething will happen in the courſe of a little time, to make her as eſſentially your wife, by the laws of the land, as ſhe is evidently already by the laws of the tendereſt love that can poſſibly be reciprocated. At leaſt give her the indulgence of a ſhort period. I ſtill expect to ſee you happy together, and I am perſuaded, if you let for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune take her own play, without un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonably interrupting her, ſhe will contrive matters in your favour, till
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:0226500401:150"/>
all ſhall work together for your good. Perſecutions and ſearchings after her at preſent, will only defeat your purpoſes. View her, therefore, I again conjure you, as the deareſt relation in the world, who cannot poſſibly live in the ſame houſe with you. Surely there is a moſt delicate conſolation in believing yourſelf moſt paſſionately beloved by an <hi>abſent</hi> friend. That you <hi>are</hi> paſſionately beloved, and that you will continue to be ſo, there is not the ſmalleſt doubt: and, give me as a friend, leave to tell you, that, to ſuppoſe you are <hi>not,</hi> is a poor compliment to Charlotte: your incredulity, in this caſe, argues your want of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence. Depend upon it, if ſhe
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:0226500401:151"/>
who has torn herſelf from you, ever finds it again in her power (I mean in the power of her feelings) to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, ſhe will not heſitate to crown the warmeſt wiſhes of her amiable companion, who, both by habit and inclination, muſt be too dear to be ſoon forgotten. Do you think ſhe <hi>has</hi> forgotten you? oh, Charles, you cannot be ſo ignorant of the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of nature, nor can you be ſo inſenſible to the peculiarly ſoft heart of her, whoſe abſence you are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploring. Take my word for it, that were you to meet twelve-months hence, your firſt interview would not be ſuſtained like perſons who had buried the remembrance of each other. I judge not romantically,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:0226500401:152"/>
but from a knowledge of you both: I judge from the ſcenes of lively, and laſting endearment you have both experienced: you can no more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get one another, than you can forget yourſelves. Many a ſad hour does ſhe feel, as well as Charles, and much anguiſh muſt ſhe undergo to ſupport and continue theſe triumphs of her delicacy. Once more, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I deſire you to let things take their courſe, and, by ſome ſtroke of providence, Charlotte will aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly be reſtored to you.

               <p>GOOD God, Charles, what a life do you make me lead! and what real miſery hath diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed the night and the day ſince the arrival of your laſt! how can you be ſo ingenious to torture your own heart and mine? Your ſcene at my window thrills me with horror. What a time to be expoſed to the open air: careleſs and intoxicated too as you were! what wretchedneſs muſt attend your proſpect! How could the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuoſity of your paſſion ſuggeſt ſuch
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:0226500401:155"/>
an expedient; dangerous in itſelf, and painful in its conſequences? I hope, however, you have not cut yourſelf alarmingly: pray get the beſt advice: glaſs ſometimes ſticks within the ſkin, and gangrenes. Oh! for heaven's ſake, take care. Had you ſtaid till the noiſe brought me to the window, what would have become of us both? to have denied you admittance, would have been, in ſuch a ſituation, impoſſible: to have admitted you would have been a freſh gall to thoſe wounds of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour which I am trying to heal. If you regard either my health, my happineſs, or my life, never put me again to ſuch ſevere trials.</p>

I can, however, too readily gueſs the ſcope of it: and yet it was, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks, a ſtrange heart, that could juſt quit the moſt pathetic object in the world, and find a gratification, the next minute, in the groſſeſt.</p>

               <p>I HAVE met an adventure that I think may draw off your mind, in ſome meaſure, from its preſent fatal object of contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and therefore I will deſcribe it as accurately as my memory permits. You cannot too atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively apply yourſelf to thoſe ſcenes which amuſe the imagination and ſoothe the fancy.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="154" facs="tcp:0226500401:160"/>At the houſe of Mr. — where I now am on a viſit (from which I cannot yet politely diſengage ſelf) dined the other day, ſix people of both ſexes; amongſt them a ſtripling, who complained bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly that he had been abuſed by the lady of his heart, who, after a court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip (and all its coſtly conſequences) of five years, had left him in the lurch; kept his preſents, ſtolen his affections, and turned him adrift, in favour of a ſtupid fellow with a ſmooth face, a laced coat, and a well-turned pair of legs. This poor ſwain made a fool of himſelf all din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner time, could drink little, eat leſs, ſighed every ſecond, and at laſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly declared he would renounce
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:0226500401:161"/>
the ſex, and ſet out the next week to ſeek for indifference, in rambling round the habitable globe.</p>
               <p>After this declaration, he ſat ſilent and melancholy for a long time, and really infected the whole company: at length an old gentleman that ſat next him, tapp'd him ſoftly on the ſhoulder, and ſaid, "he was in hopes he did not know in what <hi>real</hi> miſery conſiſted; and ſo, continued he, as we are all mighty <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to be penſive, I will tell you the heads of <hi>my</hi> hiſtory, from which you will be able, perhaps, to deduce a very uſeful leſſon: namely, that happineſs hates to be <hi>hunted,</hi> and is very ſeldom caught by thoſe, who
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:0226500401:162"/>
                  <hi>violently</hi> purſue her. She deteſts preſſing, and muſt come a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teer into the ſervice of mortals."</p>
               <p>"All our miſery, or at leaſt the greateſt portions of it, ariſe from the want of ſettled and conſolidated ſentiments—in other words, from ſubmitting to the violence of various paſſions, without ſticking to any one of them upon principle. This has been my misfortune; take care that it is not yours. I am now, you ſee, in the decline of life, and yet, from the time that I came to years of diſcretion, as <hi>indiſcreet</hi> people too often call them, I have been cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing different ſhadows; and fluctuat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, tempeſt-toſt, betwixt oppoſite
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:0226500401:163"/>
opinions. At my firſt coming into the world, a mere noviciate in all reſpects, (as it were, in the very morning of exigence) fancy, and curioſity threw before my eye a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand gay and glittering appearances. I could neither engage in a dance, or make one at a dinner, or attend a concert, or viſit any place of public diverſion, without receiving ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucky impreſſion in favour of objects either recommended by their novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or to which I was invited by the ardour of my temper. I, like you, had a free hand, a liberal ſoul, and a ſuſceptible heart: my ſpirits were lively, my ideas excurſive, and fancy for ever on the wing. The ruling propenſities of my nature
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:0226500401:164"/>
were ſocial, and, I cultivated with a vigour peculiar to young people, all the friendly and intereſting con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nections."</p>
               <p>"To reſcue my friend, or to prove my fidelity, to him, I ſet at nought hazard, embarraſſment, and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize, with all the enthuſiaſtical ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemence of a knight-errant. My ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts were without the leaſt merce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary mixture, and my opinions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived and admitted without any ſuſpicion. Having indulged this luxury of the young man for ſome time, till certain tokens of inſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity ſomewhat cooled my ardour, I was taught by experience, the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of caution, and found it whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:0226500401:165"/>
to alter a little the ſyſtem I had adopted: inſtead, therefore, of falling in love at firſt ſight, of conferring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcriminate favours, of fixing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuous friendſhips, or of laviſhing offers of ſervice to all men, without caution or diſtinction, I was tempted to enter into intercourſes of a more ſtationary kind: my appetites were now leſs refractory: imagination had enjoyed her frolic, and the curioſity of a rambling, romantic heart was ſatisfied. I now reſolved to begin the world on a new principle: I courted a young woman eminently beautiful, and obtained her hand: from this moment I entertained no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, views and wiſhes, utterly the reverſe of my former ones: fortune—
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:0226500401:166"/>
intereſt—children—family and poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, all crouded upon me: the ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, which in my late bachelor-ſtate I ſhould have toſs'd careleſly away, I turned very deliberately, and placed it as an accumulated twelve-pence in my drawer."</p>
               <p>"At the end of a year my wife preſented me with a ſimilitude of herſelf; and the moment it came into the world, I imagined it gave ſo ſacred an addition to my character, that, I remember well, on that very day I buſtled into my barber's ſhop with an unuſual ſtrut, and ordered a ſupernumerary row of curls to my peruke, the better to figure as the father of a family. The ſucceeding
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:0226500401:167"/>
year gave me a ſon, with whom I was no ſooner provided, than I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came anxious to provide a fortune to ſupport him. To accompliſh this, need I ſay, that I adopted the moſt circumſpect maxims. I gave no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing without knowing to what end. I engaged in a good buſineſs, enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained but ſeldom, threw myſelf as little as poſſible in the way of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurable temptation, roſe up early in the morning to the account book, and knowing my infirmity (for you muſt know I always loved <hi>wine</hi>) I kept the bottle out of ſight. Yet, in reward of this ſelf-denial, I eat hearty, ſlept ſound, and repaired the conſtitution, which the career of the former part of my life had deplora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:0226500401:168"/>
ſhaken. For ſeveral years I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied myſelf to the maxims of gain, and, in the end, obtained by ſuch induſtry a conſiderable fortune."</p>
               <p>"About this period my ſentiments underwent <hi>another</hi> total alteration: from the domeſtic friend and man of buſineſs, I ſhifted to the man of magnificence and parade; and juſt as I had, by dint of infinite drudgery, obtained a good fortune, I took it into my head to ſpend it like a fool. As you are in <hi>love,</hi> young Sir, you know ſomething about human in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtency, and therefore will not wonder at this apparent lunacy. Well, Sir, I took it into my ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous head, as I was ſaying, to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:0226500401:169"/>
a piece of ground on the ſide of a hill, in the county of Somerſet: upon this hill, I had the nonſenſical ambition to build a ſpacious houſe, and in this houſe, to my ſhame be it ſpoken, I placed pictures and paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, which, as the learned in thoſe matters <hi>told me,</hi> were extremely fine and valuable. I now no longer liſten'd to the chatter upon change, the jargon of Garraway's, nor the ſtupidity of the ſtocks. I buſtled no more in buſineſs, took my caſh out of trade, ſet up a chaiſe, and commenced the <hi>eminent merchant retired from</hi> ways, <hi>to live upon his</hi> means. I turned a bleak, bare hill behind my villa, into a ſhrubbery of ſirs, and the ſteep deſcent from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my front door, I converted into
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:0226500401:170"/>
a garden, in which I placed ſtatues of all the great folks; and, that the matter might be compleat, I ordered a pond to be cut in the centre, that I might have at once wood, water, and fiſh into the bargain. My wife, however, ſoon complained that the walls were damp, my children were conſtantly afflicted with colds: my gardener diſcovered, that nothing either uſeful or beautiful would grow, upon account of barren ground; and the neighbouring gentry, after paying a compliment to my taſte in building, pitied me on being unfortunate in the <hi>ſituation.</hi> I made no more ado, Sir, but upon this, I pull'd (like a true baby tired of my plaything) the whole edifice down, even to the corner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone;
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:0226500401:171"/>
and, in the rage of my heart, hurried with my family again to Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, where I took lodgings, and, in mere deſpair and ſhame, ſhut myſelf up for ſeveral days."</p>
               <p>"My fortune, acquired by the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence of many years, was too ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial to be much hurt by a ſingle folly. I had indeed thrown away up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of two thouſand pounds, and I had got a pretty deal of experience. Now mark the reverſe: from that day to this, I do not believe I have miſemployed or miſplaced a ſingle penny. You ſee me now in the laſt ſtage of my journey. My wife is in heaven, and my children are in good circumſtances: one of my boys has
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:0226500401:172"/>
made a very good piece of arable out of that very ground which was repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated by the indolent gardener: I have rebuilt the houſe, ſo as to make it fine, and warm enough for a farmer; and my third ſon has perſuaded me to buy a pretty parcel of land contiguous to it. As to myſelf, after all the fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lics and vagaries of youth, I have ſomething to line the eaſy chair of old age: I have an old woman to rub my ancles when the gout hath wrapt them up in flannels; my bed is the ſofter for being my own buying, and though I do not bid every puppy put his hand into my purſe, yet, if he can prove to me that he is not a rogue, and is guilty only of raggedneſs, I ſhall never be churl enough to refuſe
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:0226500401:173"/>
him a caſt coat that hangs idly col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting duſt upon a peg, nor will I ſend him away in the winter, without warming himſelf againſt the weather, by a warm ſeat in the chimney-corner. Thus young, Sir, you ſee how fatal it is to indulge imagination: I was the ſport of it for a long time, and happy was it for me, that I conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended, in the ſeaſon of the grey hair, to lead the life of reaſon."</p>
               <p>Here, my dear Charles, the old gentleman ended his ſtory, which, though not abſolutely in point, was truly entertaining, and enriched by very pertinent and ſalutary obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. In all events it will anſwer a very good purpoſe, if the recital of it

               <p>I HAVE health, or at leaſt ſtrength enough returned to vindicate my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to you; for I feel, that I muſt ever remain additionally uneaſy till I ſtand fair and unſuſpected in your thoughts and opinions.</p>

                  <pb n="169" facs="tcp:0226500401:175"/>True it is, that I wandered into a houſe of ill reputation, and did it with a view of burying the image which haunted my repoſe. The utmoſt, indeed, that could poſſibly be expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from ſuch an effort, was not plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, but alleviation of pain. Heaven knows I did not hope for happineſs from the embraces of venal beauty, but merely to deaden for a moment, the ſenſe of intolerable anguiſh; and even this was attempted in the abſence or lethargy of every cool and rational faculty. Shall I confeſs to you, that I ſent a creature of convenience for a wretched female, who depended on her daily violations for ſubſiſtence? the meſſenger delayed, and my ſpirits ſinking in the <hi>interim,</hi> I ſwallowed a
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:0226500401:176"/>
bumper of champaign, and drank to the health of Charlotte, even in my debauch. As I was pouring down the third glaſs, now almoſt daylight, I heard the ruſtle of ſilks upon the ſtairs. What a ſenſation did this trifle produce! but, ah! how unlike <hi>that I</hi> had been us'd to feel, when the ſtep of Charlotte animated my expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. A female came; ſhewy, labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly adorned, and, as ſhe ſoon told me, juſt out of bed. I began immediately to make compariſons: they were indeed <hi>odious.</hi> I look'd in the eyes, for Charlotte's love-born languiſhment, and I found in their ſtead artful ogles, miſuſing the luſtre of what might once have been innocently bright. I ſurveyed
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:0226500401:177"/>
the face for tender ſenſibility; the form for engaging deportment, and the dreſs, for the union of elegance and judgment; inſtead of which, I beheld confident aukwardneſs, and a flaunting variety, betraying at once the taſte and the trade. The lady, however, to whom long habit had rendered every thing indifferent but finery, called up a look which ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied an entire compliance. I muſt own to my dear friend, that time, place, and opportunity, all favoured. Ah! madam, there was but one thing wanting to compleat the ſcene.

               <p>YOU are not to be acquainted that I have loſt my happineſs. But that is not to be the ſubject of this addreſs: you complain of your circumſtances, and I ſhall, to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of my very ſlender abilities, be ever ready to alleviate them. You will pleaſe to accept the incloſed trifle, as an evidence of my future in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="179" facs="tcp:0226500401:185"/>I believe you have no idea that it is poſſible for you and I to be re-uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Without entering painfully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a repetition of the points that at firſt divided us, I ſhall only obſerve to you, that our reconciliation (I mean ſo far as relates to our living together) is <hi>impracticable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I find that <hi>our child</hi> is at boarding-ſchool at a great diſtance from you: as your money is locked up at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, the ſupport of this muſt be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenient. I have been long anxious to ſee, and have my ſhare of the pleaſure ariſing from the ſociety of the child; and I will now venture to requeſt that I may be allowed to take
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:0226500401:186"/>
upon me the care of its education under my own eye. It ſhall receive from me all the tenderneſs and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate aſſiduities of a father. I will lead it up in the paths of honour; not a ſentiment ſhall be inculcated but thoſe that will inſpire her heart with virtue, or accompliſh her head with underſtanding. Surely madam, though it is neceſſary we ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main ſeparate, it is by no means ſo that we ſhould, in any degree, alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, or entertain againſt each other a ſingle ſentiment of antipathy. I beſeech you therefore to allow me the common pleaſure of a parent: as the child is apart from you at preſent, it may as well remain under <hi>my</hi> protection as that of a ſtranger.
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:0226500401:187"/>
I have thoughts of placing it near me at an excellent ſeminary, of which I will, at the proper time, give you the direction, that you may favour the object of our mutual de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light with your viſits, and maternal attention: only truſt it to my care, and I ſhall be ſatisfied.</p>
               <p>I do not inſult you with a ſentence in relation to a late connection. Whatever were the diſagreements betwixt you and me, may they never be communicated to the curioſity of the public: and as to my intercourſes elſewhere, may they never come within your knowledge to diſtreſs you.

               <p>I WRITE to you with my left arm in a ſling, and a ball in the bottom of my breaſt, as yet vainly endeavoured to be extracted: the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh of my mind exceeds that of my body, and I have no relief but from writing to you; and that <hi>is</hi> a relief although it is not without a great deal of pain I hold the pen: my ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon, however, has left me for an

hour, and I am reſolved to employ the interval of his perfections, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to you the principal circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of a quarrel that ended in blood on both ſides.</p>
               <p>I was on Tueſday laſt at a public dinner in the city, whither I went (in the hand of an acquaintance) on purpoſe to diſſipate a little, and to expel thought, by looking about me. The glaſs was briſkly circulated, and after we had run rapidly the round of general healths, ſuch as the king, church, royal family, <hi>&amp;c. &amp;c.</hi> we came home to the private toaſts of the heart, and drank each to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity of his paſſion, and the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his miſtreſs. In the ſincerity
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:0226500401:192"/>
of my heart, I verged a little upon common ceremonies, and gave the divine Charlotte. I was pleaſed to ſee many politely ready to fill his glaſs of good wiſhes; but a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon at the other end of the table re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated her name two or three times ſarcaſtically, and at laſt, in a kind of half whiſper, told his companion that ſhe was to be <hi>had</hi> at—, but that her price was confoundedly high. I deſired an explanation of this— ſmoke the <hi>favourite,</hi> ſaid the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, ſimpering to his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.—The companion called to order, and I ſat down: we drank freely, and though my heart lay burning within my boſom, I did not revive the ſubject, 'till the toaſt came
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:0226500401:193"/>
round to the perſon who had inſulted me. He propoſed a lady: I drank her health, and then apologizing to the maſter of the treat for being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to ſtay longer, withdrew.</p>
               <p>I retired haſtily into a room be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the ſame tavern, and ſoon found from my landlord, the name and quality of the perſon which at preſent employed my thoughts: he was an half pay officer of —'s re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment. Pen and ink being brought, I wrote as follows:

                        <p>YOUR profeſſion leaves your courage unſuſpected. Without commenting, therefore, on wanting the manners of a Britiſh ſoldier, I have only to hint, that you have <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted</hi> a gentleman, who is waiting for you where the bearer will privately conduct you. I am ſtepping out to prepare <hi>properly</hi> for your reception, as I preſume neither of us are prepared in that way; but I ſhall return im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately.</p>
                        <p>After I had folded up, and ſent the waiter with this billet, I went to a
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:0226500401:195"/>
gunſmith's in the neighbourhood, and ſoon provided a brace of piſtols, with which I returned. The officer ſent a verbal meſſage by the ſervant, that he ſhould not attend to ſuch kind of engagements 'till the company broke up, and perhaps after that he might be in a humour to correct a ſtripling, who was hot enough to fight for his w—. Stung beyond meaſure at this, I ran abruptly into the dining-room, and placed myſelf oppoſite to the inſulter. He was that minute entering into what he was pleaſed to ſuppoſe the hiſtory of our former ſeparation, having heard, as it appeared, ſome abſurd ſtory on that ſubject. He broke off upon my en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance, and filled his glaſs: juſt as he
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:0226500401:196"/>
was lifting it to his lip, I roſe, and in a whiſper told him my contemptible opinion of a <hi>ſcoundrel,</hi> eſpecially when he happened to diſgrace a cockade. The colour of rage immediately roſe over our hero's countenance, and he threw the contents of his glaſs into my face. All meaſures being now taken between us, I withdrew a ſecond time, and the lieutenant was held by his companions.</p>
                        <p>My pains, Templeton, are ſo acute, I muſt reſt a little.</p>

I ſhewed myſelf.—The lieutenant beckoned to me, and I followed him. With the firſt opportunity
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:0226500401:198"/>
he called a hackney coach, into which we both got, and rode in it ſullenly till we came to the apartment of the Lieutenant. Both of us threw down a ſhilling for the fare, becauſe either diſdained the obligation, in ſuch a eaſe, of being treated. He conducted me into a large well furniſhed din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-room, where, after having turned the key, he begg'd pardon for not attending me at the firſt ſummons, and propoſed an immediate accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation of differences.—We fought —he conquered—I fell.—</p>

               <p>OH my dear father aſſiſt me: the oldeſt, and beſt, and moſt ingenious friend I have in the world, is now on the bed of ſickneſs, and in want of a ſmall ſupply of caſh to

               <p>NOW the murder's out I find. I ſhall forbear henceforward to wonder at your extravagance, or at the various ſhifts you are driven to, to ſupport it. Upon my word, young gentleman, you are a mighty pretty fellow; a very prince of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity; a perfect Pilades! and pray who <hi>is</hi> this heroic Oreſtes? but no matter! and ſo you want to fleece the old fellow out of fifty pieces, do
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:0226500401:222"/>
you? very well puſhed, I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs; but it won't take. I warrant you now, if I ſhould be blockhead enough to ſend you a draft for this money, you and your friend would be both cured of your ſickneſs and your ſorrows, and hug yourſelves happily at having humbug'd the old put of a father.</p>
               <p>I am mightily tickled with the compliment you pay my generoſity, at the expence of my prudence. As much as if you had ſaid to a lady, madam, I admire your eyes, if they were not in the way of your noſe, and I am charmed with your teeth, only it is a pity they overhang your lips. — Between you and I, Sir, it is not
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:0226500401:223"/>
quite clear to me whether your gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity, as you call it, will not one day or another exalt you above the heads of the people, and give you a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminent <hi>exit</hi> at Tyburn. Why, you no more mind fifty pounds than fifty flea-bites, or ſo many ſnaps of the finger. Do you know Sir, that fifty pounds will buy me a pair of horſes for my carriage — that it will equip me in cloaths for two years?—that it is more than you ought to have <hi>per annum,</hi> and find every thing; although I am fool enough to double it?</p>
               <p>If I will give you an order for this ſum, you will live more <hi>oeconomically</hi> —ſo you <hi>can</hi> live more oeconomically,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:0226500401:224"/>
can you? why, you are a prodigal by your own confeſſion, and I have a great mind to ſink the half of your allowance from this day, till you are pinched into prudence! I can't con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive where the plague you got that curſed talent for laviſhing money! none of my family, nor any of your mother's, were ever ſpendthrifts. We were all upon the ſaving order. Zounds, ſir! I have had three ſets of buttons upon one ſuit of cloaths: but you ſcorn to ſet any thing off ſavingly, and by the way of Cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, as I uſed to expreſs myſelf. I have abſolutely heard you laugh at ſoling a pair of ſhoes; you never would ſuffer my taylor to <hi>turn</hi> cloth of eighteen ſhillings <hi>per</hi> yard;
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:0226500401:225"/>
and I have ſeen you toſs up your noſe at a fine-drawn ſtroke in the elbow! for all this, you can conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend to go ſkulking with a bundle under your arm, in the duſk of the evening, to a pawn-brokers! Zounds, ſir! what a low-ſpirited dog you muſt be! to run into ſuch a horrid place, with a coat, a ſhirt, and an old pair of ſtockings!</p>
               <p>To be plain, young man, I do not expect any good from you while you are ſo conſumedly liberal, and ready to give away your money to every coxcomb or impoſtor that aſks for it. But 'tis as I ever ſaid, "lightly come lightly go." Be that as it may: I will not ſend you a ſingle ſhilling to
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:0226500401:226"/>
ſpend in ſuch romantic purpoſes: and I would rather relieve any wound than that occaſioned by a duel. Every fellow that dares to lift up his hand againſt the life of another, ought to ſmart for it; and I ſhould be ſorry, for any one to eſcape out of ſuch an infamous en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter without the loſs of a limb, or a ſcar at the leaſt. If the truth was known, I don't doubt but your friend fought for a wench, or becauſe he was drunk, or becauſe he wanted better and wiſer employment. Let the fact, however, be what it will, I am very angry that you ſhould be a very great fool yourſelf, and that you ſhould endeavour to make me a much greater.</p>

               <p>I Continue to mend, and yet the inhuman Melbank ſtill denies me the uſe of pen and paper; but I have bribed my nurſe to buy me ſome, and ſhe keeps it under lock and key.

Her ſenſe—her elegance—her delicacy— her gentleneſs—her love — I mean her <hi>friendſhip,</hi> are all ſo many cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dials to me. I lay them—I lay the
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:0226500401:228"/>
letters which contain the marks of them, upon my pillow, and they add ſoftneſs to the down—I preſs them upon my boſom, even till they touch my wounds, and they act as the healing balm, or reſtoratives of life, health, and joy—I then carry them to my heart, and it pants to confeſs from whence they came. How then can this cruel Melbank tell me that I muſt ſtifle ſuch ideas—ſuch actions —how can he ſay they will agitate me into a relapſe? You, Charlotte, are acquainted—you have perhaps ſome intereſt with Cleora. If ſo, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercede with her, I beſeech you, for my child.

               <p>NOtwithſtanding, dear madam, what I urged to you, in ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs to your friend Charles, laſt night, in regard to the danger of
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:0226500401:233"/>
writing pathetic letters before the nervous ſyſtem could bear ſuch alar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming concuſſions, I would not, on any account, have you take any no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of this friendly hint to my pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient. He might miſconſtrue it. Young men of lively ſpirits, and animated tempers, are apt to miſtake. <hi>You,</hi> however, ſee my motive, and will take your meaſures accordingly. I cannot but uſe this opportunity to applaud the dignity of your reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions in regard to the ſeparation. 'Tis an effort even ſuperior to the virtue of the Spartan Ladies: 'tis Roman—'tis Chriſtian! How much ought you to be celebrated for ſo il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious an action! and how infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ought Cleora to ſound your praiſes!
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:0226500401:234"/>
at the ſame time, my good lady, are you not a little too enterprizing to continue the correſpondence? was it not a little too much in the novel ſtrain to come in a boy's habit, and diſplay ſuch various beauties to the eye of Charles, in ſuch a ſituation— ſoftened as he was by ſickneſs, touched as he muſt be at the diſcovery? you recollect to what an embarraſſment he was reduced: did not he faint? did not he fall lifeleſs on the pillow? and was it not with great difficulty you yourſelf could ſupport the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict? ſuffer me to ſay, ſuch trials, if frequent, would ſtagger the firmeſt philoſophy, and I doubt, it is at beſt raſhneſs to put too much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in our own ſtrength when we
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:0226500401:235"/>
oppoſe it to thoſe paſſions which too often turn ſtrength into weakneſs. It is certainly your duty to avoid the temptation as much as poſſible, and this you can do, only by aſſiduouſly avoiding every thing that reminds you of the object. Don't you know, my dear Madam, that in epidemic diſtempers, we are only ſecure, while we eſcape the touch of the contagious perſon? and with reſpect to wounds of the mind, they are like thoſe of the body; if we venture abroad too ſoon, or, thinking our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves quite cured, if we run haſtily into circumſtances that hurt us before, we ſhall, in all human probability, have a return of our complaint; and a
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:0226500401:236"/>
relapſe, in either caſe, is often worſe than the firſt attack.</p>
               <p>To drop, however, the language of my profeſſion, and ſpeak as a moraliſt, I muſt every way, and by every argument, recommend it to you to lay aſide the correſponding pen: every line in every letter ſtirs the embers, which, if not meddled with would go out, till, in the end, the fatal paſſion which at firſt kindled the original flame, would be utterly extinguiſhed. But, I beg pardon. I am too haſtily aſſuming the ſoft authority of friendſhip.

               <head>LETTER LXIII. CHARLES to CHARLOTTE.</head>
               <p>TWO days run away, and not <hi>one</hi> letter? but you may be ill—you may be incapable of writing —Oh! heaven forbid that! I would rather find myſelf neglected, than have you furniſhed with an apology from real indiſpoſition. Yet, indeed, Charlotte, if you <hi>can,</hi> you <hi>ſhould</hi> write, and write longer letters than ever. There is more neceſſity for ſuch an indulgence. I am very weak; my wound heals tardily—my friend is abſent, and a nurſe's officiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,

is by no means like the tender attentions of a lover or a friend. Ah! what a bleſſing would my Charlotte's ſociety now be! how might ſhe ſupport me with her kind arm as I made gradual efforts to walk acroſs my chamber: from her hand how acceptable would be the bittereſt draught, and the moſt nauſeous drugs that could be adminiſtered! in the middle of the day, when the ſun favoured the attempt, here might Charlotte lead me to the opened window till I revived: the balmy air would be additionally ſalubrious, the warm beams of noon would be doubly genial, if Charlotte was by my ſide. But this is impoſſible — yet ſurely it is not impoſſible to give me
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:0226500401:240"/>
the only comfort I can now receive! —the innocent comfort of a daily letter! the moſt rigid enemy could not deny me that! and will Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotte then deny it? write, I charge you, and gild my ſolitary ſickneſs with one ray of ſatisfaction!</p>

               <p>THE date of a card I have this inſtant received from a perſon in the city, puts me in mind of a circumſtance that brings the
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:0226500401:241"/>
tears of tender congratulation into my eyes. It is the 18th of Auguſt! my watch, which hangs at the head of the bed, points betwixt the hours of eight and nine! It is the anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary morning of my Charlotte's birth! it is the returning day of the year, that gave to the world one of the beſt and lovelieſt of women! the ſun darts chearfully into my chamber: the ſky is uncommonly azure! I have opened the caſement, and am ſaluted with a breeze more balmy and ſerene, than I ever felt in my life. There is a grape-vine run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing along the wall, till its tendrils ambitiouſly twiſt round my window, and come mantling into my bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>room. The foliage on the outſide is
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:0226500401:242"/>
uncommonly luxurious! and ſince I have been confined, a red-breaſt has neſted amongſt the leaves. He is this moment in the ſweeteſt thrillings of his domeſtic ſong! Even ſo near the buſtle and buildings of the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolis, I have all the advantages of rural life! Every thing around me ſeems to compliment my Charlotte! What then muſt I feel upon the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject? how muſt I be touched—with what an ardent ſincerity muſt I wiſh this day, and every revolving one— every eighteenth of Auguſt—how —how, I ſay, muſt I pray—how ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate the powers of happineſs and health that

                     <l>This day may be always ſacred;</l>
                     <l>No mourning, no misfortune happen on it;</l>
                     <l>That it be mark't with triumphs and rejoicings;</l>
                     <l>That happy lovers ſtill may make it holy</l>
                     <l>And ever chooſe it to endear remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance!</l>
                  </q>
From the bottom of my heart I hail the return of this delightful morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. And yet, Charlotte, how cruelly buſy is fancy in the breaſt and brain of a man under certain influences? what a train of objects now uſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me? what a viſion is Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation drawing? how ſhe ſwells upon the canvaſs? what a glow in
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:0226500401:244"/>
her colouring? what animation in her touches? there is character in every ſtroke of her pencil; her figures are from the life. She has a hand that throws Raphael into deſpair. Her exact ſimilitudes captivate the eye, and her reſemblances ſubdue the heart!</p>
               <p>Methinks I now ſee how Charlotte employs the preſent day; ſhe invites the numerous circles of thoſe that wiſh her well: the feaſt is prepared: the lovely entertainer in the bloom of beauty and youth, ſits at the head of the table as goddeſs of the ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet. She delights more by her ſenſes, her wit, and her politeneſs, than by the delicacies of her board.
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:0226500401:245"/>
And yet can it ever Charlotte, ah! can it ever be forgotten, in what Charles uſed to engage upon this day! will not his attention to the very hour, the minute—the ſecond of her birth, be long remembered? With what a more than bridal vigilance did he watch the returns of this auſpicious aera! how did he fondly buſy himſelf in birth-day preparations—love con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, exalted love inſpired, his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct upon theſe occaſions. It was love that invited the ſun to ſhine on that day with a conſpicuous luſtre: it was love that provided the orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and decorating novelties which were then, for the <hi>firſt time,</hi> to be worn: it was love that wept over the ſparkling glaſs: love it was which
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:0226500401:246"/>
gave the congratulating kiſs—and it was love which ſmiled as the day cloſed, and as the indulging night advanced, to give you, all accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed, to my embraces.</p>
               <p>Surely theſe recollections will, even in the midſt of natal feſtivity, revive thoſe ſentiments in the ſympathizing boſom of Charlotte, which will beſtow one tender ſigh to the memory of affection, and</p>
