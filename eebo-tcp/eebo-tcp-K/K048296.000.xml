            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <p>Sir, by the mouth of a parent ſhe receives admonition from Heaven itſelf; and when he commits that charge to another, it is indeed ſacred. The care of youth is an ardu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and delicate truſt of confidence, and honor; I look upon truth, cleanlineſs, and frugality, to be the firſt principles in a lady's education. They preſerve to her mind, perſon, and means, purity, health, and independence of obligation, which thro' the devious paths of her future life, to the unſuſpecting female, is often the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed adder, for the deſtruction of her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence.</p>

I don't know any one thing that my boy is not perfect maſter of, muſic, dancing, fencing, lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, a magazine of accompliſhments: ſet him to country ſports, he excels every body; he's as keen as an attorney, has the courage of a maſtiff, generous as the Man of Roſs! but hang it, all his ſhining qualities clouded by want of ſpirit to daſh!

I wiſh my Lord hadn't part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with it! the caſtle and its delightful envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons were the tranquil ſcenes of my moſt happy hours! after marriage our firſt years were paſs'd here, and tho' there was title on his ſide, and great wealth on mine, yet ours was not a match of faſhion! neither ambition on my part, or (I think) avarice on his; very young to be ſure,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0439800200:52"/>but then I was a little philoſopher, tho' bred in the full brilliant certainty of every dazzling joy that riches cou'd beſtow, yet my ſight was proof againſt the glare of ſplendor. My Lord was gay, accompliſh'd, and the generoſity of a youthful mind repell'd all idea of advantage in our union.</p>

                     <p>I think, Martha, I remember the caſtle better than you, who have lived in it ſo long. Out of that door there's a ſtair-caſe to my Lord's dreſſing-room, where I'll wait till he comes in. I'd wiſh to know a little more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſee him. Rather mean this lurking about and tampering with ſervants—but no hope of reclaiming him, except he's certain I know what then will be out of his power to deny. <stage>(aſide)</stage> My Lord rode out you ſay; formed diſcompoſed? well, not a word that I'm here, <stage>(Martha returns)</stage> this houſe ſeems all wild, no regularity, peace, or the comforts of a home, but the gratification of paſſions which reaſon and nature now ſhould ſubdue, reconciles him to inquietude, meanneſs, and diſhonour. So, this room now belongs to his vile agent! it was formerly put to a better purpoſe—this is the very room I converted to a ſchool for the poor infant ruſtics. Here the young mind was trained to virtue and induſtry—here now, are perhaps, plans laid to corrupt and deſtroy the ſweet roſe of innocence! Eh, who's here!</p>
