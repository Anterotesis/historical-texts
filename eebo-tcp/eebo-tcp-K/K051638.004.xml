            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE <hi>EDITOR</hi> to the <hi>READER.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>IF it may be thought reaſonable to cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticiſe the Public Taſte, in what are generally ſuppoſed to be Works of mere Amuſement; or modeſt to direct its Judgment, in what is offered for its Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment; I would beg leave to introduce the following Sheets with a few curſory. Remarks, that may lead the common Reader into ſome tolerable conception of the nature of this Work, and the deſign of its Author.</p>
            <p>THE cloſe connexion which every Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual has with all that relates to MAN in general, ſtrongly inclines us to turn our obſervation upon human affairs, prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably to other attentions, and impatiently to wait the progreſs and iſſue of them. But, as the courſe of human actions is too ſlow to gratify our inquiſitive curioſity,
<pb n="ii" facs="tcp:0447200104:3"/>
obſervant men very eaſily contrived to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy its rapidity, by the invention of <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory.</hi> Which, by recording the principal circumſtances of paſt facts, and laying them cloſe together, in a continued narration, kept the mind from languiſhing, and gave conſtant exerciſe to its reflections.</p>
            <p>BUT as it commonly happens, that in all indulgent refinements on our ſatisfactions, the Procurers to our pleaſures run into ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs; ſo it happened here. Strict matters of fact, how delicately ſoever dreſſed up, ſoon grew too ſimple and inſipid to a taſte ſtimulated by the Luxury of Art: They wanted ſomething of more poignancy to quicken and enforce a jaded appetite. Hence the original of the firſt barbarous <hi>Romances,</hi> abounding with this falſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocative of uncommon, extraordinary, and miraculous Adventures.</p>
            <p>BUT ſatiety, in things unnatural, ſoon brings on diſguſt. And the Reader, at length, began to ſee, that too eager a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit after <hi>Adventures</hi> had drawn him from what firſt engaged his attention, MAN <hi>and his Ways,</hi> into the Fairy Walks of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and Chimeras. And now thoſe who
<pb n="iii" facs="tcp:0447200104:4"/>
had run fartheſt after theſe deluſions, were the firſt that recovered themſelves. For the next Species of Fiction, which took its name from its <hi>novelty,</hi> was of <hi>Spaniſh</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention. Theſe preſented us with ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of Humanity; but of Humanity in a ſtiff unnatural ſtate. For, as every thing before was conducted by <hi>Inchantment</hi>; ſo now all was managed by <hi>Intrigue.</hi> And tho' it had indeed a kind of <hi>Life,</hi> it had yet, as in its infancy, nothing of <hi>Manners.</hi> On which account, thoſe, who could not penetrate into the ill conſtitution of its plan, yet grew diſguſted at the dryneſs of the Conduct, and want of eaſe in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtrophe.</p>
            <p>THE avoiding theſe defects gave riſe to the <hi>Heroical Romances</hi> of the <hi>French</hi>; in which ſome celebrated Story of antiquity was ſo ſtained and polluted by modern fable and invention, as was juſt enough to ſhew, that the contrivers of them neither knew how to lye, nor ſpeak truth. In theſe voluminous extravagances, <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi> ſupplied the place of <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</hi> But the over-refinement of Platonic ſentiments always ſinks into the droſs and feces of that Paſſion. For in attempting a
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0447200104:5"/>
more natural repreſentation of it, in the little amatory Novels, which ſucceeded theſe heavier Volumes, tho' the Writers avoided the dryneſs of the Spaniſh Intrigue, and the extravagance of the French He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roiſm, yet, by too natural a repreſentation of their Subject, they opened the door to a worſe evil than a corruption of <hi>Taſte</hi>; and that was, A corruption of <hi>Heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AT length, this great People (to whom, it muſt be owned, all Science has been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely indebted) hit upon the true Secret, by which alone a deviation from ſtrict fact, in the commerce of Man, could be really entertaining to an improved mind, or uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to promote that Improvement. And this was by a faithful and chaſte copy of real <hi>Life and Manners:</hi> In which ſome of their late Writers have greatly excelled.</p>
            <p>IT was on this ſenſible Plan, that the Author of the following Sheets attempted to pleaſe, in an Eſſay, which had the good fortune to meet with ſucceſs: That encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement engaged him in the preſent De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign: In which his ſole object being <hi>Human Nature,</hi> he thought himſelf at liberty to draw a Picture of it in that light which
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:0447200104:6"/>
would ſhew it with moſt ſtrength of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion; tho' at the expence of what ſuch as read merely for Amuſement, may fancy can be ill-ſpared, the more artificial com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of a ſtory in one continued Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative.</p>
            <p>HE has therefore told his Tale in a Series of Letters, ſuppoſed to be written by the Parties concerned, as the circumſtances related, paſſed. For this juncture afforded him the only natural opportunity that could be had, of repreſenting with any grace thoſe lively and delicate impreſſions which <hi>Things preſent</hi> are known to make upon the minds of thoſe affected by them. And he appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends, that, in the ſtudy of Human Nature, the knowlege of thoſe apprehenſions leads us farther into the receſſes of the Human Mind, than the colder and more general reflections ſuited to a continued and more contracted Narrative.</p>
            <p>THIS is the nature and purport of his At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt. Which, perhaps, may not be ſo well or generally underſtood. For if the Reader ſeeks here for Strange Tales, Love Stories, Heroical Adventures, or, in ſhort, for any thing but a <hi>Faithful Picture of Nature</hi> in
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0447200104:7"/>
               <hi>Private Life,</hi> he had better be told before hand the likelihood of his being diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed. But if he can find Uſe or Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment; either <hi>Directions for his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct,</hi> or <hi>Employment for his Pity,</hi> in a HISTORY <hi>of</hi> LIFE <hi>and</hi> MANNERS, where, as in the World itſelf, we find Vice, for a time, triumphant, and Virtue in diſtreſs, an idle hour or two, we hope, may not be unprofitably loſt.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>HEN you reflect upon my unhappy ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is attended with ſo many indelicate and even ſhocking circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, ſome of which my pride will not let me think of with patience; all aggravated by the contents of my couſin's affecting letter; you will not wonder, that the vapouriſhneſs which has laid hold of my heart, ſhould riſe to my pen. And yet it would be more kind, more friendly in me, to conceal from <hi>you,</hi> who take ſuch a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous intereſt in my concerns, that worſt part of my griefs, which communication and complaint cannot relieve.</p>
               <p>But to whom can I unboſom myſelf but to you?—When the man who ought to be my protector, as he
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0447200104:9"/>
has brought upon me all my diſtreſſes, adds to my ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions; when I have not even a ſervant on whoſe fidelity I can rely, or to whom I can break my griefs as they ariſe; and when his bountiful temper and gay heart, attach every one to him; and I am but a cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, to give him ſignificance, and myſelf pain?—Theſe griefs, therefore, do what I can, will ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times burſt into tears; and theſe mingling with my ink, will blot my paper.—And I know you will not grudge me the temporary relief.</p>
               <p>But I ſhall go on in the ſtrain I left off with in my laſt; when I intended rather to apologize for my me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy. But let what I have above written, once for all, be my apology. My misfortunes have given you a call to diſcharge the nobleſt offices of the friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip we have vowed to each other, in advice and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation, and it would be an injury to it, and to you, to ſuppoſe it needed even that call.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>She then tells Miſs Howe, that now her cloaths are come, Mr. Lovelace is continually teazing her to go abroad with him in a coach, attended by whom ſhe pleaſes of her own ſex; either for the air, or to the public diverſions.</p>
                  <p>She gives the particulars of a converſation that has paſſed between them on that ſubject, and his ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral propoſals. But takes notice, that he ſays not the leaſt word of the ſolemnity which he ſo much preſſed upon her before they came to town; and which, as ſhe obſerves, was neceſſary to give pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety to his propoſals.</p>
               </q>
               <p>Now, my dear, <hi>ſays ſhe,</hi> I cannot bear the life I live. I would be glad at my heart to be out of his reach. If I were, he ſhould ſoon ſee the difference. If I muſt be humbled, it had better be by thoſe to whom I owe duty, than by him. My aunt writes in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>er letter <note n="(a)" place="bottom">See Vol. <hi>III.</hi> p. <hi>251.</hi>
                  </note>, that SHE dare not propoſe any thing in
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0447200104:10"/>
my favour. You tell me, that, upon inquiry, you find <note n="(b)" place="bottom">
                     <hi>See Vol.</hi> III. <hi>p.</hi> 272, 273.</note>, that, had I not been unhappily ſeduced away, a change of meaſures was actually reſolved upon; and that my mamma, particularly, was deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to exert herſelf, for the reſtoration of the family peace; and, in order to ſucceed the better, had thoughts of trying to engage my uncle Harlowe in her party.</p>
               <p>Let me build on theſe foundations.—I can but try, my dear.—It is my duty to try all <hi>probable</hi> methods to reſtore the poor outcaſt to favour.—And who knows but that once indulgent uncle, who has very great weight in the family, may be induced to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in my behalf?—I will give up all right and title to my grandfather's bequeſts, with all my heart and ſoul, to whom they ſhall think fit, in order to make my propoſal palatable to my brother. And that my ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render may be effectual, I will engage never to marry.</p>
               <p>What think you, my dear, of this expedient? Surely they cannot reſolve to renounce me for ever. If they look with impartial eyes upon what has happened, they <hi>will</hi> have ſomething to blame <hi>themſelves</hi> for, as well as <hi>me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I preſume, that you will be of opinion, that this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient is worth trying. But here is my difficulty; If I ſhould write, my hard-hearted brother has ſo ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confederated every-body againſt me, that my let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter would be handed about from one to another, till he had hardened every one to refuſe my requeſt; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, could my uncle be engaged to eſpouſe my cauſe, as from <hi>himſelf,</hi> I ſhould have ſome hope; as I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to think he would ſoon have my mother, and my aunt, of his party.</p>
               <p>What therefore I am thinking of, is this.—Suppoſe Mr. Hickman, whoſe good character has gained him every-body's reſpect, ſhould put himſelf in my uncle Harlowe's way? And as if, from your knowlege of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0447200104:11"/>
the ſtate of things between Mr. Lovelace and me, aſſure him not only of the above particulars, but that I am under no obligations, that ſhall hinder me from taking his directions?</p>
               <p>I ſubmit the whole to your diſcretion, whether to purſue it at all, or in what manner. But if it be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued, and if my uncle refuſes to intereſt himſelf in my favour, upon Mr. Hickman's application, as from you (for ſo, for obvious reaſons, it muſt be put), I can then have no hope; and my next ſtep, in the mind I am in, ſhall be, to throw myſelf into the protection of the ladies of his family.</p>
               <p>It were an impiety to adopt the following lines, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it would be throwing upon the decrees of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence a fault too much my own. But often do I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve them, for the ſake of the general ſimilitude which they bear to my unhappy, yet undeſigned error.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>To you, great gods! I make my laſt appeal:</l>
                  <l>Or clear my virtues, or my crimes reveal.</l>

               <p>Miſs Harlowe dates again on Monday, to let Miſs Howe know, that Mr. Lovelace, on obſerving her uneaſineſs, had introduced to her Mr. Mennell, Mrs. Fretchville's kinſman, who managed all her affairs [a young officer of ſenſe and politeneſs, ſhe calls him]; and who gave her an account of the houſe and furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to the ſame effect that Mr. Lovelace had done before; as alſo of the melancholy way Mrs. Fretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville is in.</p>
               <p>She tells Miſs Howe, how extremely urgent Mr. Lovelace was with the gentleman, to get his ſpouſe (as he now always calls her before company) a ſight of the houſe: And that Mr. Mennell undertook that very

afternoon to ſhew her all of it, except the apartment Mrs. Fretchville ſhould be in, when ſhe went. But that ſhe choſe not to take another ſtep till ſhe knew how ſhe approved of her ſcheme to have her uncle ſounded; and what ſucceſs, if try'd, it would be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with.</p>
               <p>Mr. Lovelace, in his humourous way, gives his friend an account of the Lady's peeviſhneſs and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, on receiving a letter with her cloaths. He regrets that he has loſt her confidence; which he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes to bringing her into the company of his four companions. Yet he thinks he muſt excuſe them, and cenſure her for over-niceneſs; for that he never ſaw men behave better, at leaſt not <hi>them.</hi>

But I ſhall make myſelf a common man by-and-by: Which is what no one yet ever thought me. I will now lead to the occaſion of this preamble.</p>
                     <p>I had been out. On my return, meeting Dorcas on the ſtairs—Your lady in her chamber, Dorcas? In the dining-room, Sir: And if ever you hope for an opportunity to come at a letter, it muſt be now. For at her feet I ſaw one lie, which, by its open'd folds, ſhe has been reading, with a little parcel of others ſhe is now buſied with. All pulled out of her pocket, as I believe: So, Sir, you'll know where to find them another time.</p>
                     <p>I was ready to leap for joy, and inſtantly reſolved to bring forward an expedient which I had held in petto; and entering into the dining-room, with an air of tranſport, I boldly claſped my arms about her, as ſhe ſat (ſhe huddling up her papers in her hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerchief all the time, the dropt paper unſeen): O my deareſt life, a lucky expedient have Mr. Mennell and I hit upon, juſt now. In order to haſten Mrs. Fretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville to quit the houſe, I have agreed, if you approve of it, to entertain her cook, her houſemaid, and two men-ſervants (about whom ſhe was very ſolicitous), till you are provided to your mind. And that no accommodations may be wanted, I have conſented to take the houſhold linen at an appraiſement.</p>
                     <p>I am to pay down 500 l. and the remainder as ſoon as the bills can be look'd up, and the amount of them
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0447200104:19"/>
adjuſted. Thus will you have a charming houſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely ready to receive you, and any of my friends. They will ſoon be with you: They will not permit you long to ſuſpend my happy day.—And that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing may be wanting to gratify your utmoſt punctilio, I will till then conſent to ſtay here at Mrs. Sinclair's, while you reſide at your new houſe; and leave the reſt to your own generoſity.</p>
                     <p>O my beloved creature, will not this be agreeable to you? I am ſure it will—It muſt—And claſping her cloſer to me, I gave her a more fervent kiſs than ever I had dared to give her before: But ſtill let not my ardor overcome my diſcretion; for I took care to ſet my foot upon the letter, and ſcraped it farther from her, as it were behind her chair.</p>
                     <p>She was in a paſſion at the liberty I took. Bowing low, I begg'd her pardon; and, ſtooping ſtill lower, in the ſame motion, took it up, and whipt it in my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom.</p>
                     <p>Pox on me, for a puppy, a fool, a blockhead, a clumſy varlet, and a mere Jack Belford!—I thought myſelf a much cleverer fellow than I am!—Why could I not have been followed in by Dorcas; who might have taken it up, while I addreſſed her lady?</p>
                     <p>For here, the letter being unfolded, I could not put it into my boſom, without alarming her ears, as my ſudden motion did her eyes.—Up ſhe flew in a moment: Traitor! Judas! her eyes flaſhing light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and a perturbation in her eager countenance, ſo charming!—What have you taken up?—And then, what for both my ears I durſt not to have done to her, ſhe made no ſcruple to ſeize the ſtolen letter, tho' in my boſom.</p>
                     <p>Beg-pardon apologies were all that now remained for me, on ſo palpable a detection. I claſped her hand, which had hold of the raviſh'd paper, between mine: O my beloved creature! can you think I have not <hi>ſome</hi> curioſity? Is it poſſible you can be thus for
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0447200104:20"/>
ever employed; and I, loving narrative letter-writing above every other ſpecies of writing, and admiring your talent that way, ſhould not (thus upon the dawn of my happineſs, as I preſume to hope) burn with a deſire to be admitted into ſo ſweet a correſpondence.</p>
                     <p>Let go my hand!—ſtamping with her pretty foot: How dare you, Sir!—At this rate, I ſee—Too plainly I ſee—And more ſhe could not ſay: But, gaſping, was ready to faint, with paſſion and affright; the devil a bit of her accuſtomed gentleneſs to be ſeen in her charming face, or to be heard in her muſical voice.</p>
                     <p>Having gone thus far, loth, very loth was I to loſe my prize—Once more, I got hold of the rumpled-up letter!—Impudent man! were her words: Stamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing again: For God's ſake, then it was!—I let go my prize, leſt ſhe ſhould faint away: But had the pleaſure firſt to find my hand within both hers, ſhe trying to open my reluctant fingers. How near was my heart, at that moment, to my hand, throbbing to my fingers ends, to be thus familiarly, altho' angrily, treated by the charmer of my ſoul!</p>
                     <p>When ſhe had got it in her poſſeſſion, ſhe flew to the door: I threw myſelf in her way, ſhut it, and, in the humbleſt manner, beſought her to forgive me: And yet do you think the Harlowe-hearted charmer would; notwithſtanding the agreeable annunciation I came in with?—No, truly! but puſhing me rudely from the door, as if I had been nothing (yet do I love to try, ſo innocently to try, her ſtrength too!); ſhe gaining that force through paſſion, which I had loſt through fear; and out ſhe ſhot to her own apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment [Thank my ſtars ſhe could fly no further!]; and as ſoon as ſhe enter'd it, in a paſſion ſtill, ſhe double-locked and double-bolted herſelf in.—This my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, on reflection, that, upon a greater offence, it cannot be worſe!</p>
                     <p>I retreated to my own apartment, with my heart full. And, my man Will. not being near me, gave
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0447200104:21"/>
myſelf a plaguy knock on the forehead, with my double fiſt.</p>
                     <p>And now is my charmer ſhut up from me: Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing to ſee me; refuſing her meals: Reſolves <hi>not</hi> to ſee me, that's more;—Never again, if ſhe can help it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>In the mind ſhe is in</hi>—I hope ſhe has ſaid. The dear creatures, whenever they quarrel with their humble ſervants, ſhould always remember this ſaving clauſe, <hi>that they may not be forſworn.</hi>
                     </p>

                     <p>No admiſſion to breakfaſt, any more than to ſupper. I wiſh this lady is not a ſimpleton, after all.—I have ſent up in Capt. Mennell's name. A meſſage from Capt. Mennell, Madam.</p>
                     <p>It won't do!—She is of a baby age: She cannot be—a Solomon, I was going to ſay, in every thing. Solomon, Jack, was the wiſeſt man:—But didſt ever hear who was the wiſeſt woman?—I want a compariſon for this lady: Cunning women and witches, we read of without number. But I fancy wiſdom never entered into the character of a woman. It is not a requiſite of the Sex. Women, indeed, make better ſovereigns than men: But why is that?—Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the women ſovereigns are governed by men; the men ſovereigns by women:—Charming by my ſoul! For hence we gueſs at the rudder by which both are governed. Yet, ſorry puppy as thou art, thou makeſt light of me for my attachment to this Sex; and even of my ardors to the moſt excellent one of it!—</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="15" facs="tcp:0447200104:22"/>But to put wiſdom out of the queſtion, and to take <hi>cunning</hi> in: That is to ſay, To conſider woman <hi>as</hi> a woman; what ſhall we do, if this lady has ſomething extraordinary in her head?—Repeated charges has ſhe given for Wilſon, by a particular meſſenger, to ſend any letter directed for her, the moment it comes.</p>
                     <p>I muſt keep a good look-out. She is not now afraid of her brother's plot. I ſhan't be at all ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized, if Singleton calls upon Miſs Howe, as the only perſon who knows, or is likely to know, where Miſs Harlowe is; pretending to have affairs of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, and of particular ſervice to her, if he can but be admitted to her ſpeech. Of compromiſe, who knows, from her brother?</p>
                     <p>Then will Miſs Howe warn her to keep cloſe; then will my protection be again neceſſary. This will do, I believe. Any thing from Miſs Howe muſt.</p>
                     <p>Joſeph Leman is a vile fellow with her, and my implement. Joſeph, honeſt Joſeph, as I call him, may hang himſelf. I have play'd him off enough, and have very little further uſe for him. No need to wear one plot to the ſtumps, when I can find new ones every hour.</p>
                     <p>Nor blame me for the uſe I make of my talents. Who, that had ſuch, would let 'em be idle?</p>
                     <p>Well then, I will find a Singleton; that's all I have to do.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Inſtantly</hi> find one!—Will.—</p>
                     <p>Sir—</p>
                     <p>This moment call me hither thy couſin Paul Wheatly, juſt come from ſea, whom thou wert re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commending to my ſervice, if I were to marry and keep a pleaſure-boat.</p>
                     <p>Preſto—Will.'s gone!—Paul will be here preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly!—Preſently will he be gone to Mrs. Howe's.—If Paul be Singleton's mate, coming from his captain, it will do as well as if it were Singleton himſelf.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="16" facs="tcp:0447200104:23"/>Sally, a little devil, often reproaches me with the ſlowneſs of my proceedings. But in a play, does not the principal entertainment lie in the firſt four acts? Is not all in a manner over, when you come to the fifth? And what a vultur of a man muſt he be, who ſowſes upon his prey, and in the ſame moment truſſes and devours?</p>
                     <p>But to own the truth, I have overplotted myſelf. To make my work ſecure, as I thought, I have frighted the dear creature with my four Hottentots, and I ſhall be a long time, I doubt, before I can recover my loſt ground. And then theſe curſed folks at Harlowe-Place have made her out of humour with me, with herſelf, and with all the world, but Miſs Howe, who, no doubt, is continually adding difficulties to my other difficulties. And then I am very unwilling to have recourſe to meaſures which theſe daemons below are continually urging me to take. And the rather, as I am ſure, that, at laſt, ſhe muſt be legally mine. One complete trial over, and I think I will do her noble juſtice.</p>
                     <p>WELL, Paul's gone!—Gone already!—Has all his leſſons!—A notable fellow!—Lord W.'s neceſſary-man was Paul before he went to ſea. A more ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible rogue Paul than Joſeph!—Not ſuch a pretender to piety neither, as the other. At what a price have I bought that Joſeph!—I had two to buy, in him—His conſcience, as well as the man.—I believe I muſt puniſh the raſcal at laſt: But muſt let him marry firſt: Then (tho' that may be puniſhment enough), as I bribed two at once in one man, I ſhall puniſh two at once in the man and his wife.—And how richly does Betty deſerve it for her behaviour to my goddeſs?</p>
                     <p>But now I hear the ruſty hinges of my Beloved's door give me creaking invitation. My heart creaks and throbs with reſpondent trepidations: Whimſical
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0447200104:24"/>
enough tho'! For what relation has a lover's heart to a ruſty pair of hinges?—But they are the hinges that open and ſhut the door of my Beloved's bed-chamber!—Relation enough in that!</p>
                     <p>I hear not the door ſhut again. I ſhall have her commands I hope anon.—What ſignifies her keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me thus at a diſtance?—She muſt be mine, let me do or offer what I will. Courage whenever I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume, all is over: For ſhould ſhe think of eſcaping from hence, whither can ſhe fly to avoid me? Her parents will not receive her: Her uncles will not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain her: Her beloved Norton is in their direction, and cannot: Miſs Howe dare not: She has not one friend in town but me: Is intirely a ſtranger to the town. And what then is the matter with me, that I ſhould be thus unaccountably over-awed and tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized over, by a dear creature, who wants only to know how impoſſible it is that ſhe ſhould eſcape me, in order to be as humble to me, as ſhe is to her per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting relations?</p>
                     <p>Should I even make the grand attempt, and fail, and ſhould ſhe hate me for it, her hatred can be but temporary. She has already incurred the cenſure of the world. She muſt therefore chooſe to be mine, for the ſake of ſoldering up her reputation in the eye of that impudent world. For, who that knows me, and knows that ſhe has been in my power, tho' but for twenty-four hours, will think her ſpotleſs as to fact, let her inclination be what it will?—And then human nature is ſuch a well-known rogue, that every man and woman judges by what each knows of themſelves, that inclination is no more to be truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, where an opportunity is given, than I am; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially where a woman young and blooming loves a man well enough to go off with him; for ſuch will be the world's conſtruction in the preſent caſe.</p>
                     <p>She calls her maid Dorcas. No doubt, that I may hear her harmonious voice, and to give me an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0447200104:25"/>
to pour out my ſoul at her feet; to renew all my vows; and to receive her pardon for the paſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence: And then, with what pleaſure ſhall I begin up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a new ſcore; and afterwards wipe out that; and begin another, and another; till the <hi>laſt</hi> offence paſſes; and there can be no other. And once, after that, to be forgiven, will be to be forgiven for ever.</p>
                     <p>THE door is again ſhut. Dorcas tells me, that ſhe denies to admit me to dine with her, as I had or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered her to requeſt for me next time ſhe ſaw her. Not uncivilly, however, denies. Coming to by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees! Nothing but the laſt offence, the honeſt wench tells me, in the language of her principals be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, will do with her. The laſt offence is meditat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Yet this vile recreant heart of mine plays me booty.—But here I conclude; tho' the tyranneſs leaves me nothing to do, but read, write, and fret.</p>
                     <p>Subſcription is formal between us. Beſides, I am ſo totally hers, that I cannot ſay, how much I am thine, or any other perſon's.</p>

               <p>I Much approve of your reſolution to leave this man, if you can have any encouragement from your uncle. And the rather, as I have heard but within theſe two hours ſome well-atteſted ſtories of him, that ſhew him to be one of the worſt of men as to our Sex. I do aſſure you, my dear friend, that had he a dozen lives, if all I have heard be true, he might have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited them all, and been dead <hi>twenty crimes</hi> ago.</p>
               <p>If ever you condeſcend to talk familiarly with him again, aſk him after Miſs Betterton, and what became of her: And if he ſhuffle and prevaricate, queſtion him about Miſs Lockyer.—O my dear, the man's a villain!</p>
               <p>I will have your uncle ſounded, as you deſire, and that out of hand. But yet I am afraid of the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs;
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0447200104:27"/>
and this for ſeveral reaſons. 'Tis hard to ſay what the ſacrifice of your eſtate would do with ſome people: And yet I muſt not, when it comes to the teſt, permit you to make it.</p>
               <p>As your Hannah continues ill, I would adviſe you to try to attach Dorcas to your intereſt. Have you not been impoliticly ſhy of her?</p>
               <p>I wiſh you could come at ſome of his letters. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a man of his negligent character cannot be always guarded. If he were, and if you cannot engage your ſervant, I ſhould ſuſpect them both. Let him be called upon at a ſhort warning when he is writing, or when he has papers lying about, and ſo ſurprize him into negligence.</p>
               <p>Such inquiries, I know, are of the ſame nature with thoſe we make at an inn in travelling, when we look into every corner and cloſet for fear of a villain; yet ſhould be frighted out of our wits, were we to find one. But 'tis better to detect ſuch a one when awake and up, than to be attacked by him when in bed and aſleep.</p>
               <p>I am glad you have your cloaths. But no money; no books; but a <hi>Spira,</hi> a <hi>Drexelius,</hi> and a <hi>Practice of Piety.</hi> Thoſe who ſent the latter, ought to have kept it for themſelves.—But I muſt hurry myſelf from this ſubject.</p>
               <p>You have excceedingly alarmed me by what you hint of his attempt to get one of my letters. I am aſſured by my new informant, that he is the head of a gang of wretches [Thoſe he brought you among, no doubt, were ſome of them], who join together to betray innocent creatures, and to ſupport one another, when they have done, by violence: And were he to come at the knowlege of the freedoms I take with him, I ſhould be afraid to ſtir out without a guard.</p>
               <p>I am ſorry to tell you, that I have reaſon to think, that your brother has not laid aſide his fooliſh plot. A ſun-burnt, ſailor-looking fellow was with me juſt
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0447200104:28"/>
now, pretending great ſervice to you from Captain Singleton, could he be admitted to your ſpeech. I pleaded ignorance. The fellow was too well inſtructed for me to get any thing out of him.</p>
               <p>I wept for two hours inceſſantly, on reading yours, which incloſed that from your couſin Morden <note n="(a)" place="bottom">See Vol. <hi>III.</hi> Letters <hi>lxxviii.lxxix.</hi>
                  </note>. My deareſt creature, do not deſert yourſelf: Let your Anna Howe obey the call of that friendſhip, which has united us as one ſoul, and endeavour to give you conſolation.</p>
               <p>I wonder not at the melancholy reflections you ſo often caſt upon yourſelf in your letters, for the ſtep you have been forced upon, on one hand, and tricked into on the other. A ſtrange fatality! As if it were deſigned to ſhew the vanity of all human prudence. I wiſh, my dear, as you hint, that both you and I have not too much prided ourſelves in a perhaps too conſcious ſuperiority over others—But I will ſtop—How apt are weak minds to look out for judgments in any extraordinary event! 'Tis ſo far right, that it is better, and ſafer, and juſter, to arraign ourſelves, or our deareſt friends, than Providence; which muſt always have wiſe ends to anſwer in its diſpenſations.</p>
               <p>But do not talk, as in one of your former, of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a warning <hi>only</hi> 
                  <note n="(b)" place="bottom">See Vol. <hi>III.</hi> p. <hi>153.</hi>
                  </note>.—You will be as excellent an example, as ever you hoped to be, as well as a warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: And that will make your ſtory, to all that ſhall come to know it, of double efficacy: For were it that ſuch a merit as yours could not enſure to herſelf noble and generous uſage from a libertine heart, who will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect any tolerable behaviour from men of his character?</p>
               <p>If YOU think yourſelf inexcuſable for taking a ſtep that put you into the way of deluſion, without any intention to go off with him, what muſt thoſe giddy creatures think of themſelves, who, without half your provocations and inducements, and without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard

to decorum, leap walls, drop from windows, and ſteal away from their parents houſe, to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducer's bed, in the ſame day?</p>
               <p>Again, if YOU are ſo ready to accuſe yourſelf for diſpenſing with the prohibitions of the moſt unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able parents, which yet were but half-prohibitions at firſt, what ought thoſe to do, who wilfully ſhut their ears to the advice of the moſt reaſonable; and that, perhaps, where apparent ruin, or undoubted inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience, is the conſequence of the predetermin'd raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs?</p>
               <p>And, laſtly, to all who will know your ſtory, you will be an excellent <hi>example</hi> of watchfulneſs, and of that caution and reſerve, by which a prudent perſon, who has been ſuppoſed to be a little miſled, endeavours to mend her error; and, never once loſing ſight of her duty, does all in her power to recover the path ſhe has been rather driven out of, than choſen to ſwerve from.</p>
               <p>Come, come, my deareſt friend, conſider but theſe things; and ſteadily, without deſponding, purſue your earneſt purpoſes to amend what you think has been amiſs; and it may not be a misfortune in the end, that you have erred; eſpecially as ſo little of your will was in your error.</p>
               <p>And, indeed, I muſt ſay, that I uſe the words <hi>miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,</hi> and <hi>error,</hi> and ſuch-like, only in compliment to your own too ready ſelf-accuſations, and to the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of one to whom I owe duty: For I think in my conſcience, that every part of your conduct is defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible; and that thoſe only are blameable, who have no other way to clear themſelves, than by condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you.</p>
               <p>I expect, however, that ſuch melancholy reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as drop from your pen but too often, wil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:0447200104:30"/>You was immenſely happy, above the happineſs of a mortal creature, before you knew him: Every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body almoſt worſhiped you: Envy itſelf, which has of late reared up its venomous head againſt you, was awed by your ſuperior worthineſs, into ſilence and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration. You was the ſoul of every company where you viſited: Your elders have I ſeen declining to offer their opinions upon a ſubject, till you had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered yours; often to ſave themſelves the mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of retracting <hi>theirs,</hi> when they heard <hi>yours.</hi> Yet, in all this, your ſweetneſs of manners, your humility and affability, cauſed the ſubſcription every one made to your ſentiments, and to your ſuperiority, to be equally unfeigned and unheſitating; for they ſaw, that their applauſe, and the preference they gave you to themſelves, ſubjected not themſelves to inſults, nor exalted you into any viſible triumph over them; for you had always ſomething to ſay, on every point you carried, that raiſed the yielding heart, and left every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one pleaſed and ſatisfied with themſelves, tho' they carried not off the palm.</p>
               <p>Your works were ſhewn, or referred to, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever fine works were talked of. Nobody had any but an inferior and ſecond-hand praiſe for diligence, for oeconomy, for reading, for writing, for memory, for facility in learning every-thing laudable, and even for the more envied graces of perſon and dreſs, and an all-ſurpaſſing elegance in both, where you were known, and thoſe ſubjects talked of.</p>
               <p>The Poor bleſſed you every ſtep you trod: The Rich thought you their honour, and took a pride, that they were not obliged to deſcend from their own claſs, for an example that did credit to it.</p>
               <p>Tho' all men wiſhed for you, and ſought you, young as you was, yet, had not thoſe, who were brought to addreſs you, been encouraged out of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did and ſpiteful views to attempt your preſence, not
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0447200104:31"/>
one of them would have dared to lift up his eyes to you.</p>
               <p>Thus happy in all about you, thus making happy all within your circle, could you think that nothing would happen to you, to convince you, that you were not to be exempted from the common lot?—To convince you, that you were not <hi>abſolutely</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; and that you muſt not expect to paſs thro' life, without trial, temptation, and misfortune?</p>
               <p>Indeed, it muſt be owned, that no trial, no tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, worthy of you, could have well attacked you ſooner, or more effectually, than thoſe heavy ones have done: For every common caſe you were ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to: It muſt be ſome man, or ſome worſe ſpirit in the ſhape of one, that, formed on purpoſe, was to be ſent to invade you; while as many other ſuch ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, as there are perſons in your family, were permitted to take poſſeſſion, ſeverally, in one dark hour, of the heart of every one of it, there to ſit perching, perhaps, and directing every motion to the motions of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducer without, in order to irritate, to provoke, to puſh you forward to meet him.</p>
               <p>So, upon the whole, there ſeems, as I have often ſaid, a kind of fate in your error, if an error; and this, perhaps, admitted, for the ſake of a better ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample to be collected from your <hi>ſufferings,</hi> than could have been given, had you <hi>never erred:</hi> For, my dear, ADVERSITY is your SHINING-TIME: I ſee evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, that it muſt call forth graces and beauties, that could not have been ſeen in a run of that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperous fortune, which attended you from your cradle till now; admirably as you became, and, as we all thought, greatly as you deſerved, that proſperity.</p>
               <p>All the matter is, the trial muſt be grievous to you: It is to <hi>me:</hi> It is to all who love you, and looked upon you as one ſet aloft to be admired and imitated, and not as a mark, as you have lately found, for Envy to ſhoot its ſhafts at.</p>

                     <p>I Muſt be ſilent, my exalted friend, under praiſes that oppreſs my heart with a conſciouſneſs of not deſerving them; at the ſame time, that the generous deſign of thoſe praiſes raiſes and comforts it: For it is a charming thing to ſtand high in the opinion of thoſe we love: And to find that there are ſouls that can carry their friendſhips beyond accidents, beyond body, and ties of blood. Whatever, my deareſt creature, is <hi>my</hi> ſhining-time, the adverſity of a friend is <hi>yours.</hi> And it would be almoſt a fault in me to regret thoſe afflictions, which give you an opportunity ſo gloriouſly to exert thoſe qualities, which not only ennoble our ſex, but dignify human nature.</p>
                     <p>But let me proceed to ſubjects leſs agreeable.</p>
                     <p>I am ſorry you have reaſon to think Singleton's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects are not at an end. But who knows what the ſailor had to propoſe?—Yet had any good been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended

                     <p>I have made a handle of Mr. Lovelace's bold attempt and freedom, as I told you I would, to keep him ever ſince at diſtance, that I may have an opportunity to ſee the ſucceſs of the application to my uncle, and to be at liberty to embrace any favourable overtures that may ariſe from it. Yet he has been very importunate, and twice brought Mr. Mennell from Mrs. Fretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville, to talk about the houſe. If I ſhould be obliged to make up with him again, I ſhall think I am always doing myſelf a ſpight.</p>
                     <p>As to what you mention of his newly-detected crimes; and your advice to attach Dorcas; and to come at ſome of his letters; theſe things will require more or leſs of my attention, as I may hope favour, or not, from my uncle Harlowe.</p>
                     <p>I am ſorry for poor Hannah's continued illneſs. Pray, my dear, inform yourſelf, for me, whether ſhe wants any thing that befits her caſe.</p>
                     <p>I will not cloſe this letter till to-morrow is over; for I am reſolved to go to church; and this as well for the ſake of my duty, as to ſee, if I am at liberty to go out when I pleaſe, without being attended or accompanied.</p>

                     <p>I HAVE not been able to avoid a ſhort debate with Mr. Lovelace. I had order'd a coach to the door. When I had notice that it was come, I went out of my chamber, to go to it; but met him dreſſed on the ſtairs head, with a book in his hand, but without his hat and ſword.—He aſked, with an air very ſolemn, yet reſpectful, if I were going abroad. I told him! was. He deſired leave to attend me, if I were going to church. I refuſed him. And then he complained heavily of my treatment of him; and declared that he
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0447200104:34"/>
would not live ſuch another week, as the paſt, for the world.</p>
                     <p>I owned to him very frankly, that I had made an application to my friends; and that I was reſolved to keep myſelf to myſelf till I knew the iſſue of it.</p>
                     <p>He coloured, and ſeemed ſurprized. But checking himſelf in ſomething he was going to ſay, he pleaded my danger from Singleton, and again deſired to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend me.</p>
                     <p>And then he told me, that Mrs. Fretchville had deſired to continue a fortnight longer in the houſe. She found, ſaid he, that I was unable to determine about entering upon it; and now who knows when ſuch a vapouriſh creature will come to a reſolution? This, Madam, has been an unhappy week; for had I not ſtood upon ſuch bad terms with you, you might have been now miſtreſs of that houſe; and probably had my couſin Montague, if not my aunt Lawrance, actually with you.</p>
                     <p>And ſo, Sir, taking all you ſay for granted, your couſin Montague cannot come to Mrs. Sinclair's? What, pray, is her objection to Mrs. Sinclair's? Is this houſe fit for me to live in a month or two, and not fit for any of your relations for a few days?—And Mrs. Fretchville has taken more time too—And ſo, puſhing by him, I hurried down ſtairs.</p>
                     <p>He called to Dorcas to bring him his ſword and hat; and following me down into the paſſage, placed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf between me and the door; and again beſought me to permit him to attend me.</p>
                     <p>Mrs. Sinclair came out at that inſtant, and aſked me, If I did not chooſe a diſh of chocolate?</p>
                     <p>I wiſh, Mrs. Sinclair, ſaid I, you would take this man in with you to your chocolate. I don't know whether I am at liberty to ſtir out without his leave or not—Then turning to him, I asked, If he kept me there his priſoner?</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="28" facs="tcp:0447200104:35"/>Dorcas juſt then bringing him his ſword and hat, he opened the ſtreet-door, and taking my reſiſting hand, led me, in a very obſequious manner, to the coach. People paſſing by, ſtopt, ſtared, and whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per'd—But he is ſo graceful in his perſon and dreſs, that he generally takes every eye.</p>
                     <p>I was uneaſy to be ſo gaz'd at; and he ſtepp'd in after me, and the coachman drove to St. Paul's.</p>
                     <p>He was very full of aſſiduities all the way; while I was as reſerv'd as poſſible: And when I return'd, din'd, as I had done the greateſt part of the week, by myſelf.</p>
                     <p>He told me, upon my reſolving to do ſo, that altho' he would continue his paſſive obſervance, till I knew the iſſue of my application; yet I muſt expect, that then I ſhould never reſt one moment till I had fixed his happy day: For that his very ſoul was fretted with my ſlights, reſentments, and delays.</p>

                     <p>O that I may have good tidings from my uncle!</p>

               <p>CANNOT you, without naming <hi>me</hi> as an adviſer, who am hated by the family, contrive a way to let Mrs. Harlowe know, that in an accidental conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation with me, you had been aſſured, that my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved friend pines after a reconciliation with her rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: That ſhe has hitherto, in hopes of it, refuſed
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0447200104:36"/>
to enter into any obligations, that ſhall be in the leaſt an hindrance to it: That ſhe would fain avoid giving Mr. Lovelace a right to make her family uneaſy, in relation to her grandfather's eſtate: That all ſhe wiſhes for ſtill, is to be indulged in her choice of a ſingle life, and, on that condition, would make her father's pleaſure hers with regard to that eſtate: That Mr. Lovelace is continually preſſing her to marry him; and all his friends likewiſe: But that I am ſure, ſhe has ſo little liking to the man, becauſe of his faulty morals, and of her relations antipathy to him, that if ſhe had any hope given her of a reconciliation, ſhe would forego all thoughts of him, and put herſelf into her father's protection. But that their reſolution muſt be ſpeedy; for otherwiſe ſhe would find herſelf ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to give way to his preſſing intreaties; and it might then be out of her power to prevent diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able litigations.</p>
               <p>I do aſſure you, Mrs. Norton, upon my honour, that our deareſt friend knows nothing of this proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure of mine: And therefore it is proper to acquaint you, in confidence, with my grounds for it.—Theſe are they:—</p>
               <p>She had deſired me to let Mr. Hickman drop hints to the above effect to her uncle Harlowe; but indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly as from <hi>himſelf,</hi> leſt, if the application ſhould not be attended with ſucceſs; and Mr. Lovelace (who already takes it ill, that he has ſo little of her favour) come to know it, ſhe may be deprived of every protection, and be perhaps ſubjected to great inconveniences from ſo haughty a ſpirit.</p>
               <p>Having this authority from her; and being very ſollicitous about the ſucceſs of the application, I thought, that if the weight of ſo good a wife, mother, and ſiſter, as Mrs. Harlowe is known to be, were thrown into the ſame ſcale, with that of Mr. John Harlowe (ſuppoſing he <hi>could</hi> be engaged) it could hardly fail of making a due impreſſion.</p>

                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:0447200104:37"/>Mr. Hickman will ſee Mr. Harlowe to-morrow: By that time you may ſee Mrs. Harlowe. If Mr. Hickman finds the old gentleman favourable, he will tell him, that you will have ſeen Mrs. Harlowe upon the ſame account; and will adviſe him to join in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation with her how beſt to proceed to melt the moſt obdurate hearts in the world.</p>
               <p>This is the fair ſtate of the matter, and my true motive for writing to you. I leave all therefore to your diſcretion: And moſt heartily wiſh ſucceſs to it; being of opinion that Mr. Lovelace cannot poſſibly deſerve our admirable friend: Nor, indeed, know I the man who can.</p>

If it prove not ſuch, as may be reaſonably hoped for, our dear friend ſhall know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of this ſtep from me; and pray let her not from you.

But take no notice, that I do write, either to my Bella's Betty, who I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, ſometimes viſits you, or to the poor wretch herſelf; nor to any-body. I charge you don't. My heart is full. Writing may give ſome vent to my griefs, and perhaps I may write what lies moſt upon my heart, without confining myſelf ſtrictly to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſubject.</p>
               <p>You know how dear this ingrateful creature ever was to us all. You know how ſincerely we joined with every one of thoſe who ever had ſeen her, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed with her, to praiſe and admire her; and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in our praiſe even the bounds of that modeſty, which, becauſe ſhe was our own, ſhould have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained us; being of opinion, that to have been ſilent in the praiſe of ſo apparent a merit, muſt rather have argued blindneſs or affectation in us, than that we ſhould incur the cenſure of vain partiality to our own.</p>
               <p>When therefore any-body congratulated us on ſuch a daughter, we received their congratulations without any diminution. If it was ſaid, You are happy in this child, we owned, that no parents ever were hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier <hi>in</hi> a child. If more particularly, they praiſed her dutiful behaviour to us, we ſaid, She knew not how to offend. If it was ſaid, Miſs Clariſſa Harlowe has
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0447200104:40"/>
a wit and penetration beyond her years; we, inſtead of diſallowing it, would add,—And a judgment no leſs extraordinary than her wit. If her prudence was praiſed, and a forethought, which every one ſaw ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd what only years and experience gave to others; Nobody need to ſcruple taking leſſons from Miſs Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſſa Harlowe, was our proud anſwer.</p>
               <p>Forgive me, O forgive me, my dear Norton—But I know you will—For yours, when good, was this child, and your glory as well as mine!</p>
               <p>But have you not heard ſtrangers, as ſhe paſſed to and from church, ſtop to praiſe the angel of a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as they called her; when it was enough for thoſe who knew who ſhe was, to cry, <hi>Why, it is Miſs Clariſſa Harlowe!</hi>—As if every-body were obliged to know, or to have heard of Miſs Clariſſa Harlowe, and of her excellencies. While, accuſtom'd to praiſe, it was too familiar to her, to cauſe her to alter either her look or her pace.</p>
               <p>For my own part, I could not ſtifle a pleaſure, that had perhaps a faulty vanity for its foundation, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I was ſpoken of, or addreſſed to, as the mother of ſo ſweet a child: Mr. Harlowe and I, all the time, loving each other the better for the ſhare each had in ſuch a daughter.</p>
               <p>Still, ſtill, indulge the fond, the overflowing heart of a mother! I could dwell for ever upon the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of what ſhe <hi>was,</hi> would but that remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance baniſh from my mind what ſhe <hi>is!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In her boſom, young as ſhe was, could I repoſe all my griefs—Sure of receiving from <hi>her</hi> prudence, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice as well as comfort: And both inſinuated in ſo humble, in ſo dutiful a manner, that it was impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to take thoſe exceptions which the diſtance of years and character between a mother and a daughter, would, from any other daughter, have made one appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive of. She was our glory when abroad, our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light when at home. Every-body was even covetous
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0447200104:41"/>
of her company; and we grudg'd her to our brothers Harlowe, and to our ſiſter and brother Hervey.—No other contention among us, then, but who ſhould be favoured by her next.—No chiding ever knew ſhe from us, but the chiding of lovers, when ſhe was for ſhut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting herſelf up too long together from us, in purſuit of thoſe charming amuſements, and uſeful employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which, however, the whole family was the better for.</p>
               <p>Our other children had reaſon, good children as they always were, to think themſelves neglected. But they likewiſe were ſo ſenſible of their ſiſter's ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority, and of the honour ſhe reflected upon the whole family, that they confeſſed themſelves eclipſed, without envying the eclipſer. Indeed there was not any-body ſo equal with her, in their own opinions, as to envy what all aſpired but to emulate.—The dear creature, you know, my Norton, gave an eminence to us all: And now, that ſhe has left us, ſo diſgrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully left us! we are ſtript of our ornament, and are but a common family!</p>
               <p>Then her acquirements. Her ſkill in muſic, her fine needleworks, her elegance in dreſs; for which ſhe was ſo much admired, that the neighbouring ladies uſed to ſay, that they need not fetch faſhions from London; ſince whatever Miſs Clariſſa Harlowe wore, was the <hi>beſt</hi> faſhion, becauſe her choice of <hi>natural</hi> beauties ſet thoſe of <hi>art</hi> far behind them. Her genteel eaſe, and fine turn of perſon; her deep reading; and theſe, joined to her open manners, and her chearful modeſty—O my good Norton, what a ſweet child was <hi>once</hi> my Clary Harlowe!</p>
               <p>This, and more, <hi>you</hi> knew her to be: For many of her excellencies were owing to yourſelf; and with the milk you gave her, you gave her what no other nurſe in the world could give her.</p>
               <p>And do you think, my worthy woman, do you think, that the wilful lapſe of ſuch a child is to be
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0447200104:42"/>
forgiven? Can ſhe herſelf think, that ſhe deſerves not the ſevereſt puniſhment for the abuſe of ſuch ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents as were intruſted to her?</p>
               <p>Her fault was a fault of premeditation, of cunning, of contrivance. She has deceived every-body's ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations. Her whole ſex, as well as the family ſhe ſprung from, is diſgraced by it.</p>
               <p>Would any-body ever have believed, that ſuch a young creature as this, who had by her advice ſaved even her over-lively friend from marrying a fop, and a libertine, would herſelf have gone off with one of the vileſt and moſt notorious of libertines? A man whoſe character ſhe knew; and knew to be worſe than his ſhe ſaved her friend from; whoſe vices ſhe was warned of: One who had had her brother's life in his hands; and who conſtantly ſet our whole fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily at defiance.</p>
               <p>Think for me, my good Norton; think what my unhappineſs muſt be, both as a wife and a mother. What reſtleſs days, what ſleepleſs nights; yet my own rankling anguiſh endeavoured to be ſmoothed over, to ſoften the anguiſh of fiercer ſpirits, and to keep them from blazing out to further miſchief. O this naughty, naughty girl! who <hi>knew</hi> ſo well what ſhe did; and who could look ſo far into conſequences, that we thought ſhe would have dy'd, rather than have done as ſhe has done!</p>
               <p>Her known character for prudence leaves no plea for excuſe. How then can I offer to plead for her, if, thro' motherly indulgence, I would forgive her myſelf?—And have we not, moreover, ſuffer'd all the diſgrace that can befal us? Has not ſhe?</p>
               <p>If <hi>now,</hi> ſhe has ſo little liking to his morals, had ſhe not reaſon <hi>before</hi> to have <hi>as</hi> little? Or has ſhe ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered by them in her own perſon?—O my good wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, I doubt—I doubt—Will not the character of the man make one doubt an angel, if once in his power? The world will think the worſt. I am told
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0447200104:43"/>
it <hi>does.</hi> So likewiſe her father fears; her brother hears; and what can I do?</p>
               <p>Our <hi>antipathy</hi> to him ſhe knew before, as well as his character. Theſe therefore cannot be new mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives without a new reaſon.—O my dear Mrs. Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, how ſhall <hi>I,</hi> how can <hi>you,</hi> ſupport ourſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the apprehenſions that theſe thoughts lead to, of my Clary Harlowe, and your Clary Harlowe!</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He continually preſſing her,</hi> you ſay, <hi>to marry him. His friends likewiſe.</hi> She has reaſon, no doubt ſhe has reaſon, for this application to us: And her crime is gloſs'd over, to bring her to us with new diſgrace!—Whither, whither, does one guilty ſtep lead the miſguided heart!—And now truly, to ſave a ſtubborn ſpirit, we are only to be <hi>ſounded,</hi> that the application may be retracted or deny'd!</p>
               <p>Upon the whole: Were I inclined to plead for her, it is <hi>now</hi> the moſt improper of all times. <hi>Now</hi> that my brother Harlowe has diſcouraged (as he laſt night came hither on purpoſe to tell us) Mr. Hick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's inſinuated application; and been applauded for it. <hi>Now,</hi> that my brother Antony is intending to carry his great fortune, thro' her fault, into another family:—She expecting, no doubt, herſelf, to be put into her grandfather's eſtate, in conſequence of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation, and as a reward for her fault: And inſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtill upon terms, that ſhe offer'd before, and were rejected.—Not thro' my fault, I am ſure, rejected.</p>
               <p>From all theſe things, you will return ſuch an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer as the caſe requires.—It might coſt me the peace of my whole life, at this time, to move for her. God forgive her!—If I do, nobody elſe will. And let it be for your own ſake, as well as mine, a ſecret that you and I have enter'd upon this ſubject. And I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire you not to touch upon it again but by particular permiſſion: For, O my dear good woman, it ſets my heart a-bleeding in as many ſtreams as there are veins in it!</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:0447200104:44"/>Yet think me not impenetrable by a proper con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition and remorſe! But what a torment is it to have a will without a power!</p>
               <p>Adieu! adieu! God give us both comfort; and to the once dear—the ever-dear creature (for can a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther forget her child?), repentance, deep repentance! And as little ſuffering as may befit his bleſſed will, and her grievous fault, prays</p>

               <p>HOW it is now, my dear, between you and Mr. Lovelace, I cannot tell. But wicked as the man is, I am afraid he muſt be your lord and maſter.</p>
               <p>I called him by ſeveral very hard names in my laſt. I had but juſt heard ſome of his vileneſſes, when I ſat down to write; ſo my indignation was raiſed. But on inquiry, and recollection, I find that the facts laid to his charge were all of them committed ſome time ago; not ſince he has had <hi>ſtrong</hi> hopes of your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour. This is ſaying ſomething for him. His gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous behaviour to the innkeeper's daughter, is a more recent inſtance to his credit; to ſay nothing of the univerſal good character he has as a kind landlord. And then I approve much of the motion he made to put you in poſſeſſion of Mrs. Fretchville's houſe, while he continues at the other widow's, till you agree that one houſe ſhall hold you. I wiſh this was done. Be ſure you embrace this offer, if you do not ſoon meet at the altar, and get one of his couſins with you.</p>
               <p>Were you once marry'd, I ſhould think you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be <hi>very</hi> unhappy, tho' you n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> ſtake he has in

his country, and his reverſions: The care he takes of his affairs; his freedom from obligation; nay, his pride, with your merit, muſt be a tolerable ſecurity for you, I ſhould think. Tho' particulars of his wickedneſs, as they come to my knowlege, hurt and incenſe me; yet, after all, when I give myſelf time to reflect, all that I have heard of him, to his diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, was comprehended in the general character given of him long ago, by his uncle's and his own diſmiſs'd bailiff <note n="(a)" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Vol.</hi> I. <hi>p.</hi> 22.</note>, and which was confirm'd to you by Mrs. Greme <note n="(b)" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Vol.</hi> III. <hi>p.</hi> 48.</note>.</p>
               <p>You can have nothing therefore, I think, to be deeply concerned about, but his future good, and the bad example he may hereafter ſet to his own family. Theſe indeed are very juſt concerns: But were you to <hi>leave</hi> him now, either <hi>with</hi> or <hi>without</hi> his conſent, his fortune and alliances ſo conſiderable, his perſon and addreſs ſo engaging (every-one excuſing you now on thoſe accounts, and becauſe of your relations fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies), it would have a very ill appearance for your reputation. I cannot therefore, on the moſt delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate conſideration, adviſe you to think of that, while you have no reaſon to doubt his honour. May eternal vengeance purſue the villain, if he gives room for an apprehenſion of this nature!</p>
               <p>Yet his teazing ways are intolerable: His ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſcence with your ſlight delays, and his reſigned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the diſtance you now keep him at (for a fault ſo much ſlighter, as he muſt think, than the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment), are unaccountable: He doubts your love of <hi>him,</hi> that is very probable; but you have reaſon to be ſurpriſed at <hi>his</hi> want of ardour; a bleſſing ſo great, within his <hi>reach,</hi> as I may ſay.</p>
               <p>By the time you have read to this place, you will have no doubt of what has been the iſſue of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between the <hi>Two Gentlemen.</hi> I am equally ſhock'd, and enraged againſt them All: Againſt them
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0447200104:46"/>
                  <hi>All,</hi> I ſay; for I have try'd your good Norton's weight with your mother, to the ſame purpoſe as the gentleman ſounded your uncle.—Never were there ſuch determin'd brutes in the world! Why ſhould I mince the matter? Yet would I fain, methinks, make an exception for your mother.</p>
               <p>Your uncle will have it, that you are ruin'd.
<q rend="inline margQuotes">'He can believe every-thing bad of a creature, who could run away with a man—With ſuch a one eſpecially as Lovelace. They all <hi>expected</hi> applications from you, when ſome heavy diſtreſs had fallen upon you.—But they were all reſolved not to ſtir an inch in your favour; no, not to ſave your life!'</q>
               </p>
               <p>My deareſt ſoul! reſolve to aſſert your right. Claim your own, and go and live upon it, as you ought. Then, if you marry not, how will the wretches creep to you, for your reverſionary diſpoſitions!</p>
               <p>You were accuſed (as in your aunt's letter)
<q rend="inline margQuotes">'of premeditation and contrivance in your eſcape.'</q>
In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of pitying <hi>you,</hi> the mediating perſon was called upon
<q rend="inline margQuotes">'to pity <hi>them</hi>; who once, he ſaid, doted upon you: Who took no joy but in your preſence: Who devour'd your words as you ſpoke them: Who trod over again your footſteps, as you walked before them.'</q>
—And I know not what of this ſort.</p>
               <p>Upon the whole, it is now evident to me, and ſo it muſt be to you, when you read this letter, that you have but one choice. And the ſooner you make it the better.—Shall we ſuppoſe that it is not in your power to make it?—I cannot have patience to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that.</p>
               <p>I am concern'd, methinks, to know how you will do to condeſcend, now you ſee you muſt be his, after you have kept him at ſuch a diſtance; and for the revenge his pride may put him upon taking for it. But let me tell you, that if my going up, and ſhare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fortunes with you, will prevent ſuch a noble crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from ſtooping too low; much more, were it
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0447200104:47"/>
likely to prevent your ruin, I would not heſitate a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment about it. What's the whole world to me, weigh'd againſt ſuch a friendſhip as ours?—Think you, that any of the enjoyments of this life, could be enjoyments to me, were ſuch a friend as you to be involved in calamities, which I could either relieve her from, or alleviate, by giving them up? And what in ſaying this, and acting up to it, do I offer you, but the fruits of a friendſhip your worth has created?</p>
               <p>Excuſe my warmth of expreſſion. The warmth of my heart wants none. I am enraged at your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations; for, bad as what I have mentioned is, I have not told you all; nor now, perhaps, ever will:—I am angry at my own mother's narrowneſs of mind, and adherence to old notions indiſcriminately—And I am exaſperated againſt your fooliſh, your low-va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity'd Lovelace!—But let us ſtoop to take the wretch as he is, and make the beſt of him, ſince you are deſtin'd to ſtoop, to keep grovelers and worldlings in countenance. He has not been guilty of direct in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decency to you. Nor <hi>dare</hi> he. Not ſo much of a devil as that comes to neither!—Had he ſuch villain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous intentions, ſo much in his power as you are, they would have ſhewn themſelves before now to ſuch a penetrating and vigilant eye, and to ſuch a pure heart as yours. Let us ſave the wretch then, if we can, tho' we ſoil our fingers in lifting him up from his dirt.</p>
               <p>There is yet, to a perſon of your fortune and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependence, a good deal to do, if you enter upon thoſe terms, which <hi>ought</hi> to be enter'd upon. I don't find, that he has once talked of ſettlements; much leſs of the licence. It is hard! But as your evil de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiny has thrown you out of all other protection and medi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>me</hi> write to the wretch? Yet that would be the ſame thing, as if you were to write yourſelf. Yet write you ſhould, I think, if you cannot ſpeak. But ſpeaking is certainly beſt: For words leave no traces; they paſs as breath; and mingle with air; and may be explained with latitude. But the pen is a witneſs on record.</p>
               <p>I know the gentleneſs of your ſpirit; I know the laudable pride of your heart; and the juſt notion you have of the dignity of our ſex, in theſe delicate points. But once more, all this is nothing now: Your honour is concerned, that the dignity I ſpeak of, ſhould not be ſtood upon.</p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline margQuotes">'Mr. Lovelace,' would I ſay; yet hate the fooliſh fellow, for his low, his ſtupid pride, in wiſhing to triumph over the dignity of his own wife;—
'I am deprived, by your means, of every friend I have in the world. In what light am I to look upon <hi>you?</hi> I have well conſider'd of every thing: You have made ſome people, much againſt my liking, think me a <hi>wife:</hi> Others know I am <hi>not</hi> married; nor do I deſire any body ſhould believe I <hi>am.</hi> Do you think your being here in the ſame houſe with me, can be to my reputation? You talk to me of Mrs. Fretchville's houſe—"
[This will bring him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new his laſt diſcourſe on that ſubject, if he does not revive it of himſelf.]
'If Mrs. Fretchville knows not her own mind, what is her houſe to me? You talked of bringing up your couſin Montague to bear me company: If my brother's ſchemes be your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence for not going yourſelf to <hi>fetch her,</hi> you can <hi>write</hi> to her.—I inſiſt upon bringing theſe two points to an iſſue: Off or on, ought to be indifferent to <hi>me,</hi> if ſo to <hi>them.</hi>'</q>
               </p>
               <p>Such a declaration muſt bring all forward. There are twenty ways, my dear, that you would find out to adviſe another how to act in your circumſtances. He will diſdain, from his native inſolence, to have it thought he

has <hi>any-body</hi> to conſult. Well then, will he not be obliged to declare himſelf? And if he <hi>does,</hi> no delays on your ſide, I beſeech you. Give him the day: Let it be a ſhort one. It would be derogating from your own merit, and <hi>honour</hi> too, let me tell you, even altho' he ſhould <hi>not</hi> be ſo explicit as he ought to be, to ſeem but to doubt his meaning; and to wait for that explanation which I ſhould for ever deſpiſe him for, if he makes neceſſary. Twice already have you, my dear, if not oftener, <hi>modeſty'd</hi> away ſuch opportunities as you ought not to have ſlipt.—As to ſettlements, if they come not in naturally, e'en leave them to his own juſtice, and to the juſtice of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily. And there's an end of the matter.</p>
               <p>This is <hi>my</hi> advice: Mend it, as circumſtances offer, and follow <hi>your own.</hi> But indeed, my dear, this, or ſomething like it, would I do. As witneſs</p>

                     <pb n="43" facs="tcp:0447200104:50"/>I repeat, that it cannot come to any thing. But theſe <hi>widows</hi>—Then ſuch a love in us all, both old and young, of being courted and admired!—And ſo irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtible to their <hi>elderſhips</hi> to be flatter'd, that all power is not over with them; but that they may ſtill claſs and prank it with their daughters. It vexed me hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily to have her tell me of this propoſal with ſelf-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſant ſimperings; and yet ſhe affected to ſpeak of it, as if ſhe had no intention to encourage it.</p>
                  <p>Theſe antiquated batchelors, old before they think themſelves ſo, imagine, that when they have once perſuaded <hi>themſelves,</hi> they have nothing elſe to do, but to make their minds known to the lady. His overgrown fortune is indeed a bait—a tempting one. A ſaucy daughter to be got rid of! The me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of the father of that daughter not precious enough to weigh!—But let him advance if he dare—Let her encourage—But I hope ſhe won't.</p>
                  <p>Excuſe me, my dear. I am nettled. They have fearfully rumpled my gorget. You'll think me faulty. So I won't put my name to this ſeparate paper. Other hands may reſemble mine. You did not ſee me write it.</p>

                     <p>NOW indeed, is it evident, my beſt, my only friend, that I have but one choice to make. And now do I find, that I have carried my reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt this man too far; ſince now I am to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear as if under an obligation to his patience with me for a conduct, that, perhaps, he will think, if not humourſome and childiſh, plainly demonſtrative of my little eſteem of him; of but a ſecondary eſteem at leaſt, where before, his pride, rather than
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0447200104:51"/>
his merit, had made him expect a <hi>firſt.</hi> O my dear!—to be under obligation to, and to be caſt upon a man, that is not a <hi>generous</hi> man!—That is, indeed, a <hi>cruel</hi> man!—That is capable of creating a diſtreſs to a young creature, who by her evil deſtiny, is thrown into his power; and then of <hi>enjoying</hi> it, as I may ſay! [I verily think I may ſay ſo, of this ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage!]—What a fate is mine!</p>
                     <p>You give me, my dear, good advice, as to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptory manner in which I ought to treat him: But do you conſider to whom it is that you give that advice?</p>
                     <p>The occaſion for it ſhould never have been given by <hi>me,</hi> of all creatures; for I am unequal, utterly unequal to it!—What, <hi>I,</hi> to challenge a man for a huſband!—<hi>I,</hi> to exert myſelf to quicken the delayer in his reſolutions! And, having loſt an opportunity, to begin to try to recal it, as <hi>from myſelf,</hi> and <hi>for myſelf!</hi>—To <hi>threaten</hi> him, as I may ſay, into the marriage-ſtate!—O my dear! if this be right to be done, how difficult is it, where Modeſty and Self (or where Pride, if you pleaſe) is concerned to do that right? Or, to expreſs myſelf in your words, to be father, mother, uncle, to myſelf!—Eſpecially where one thinks a triumph over one is intended.—Do, my dear, adviſe me, perſuade me, to renounce the man for ever: And then I will for ever renounce him!</p>
                     <p>You ſay, you have tried Mrs. Norton's weight with my mamma.—Bad as the returns are which my appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by Mr. Hickman has met with, you tell me, you have not acquainted me with all the bad; nor now, perhaps, ever will. But why ſo, my dear? What <hi>is</hi> the bad, what <hi>can</hi> be the bad, which now you will never tell me of?—What worſe, than renounce me! and for ever!
<q rend="inline margQuotes">'My uncle, you ſay, believes me ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in'd: He declares, that he can believe every thing bad of a creature, who could run away with a man:
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0447200104:52"/>
And they have all made a reſolution, not to ſtir an inch in my favour; no, not to ſave my life."</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Have you worſe than this, my dear, behind?—Surely my father has not renewed his dreadful male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction!—Surely, if ſo, my mamma has not joined in it! Have my uncles given it their ſanction, and made it a family act! What, my dear, is the worſt, that you will leave for ever unrevealed?</p>
                     <p>O Lovelace! why comeſt thou not juſt now; while theſe black proſpects are before me? For now, couldſt thou look into my heart, wouldſt thou ſee a diſtreſs worthy of thy barbarous triumph!</p>
                     <p>I WAS forced to quit my pen.</p>
                     <p>And you ſay you have try'd Mrs. Norton's weight with my mamma?</p>
                     <p>What <hi>is</hi> done, cannot be help'd: But I wiſh you had not taken any ſtep, in a matter ſo very concerning to me, without firſt conſulting me.—Forgive me, my dear;—but that high-ſoul'd and noble friendſhip, which you avow with ſo obliging, and ſo uncommon a warmth, at the ſame time, that it is the ſubject of my grateful admiration, is no leſs, becauſe of its fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor, the ground of my apprehenſion!</p>
                     <p>Well, but now, to look forward, you are of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that I muſt be his: And that I cannot leave him with reputation to myſelf, whether with or without his conſent. I muſt, if ſo, make the beſt of the bad matter.</p>
                     <p>He went out in the morning; intending not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to dinner, unleſs (as he ſent me word) I would admit him to dine with me.</p>
                     <p>I excuſed myſelf. The man, whoſe anger is now to be of ſuch high importance to me, was, it ſeems, diſpleaſed.</p>
                     <p>As he, as well as I, expected, that I ſhould receive a letter from you this day, by Collins, I ſuppoſe he will not be long before he returns; and then, poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly,

And then muſt I be very humble, very ſubmiſſive, and try to whine myſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his good graces: With downcaſt eye, if not by ſpeech, beg his forgivenneſs for the diſtance I have ſo perverſely kept him at!—Yes, I warrant you!—But I'll ſee how this behaviour will ſit upon me!—You have always railly'd me upon my meekneſs, I think! Well then, I'll try, if I can be ſtill meeker, ſhall I!—O my dear!—</p>
                     <p>But let me ſit with my hands before me, all pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, all reſignation; for I think I hear him coming up.—Or ſhall I roundly accoſt him, in the words, in the form, you, my dear, have preſcrib'd?</p>
                     <p>He is come in.—He has ſent to me, all impatience in his aſpect, Dorcas ſays.—But I cannot, cannot ſee him!</p>

                     <p>THE contents of your letter, and my own heavy reflections, render'd me incapable of ſeeing this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting man!—The firſt word he aſked Dorcas, was, If I had received a letter ſince he had been out?—She told me this; and her anſwer, That I had; and was faſting, and had been in tears ever ſince.</p>
                     <p>He ſent to deſire an interview with me.</p>
                     <p>I anſwer'd by her, That I was not very well. In the morning, if better, I would ſee him as ſoon as he pleaſed.</p>
                     <p>Very humble! was it not, my dear?—Yet he was too royal to take it for humility; for Dorcas told me, he rubb'd one ſide of his face imp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>He ſent up to tell me, that as he heard I was faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, if I would promiſe to eat ſome chicken which Mrs. Sinclair had order'd for ſupper, he would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſce.—Very kind in his anger!—Is he not?</p>

               <p>I Think once more, we ſeem to be in a kind of train; but through a ſtorm. I will give you the particulars.</p>
               <p>I heard him in the dining-room at five in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. I had reſted very ill, and was up too: But opened not my door till ſix: When Dorcas brought me his requeſt for my company.</p>
               <p>He approached me, and taking my hand, as I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd the dining-room, I went not to bed, Madam, till two, yet ſlept not a wink. For God's ſake, torment me not, as you have done for a week paſt.</p>
               <p>He paus'd. I was ſilent.</p>
               <p>At firſt, proceeded he, I thought your reſentment of a mere unavailing curioſity could not be deep;
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0447200104:55"/>
and that it would go off of itſelf: But when I found, it was to be kept up till you knew the ſucceſs of ſome new overtures which you had made, and which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd with, might have deprived me of you for ever; how, Madam, could I ſupport myſelf under the thoughts of having, with ſuch an union of intereſts, made ſo little impreſſion upon your mind in my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour?</p>
               <p>He paus'd again. I was ſtill ſilent. He went on.</p>
               <p>I acknowlege that I have a proud heart, Madam. I cannot but hope for ſome inſtance of previous and preferable favour from the lady I am ambitious to call mine; and that her choice of me ſhould not appear, not <hi>flagrantly</hi> appear, directed by the perverſeneſs of her ſelfiſh perſecutors, and my irreconcileable ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
               <p>More to the ſame purpoſe he ſaid: You know, my dear, the room he had given me to recriminate upon him, in twenty inſtances: I did not ſpare him: But I need not repeat thoſe inſtances to you. Every one of theſe inſtances, I told him, convinced me of his <hi>pride,</hi> indeed, but not of his <hi>merit.</hi> I confeſſed, that I had as much pride as himſelf; altho' I hoped it was of another kind, than that he ſo readily avowed. But that if he had the leaſt mixture in <hi>his</hi> of the true pride (a pride worthy of his birth, of his family, and of his fortune), he ſhould rather wiſh, I would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to ſay, to promote <hi>mine,</hi> than either to ſuppreſs, or to regret that I had it: That <hi>hence</hi> it was, that I thought it beneath me to diſown what had been my motives for declining, for ſome days paſt, any conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation with him, or viſit from Mr. Mennell, that might lead to points out of my power to determine upon, until I heard from my uncle Harlowe; whom, I confeſſed, I had cauſed to be ſounded, whether<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> might be favoured with his intereſt, to obtain for me a reconciliation with my friends, upon terms which I had cauſed to be propoſed to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:0447200104:56"/>He knew not, he ſaid, and ſuppoſed muſt not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to aſk, what theſe terms were. But he could but too well gueſs at them; and that he was to have been the preliminary ſacrifice. But I muſt allow him to ſay, That as much as he admired the nobleneſs of my ſentiments in general, and in particular that <hi>true</hi> pride in me, which I had ſpoken of; he wiſh'd, that he could compliment me with ſuch an uniformity in it, as ſhould have ſet me as much above all ſubmiſſion to minds implacable and unreaſonable (he hoped he might, without offence, ſay that my brother's and ſiſter's were ſuch), as it had above all favour and condeſcenſion to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Duty</hi> and <hi>nature,</hi> Sir, call upon me to make the ſubmiſſions you ſpeak of: There is a father, there is a mother, there are uncles, in the one caſe, to juſtify and demand thoſe ſubmiſſions—What, pray, Sir, can be pleaded for the <hi>condeſcenſion,</hi> as you call it?—Will you ſay, your merits, either with regard to <hi>them,</hi> or to <hi>myſelf,</hi> may?</p>
               <p>This to be ſaid, after the perſecution of thoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations! After what you have ſuffer'd! After what you have made me hope! Let me aſk you, Madam (we talk'd of <hi>pride</hi> juſt now), What ſort of pride muſt <hi>his</hi> be, which could diſpenſe with inclination and preference in his lady's part of it?—What muſt be that love—</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Love,</hi> Sir! who talks of <hi>love?</hi>—Was not <hi>merit</hi> the thing we were talking of?—Have <hi>I</hi> ever profeſſed; have <hi>I</hi> ever required of <hi>you</hi> profeſſions of a paſſion of that nature? But there is no end of theſe debatings; each <hi>ſo</hi> faultleſs, each <hi>ſo</hi> full of ſelf—</p>
               <p>I do not think myſelf <hi>faultleſs,</hi> Madam:—But—</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But</hi> what, Sir!—Would you evermore argue with me, as if you were a child?—Seeking palliations, and making promiſes?—Promiſes of what, Sir? Of being in future the man it is a ſhame a gentleman is not?—Of being the man—</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:0447200104:57"/>Good God! interrupted he, with eyes lifted up, if <hi>thou</hi> wert to be thus ſevere—</p>
               <p>Well, well, Sir, impatiently—I need only to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that all this vaſt difference in ſentiments ſhews how unpair'd our minds are—So let us—</p>
               <p>Let us <hi>what,</hi> Madam!—My ſoul is riſing into tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults! And he look'd ſo wildly, that it ſtartled me a good deal—Let us <hi>what,</hi> Madam—</p>
               <p>Why, Sir, let us reſolve to quit every regard for each other—[Nay, flame not out—I am a poor weak-minded creature in ſome things: But where what I <hi>ſhould be,</hi> or not deſerve to live, if I <hi>am not,</hi> is in the queſtion, I have great and invincible ſpirit, or my own conceit betrays me].—Let us reſolve to quit every regard for each other that is more than civil. <hi>This</hi> you may depend upon; you may, if it will fewel your pride, gratify it with this aſſurance; That I will never marry any other man. I have ſeen enough of your ſex; at leaſt of <hi>you.</hi>—A ſingle life ſhall ever be <hi>my</hi> choice—While I will leave you at liberty to purſue <hi>your own.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Indifference, worſe than indifference! ſaid he, in a paſſion—</p>
               <p>Interrupting him—Indifference let it be—You have not, in <hi>my</hi> opinion, at leaſt, deſerved it ſhould be other: If you have in <hi>your own,</hi> you have cauſe, at leaſt your <hi>pride</hi> has, to hate me for misjudging you.—</p>
               <p>Deareſt, deareſt creature! ſnatching my hand with wildneſs, let me beſeech you to be <hi>uniformly</hi> noble! <hi>Civil regards,</hi> Madam!—<hi>Civil regards!</hi>—Can you ſo expect to narrow and confine ſuch a paſſion as mine!—</p>
               <p>Such a paſſion as yours, Mr. Lovelace, <hi>deſerves</hi> to be narrow'd and confin'd.—It is either the paſſion <hi>you</hi> do not think it; or <hi>I</hi> do not.—I queſtion whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther your mind is capable of being <hi>ſo</hi> narrow'd and <hi>ſo</hi> widen'd, as is neceſſary to make it be what I wiſh
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0447200104:58"/>
it to be. Lift up your hands and your eyes, Sir, in that emphatical ſilent wonder, as you pleaſe: But what does it expreſs, what does it convince me of; but that we are not born for one another?</p>
               <p>By his ſoul, he ſaid, and graſp'd my hand with an eagerneſs that hurt it, we <hi>were</hi> born for one another: I <hi>muſt</hi> be his—I <hi>ſhould</hi> be his (and put his other arm round me), altho' his damnation were to be the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe!—</p>
               <p>I was terrify'd!—Let me leave you—or begone from me, Sir—Is the paſſion you boaſt, to be thus ſhockingly declared!</p>
               <p>You muſt not go, Madam!—You muſt <hi>not</hi> leave me in anger—</p>
               <p>I will return—I will return—When you can be leſs violent—leſs ſhocking.</p>
               <p>And he let me go.</p>
               <p>The man quite frighted me; inſomuch that when I got into my chamber, I found a ſudden flow of tears a great relief to me.</p>
               <p>In half an hour, he ſent a little billet, expreſſing his concern for the vehemence of his behaviour, and praying to ſee me.</p>
               <p>I went—Becauſe I could not help myſelf, I went.</p>
               <p>He was full of his excuſes.—O my dear, what would you, even <hi>you,</hi> do with ſuch a man as this; and in my ſituation?</p>
               <p>It was very poſſible for him now, he ſaid, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for the workings of a frenzical diſorder. For his part, he was near diſtraction. All laſt week to ſuffer as he had ſuffer'd; and now to talk of <hi>civil re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards</hi> only, when he had hoped from the nobleneſs of my mind—</p>
               <p>Hope what you will, interrupted I; I muſt inſiſt upon it, that our minds are by no means ſuited to each other. You have brought me into difficulties. I am deſerted of every friend but Miſs Howe. My
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0447200104:59"/>
true ſentiments I will not conceal: It is againſt my will, that I muſt ſubmit to owe protection from a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's projects, which Miſs Howe thinks are not given over, to you, who have brought me into theſe ſtreights; <hi>not</hi> with my own concurrence brought me into them; remember that—</p>
               <p>I do remember that, Madam! So often reminded, how can I forget it?</p>
               <p>Yet I <hi>will</hi> owe to you this protection, if it be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, in the earneſt hope, that you will <hi>ſhun</hi> rather than <hi>ſeek</hi> miſchief, if any further inquiry after me be made. But what hinders you from leaving me?—Cannot I ſend to you? The Widow Fretchville, it is plain, knows not her own mind: The people here indeed are civiller every day than other: But I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have lodgings more agreeable to my circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. I beſt know what will ſuit them; and am reſolved not to be obliged to any body. If you leave me, I will take a civil leave of theſe people, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire to ſome one of the neighbouring villages, and there, ſecreting myſelf, wait my couſin Morden's ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival with patience.</p>
               <p>He preſumed, he told me, from what I ſaid, that my application to my relations was unſucceſsful: That therefore he hoped I would give him leave now to mention the terms in the nature of ſettlements, which he had long intended to propoſe to me; and which having till now delay'd to do, thro' accidents not proceeding from himſelf, he had thoughts of urg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to me the moment I enter'd upon my new houſe; and upon finding myſelf as independent in <hi>appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance</hi> as I was in <hi>fact.</hi> Permit me, Madam, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe theſe matters to you:—Not with an expectation of your immediate anſwer; but for your conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Were not heſitation, a ſelf-felt glow, a downcaſt eye, more than enough? Your advice was too much in my head: I heſitated.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:0447200104:60"/>He urg'd on upon my ſilence: He would call God to witneſs to the juſtice, nay to the <hi>generoſity</hi> of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions to me, if I would be ſo good as to hear what he had to propoſe to me, as to ſettlements.</p>
               <p>Could not the man have fallen into the ſubject without this <hi>parade?</hi> Many a point, you know, <hi>is</hi> refuſed, and <hi>ought to be</hi> refuſed, if leave be aſked to introduce it; and when once refuſed, the refuſal muſt in honour be adhered to:—Whereas, had it been <hi>ſlid</hi> in upon one, as I may ſay, it might have merited fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conſideration. If ſuch a man as he knows not this, who ſhould?</p>
               <p>I thought myſelf obliged, tho' not to depart from this ſubject intirely, yet, to give it a more diffuſe turn; in order, on the one hand, to ſave myſelf the morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of appearing too ready in my compliance, after ſuch a diſtance as had been between us; and on the other, to avoid (in purſuance of your advice) the neceſſity of giving him ſuch a repulſe, as might again throw us out of the courſe.</p>
               <p>A cruel alternative to be reduced to!</p>
               <p>You talk of <hi>generoſity,</hi> Mr. Lovelace, ſaid I; and you talk of <hi>juſtice</hi>; perhaps without having conſider'd the force of the words, in the ſenſe you uſe them on this occaſion.—Let me tell you what <hi>generoſity</hi> is, in my ſenſe of the word—TRUE GENEROSITY is not confined to pecuniary inſtances: It is <hi>more</hi> than po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liteneſs: It is <hi>more</hi> than good faith: It is <hi>more</hi> than honour: It is <hi>more</hi> than <hi>juſtice:</hi> Since all theſe are but duties, and what a worthy mind cannot diſpenſe with. But TRUE GENEROSITY is greatneſs of ſoul: It in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cites us to do more by a fellow-creature, than can be ſtrictly required of us: It obliges us to haſten to the relief of an object that wants relief; anticipating even hope or expectation. Generoſity, Sir, will not ſurely permit a worthy mind to doubt of its honourable and beneficent intentions: Much leſs will it allow itſelf to ſhock, to offend any one; and, leaſt of all, a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0447200104:61"/>
thrown by adverſity, miſhap, or accident, into its protection.</p>
               <p>What an opportunity had he to clear his intentions, had he been ſo diſpoſed, from the <hi>latter part</hi> of this home obſervation!—But he run away with the <hi>firſt,</hi> and kept to that.</p>
               <p>Admirably defin'd! he ſaid.—But who at this rate, Madam, can be ſaid to be <hi>generous</hi> to you?—Your <hi>generoſity</hi> I implore; while, <hi>juſtice,</hi> as it muſt be my ſole merit, ſhall be my aim. Never was there a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of ſuch nice and delicate ſentiments!</p>
               <p>It is a reflection upon yourſelf, Sir, and upon the company you have kept, if you think theſe notions either nice or delicate. Thouſands of my ſex are more nice than I; for they would have avoided the devious path I have been ſurprized into: The conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of which ſurprize have laid me under the ſad neceſſity of telling a man, who has not delicacy enough to enter into thoſe parts of the female chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter, which are its glory and diſtinction, what True Generoſity is.</p>
               <p>His divine monitreſs, he called me!—He would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to form his manners, as he had often pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, by my example. But he hoped I would now permit him to mention briefly the <hi>juſtice</hi> he propoſed to do me, in the terms of the ſettlement; a ſubject ſo proper, before now, to have been enter'd upon; and which would have been enter'd upon long ago, had not my frequent diſpleaſure taken from him the opportunity he had often wiſh'd for: But now having ventur'd to lay hold of this, nothing ſhould divert him from improving it.</p>
               <p>I have no ſpirits juſt now, Sir, to attend to ſuch weighty points. What you have a mind to propoſe, write to me: And I ſhall know what anſwer to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn. Only one thing let me remind you of, that if you touch upon any ſubject, in which my papa has
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0447200104:62"/>
a concern, I ſhall judge by your treatment of the father, what value you have for the daughter.</p>
               <p>He <hi>looked,</hi> as if he would chooſe rather to ſpeak than write: But had he <hi>ſaid</hi> ſo, I had a ſevere return to have made upon him; as poſſibly he might ſee by <hi>my</hi> looks.</p>
               <floatingText type="letter">
                  <body>
                     <p>IN this way are we now: A ſort of calm, as I ſaid, ſucceeding a ſtorm:—What may happen next, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a ſtorm or a calm, with ſuch a ſpirit as I have to deal with, who can tell?</p>
                     <p>But be that as it will, I think, my dear, I am not <hi>meanly</hi> off: And that is a great point with me; and which I know you'll be glad to hear: If it were on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that I can ſee this man without loſing any of that dignity (what other word can I uſe, ſpeaking of <hi>my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi> that betokens <hi>decency,</hi> and not <hi>arrogance?</hi>) which is ſo neceſſary to enable me to look <hi>up,</hi> or rather, with the <hi>mind's</hi> eye, I may ſay, to look <hi>down</hi> upon a man of this man's caſt.</p>
                     <p>Altho' circumſtances have ſo offer'd, that I could not take your advice as to the <hi>manner</hi> of dealing with him; yet you gave me ſo much courage by it, as has enabled me to conduct things to this iſſue; as well as determin'd me againſt leaving him: Which <hi>before,</hi> I was thinking to do, at all adventures. Whether, when it came to the point, I <hi>ſhould</hi> have done ſo, or not, I cannot ſay, becauſe it would have depended upon his behaviour at the time.</p>
                     <p>But let his behaviour be what it will, I am afraid, with you, that, ſhould any thing offer, at laſt, to oblige me to leave him, I ſhall not mend my ſituation in the world's eye; but the contrary. And yet I will not be treated by him with indignity, while I have any power to help myſelf.</p>
                     <p>You, my dear, have accuſed me of having <hi>modeſty'd-away,</hi> as you phraſe it, ſeveral opportunities of being—Being what, my dear?—Why, the wife of a liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine:
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0447200104:63"/>
And what a libertine and his wife are, my couſin Morden's letter tells us.—Let me here, once for all, endeavour to account for the motives of my behaviour to this man, and for the principles I have proceeded upon, as they appear to me upon a cloſe ſelf-examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>Be pleaſed then to allow me to think, that my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives on this occaſion, ariſe not <hi>altogether</hi> from maid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enly niceneſs; nor yet from the apprehenſion of what my preſent tormentor, and future huſband, may think of a precipitate compliance, on ſuch a diſagreeable behaviour as his: But they ariſe principally from what offers to my own heart, reſpecting, as I may ſay, its own rectitude, its own judgment of the <hi>fit</hi> and the <hi>unfit</hi>; as I would, without ſtudy, anſwer <hi>for</hi> myſelf <hi>to</hi> myſelf, in the <hi>firſt</hi> place; to <hi>him,</hi> and to the <hi>world,</hi> in the <hi>ſecond</hi> only. Principles, that <hi>are</hi> in my mind; that I <hi>found</hi> there; implanted, no doubt, by the firſt gracious Planter: Which therefore <hi>impell</hi> me, as I may ſay, to act up to them, that thereby I may, to the beſt of my judgment, be enabled to comport myſelf worthily in both ſtates (the ſingle and the married), let others act as they will by <hi>me.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I hope, my dear, I do not deceive myſelf, and, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of ſetting about rectifying what is amiſs in my heart, endeavour to find excuſes for habits and pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarities, which I am unwilling to caſt off or overcome. The heart is very deceitful: Do you, my dear friend, lay mine open (but, ſurely, it is always open before you!) and ſpare me not, if you find or think it culpable.</p>
                     <p>This obſervation, once for all, as I ſaid, I thought proper to make, to convince you, that, to the beſt of my judgment, my errors, in matters as well of the leſſer moment, as the greater, ſhall rather be the fault of my underſtanding than of my will.</p>

               <p>MR. Lovelace has ſent me, by Dorcas, his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals, as follow:</p>

I have no doubt, but he will be put upon making large de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands upon you. All thoſe it ſhall be in your power to comply with, for the ſake of your own peace. And the remainder ſhall be paid into your hands, and be intirely at your diſpoſal, as a fund to ſupport thoſe charitable donations, which I have heard you ſo famed for <hi>out</hi> of your family; and for which you have been ſo greatly reflected upon <hi>in</hi> it.'</q>

                     <p>MR. Lovelace would fain have engag'd me laſt night. But as I was not prepar'd to enter upon the ſubject of his propoſals, intending to conſider them maturely, and was not highly pleaſed with his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion (and then there is hardly any getting from him in tolerable time over-night), I deſired to be excuſed ſeeing him till morning.</p>
                     <p>About ſeven o'clock we met in the dining-room. I find, he was full of expectation that I ſhould meet him with a very favourable, who knows, but with a <hi>thankful</hi> aſpect?—And I immediately found by his ſullen countenance, that he was under no ſmall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>app<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>My deareſt love, are you well?—Why look you ſo ſolemn upon me?—Will your indifference never

be over?—If I have propoſed terms in any reſpect <hi>ſhort</hi> of your expectation—</p>
                     <p>I told him, that he had very conſiderately men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd my ſhewing his propoſals to Miſs Howe, and conſulting any of her friends upon them by her means; and I ſhould have an opportunity to ſend them to her, by Collins, by-and-by; and ſo inſiſted to ſuſpend any talk upon that ſubject till I had her opinion upon them.</p>
                     <p>Good God!—If there were but the leaſt loop-hole; the leaſt room for delay!—But he was writing a letter to his uncle, to give him an account of his ſituation with me, and could not finiſh it ſo ſatisfactorily, either to my Lord, or to himſelf, as if I would conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend to ſay, whether the terms he had propoſed were acceptable, or not.</p>
                     <p>Thus far, I told him, I could ſay, That my prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal point was peace and reconciliation with my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily. As to other matters, the genteelneſs of his own ſpirit would put him upon doing more for me than I ſhould aſk, or expect. Wherefore, if all he had to write about was to know what Lord M. would do on my account, he might ſpare himſelf the trouble; for that my utmoſt wiſhes as to myſelf, were much more eaſily gratify'd than he perhaps imagin'd.</p>
                     <p>He aſked me then, If I would ſo far permit him to touch upon the happy day, as to requeſt his uncle's preſence on the occaſion, and to be my father?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Father</hi> had a ſweet and venerable ſound with it, I ſaid. I ſhould be glad to have a father who would own me!</p>
                     <p>Was not this plain ſpeaking, think you, my dear? Yet it rather, I muſt own, appears ſo to me on re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection, than was <hi>deſigned</hi> freely at the time. For I then, with a ſigh from the bottom of my heart, thought of my <hi>own father</hi>; bitterly regretting, that I am an outcaſt from him and from my mother.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Lovelace, I thought, ſeemed a little affected; at

the <hi>manner</hi> of my ſpeaking, as well as at the ſad refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, I ſuppoſe.</p>
                     <p>I am but a very young creature, Mr. Lovelace, ſaid I, and wiped my averted eye, altho' you have <hi>kindly,</hi> and in <hi>love to me,</hi> introduced ſo much ſorrow to me already: So you muſt not wonder, that the word <hi>father</hi> ſtrikes ſo ſenſibly upon the heart of a child, ever dutiful till ſhe knew you, and whoſe ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der years ſtill require the paternal wing.</p>
                     <p>He turned towards the window: [Rejoice with me, my dear, ſince I ſeem devoted to him, that the man is not abſolutely impenetrable!]—His emotion was viſible; yet he endeavoured to ſuppreſs it—Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching me again; again he was obliged to turn from me; Angelic ſomething, he ſaid: But then, obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a heart more <hi>ſuitable</hi> to his wiſh, he once more approached me.—For his own part, he ſaid, as Lord M. was ſo ſubject to the gout, he was afraid, that the compliment he had juſt propoſed to make him, might, if made, occaſion a longer ſuſpenſion, than he could bear to think of: And if it did, it would vex him to the heart, that he had made it.</p>
                     <p>I could not ſay a ſingle word to this, you know, my dear. But you will gueſs at my thoughts of what h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>—But by his ſoul, he knew not, ſo much was I upon the reſerve, and ſo much latent meaning did my eye import, whether, when he moſt hoped to pleaſe me, he was not fartheſt from doing ſo. Would I vouchſafe to ſay, Whether I approved of his compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to Lord M. or not?</p>
                     <p>Miſs Howe, thought I, at that moment, ſays, I muſt <hi>not</hi> run away from This man!</p>
                     <p>To be ſure, Mr. Lovelace, if this matter is <hi>ever to be,</hi> it muſt be agreeable to me to have the full appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of <hi>one</hi> ſide, ſince I cannot have that of the <hi>other.</hi>

                        <hi>If this matter be ever to be!</hi> Good God! what words were thoſe at this time of day! And full <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation</hi> of one ſide! Why that word <hi>approbation?</hi> When the greateſt pride of all his family was, That of having the honour of ſo dear a creature for their relation? Would to Heaven, my deareſt life, added he, that, without complimenting <hi>Any</hi>-body, to-mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row might be the happieſt day of my life!—What ſay you, my angel? With a trembling impatience, that <hi>ſeemed</hi> not affected,—What ſay you for <hi>to-morrow?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It was likely, my dear, I could ſay much to it, or name another day, had I been diſpoſed to the latter, with ſuch an hinted delay from him.</p>

ſhould be reaſon for ſuch a hurry. It will be moſt agreeable, to be ſure, for my Lord to be preſent.</p>
                     <p>I am all obedience and reſignation, returned the wretch, with a ſelf-pluming air, as if he had acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſced to a propoſal made by me, and had complimented me with a great piece of ſelf-denial.</p>
                     <p>Modeſty, I think, required it of me, that it ſhould paſs ſo: Did it not?—I think it did. Would to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven—But what ſignifies wiſhing?</p>
                     <p>But when he would have <hi>rewarded himſelf,</hi> as he had heretofore called it, for this ſelf-ſuppoſed conceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, with a kiſs, I repulſed him with a juſt and very ſincere diſdain.</p>
                     <p>He ſeemed both vex'd and ſurpriz'd, as one who had made propoſals that he had expected every thing from. He plainly ſaid, that he thought our ſituation would intitle him to ſuch an innocent freedom: And he was both amaz'd and griev'd to be thus ſcorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully repulſed.</p>
                     <p>No reply could be made by me. I abruptly broke from him. I recollect, as I paſſed by one of the pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glaſſes, that I ſaw in it his clenched hand offered in wrath to his forehead: The words, <hi>indifference, by his ſoul, next to hatred,</hi> I heard him ſpeak: And ſomething of <hi>ice</hi> he mentioned: I heard not what.</p>
                     <p>Whether he intends to write to my Lord, or to Miſs Montague, I cannot tell. But as all delicacy ought to be over with me <hi>now,</hi> perhaps I am to blame to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect it from a man who may not know <hi>what it is.</hi> If he does <hi>not,</hi> and yet thinks himſelf very delicate, and intends not to be otherwiſe, I am rather to be pitied, than he to be cenſured. And after all, ſince I <hi>muſt</hi> take him as I find him, I <hi>muſt:</hi> That is to ſay, as a man ſo vain, and ſo accuſtom'd to be admired, that, not being conſcious of internal defect, he has taken no pains to poliſh more than his outſide: And as his propoſals are higher than my expectations; and as in his own opinion, he has a great deal to bear from <hi>me,</hi> I
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0447200104:72"/>
                        <hi>will</hi> (no new offence preventing) ſit down to anſwer them:—And, if poſſible, in terms as unobjectible to him, as his are to me.</p>
                     <p>But after all, ſee you not my dear, more and more, the miſmatch that there is in our minds?</p>
                     <p>However, I am willing to compound for my fault, by giving up (if that may be all my puniſhment) the expectation of what is deemed happineſs in this life, with ſuch a huſband as I fear he will make. In ſhort, I will content myſelf to be a ſuffering perſon thro' the ſtate to the end of my life. A long one it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be!—</p>
                     <p>This may qualify him (as it may prove) from ſtings of conſcience from miſbehaviour to a <hi>firſt</hi> wife, to be a more tolerable one to a <hi>ſecond,</hi> tho' not perhaps bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter deſerving: While my ſtory, to all who ſhall know it, will afford theſe inſtructions: That the eye is a traitor, and ought ever to be miſtruſted: That form is deceitful: In other words; That a fine perſon is ſeldom pair'd by a fine mind: And that ſound prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and a good heart, are the only baſes on which the hopes of a <hi>happy future,</hi> either with reſpect to the <hi>here</hi> or to the <hi>hereafter,</hi> can be built.</p>

               <p>Four letters are written by Mr. Lovelace from the date of his laſt, giving the ſtate of affairs between him and the lady, pretty much the ſame as in hers in the ſame period, allowing for the humour in his; and for his reſentments expreſſed with vehemence on her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution to leave him, if her friends could be prevailed upon.—A few extracts from them will be only given.</p>

After violent threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings and vows of revenge, he ſays—
''Tis plain ſhe would have given me up for ever; nor ſhould I have been able to prevent her abandoning of me, unleſs I had torn up the tree by the roots to come at the fruit; which I hope ſtill to bring down by a gentle ſhake or two, if I can but have patience to ſtay the ripening ſeaſon.'</q>

               <p>Mentioning the ſettlements, he ſays,—

               <p>I Would conceal nothing from you that relates to yourſelf ſo much as the incloſed. You will ſee what the noble writer apprehends from you, and wiſhes of you, with regard to Miſs Harlowe, and how much at heart all your relations have it, that you do honourably by her. They compliment me with an influence over you, which I wiſh with all my ſoul you would let me have in this article.</p>
               <p>Let me once more intreat thee, Lovelace, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect, before it be too late, before the mortal offence <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e given, upon the graces and merits of this lady. Let thy frequent remorſes at laſt end in one effectual one. Let not pride and wantonneſs of heart, ruin thy fairer proſpects. By my faith, Lovelace, there is nothing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ut vanity, conceit, and nonſenſe, in our wild ſchemes. As we grow older, we ſhall be wiſer, and looking back upon our fooliſh notions of the preſent hour, ſhall certainly deſpiſe ourſelves (our youth diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated), when we think of the honourable engagements we might have made. Thou, more eſpecially, if thou letteſt ſuch a matchleſs creature ſlide thro' thy fingers. A creature pure from her cradle. In all her actions and ſentiments uniformly noble. Strict in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of all her even <hi>unrewarded</hi> duties to the moſt unreaſonable of fathers, what a wife will ſhe make the man who ſhall have the honour to call her his!</p>
               <p>Reflect likewiſe upon her ſufferings for thee. Actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:0447200104:79"/>
at the time thou art forming ſchemes to ruin her (at leaſt, in <hi>her</hi> ſenſe of the word) is ſhe not labouring under a father's curſe laid upon her by thy means, and for thy ſake? And wouldſt thou give operation and completion to this curſe?</p>
               <p>And what, Lovelace, all the time is thy pride? Thou that vainly imagineſt, that the whole family of the, Harlowes, and that of the Howes too, are but thy machines, unknown to themſelves, to bring about thy purpoſes, and thy revenge: What art thou more, or better, than the inſtrument even of her implacable brother, and envious ſiſter, to perpetrate the diſgrace of the moſt excellent of ſiſters, which they are moved to by vilely low and ſordid motives?—Canſt thou bear, Lovelace, to be thought the machine of thy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veterate enemy James Harlowe?—Nay, art thou not the cully of that ſtill viler Joſeph Leman, who ſerves himſelf as much by thy money, as he does thee by the double part he acts by thy direction?—And the devil's agent beſides, who only can, and who cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly will, ſuitably reward thee, if thou proceedeſt, and if thou effecteſt thy wicked purpoſe?</p>
               <p>Could any man but you put together upon paper the following queſtions, with ſo much unconcern as you ſeem to have written them?—Give them a reperuſal, O heart of adamant!
<q rend="inline margQuotes">'Whither can ſhe fly to avoid me? Her parents will not receive her; her uncles will not entertain her: Her beloved Norton is in their direction, and cannot. Miſs Howe dare not. She has not one friend in town but ME: Is intirely a ſtranger to the town <note n="(a)" place="bottom">See Letter <hi>ii.</hi> p. <hi>17.</hi>
                     </note>.'</q>—What muſt that heart be that can triumph in a diſtreſs ſo deep, into which ſhe has been plunged by thy ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borate arts and contrivances? And what a ſweet, yet ſad reflection was that, which had almoſt had its due effect upon thee, ariſing from thy naming Lord M. for her nuptial father! Her tender years inclining
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:0447200104:80"/>
her to <hi>wiſh</hi> a father, and to <hi>hope</hi> a friend.—O my dear Lovelace, canſt thou reſolve to be, inſtead of the father thou haſt robbed her of, a devil?</p>
               <p>Thou knoweſt, that I have no intereſt, that I can have no view, in wiſhing thee to do juſtice to this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable creature. For thy own ſake, once more I conjure thee, for thy family's ſake, and for the ſake of our common humanity, let me beſeech thee to be juſt to Miſs Clariſſa Harlowe.</p>
               <p>No matter whether theſe expoſtulations are in cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter from me, or not. I <hi>have</hi> been, and <hi>am,</hi> bad enough. If thou takeſt my advice, which is, as the incloſed will ſhew thee, the advice of all thy family, thou wilt perhaps have it to reproach me (and but perhaps neither), that thou art not a worſe man than myſelf. But if thou doſt <hi>not,</hi> and if thou ruineſt ſuch a virtue, all the complicated wickedneſs of ten devils, let looſe among the innocent, with full power over them, will not do ſo much vile and baſe miſchief as thou wilt be guilty of.</p>
               <p>It is ſaid, that the prince on his throne is not ſafe, if a mind ſo deſperate can be found, as values not its <hi>own</hi> life. So may it be ſaid, that the moſt immacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late virtue is not ſafe, if a man can be met with, who has no regard to his own honour, and makes a jeſt of the moſt ſolemn vows and proteſtations.</p>
               <p>Thou mayeſt by trick, chicane, and falſe colours, thou who art worſe than a pickeroon in love, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a poor lady ſo intangled as thou haſt intangled her; ſo unprotected as thou haſt made her: But conſider, how much more generous and juſt to her, and noble to thyſelf, it is, to overcome <hi>thyſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Once more, it is no matter, whether my paſt or future actions countenance my preachment, as perhaps thou'lt call what I have written: But this I promiſe thee, that whenever I meet with a woman of but one half of Miſs Harlowe's perfections, who will favour me with her acceptance, I will take the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:0447200104:81"/>
I give, and marry. Nor will I attempt to try her honour at the hazard of my own. In other words, I will not degrade an excellent creature in her own eyes, by trials, when I have no cauſe for ſuſpicion. And let me add, with reſpect, to thy <hi>Eagleſhip</hi>'s manifeſtation, of which thou boaſteſt, in thy attempts upon the innocent and uncorrupted, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than upon thoſe whom thou humourouſly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pareſt to wrens, <hi>philtits,</hi> and wagtails <note n="(a)" place="bottom">

Guilt enough in contributing to the <hi>continued</hi> guilt of other poor wretches, if I am one of thoſe who take care ſhe ſhall never riſe again, when ſhe has once fallen.</p>
               <p>Whatever the capital devil, under whoſe banner thou haſt liſted, will let thee do, with regard to this incomparable woman, I hope thou wilt act with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, in relation to the incloſed, between Lord M. and me; who, as thou wilt ſee, deſires, that thou mayeſt not know he wrote on the ſubject; for reaſons, I think, very far from being creditable to thyſelf: And that thou wilt take as meant, the honeſt zeal for thy ſervice, of</p>

                     <p>IF any man in the world has power over my ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew, it is you. I therefore write this, to beg you to interfere in the affair depending between him and the moſt accompliſhed of women, as every one ſays; and <hi>what every one ſays, muſt be true.</hi>
                     </p>

                        <pb n="75" facs="tcp:0447200104:82"/>I don't know that he has any bad deſigns upon her; but I know his temper too well, not to be apprehenſive upon ſuch long delays: And the ladies here have been for ſome time in fear for her; my ſiſter Sadleir, in particular, who (you know) is a wiſe woman, ſays, that theſe delays, in the preſent caſe, muſt be from him, rather than from the lady. He had always in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a ſtrong antipathy to marriage; and may think of playing his dog's tricks by her, as he has by ſo many others. If there's any danger of this, 'tis beſt to prevent it in time: For, <hi>when a thing is done, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice comes too late.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He has always had the folly and impertinence to make a jeſt of me for uſing proverbs: But as they are the wiſdom of whole nations and ages, collected into a ſmall compaſs, I am not to be ſhamed out of ſentences, that often contain more wiſdom in them, than the tedious harangues of moſt of our parſons and moraliſts. Let him laugh at them, if he pleaſes: You and I know better things, Mr. Belford.—<hi>Tho' you have kept company with a wolf, you have not learnt to howl of him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But nevertheleſs, you muſt not let him know, that I have written to you on this ſubject. I am aſhamed to ſay it; but he has ever treated me, as if I were a man of very common underſtanding. And would perhaps think never the better of the beſt advice in the world, for coming from me.</p>
                     <p>I am ſure, he has no reaſon to ſlight me as he does. He may and will be the better for me, if he outlives me; tho' he once told me to my face, That I might do as I would with my eſtate; for that he, for his part, loved his liberty as much as he deſpiſed money. He thought, I ſuppoſe, that <hi>I could not cover him with my wings, without pecking at him with my bill</hi>; tho' I never uſed to be pecking at him, without very great occaſion: And, God knows, he might have my very heart, if he would but endeavour to oblige me, by
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:0447200104:83"/>
ſtudying his own good; for that is all I deſire of him. Indeed, it was his poor mother that firſt ſpoil'd him; and I have been but too indulgent to him ſince.—A fine grateful diſpoſition, you'll ſay, to <hi>return evil for good!</hi> But that was always his way.</p>
                     <p>This match, however, as the lady has ſuch an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary ſhare of wiſdom and goodneſs, might ſet all to rights: and if you can forward it, I would enable him to make whatever ſettlements he could wiſh; and ſhould not be unwilling to put him in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of another pretty eſtate beſides: For what do I live for (as I have often ſaid), but to ſee him and my two nieces well married and ſettled? May heaven ſettle him down to a better mind, and turn his heart to more of goodneſs and conſideration!</p>
                     <p>If the delays are on his ſide, I tremble for the lady; and, if on hers (as he tells my niece Charlotte), I could wiſh the young lady were apprized, that <hi>Delays are dangerous.</hi> Excellent as ſhe is, I can tell her, ſhe ought not to depend on her merits with ſuch a change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able fellow, and ſuch a profeſſed marriage-hater, as he has been. I know you are very good at giving kind hints. <hi>A word to the wiſe is enough.</hi>

                     <p>I wiſh you would try what you can do with him; for I have warned him ſo often of his wicked prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices, that I begin to deſpair of my words having any effect upon him. But let him remember, that <hi>Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, tho' it comes with leaden feet, ſtrikes with iron hands.</hi> If he behaves ill in this caſe, he may find it ſo. What a pity it is, that a man of his talents and learning ſhould be ſo vile a rake! Alas! alas! <hi>Une poignée de bonne vie vaut mieux que plein muy de clergé</hi>; A handful of good life is better than a whole buſhel of learning.</p>
                     <p>You may throw in, too, as his friend, that, ſhould he provoke me, it may not be too late for me to marry. My old friend Wycherly did ſo, when he was older than I am, on purpoſe to plague <hi>his</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew:
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:0447200104:84"/>
And, inſpite of this gout, I might have a child or two ſtill. And have not been without ſome thoughts that way, when he has angered me more than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary: But theſe thoughts have gone off again hitherto, upon my conſidering, that <hi>the children of very young and very old men</hi> [tho' I am not ſo very old neither] <hi>laſt not long</hi>; and that <hi>old men, when they marry young women,</hi> are ſaid to <hi>make much of death:</hi> Yet who knows but that matrimony might be good againſt the gouty humours I am troubled with?</p>
                     <p>The ſentences, that I have purpoſely wove into my diſcourſe, may be of ſome ſervice to you in talking to him; but uſe them ſparingly, that he may not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover, that you borrow your <hi>darts</hi> from my <hi>quiver.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>May your good counſels, Mr. Belford, founded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the hints I have given, pierce his heart, and incite him to do what will be ſo happy for himſelf, and ſo neceſſary for the honour of that admirable lady whom I long to ſee his wife; and, if I may, I will not think of one for myſelf.</p>
                     <p>Should he abuſe the confidence ſhe has plac'd in him, I myſelf ſhall pray, that vengeance may f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </opener>
               <p>WHEN I have opened my views to thee ſo amply, as I have done in my former letters; and have told thee, that my principal deſign is but to bring virtue to a trial, that, <hi>if</hi> virtue, it need not be afraid of; and that the reward of it will be marriage (that is to ſay, if, after I have carried my point, I cannot prevail upon her to live with me the Life of Honour<note n="(a)" place="bottom">See Vol. <hi>III.</hi> p. <hi>111.</hi>
                  </note>; for that thou knoweſt is the wiſh of my heart); I am amazed at the repetition of thy wambling nonſenſe.</p>
               <p>I am of opinion with thee, that ſome time hence, when I am <hi>grown wiſer,</hi> I ſhall conclude, that <hi>there is nothing but vanity, conceit, and nonſenſe, in my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent wild ſchemes.</hi> But what is this ſaying, but that I muſt be <hi>firſt</hi> wiſer?</p>
               <p>I do not intend <hi>to let this matchleſs creature ſlide through my fingers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Art thou able to ſay half the things in her praiſe, that I have ſaid, and am continually ſaying or writing?</p>
               <p>Her gloomy father curſed the ſweet creature, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe put it out of his wicked power to compel her to have the man ſhe hated. Thou knoweſt how little merit ſhe has with me on this ſcore.—And ſhall I not try the virtue I intend, upon full proof, to reward, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe her father is a tyrant?—Why art thou thus eternally reflecting upon ſo excellent a woman, as if thou wert aſſured ſhe would fail in the trial?—Nay, thou declareſt, every time thou writeſt on the ſubject, that ſhe <hi>will,</hi> that ſhe <hi>muſt</hi> yield, <hi>intangled as ſhe is:</hi> And yet makeſt her virtue the pretence of thy ſolicitude for her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An inſtrument of the vile James Harlowe,</hi> doſt thou call me?—O Jack! how I could curſe thee!—<hi>I</hi> an
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:0447200104:87"/>
                  <hi>inſtrument</hi> of that brother! of that ſiſter!—But mark the end—And thou ſhalt ſee what will become of that brother, and of that ſiſter!</p>
               <p>Play not againſt me my own acknowleged ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities, I deſire thee. Senſibilities which, at the ſame time that they contradict thy charge of an <hi>adamantine heart</hi> in thy friend, thou hadſt known nothing of, had I not communicated them to thee.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If I ruin ſuch a virtue,</hi> ſayeſt thou?—Eternal mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notoniſt!—Again; <hi>The moſt immaculate virtue may be ruined by men, who have no regard to their honour, and who make a jeſt of the moſt ſolemn oaths,</hi> &amp;c. What muſt be the virtue that will be ruined without oaths? Is not the world full of theſe deceptions? And are not <hi>lovers oaths</hi> a jeſt of hundreds of years ſtanding? And are not cautions againſt the perfidy of our ſex, a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary part of the female education?</p>
               <p>I do intend to endeavour to overcome <hi>myſelf</hi>; but I muſt firſt try, if I cannot overcome <hi>this lady.</hi> Have I not ſaid, that the honour of her Sex is concerned that I ſhould <hi>try?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whenever thou meeteſt with a woman of but half her perfections, thou wilt marry.</hi>—Do, Jack.</p>
               <p>Can a girl be <hi>degraded by trials,</hi> who is not <hi>over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I am glad, that thou takeſt crime to thyſelf, for not endeavouring to convert the poor wretches whom <hi>others</hi> have ruined. I will not recriminate upon thee, Belford, as I might, when thou flattereſt thyſelf, that thou never ruinedſt the morals of any young creature, who otherwiſe would not have been corrupted.—The palliating conſolation of an Hottentot heart, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined rather to gluttonize on the garbage of other ſoul feeders, than to reform.—But tell me, Jack, wouldſt thou have ſpared ſuch a girl as my Roſebud, had I not, by my example, engaged thy generoſity? Nor was my Roſebud the only girl I ſpared:—When my power was acknowleged, who more merciful than thy friend?</p>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:0447200104:88"/>
               <q>
                  <l>It is <hi>reſiſtance</hi> that inflames deſire,</l>
                  <l>Sharpens the darts of love, and blows its fire.</l>
                  <l>Love is diſarm'd that meets with too much eaſe;</l>
                  <l>He languiſhes, and does not care to pleaſe.</l>
               </q>
               <p>The women know this as well as the men. They love to be addreſſed with ſpirit;
<q>
                     <l>And therefore 'tis their golden fruit they guard</l>
                     <l>With ſo much care, to make poſſeſſion hard.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Whence, for a by-reflection, the ardent, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſant Gallant is ſo often preferr'd to the cold Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band. And yet the Sex do not conſider, that Variety or Novelty gives the ardour and the obſequiouſneſs; and that, were the Rake as much uſed to them as the Huſband is, he would be (and is to his own wife, if married) <hi>as</hi> indifferent to their favours; and the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, in his turn, would, to another woman, be the Rake. Let the women, upon the whole, take this leſſon from a Lovelace-Always to endeavour to make themſelves as New to a Huſband, and to appear as elegant and as obliging to him, as they are deſirous to appear to a Lover, and actually were to him as <hi>ſuch</hi>; and then the Rake, which all women love, will laſt longer in the Huſband, than it generally does.</p>
               <p>But to return:—If I have not ſufficiently clear'd my conduct to thee in the above; I refer thee once more to mine of the 13th of laſt month <note n="(a)" place="bottom">See Vol. <hi>III.</hi> Letter <hi>xvii.</hi> p. <hi>103.</hi>
                  </note>. And pr'ythee, Jack, lay me not under a neceſſity to repeat the ſame things ſo often. I hope thou readeſt what I write more than once.</p>
               <p>I am not diſpleaſed that thou art ſo apprehenſive of my reſentment, that I cannot miſs a day, without making thee uneaſy. Thy conſcience, 'tis plain, tells thee, that thou haſt deſerved my diſpleaſure: And if it has convinced thee of <hi>that,</hi> it will make thee afraid of repeating thy fault. See that this be the conſequence. Elſe, now that thou haſt told me how I can pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:0447200104:89"/>
thee, it is very likely that I do puniſh thee by my ſilence, altho' I have as much pleaſure in writing on this charming ſubject, as thou canſt have in reading what I write.</p>
               <p>When a boy, if a dog ran away from me thro' fear, I generally looked about for a ſtone, a ſtick, or a brickbat; and if neither offer'd to my hand, I ſkimm'd my hat after him, to make him afraid for ſomething. What ſignifies power, if we do not exert it?</p>
               <p>Let my Lord know thou haſt ſcribbled to me. But give him not the contents of thy epiſtle. Tho' a parcel of crude ſtuff, <hi>he</hi> would think there was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in it. Poor arguments will do in favour of what we like. But the ſtupid Peer little thinks, that this lady is a rebel to love. On the contrary, not only he, but all the world, believe her to be a volunteer in his ſervice.—So I ſhall incur blame, and ſhe will be pity'd, if any thing happen amiſs.</p>
               <p>Since my Lord's heart is ſo ſet upon this match, I have written already to let him know,
<q rend="inline margQuotes">'That my unhappy character has given my beloved an unge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous diffidence of me. That ſhe is ſo mother-ſick and father-fond, that ſhe had rather return to Harlowe-Place, than marry. That ſhe is even ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive, that the ſtep ſhe has taken of going off with me, will make the ladies of a family of ſuch name and rank as ours, think ſlightly of her. That therefore I deſire his Lordſhip (tho' this hint, I tell him, muſt be very delicately touched) to write me ſuch a letter as I can ſhew her. Let him treat me in it ever ſo freely, I ſhall not take it amiſs, becauſe I know his Lordſhip takes pleaſure in writing to me in a corrective ſtyle. That he may make what offers he pleaſes on the marriage. That I deſire his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence at the ceremony; that I may take from his hand the greateſt bleſſing that mortal man can give me.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="83" facs="tcp:0447200104:90"/>I have not abſolutely told the lady that I would write to his Lordſhip to this effect; yet have given her reaſon to think I will. So that without the laſt neceſſity I ſhall not produce the anſwer I expect from him: For I am very loth, I own, to make uſe of any of my family's names for the furthering of my deſigns. And yet I muſt make all ſecure, before I pull off the maſk. This was my motive for bringing her hither.</p>
               <p>Thus, thou ſeeſt, that the old Peer's letter came very ſeaſonably. I thank thee for it. But as to his ſentences, they cannot poſſibly do me good. I was early ſuffocated with his <hi>Wiſdom of nations.</hi> When a boy, I never aſked any thing of him, but out flew a <hi>proverb</hi>; and if the tendency of that was to deny me, I never could obtain the leaſt favour. This gave me ſo great an averſion to the very word, that, when a child, I made it a condition with my tutor, who was an honeſt parſon, that I would not read my Bible at all, if he would not excuſe me one of the wiſeſt books in it: To which, however, I had no other objection, than that it was called <hi>The Proverbs.</hi> And as for So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon, he was then a hated character with me, not becauſe of his polygamy, but becauſe I had conceived him to be ſuch another muſty old fellow as my uncle.</p>
               <p>Well, but let us leave old ſaws to old men.—What ſignifies thy tedious whining over thy departing relation? Is it not generally agreed, that he cannot recover? Will it not be kind in thee, to put him out of his miſery? I hear, that he is peſter'd ſtill with viſits from doctors, and apothecaries, and ſurgeons; that they cannot cut ſo deep as the mortification has gone; and that in every viſit, in every ſcarification, inevitable death is pronounced upon him. Why then do they keep tormenting him? Is it not to take away more of his living fleece than of his dead fleſh?—When a man is given over, the fee ſhould ſurely be refuſed. Are they not now robbing his heirs?—What haſt thou to do, if the will be as thou'dſt have it?—
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:0447200104:91"/>
He ſent for thee [Did he not?] to cloſe his eyes. He is but an <hi>uncle,</hi> is he?</p>
               <p>Let me ſee, if I miſtake not, it is in the Bible, or ſome other good book: Can it be in Herodotus?—O, I believe it is in Joſephus; A half-ſacred and half-pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane author. He tells us of a king of Syria, put out of his pain by his prime miniſter, or one who deſerved to be ſo for his contrivance. The ſtory ſays, if I am right, that he ſpread a wet cloth over his face, which killing him, he reigned in his place. A notable fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low! Perhaps this wet cloth, in the original, is what we now call <hi>laudanum</hi>; a potion that overſpreads the faculties, as the wet cloth did the face of the royal patient, and the tranſlator knew not how to render it.</p>
               <p>But how like a forlorn varlet thou ſubſcribeſt, <hi>Thy melancholy friend,</hi> J. BELFORD!—Melancholy! for what? To ſtand by, and ſee fair play between an old man and death? I thought thou hadſt been more of a man; thou that art not afraid of an acute death, a ſword's point, to be ſo plaguily hyp'd at the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of a chronical one?—What tho' the ſcarifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cators work upon him day by day? it is only upon a <hi>caput mortuum:</hi> And pr'ythee <hi>Go to,</hi> to uſe the <hi>ſty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum veterum,</hi> and learn of the <hi>Royal butchers</hi>; who, for ſport [an hundred times worſe men than thy Love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace] widow ten thouſand at a bruſh, and make twice as many fatherleſs; and are dubb'd <hi>Magnus</hi> or <hi>Le Grand</hi> for it: Learn of <hi>them,</hi> I ſay, how to ſupport a <hi>ſingle</hi> death.</p>

And yet ſhe has ſo long paſſed for his wife, that he knows not what to reſolve upon about her; nor about the two boys he was ſo fond of, ſuppoſing them to be his; whereas now he begins to doubt his ſhare in them.</p>
               <p>So KEEPING don't do, Lovelace. 'Tis not the eligible life.
<q rend="inline margQuotes">'A man my <hi>keep a woman,</hi> ſaid the poor fellow to me, but <hi>not his eſtate!</hi>—Two inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſts!—Then, my tottering fabric!'</q>
pointing to his emaciated carcaſe.</p>
               <p>We do well to value ourſelves upon our <hi>liberty,</hi> or, to ſpeak more properly, upon the liberties we take! We had need to run down matrimony as we do, and to make that ſtate the ſubject of our frothy jeſts; when we frequently render ourſelves [for this of Tom's is not a <hi>ſingular</hi> caſe] the dupes and fools of women, who generally govern us (by arts our wiſe heads penetrate not) more abſolutely than a wife would attempt to do!</p>
               <p>Let us conſider this point a little; and that upon our own <hi>principles,</hi> as <hi>libertines,</hi> ſetting aſide what the <hi>laws of our country,</hi> and its <hi>cuſtoms,</hi> oblige from us; which, nevertheleſs, we cannot get over, till we have got over almoſt all moral obligations, as members of ſociety.</p>
               <p>In the firſt place, let us conſider [we, who are in poſſeſſion of eſtates by <hi>legal deſcent</hi>], how we ſhould have liked to have been ſuch naked deſtitute varlets as we muſt have been, had our fathers been as wiſe
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:0447200104:94"/>
as ourſelves; and deſpiſed matrimony as we do—And then let us aſk ourſelves, if we ought not to have the ſame regard for <hi>our</hi> poſterity, as we are glad our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers had for <hi>theirs?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this, perhaps, is too <hi>moral</hi> a conſideration.—To proceed therefore to thoſe which will be more ſtriking to <hi>us,</hi> How can we reaſonably expect oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy or frugality (or any thing indeed but riot and waſte) from creatures who have an <hi>intereſt,</hi> and muſt therefore have <hi>views,</hi> different from our own?</p>
               <p>They know the uncertain tenure [our fickle hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours] by which they hold: And is it to be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd at, ſuppoſing them to be provident harlots, that they ſhould endeavour, if they have the <hi>power, to lay up againſt a rainy day</hi>; or, if they have <hi>not</hi> the power, that they ſhould ſquander all they can come at, when they are ſure of <hi>nothing but the preſent hour</hi>; and when the life they live, and the ſacrifices they have made, put conſcience and honour out of the queſtion?</p>
               <p>Whereas a <hi>wife,</hi> having the ſame family-intereſt with her huſband, lies not under either the ſame <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions</hi> or <hi>temptations</hi>; and has not broken through [of <hi>neceſſity,</hi> at leaſt, has not] <hi>thoſe</hi> reſtraints which education has faſten'd upon her: And if ſhe make a private purſe, which we are told by anti-matrimonial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts, all wives love to do, and has children, it goes all into the ſame family, at the long-run.</p>
               <p>Then, as to the great article of fidelity to your bed, are not women of family, who are well-edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, under greater reſtraints, than creatures, who, if they ever <hi>had</hi> reputation, ſacrifice it to ſordid in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, or to more ſordid appetite, the moment they give up to you? Does not the example you furniſh, of having ſucceeded with her, give encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for <hi>others</hi> to attempt her likewiſe? For, with all her blandiſhments, can any man be ſo credulous,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:0447200104:95"/>
or ſo vain, as to believe, that the woman <hi>be</hi> could perſuade, <hi>another</hi> may not prevail upon?</p>
               <p>Adultery is ſo capital a guilt, that even rakes and libertines, if not wholly abandon'd, and, as I may ſay, <hi>invited</hi> by a woman's levity, diſavow and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn it: But here, in a ſtate of KEEPING, a woman is in no danger of incurring, <hi>legally,</hi> at leaſt, that guilt; and you yourſelf have broken thro', and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown in her, all the fences and boundaries of moral honeſty, and the modeſty and reſerves of her Sex: And what tie ſhall hold her againſt inclination, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt? And what ſhall deter an attempter?</p>
               <p>While a huſband has this ſecurity from <hi>legal</hi> ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, that if his wife be detected in a criminal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation with a man of fortune [the <hi>moſt</hi> likely by bribes to ſeduce her], he may recover very great da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages, and procure a divorce beſides: Which, to ſay nothing of the ignominy, is a conſideration that muſt have ſome force upon <hi>both</hi> parties. And a wife muſt be vicious indeed, and a reflection upon a man's own choice, who, for the ſake of change, and where there are no qualities to ſeduce, nor affluence to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, will run ſo many hazards to injure her huſband in the tendereſt of all points.</p>
               <p>But there are difficulties in procuring a divorce—[And ſo there ought:]—And none, ſays the rake, in parting with a miſtreſs, whenever you ſuſpect her; or, whenever, weary of her, you have a mind to change her for another.</p>
               <p>But muſt not the man be a brute indeed, who can caſt off a woman, whom he has ſeduced [If he take her from the town, that's another thing], without ſome flagrant reaſon; ſomething that will better juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify him to <hi>himſelf,</hi> as well as to <hi>her,</hi> and to the <hi>world,</hi> than mere <hi>power</hi> and <hi>novelty?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But I don't ſee, if we judge by <hi>fact,</hi> and by the <hi>practice</hi> of all we have been acquainted with, of the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:0447200104:96"/>
                  <hi>Keeping claſs,</hi> that we know how to part with them when we have them.</p>
               <p>That we know we <hi>can</hi> if we <hi>will,</hi> is all we have for <hi>it:</hi> And this leads us to bear many things from a <hi>miſtreſs,</hi> which we would not from a <hi>wife.</hi> But if we are good-natur'd and humane: If the woman has <hi>art</hi> [And what woman <hi>wants</hi> it, who has fallen by <hi>art?</hi> and to whoſe precarious ſituation <hi>art</hi> is ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary?] If you have given her the credit of being called by your name: If you have a ſettled place of abode, and have received and paid viſits in her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, as your wife: If ſhe has brought you children; you will allow, that theſe are ſtrong obligations upon you, in the world's eye, as well as to your own heart, againſt tearing yourſelf from ſuch cloſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexions. She will ſtick to you as your ſkin: And it will be next to flaying yourſelf to caſt her off.</p>
               <p>Even if there be <hi>cauſe</hi> for it, by infidelity, ſhe will have managed ill, if ſhe have not her defenders—Nor did I ever know a cauſe, or a perſon, ſo <hi>bad,</hi> as to want advocates, either from ill will to the one, or pity to the other; and you will then be thought a hard-hearted miſcreant: And even were ſhe to go off without credit to <hi>herſelf,</hi> ſhe will leave <hi>you</hi> as little; eſpecially with all thoſe whoſe good opinion a man would wiſh to cultivate.</p>
               <p>Well, then, ſhall this poor privilege, that we may part with a woman, if we <hi>will,</hi> be deem'd a balance for the other inconveniencies? Shall it be thought by <hi>us,</hi> who are men of family and fortune, an equivalent for giving up equality of degree; and taking for the partner of our bed, and very probably more than the partner in our eſtates (to the breach of all family-rule and order), a low-born, a low-educated creature, who has not brought any-thing into the common ſtock; and can poſſibly make no returns for the ſolid benefits ſhe receives, but thoſe libidinous ones, which
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:0447200104:97"/>
a man cannot boaſt of, but to <hi>his</hi> diſgrace, nor think of, but to the ſhame of <hi>both?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moreover, as the man advances in years, the fury of his libertiniſm will go off. He will have different aims and purſuits, which will diminiſh his appetite to ranging, and make ſuch a regular life as the matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial and family-life, palatable to him, and every day more palatable.</p>
               <p>If he has children, and has reaſon to think them <hi>his,</hi> and if his lewd courſes have left him any eſtate, he will have cauſe to regret the <hi>reſtraint</hi> his boaſted <hi>liberty</hi> has laid him under, and the valuable <hi>privilege</hi> it has deprived him of; when he finds, that it muſt deſcend to ſome relation, for whom, whether near or diſtant, he cares not one farthing; and who, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, from his diſſolute life, if a man of virtue, has held him in the utmoſt contempt.</p>
               <p>And were we to ſuppoſe his eſtate in his power to bequeath as he pleaſes; why ſhould a man reſolve, for the gratifying of his wicked humour only, to ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtardize his race? Why ſhould he wiſh to expoſe them to the ſcorn and inſults of the reſt of the world?—Why ſhould he, whether they are men or women, lay them under the neceſſity of complying with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals of marriage, either inferior as to fortune, or unequal as to age?—Why ſhould he deprive the children he loves, and who are themſelves guilty of no fault (if they have regard to morals, and to legal and ſocial ſanctions), of the reſpect they would wiſh to have, and to deſerve?—and of the opportunity of aſſociating themſelves with proper, that is to ſay, with <hi>reputable</hi> company?—And why ſhould he make them think themſelves under obligation to every per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of character, who ſhould vouchſafe to viſit them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> What little reaſon, in a word, would ſuch children have to bleſs their father's obſtinate defiance of the laws and cuſtoms of his country; and for giving them
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:0447200104:98"/>
a mother, whom they could not think of with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; to whoſe <hi>crime</hi> it was, that they owed their very beings, and whoſe example it was their duty to ſhun?</p>
               <p>If the education and morals of theſe children are left to chance, as too generally they are (for the man who has humanity and a feeling heart, and who is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of fondneſs for his offspring, I take it for granted, will marry); the caſe is ſtill worſe; his crime is perpetuated, as I may ſay, by his children: And the Sea, the Army, perhaps the Highway, for the boys; the Common for the girls; too often point out the way to a worſe cataſtrophe.</p>
               <p>What therefore, upon the whole, do we get by treading in theſe crooked paths, but danger, diſgrace, and a too late repentance?</p>
               <p>And after all, do we not frequently become the cullies of our own libertiniſm; ſliding into the very ſtate with thoſe half-worn-out doxies; which, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps we might have enter'd into with their ladies; at leaſt with their ſuperiors, both in degree and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune? And all the time, lived handſomely like our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; not ſneaking into holes and corners; and, when we crept abroad with our women, looking about us at every opening into the ſtreet or day, as if we were confeſſedly accountable to the cenſures of all honeſt people.</p>
               <p>My couſin Tony Jenyns, thou kneweſt. He had not the actively miſchievous ſpirit, that Thou, Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, Mowbray, Myſelf, and Tourville, have: But he imbibed the ſame notions we do, and carried them into practice.</p>
               <p>How did he prate againſt wedlock! How did he ſtrut about as a <hi>wit</hi> and a <hi>ſmart!</hi> And what a <hi>wit</hi> and a <hi>ſmart</hi> did all the boys and girls of our family, myſelf among the reſt, then an urchin, think him, for the airs he gave himſelf?—Marry! No, not for the world; what man of ſenſe would bear the inſolences,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:0447200104:99"/>
the petulances, the expenſiveneſs of a wife! He could not for the heart of him think it tolerable, that a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of <hi>equal</hi> rank and fortune, and, as it might hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, <hi>ſuperior</hi> talents to his own, ſhould look upon herſelf to have a right to ſhare the benefit of that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune which ſhe brought him.</p>
               <p>So, after he had flutter'd about the town for two or three years, in all which time he had a better opinion of himſelf than any-body elſe had, what does he do, but enter upon an affair with his fencing-maſter's daughter?</p>
               <p>He ſucceeds, takes private lodgings for her at Hack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; viſits her by ſtealth, both of them tender of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations, that were <hi>extremely</hi> tender, but which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had quite given over; for rakes of either ſex are always the laſt to condemn or cry down themſelves: Viſited by nobody, nor viſiting: The life of a thief, or of a man beſet by creditors, afraid to look out of his own houſe, or to be ſeen abroad with her. And thus went he on for twelve years, and, tho' he had a good eſtate, hardly making both ends meet; for, tho' no glare, there was no oeconomy; and beſides, he had every year a child, and very fond of them was he. But none of them lived above three years: And being now, on the death of the dozenth, grown as dully ſober, as if he had been a real huſband, his good Mrs. Thomas (for he had not permitted her to take his own name) prevailed upon him, to think the loſs of their children a judgment upon the parents for their wicked way of life [There is a time, when calamities will beget reflection! The royal cully of France, thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, was <hi>Maintenon</hi>'d into it by his ill ſucceſſes in the field]: And ſo, when more than half-worn out <hi>both</hi> of them, the ſorry fellow took it into his head to marry her: And then had leiſure to ſit down, and contemplate the many offers of perſons of family and fortune, which he had declined in the prime of his life: His ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences <hi>equal</hi> at leaſt: His reputation not only <hi>leſs,</hi> but <hi>loſt:</hi> His enjoyments <hi>ſtollen:</hi> His partnerſhip <hi>unequal,</hi>
                  <pb n="93" facs="tcp:0447200104:100"/>
and ſuch as he had always been aſhamed of. But the women ſaid, That after twelve years cohabitation, Tony did an honeſt thing by her. And that was all my poor couſin got by making his old miſtreſs his new wife:—Not a drum, not a trumpet, not a fife, not a tabret, nor the expectation of a new joy, to ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate him on!</p>
               <p>What Belton will do with his Thomaſine, I know not; nor care I to adviſe him: For I ſee the poor fellow does not like that any-body ſhould curſe her but himſelf: And that he does very heartily. And ſo low is he reduced, that he blubbers over the reflection upon his paſt fondneſs for her cubs, and upon his preſent doubts of their being his:
<q rend="inline margQuotes">'What a d—n'd thing is it, Belford, if Tom and Hall ſhould be the hoſtler dog's puppies, and not mine!'</q>
Very true! and I think the ſtrong health of the chubby-faced, muſcular whelps, confirms the too great probability. But I ſay not ſo to him.</p>
               <p>You, he ſays, are ſuch a gay, lively mortal, that this ſad tale would make no impreſſion upon you: Eſpecially now, that your whole heart is engaged as it is. Mowbray would be too violent upon it; he has not, he ſays, a feeling heart: Tourville has no diſcretion: And, a pretty jeſt! although he and his Thomaſine lived without reputation in the world (People gueſſing that they were not married, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding ſhe went by his name); yet
<q rend="inline margQuotes">'he would not <hi>too much</hi> diſcredit the <hi>curſed ingrate</hi> neither!'</q>
—Could a man act a weaker part, had he been really married; and were he ſure he was going to ſeparate from the mother of his own children?</p>
               <p>I leave this as a leſſon upon thy heart, without making any application: Only, with this remark, That after we libertines have indulged our licentious appetites, reflecting in the conceit of our vain hearts, both with our lips and by our lives, upon our anceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               <p>AND now will I favour thee with a brief account of our preſent ſituation.</p>
               <p>From the higheſt to the loweſt we are all extremely happy.—<hi>Dorcas</hi> ſtands well in her lady's graces. <hi>Polly</hi> has aſked her advice in relation to a courtſhip affair of her own. No oracle ever gave better. <hi>Sally</hi> has had a quarrel with her woollen-draper; and made my beloved Lady-chancellor in it. She blamed Sally for behaving tyrannically to a man who loves her. Dear creature! to ſtand againſt a glaſs, and to ſhut her eyes becauſe ſhe will not ſee her face in it!—Mrs. Sinclair has paid <hi>her</hi> court to ſo unerr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a judge, by requeſting her advice with regard to both nieces.</p>
               <p>This the way we have been in for ſeveral days with the people below. Yet <hi>ſola</hi> generally at her meals,

and ſeldom at other times in their company. They now, uſed to her ways [Perſeverance muſt conquer], never preſs her; ſo when they meet, all is civility on both ſides. Even marry'd people, I believe, Jack, prevent abundance of quarrels, by ſeeing one another but ſeldom.</p>
               <p>But how ſtands it between thyſelf and the lady, methinks thou aſkeſt, ſince her abrupt departure from thee, and undutiful repulſe of Wedneſday morning? Why, pretty well in the main. Nay, very well. For why? The dear ſaucy-face knows not how to help herſelf. Can fly to no other protection. And has, beſides, overheard a converſation [Who would have thought ſhe had been ſo near?] which paſſed between Mrs. Sinclair, Miſs Martin, and myſelf, that very Wedneſday afternoon; which has ſet her heart at eaſe, with reſpect to ſeveral doubtful points.</p>
               <p>Such as, particularly, Mrs. Fretchville's unhappy ſtate of mind:—Moſt humanely pitied by Miſs Martin, who knows her very well; the huſband ſhe has loſt, and herſelf, lovers from their cradles. Pity from one begets pity from another; and ſo many circumſtances were given to poor Mrs. Fretchville's diſtreſs, that it was impoſſible but my beloved muſt <hi>extremely</hi> pity her, whom the leſs tender-hearted Miſs Martin <hi>greatly</hi> pitied.</p>

could have for woman, I boaſted of. It was, in ſhort, I ſaid, of the <hi>true Platonic kind</hi>; or I had no notion of what Platonic Love was.</p>
               <p>So it is, Jack; and muſt end as Platonic Love ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally does end.</p>
               <p>Sally and Mrs. Sinclair praiſed, <hi>but not groſly,</hi> my beloved. Sally particularly admired her purity, called it exemplary; yet, to avoid ſuſpicion, expreſſed her thoughts, that ſhe was-<hi>rather over-nice,</hi> if ſhe might preſume to ſay ſo before me. But applauded me for the ſtrict obſervation I made of my vow.</p>
               <p>I more freely blamed her reſerves to me; called her cruel; inveighed againſt her relations; doubted her love. Every favour I aſked of her deny'd me. Yet my behaviour to her as pure and delicate when alone, as when before them. Hinted at ſomething that had paſſed between us that very day, that ſhewed her indifference to me in ſo ſtrong a light, that I could not bear it. But that I would aſk her for her company to the play of <hi>Venice preſerv'd,</hi> given out for Saturday night, as a benefit play; the prime actors to be in it; and this to ſee, if I were to be denied every favour.—Yet, for my own part, I loved not tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedies; tho' ſhe did, for the ſake of the inſtruction, the warning, and the example generally given in them.</p>
               <p>I had too much <hi>feeling,</hi> I ſaid. There was enough in the world to make our hearts ſad, without carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grief into our diverſions, and making the diſtreſſes of others our own.</p>
               <p>True enough, Belford; and I believe, generally ſpeaking, that all the men of our caſt are of my mind—They love not any tragedies but thoſe in which they themſelves act the parts of tyrants and executioners; and, afraid to truſt themſelves with ſerious and ſolemn reflections, run to comedies, to laugh away the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes they have occaſioned, and to find examples of
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:0447200104:105"/>
as immoral men as themſelves. For very few of our comic performances, as thou knoweſt, give us good ones.—I anſwer, however, for myſelf—Yet thou, I think, on recollection, loveſt to deal in the <hi>lamentable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sally anſwered for Polly, who was abſent, Mrs. Sinclair for herſelf, and for all her acquaintance, even for Miſs Partington, in preferring the comic to the tragic ſcenes.—And I believe they are right; for the devil's in it, if a confided-in rake does not give a girl enough of tragedy in his comedy.</p>
               <p>I aſk'd Sally to oblige my fair-one with her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.</p>
               <p>She was engaged [That was right, thou'lt ſuppoſe]. I aſked Mrs. Sinclair's leave for Polly. To be ſure, ſhe anſwer'd, Polly would think it an honour to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend Mrs. Lovelace: But the poor thing was tender-hearted; and as the tragedy was deep, would weep herſelf blind.</p>
               <p>Sally, mean time, objected Singleton, that <hi>I</hi> might anſwer the objection, and ſave my beloved the trouble of making it, or debating the point with me.</p>
               <p>I then, from a letter juſt before received from one in her father's family, warned them of a perſon who had undertaken to find us out, and whom I thus in writing (calling for pen and ink) deſcribed, that they might arm all the family againſt him—
<q rend="inline margQuotes">'A ſun-burnt, pock-fretten ſailor, ill-looking, big-boned; his ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture about ſix foot; an heavy eye, an over-hanging brow, a deck-treading ſtride in his walk; a couteau generally by his ſide; lips parched from his gums, as if by ſtaring at the ſun in hot climates; a brown coat; a colour'd handkerchief about his neck; an oaken plant in his hand, near as long as himſelf, and proportionably thick.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>No queſtions muſt be anſwer'd, that he ſhould aſk. They ſhould call me to him. But not let my beloved know a tittle of this, ſo long as it could be help'd. And I added, that if her brother or Singleton
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:0447200104:106"/>
came, and if they behaved civilly, I would, for her ſake, be civil to <hi>them:</hi> And in this caſe, ſhe had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do, but to own her marriage, and there could be no pretence for violence on either ſide. But moſt fervently I ſwore, that if ſhe was convey'd away, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by perſuaſion or force, I would directly, on miſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her but one day, go to demand her at her father's, whether ſhe were there or not; and if I recover'd not a ſiſter, I would have a brother; and ſhould find out a captain of a ſhip as well as he. And now, Jack, doſt thou think ſhe'll attempt to get from me, do what I will?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Sinclair began to be afraid of miſchief in her houſe—I was apprehenſive that ſhe would overdo the matter, and be out of character. I therefore wink'd at her. She primm'd; nodded, to ſhew ſhe took me, twang'd out a high-ho, lapp'd one horſe-lip over the other, and was ſilent.</p>
               <p>Here's preparation, Belford!—Doſt think I will throw it all away, for any thing thou canſt ſay, or Lord M. write?—<hi>No indeed!</hi>—as my charmer ſays, when ſhe bridles.</p>
               <p>AND what muſt neceſſarily be the conſequence of all this, with regard to my beloved's behaviour to me?—Canſt thou doubt, that it was all complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance next time ſhe admitted me into her preſence?</p>
               <p>Thurſday we were very happy. All the morning <hi>extremely</hi> happy. I kiſſed her charming hand—I need not deſcribe to thee her hand and arm. When thou ſaweſt her, I took notice that thy eyes dwelt upon them, whenever thou couldſt ſpare them from that beauty-ſpot of wonders, her face. <hi>Fifty</hi> times kiſſed her hand, I believe.—Once her cheek, intending her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Had ſhe not thus kept me at arms-length; had ſhe not denied me thoſe innocent liberties which our

Sex, from degree to degree, aſpire to; could I but have gained acceſs to her in her hours of heedleſſneſs and diſhabille (for full dreſs creates dignity, augments conſciouſneſs, and compels diſtance), we had been familiarized to each other long ago. But keep her up ever ſo late; meet her ever ſo early; by breakfaſt-time dreſſed for the day; and at her earlieſt hour, as nice as others dreſſed.—All her forms thus kept up, wonder not that I have made ſo little progreſs in the propoſed trial.—But how muſt all this diſtance ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulate!</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thurſday morning,</hi> I ſaid, we were extremely hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py—About <hi>noon,</hi> ſhe number'd the hours ſhe had been with me; all of them to me but as one minute; and deſired to be left to herſelf. I was loth to comply: But obſerving the ſun-ſhine begin to ſhut in, I yielded.</p>
               <p>I dined out. Returned; talked of the houſe, and of Mrs. Fretchville: Had ſeen Mennell—Had preſſed him to get the widow to quit—She pitied Mrs. Fretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville—Another good effect of the overheard conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation—Had written to my uncle; expected an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer ſoon from him. I was admitted to ſup with her. Urged for her approbation or correction of my writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten terms. She promiſed an anſwer as ſoon as ſhe had heard from Miſs Howe.</p>
               <p>Then I preſſed for her company to the play on Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turday night. She made objections, as I had foreſeen: Her brother's projects, warmth of the weather, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But in ſuch a manner, as if half-afraid to diſoblige me [Another happy effect of the overheard converſation].

who loves to plague the man who puts himſelf in her power.—But I could not do thus by ſuch an angel as this, did I not believe, that after her probation-time is expired, and if there is no bringing her to <hi>cohabitation</hi> (my darling view), I ſhall reward her as ſhe wiſhes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Saturday</hi> is half-over, equally happy—Preparing for the play—Polly has offer'd, and is accepted. I have directed her where to weep—And this not only to ſhew her humanity [a weeping eye indicates a gentle heart], but to have a pretence to hide her face with her fan or handkerchief; yet Polly is far from being every man's girl—And we ſhall ſit in the gallery green-box.</p>
               <p>The woes of others ſo well repreſented, as thoſe of Belvidera particularly will be, muſt, I hope, unlock and open my charmer's heart. Whenever I have been able to prevail upon a girl to permit me to attend her to a play, I have thought myſelf ſure of her. The fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male heart, all gentleneſs and harmony, when obliged, expands, and forgets its forms, when attention is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried out of itſelf at an agreeable or affecting enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment: Muſic, and perhaps a collation after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, co-operating. I have no hope of ſuch an effect here; but I have more than one end to anſwer, by my earneſtneſs in getting her to a play. To name but one: Dorcas has a maſter-key, as I have told thee—And it were worth carrying her to <hi>Venice pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,</hi> were it but to ſhew her, that there have been, and may be, much deeper diſtreſſes than ſhe can poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly know.</p>
               <p>Thus exceedingly happy are we at preſent. I hope we ſhall not find any of Nat. Lee's left-handed gods at work, to daſh our bowl of joy with wormwood.</p>
               <p>The Lady, in her next letter, dated Friday, May 19. acquaints her friend, that her proſpects are once more mended; and that ſhe has known four-and-twenty hours together, ſince her laſt, not unhappy

               </p>
               <p>She then gives the particulars of the converſation which ſhe had overheard between Mr. Lovelace, Mrs. Sinclair, and Miſs Martin; but accounts more minutely than he had done, for the opportunity ſhe had of overhearing it, unknown to them.</p>

               <p>She thought herſelf obliged, ſhe ſays, from what paſſed between them on Wedneſday, and from what ſhe overheard him ſay, to conſent to go with him to the play; eſpecially, as he had the diſcretion to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe one of the nieces to accompany her.</p>

               <p>I Did not know, my dear, that you deferred giving an anſwer to Mr. Lovelace's propoſals, till you had my opinion of them. A particular hand occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionally going to town, will leave this at Wilſon's, that no delay may be made on that account.</p>
               <p>I never had any doubt of the man's juſtice and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity in matters of ſettlement; and all his relations are as noble in their ſpirits, as in their deſcent: But <hi>now,</hi> it may not be amiſs for you to wait, to ſee what returns my Lord makes to his letter of invitation.</p>
               <p>The ſcheme I think of is this.</p>
               <p>There is a perſon (I believe you have ſeen her with me), one Mrs. Townſend, who is a great dealer in Indian ſilks, Bruſſels and French laces, cambricks, linen, and other valuable goods; which ſhe has a way of coming at, duty-free; and has a great vead for them, and for other curioſities which ſhe imports, in the private families of the gentry round us.</p>
               <p>She has her days of being in town, and then is at a chamber ſhe rents in an inn in Southwark, where ſhe has patterns of all her ſilks, and much of her port<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able goods, for the conveniency of her London cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomers. But her place of reſidence, and where ſhe has her principal warehouſe, is at Deptford, for the opportunity of getting her goods on ſhore.</p>
               <p>She was firſt brought to me by my mother, to whom ſhe was recommended, on the ſuppoſal of my ſpeedy
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:0447200104:111"/>
marriage; that I might have an opportunity to be as fine as a princeſs, was my mamma's expreſſion, at a moderate expence.</p>
               <p>Now, my dear, I muſt own, that I do not love to encourage theſe contraband traders. What is it, but bidding defiance to the laws of our country, when we do; and hurting fair traders; and at the ſame time robbing our Prince of his legal due, to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution of thoſe duties which poſſibly muſt be made good by new levies upon the whole public?</p>
               <p>But, however, Mrs. Townſend and I, though we have not yet dealt, are upon a very good foot of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. She is a ſenſible woman; ſhe has been abroad, and often goes abroad, in the way of her bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs; and gives very entertaining accounts of all ſhe has ſeen. And having applied to me, to recommend her to you (as it is her view to be known to young ladies, who are likely to change their condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion), I am ſure I can engage her to give you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection at her houſe at Deptford; which ſhe ſays is a populous village; and one of the laſt, I ſhould think, that you would be ſought for in. She is not much there, you will believe, by the courſe of her dealings; but, no doubt, muſt have ſomebody on the ſpot, in whom ſhe can confide: And there perhaps you might be ſafe, till your couſin comes. And I ſhould not think it amiſs, that you write to him out of hand. I cannot ſuggeſt to you what you ſhould write. That muſt be left to your own diſcretion. For you will be afraid, no doubt, of the conſequence of a variance between the two men.</p>
               <p>I will think further of this ſcheme of mine, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to Mrs. Townſend, if you find it neceſſary that I ſhould. But I hope there will be no occaſion to do ſo, ſince your proſpects ſeem to be changed, and that you have had <hi>twenty-four-not unhappy hours together.</hi> How my indignation riſes for this poor conſolation in the courtſhip (<hi>courtſhip</hi> muſt I call it?) of ſuch a lady!</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="105" facs="tcp:0447200104:112"/>Mrs. Townſend, as I have recollected, has two brothers, each a maſter of a veſſel; and who knows, as ſhe and they have great concerns together, but that, in caſe of need, you may have a whole ſhip's crew at your devotion? If he give your cauſe to leave him, take no thought for the people at Harlowe-place. Let them take care of one another. It is a care they are <hi>uſed</hi> to. The Law will help to ſecure them. The wretch is no aſſaſſin; no night-murderer. He is an <hi>open,</hi> becauſe a <hi>fearleſs</hi> enemy; and ſhould he attempt any thing that ſhould make him obnoxious to the Laws of ſociety, you might have a fair riddance of him either by flight or the gallows; no matter which.</p>
               <p>Had you not been ſo minute in your account of the circumſtances that attended the opportunity you had of overhearing the dialogue between Mr. Lovelace and two of the women, I ſhould have thought the conference contrived on purpoſe for your ears.</p>
               <p>I ſhew'd Mr. Lovelace's propoſals to Mr. Hick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who had chambers once at Lincoln's-Inn, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſigned for the Law, had his elder brother lived. He looked ſo wiſe, ſo proud, and ſo important, upon the occaſion; and wanted to take ſo much conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion about them—would take them home if I pleaſed—and weigh them well—and ſo-forth—and the like—and all that—that I had no patience with him, and ſnatched them back with anger.</p>
               <p>O dear!—to be ſo angry, and pleaſe me, for his zeal—</p>
               <p>Yes, zeal without knowlege, I ſaid—like moſt other zeals—If there were no objections that ſtruck him at once, there were none.</p>
               <p>So <hi>haſty,</hi> deareſt Madam!—</p>
               <p>And ſo <hi>ſlow,</hi> un-deareſt Sir, I could have ſaid—But, SURELY, ſaid I, with a look which imply'd, <hi>Would you rebel, Sir!</hi>—</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="106" facs="tcp:0447200104:113"/>He begged my pardon—<hi>Saw</hi> no objection, indeed!—But might he be allowed once more—</p>
               <p>No matter—No matter—I would have ſhewn them to my mother, I ſaid, who, tho' of no Inn of Court, knew more of theſe things than half the lounging lub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of them; and that at firſt ſight—only that ſhe would have been provoking upon the confeſſion of our continued correſpondence.</p>
               <p>But, my dear, let the articles be drawn up, and ingroſſed; and ſolemnize upon them; and there's no more to be ſaid.</p>
               <p>Let me add, that the ſailor fellow has been tamper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with my Kitty, and offered a bribe, to find where to direct to you. Next time he comes, I will have him drawn through one of our deepeſt fiſh-ponds, if I can get nothing out of him. His attempt to corrupt a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of mine will juſtify my orders.</p>
               <p>I ſend this away directly. But will follow it by another; which ſhall have for its ſubject only my Mother, Myſelf, and your uncle Antony. And as your proſpects are more promiſing than they have been, I will endeavour to make you ſmile upon this occaſion. For you will be pleaſed to know, that my mamma has had a formal tender from that grey gooſe; which may make her ſkill uſeful to herſelf, were ſhe to encourage it.</p>

                     <p>NOW, my dear, for the promiſed ſubject. You muſt not aſk me, how I came by the <hi>originals</hi> (ſuch they really are) that I am going to preſent you with: For my mamma would not read to me thoſe

parts of your uncle's letter, which bore hard upon myſelf, and which leave him without any title to mercy from me: Nor would ſhe let me hear but what ſhe pleaſed of hers in anſwer; for ſhe has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcended to anſwer him; with a denial, however:—But ſuch a denial, as no-one but an <hi>old batchelor</hi> would take from a widow.</p>
                     <p>Any-body, except myſelf, who could have been acquainted with ſuch a fal-lal courtſhip as this muſt have been had it proceeded, would have been glad it had gone on; and I dare ſay, but for the ſaucy daughter, it had. My mamma, in that caſe, would have been ten years the younger for it, perhaps: And could I but have approved of it, I ſhould have been conſidered as if ten years older than I am: Since, very likely, it would then have been:

Then would my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour to Mr. Hickman have been better liked; and my mother would have bridled like her daughter!</p>
                     <p>O my dear, how we might have been diverted, by the practiſings for recovery of the <hi>Long-forgottens!</hi> could I have been ſure that it would have been in my power to have put them aſunder, in the Iriſh ſtile, <hi>before they had come together.</hi> But there's no truſting to a widow whoſe goods and chattels are in her own hands, addreſſed by an old batchelor, who has fine things, and offers to leave her ten thouſand pounds better than he found her, and ſole miſtreſs beſides, of all her <hi>Notables!</hi> for theſe, as you'll ſee by-and-by, are his propoſals.</p>

                           <p>I Did make a ſort of reſolution ten years ago, never to marry. I ſaw in other families, where they lived <hi>beſt,</hi> you'll be pleaſed to mark that, <hi>queerneſſes</hi> I could not away with. Then, liked well enough to live ſingle for ſake of my brother's family; and for one child in it, more than the reſt. But that girl has turned us all off of the hinges: And why I ſhould deny myſelf any comforts for them as will not thank me for ſo doing, I don't know.</p>
                           <p>So much for my motives, as from ſelf and family: But the dear Mrs. Howe makes me go further.</p>
                           <p>I have a very great fortune, I bleſs God for it, all of my own getting, or <hi>moſt</hi> of it; you'll be pleaſed to mark that; for I was the younger brother of three. You have alſo, God be thanked, a great eſtate, which you have improved by your own frugality and wiſe management. Frugality, let me ſtop to ſay, is one of the greateſt virtues in this mortal life, becauſe it enables us to do juſtice to <hi>all,</hi> and puts it in our power to benefit <hi>ſome</hi> by it, as we ſee they <hi>deſerve.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>You have but one child; and I am a batchelor, and have never a one.—All batchelors cannot ſay ſo: Wherefore your daughter may be the better for me,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:0447200104:116"/>
if ſhe will keep up with my humour; which was never thought bad: Eſpecially to my equals. Servants, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, I don't matter being angry with, when I pleaſe: They are paid for bearing it, and too-too often de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it; as we have very frequently taken notice of to one another. But this won't hurt neither you nor Miſs.</p>
                           <p>I will make very advantageous ſettlements; ſuch as any common friend ſhall judge to be ſo. But muſt have all in my own power, while I live: Becauſe, you know, Madam, it is as creditable to the wife, as the huſband, that it ſhould be ſo.</p>
                           <p>I aim not at fine words. We are not children; tho' it is hoped we may have ſome; for I am a very healthy ſound man, I bleſs God for it: And never brought home from my voyages and travels, a worſer conſtitution than I took out with me. I was none of thoſe, I will aſſure you. But this I will undertake, that if you are the ſurvivreſs, you ſhall be at <hi>the leaſt</hi> ten thouſand pounds the better for me: What, in the contrary caſe, I ſhall be the better for you, I leave to you, as you ſhall think my kindneſs to you ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve.</p>
                           <p>But one thing, Madam, I ſhould be glad of, that Miſs Howe might not live with us then (She need not know I write thus)—But go home to Mr. Hickman, as ſhe is upon the point of marriage, I hear. And if ſhe behaves dutifully, as ſhe ſhould do, to us both, ſhe ſhall be the better; for ſo I ſaid before.</p>
                           <p>You ſhall manage all things, both mine and your own; for I know little of land-matters. All my op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to you ſhall be out of love, when I think you take too much upon you for your health.</p>
                           <p>It will be very pretty for you, I ſhould think, to have a man of experience, in a long winter's evening, to ſit down and tell you ſtories of foreign parts, and the cuſtoms of the nations he has conſorted with. And I have fine curioſities of the Indian growth; ſuch as
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:0447200104:117"/>
ladies love, and ſome that even my niece Clary, when ſhe was good, never ſaw. Theſe, one by one, as you are kind to me (which I make no queſtion of, becauſe I ſhall be kind to you) ſhall all be yours.—Prettier en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment by much, than ſitting with a too ſmartiſh daughter, ſometimes out of humour, and thwarting, and vexing, as daughters will, when women-grown eſpecially (as I have heard you often obſerve); and thinking their parents old, without paying them the reverence due to years; when, as in your caſe, I make no ſort of doubt, they are young enough to wipe their noſes. You underſtand me, Madam.</p>
                           <p>As for me myſelf, it will be very happy, and I am delighted with the thinking of it, to have, after a pleaſant ride, or ſo, a lady of like experience with my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, to come home to, and but one intereſt betwixt us: To reckon up our comings-in together; and what this day and this week has produced:—O how this will increaſe love!—Moſt mightily will it increaſe it!—And I believe I ſhould never love you enough or be able to ſhew you all my love.</p>

                     <p>Here's a letter of courtſhip, my dear!—And let me ſubjoin to it, that if now, or hereafter, I ſhould treat this hideous lover, who is ſo free with me to my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, with aſperity, and you ſhould be diſguſted at it; I ſhall think you don't give me that preference in your love, which you have in mine.</p>
                     <p>And now, which ſhall I firſt give you; the anſwer of my mamma; or, the dialogue that paſſed between the widow-mother and the pert daughter, upon her letting the latter know that ſhe had a letter?</p>
                     <p>I <hi>think</hi> you ſhall have the <hi>dialogue.</hi> But let me premiſe one thing; that if you <hi>think</hi> me too free, you muſt not let it run in your head, that I am writing of <hi>your</hi> uncle, or of <hi>my</hi> mother: But of a couple of old lovers, no matter whom.

                     <p>IT is not uſual, I believe, for our Sex to anſwer by pen and ink, the firſt letter on theſe occaſions. The <hi>firſt</hi> letter!—How odd is that!—As if I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected another; which I do not.—But then, I think, as I do not judge proper to encourage your propoſal, there is no reaſon why I ſhould not anſwer in civility, where ſo great a civility is intended. Indeed I was always of opinion, that a perſon was intitled to That, and not to ill-uſage, becauſe he had a reſpect for me. And ſo I have often and often told my daughter.</p>
                     <p>A woman, I think, makes but a poor figure in a man's eye afterwards, and does no reputation to her Sex neither, when ſhe behaves like a tyrant to him beforehand.</p>

them only; and deny themſelves every thing for their ſakes. I know Nancy could not bear a father-in-law. She would fly at the very thought of my being in earneſt to give her one. Not that I ſtand in fear of my daughter neither: It is not fit I ſhould. But ſhe has her poor papa's ſpirit: A very violent one, that was—And one would not chooſe, you know, Sir, to enter into any affair, that, one knows, one muſt renounce a daughter for, or ſhe a mother.—Except indeed one's heart were much in it;—which, I bleſs God, mine is not.</p>
                     <p>I have now been a widow theſe ten years; nobody to controul me:—And I am ſaid not to bear controul: So, Sir, you and I are beſt as we are, I believe—nay, I am ſure of it—For we want not what either has;—having both more than we know what to do with. And I know I could not be in the leaſt accountable for any of my ways.</p>
                     <p>My daughter indeed, tho' ſhe is a fine girl, as girls go [She has too much ſenſe indeed for her ſex; and knows ſhe has it], is more a check to me than one would wiſh a daughter to be—For one would not be always ſnapping at each other: But ſhe will ſoon be married; and then, not living together, we ſhall only come together when we are pleaſed, and ſtay away when we are not; and ſo, like other lovers, never ſee any thing but the beſt ſides of each other.</p>
                     <p>I own, for all this, that I love her dearly; and ſhe me, I dare ſay. So would not wiſh to provoke her to do otherwiſe. Beſides, the girl is ſo much regarded every-where, that having lived ſo much of my prime a widow, I would not lay myſelf open to her cenſures, or even to her indifference, you know.</p>
                     <p>Your generous propoſal requires all this explicit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. I thank you for your good opinion of me.

and I may, with your permiſſion, come to ſee your fine things; for I am a great admirer of rarities that come from abroad.</p>
                     <p>So, Sir, let us only converſe occaſionally as we meet, as we uſed to do, without any other view to each other, than good wiſhes: Which I hope may not be leſſen'd for this declining. And then I ſhall always think myſelf</p>

               <p>I AM too much diſturbed in my mind, to think of any think but revenge; or I had intended to give thee an account of Miſs Harlowe's curious obſervations on the play. <hi>Miſs Harlowe's,</hi> I ſay. Thou knoweſt that I hate the name of <hi>Harlowe</hi>; and I am exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly out of humour with her, and with her ſaucy friend.</p>
               <p>What's the matter <hi>now,</hi> thou'lt aſk?—Matter enough; for while we were at the play, Dorcas, who had her orders, and a key to her lady's chamber, as well as a maſter-key to her drawers and mahogany cheſt, cloſet-key and all, found means to come at ſome of Miſs Howe's laſt-written letters. The vigilant wench was directed to them by ſeeing her lady take a letter out of her ſtays, and put it to the others, before ſhe went out with me—Afraid, as the women up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braidingly tell me, that I ſhould find it there.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="124" facs="tcp:0447200104:131"/>Dorcas no ſooner found them, than ſhe aſſembled three ready writers of the <hi>non-apparents,</hi> and Sally, and ſhe and they employed themſelves with the utmoſt diligence, in making extracts, according to former directions, from theſe curſed letters, for my uſe. <hi>Curſed,</hi> I may well call them—Such abuſes, ſuch virulence! O this little fury Miſs Howe!—Well might her ſaucy friend (who has been equally free with me, or the occaſion could not have been given) be ſo violent as ſhe lately was, at my endeavouring to come at one of theſe letters.</p>
               <p>I was ſure, that this fair-one, at ſo early an age, with a conſtitution ſo firm, health ſo blooming, eyes ſo ſparkling, could not be abſolutely, and from her own vigilance, ſo guarded and ſo apprehenſive, as I have found her to be.—Sparkling eyes, Jack, when the poetical tribe have ſaid all they can for them, are an infallible ſign of a rogue, or room for a rogue, in the heart.</p>
               <p>Thou may'ſt go on with thy preachments, and Lord M. with his Wiſdom of nations, I am now more aſſured of her than ever. And now my revenge is up, and join'd with my love, all reſiſtance muſt fall before it. And moſt ſolemnly do I ſwear, that Miſs Howe ſhall come in for her ſnack.</p>
               <p>And here, juſt now, is another letter brought from the ſame little virulent devil.—I hope to procure tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcripts from that too, very ſpeedily, if it be put to the reſt; for the ſaucy lady is reſolved to go to church this morning; not ſo much from a ſpirit of devotion, I have reaſon to think, as to try whether ſhe can go out without check or controul, or my attendance.</p>
               <p>I HAVE been denied breakfaſting with her. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſhe was a little diſpleaſed with me laſt night; becauſe, on our return from the play, I obliged her to paſs the reſt of the night with the women and me, in their parlour, and to ſtay till near One. She told
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:0447200104:132"/>
me at parting, that ſhe expected to have the whole next day to herſelf.—I had not read the extracts then; ſo was all affectionate reſpect, awe, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; for I had reſolved to begin a new courſe, and, if poſſible, to baniſh all jealouſy and ſuſpicion from her heart: And yet I had no reaſon to be much troubled at her paſt ſuſpicions; ſince, if a woman will continue with a man whom ſhe ſuſpects, when ſhe can get from him, or <hi>thinks</hi> ſhe can, I am ſure it is a very hopeful ſign.</p>
               <p>SHE is gone. Slipt down before I was aware. She had ordered a chair, on purpoſe to exclude my per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal attendance. But I had taken proper precau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Will. attended her by conſent; Peter, the houſe-ſervant, was within Will.'s call.</p>
               <p>I had, by Dorcas, repreſented her danger from Single<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, in order to diſſuade her from going at all, unleſs ſhe allowed me to attend her; but I was anſwer'd, That if there was no cauſe of fear at the playhouſe, when there were but <hi>two</hi> playhouſes, ſurely there was leſs at church, when there were ſo <hi>many</hi> churches. The chairmen were ordered to carry her to St. James's church.</p>
               <p>But ſhe would not be ſo careleſs of obliging me, if ſhe knew what I have already come at, and how the women urge me on; for they are continually com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining of the reſtraint they lie under; in their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour; in their attendance; neglecting all their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns in the front-houſe; and keeping this elegant back one intirely free from company, that ſhe may have no ſuſpicion of them. They doubt not my generoſity, they ſay: But <hi>why</hi> for my own ſake, in Lord M.'s ſtyle, <hi>ſhould I make ſo long a harveſt of ſo little corn?</hi>—Women, ye reaſon well. I think I will begin my operations the moment ſhe comes in.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="126" facs="tcp:0447200104:133"/>I HAVE come at the letter brought her from Miſs Howe to-day.—Plot, conjuration, ſorcery, witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft, all going forward!—I ſhall not be able to ſee this <hi>Miſs Harlowe</hi> with patience. As the nymphs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low ſay, Why is <hi>night</hi> neceſſary?—And Sally and Polly upbraidingly remind me of my firſt attempts upon themſelves.—Yet force anſwers not my end—And yet it may, if there be truth in that part of the libertines creed, <hi>That once ſubdued, is always ſubdued!</hi> And what woman anſwers <hi>affirmatively</hi> to the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion?</p>
               <p>SHE is returned—But refuſes to admit me. Deſires to have the day to herſelf. Dorcas tells me, that ſhe believes her denial is from motives of piety—Oons, Jack, is there impiety in ſeeing me!—Would it not be the higheſt act of piety, to reclaim me? And is this to be done by her refuſing to ſee me, when ſhe is in a devouter frame than uſual? But I hate her, hate her heartily!—She is old, ugly, and deformed.—But O the blaſphemy!—Yet ſhe is an Harlowe—And I hate her for that.</p>
               <p>But ſince I muſt not ſee her [She will be miſtreſs of her <hi>own will,</hi> and of her <hi>time</hi> truly!], let me fill up mine, by telling thee what I have come at.</p>
               <p>The firſt letter the women met with, is dated April 27 <note n="(a)" place="bottom">See Vol. <hi>III.</hi> Letter <hi>lxii.</hi> p. <hi>297.</hi>
                  </note>. Where can ſhe have put the preceding ones? It mentions Mr. Hickman as a buſy fellow be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them. Hickman had beſt take care of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. She ſays in it, <hi>I hope you have no cauſe to repent returning my Norris—It is forthcoming on demand.</hi> Now, what the devil can this mean!—Her Norris forthcoming on demand!—The devil take me, if I am <hi>out-Norris'd!</hi>—If ſuch innocents can allow them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to plot, to <hi>Norris,</hi> well may I.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="127" facs="tcp:0447200104:134"/>She is ſorry, that <hi>her Hannah can't be with her.</hi>—And what if ſhe could?—What could Hannah do for her in ſuch a houſe as this?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The women in the houſe are to be found out in one breakfaſting.</hi> The women are enraged at both the correſpondents for this; and more than ever make a point of conquering her. I had a good mind to give them Miſs Howe in full property. Say but the word, Jack, and it ſhall be done.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She is glad that Miſs Harlowe had thoughts of take<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me at my word. She wondered I did not offer again.</hi> Adviſes her, if I don't ſoon, <hi>not to ſtay with me.</hi> Cautions her <hi>to keep me at diſtance; not to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the leaſt familiarity</hi>—See, Jack—See Belford—Exactly as I thought!—Her vigilance all owing to a cool friend; who can ſit down quietly, and give that advice, which, in her own caſe, ſhe could not take.—She tells her, <hi>it is my intereſt to be honeſt</hi>—INTEREST, fools!—I thought theſe girls knew, that my <hi>intereſt</hi> was ever ſubſervient to my <hi>pleaſure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What would I give to come at the copies of the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to which thoſe of Miſs Howe are anſwers!</p>
               <p>The next letter is dated May 3 <note n="(a)" place="bottom">See Vol. <hi>III.</hi> Letter <hi>lxix.</hi> p. <hi>332.</hi>
                  </note>. In this the little termagant expreſſes her aſtoniſhment, that her mother ſhould write to Miſs Harlowe, to forbid her to correſpond with her daughter. Mr. Hickman, ſhe ſays, is of opinion, <hi>that ſhe ought not to obey her mother.</hi> How the creeping fellow trims between both! I am afraid, that I muſt puniſh him, as well as this virago; and I have a ſcheme rumbling in my head, that wants but half an hour's muſing to bring into form, that will do my buſineſs upon both. I cannot bear, that the parental authority ſhould be thus deſpiſed, thus trampled under-foot—But obſerve the vixen, <hi>'Tis well he is of her opinion; for her mother having ſet her up, ſhe muſt have ſomebody to quarrel with.</hi>—Could a Love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace have allowed himſelf a greater licence? This
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:0447200104:135"/>
girl's a deviliſh rake in her heart. Had ſhe been a man, and one of us, ſhe'd have outdone us all in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize and ſpirit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She wants but very little farther provocation,</hi> ſhe ſays, <hi>to fly privately to London. And if ſhe does, ſhe will not leave her till ſhe ſees her either honourably married, or quit of the wretch.</hi> Here, Jack, the tranſcriber Sally has added a prayer—
<q rend="inline margQuotes">'For the Lord's ſake, dear Mr. Lovelace, get this fury to London!'</q>
—Her fate, I can tell thee, Jack, if we had her among us, ſhould not be ſo long deciding as her friend's. What a gant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lope would ſhe run, when I had done with her, among a dozen of her own pityleſs Sex, whom my charmer ſhall never ſee!—But more of this anon.</p>
               <p>I find by this letter, that my ſaucy captive had been drawing the characters of every varlet of ye. Nor am I ſpared in it more than you. <hi>The man's a fool, to be ſure, my dear.</hi> Let me die, if they either of them find me one. <hi>A ſilly fellow, at leaſt.</hi> Curſed contemptible!—<hi>I ſee not but they are a ſet of infern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als</hi>—There's for thee, Belford—<hi>and he the Beelzebub.</hi> There's for thee, Lovelace!—And yet ſhe would have her friend marry a Beelzebub.—And what have any of us done, to the knowlege of Miſs Harlowe, that ſhe ſhould give ſuch an account of us, as ſhould war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant ſo much abuſe from Miſs Howe?—But that's to come!</p>
               <p>She blames her, for <hi>not admitting Miſs Partington to her bed—Watchful as you are, what could have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd?—If violence were intended, he would not ſtay for the night.</hi> Sally writes upon this hint—
<q rend="inline margQuotes">'See, Sir, what is expected from you. An hundred and an hundred times have we told you of this.'</q>
—And ſo they have. But, to be ſure, the advice from them was not of half the efficacy as it will be from Miſs Howe.—<hi>You might have ſat up after her, or not gone to bed.</hi> But can there be ſuch apprehenſions between them, yet the one adviſe her to ſtay, and the other
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:0447200104:136"/>
reſolve to wait my imperial motion for marriage? I am glad I know that.</p>
               <p>She approves of my propoſal about Mrs. Fretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville's houſe. She puts her upon expecting ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; upon naming a day: And concludes, with inſiſting upon her writing, notwithſtanding her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's prohibition; or bids her <hi>take the conſequence.</hi> Undutiful wretches!</p>
               <p>Thou wilt ſay to thyſelf, by this time, And can this proud and inſolent girl be the ſame Miſs Howe, who ſighed for honeſt Sir George Colmar; and who, but for this her beloved friend, would have followed him in all his broken fortunes, when he was obliged to quit the kingdom?</p>
               <p>Yes, ſhe is the very ſame. And I always found in others, as well as in myſelf, that a firſt paſſion thoroughly ſubdued, made the conqueror of it a rover; the conquereſs a tyrant.</p>
               <p>Well, but now, comes mincing in a letter from one who has <hi>the honour of dear Miſs Howe's commands</hi> 
                  <note n="(a)" place="bottom">See Vol. <hi>III.</hi> Letter <hi>lxxi.</hi> p. <hi>337.</hi>
                  </note>, to acquaint Miſs Harlowe, that Miſs Howe is <hi>exceſſively concerned for the concern ſhe has given her.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>

               <p>In another letter <note n="(a)" place="bottom">Letter <hi>iv.</hi> p. <hi>19.</hi> of this Vol.</note>, <hi>She approves of her deſign to leave me, if ſhe can be received by her friends.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Has heard ſome ſtrange ſtories of me, that ſhew me to be the worſt of men. Had I a dozen lives, I might have forfeited them all twenty crimes ago.</hi>—An odd way of reckoning, Jack!</p>
               <p>Miſs Betterton, Miſs Lockyer, are named—<hi>The man</hi> (ſo ſhe irreverently calls me!), ſhe ſays, <hi>is a vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain.</hi> Let me periſh if I am called a villain for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing!—She <hi>will have her uncle</hi> (as Miſs Harlowe deſires) <hi>ſounded about receiving her. Dorcas is to be attach'd to her intereſt: My letters are to be come at by ſurprize or trick</hi>—See, Jack!</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She is alarmed at my attempt to come at a letter of hers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Were I to come at the knowlege of her freedoms with my character,</hi> ſhe ſays, <hi>ſhe ſhould be afraid to ſtir out without a guard.</hi>—I would adviſe the vixen to get her guard ready.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I am at the head of a gang of wretches</hi> [Thee, Jack, and thy brother varlets, ſhe owns ſhe means], <hi>who join together to betray innocent creatures, and to ſupport one another in their villainies.</hi>—What ſayeſt thou to this, Belford?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She wonders not at her melancholy reflections for meeting me, for being forced upon me, and tricked by me.</hi>—I hope, Jack, thou'lt have done preaching after this!</p>
               <p>But ſhe comforts her, <hi>that ſhe will be both a warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and example to all her Sex.</hi>—I hope the Sex will thank me for this.</p>
               <p>The nymphs had not time, they ſay, to tranſcribe all that was worthy of my reſentment in this letter—
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:0447200104:138"/>
So I muſt find an opportunity to come at it myſelf. Noble rant, they ſay, it contains.—But I am a <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducer,</hi> and a hundred vile fellows, in it—<hi>And the devil,</hi> it ſeems, <hi>took poſſeſſion of my heart, and of the hearts of all her friends, in the ſame dark hour, in order to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke her to meet me.</hi> Again, <hi>There is a fate in her error,</hi> ſhe ſays—Why then ſhould ſhe grieve?—<hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity is her ſhining-time,</hi> and I cannot tell what—Yet never to thank the man to whom ſhe owes the <hi>ſhine!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the next <note n="(a)" place="bottom">Letter <hi>x.</hi> p. <hi>37.</hi>
                  </note>, Wicked as I am, <hi>ſhe fears I muſt be her lord and maſter.</hi>—I hope ſo.</p>
               <p>She retracts what ſhe ſaid againſt me in her laſt.—My behaviour to my Roſebud; Miſs Harlowe to take poſſeſſion of Mrs. Fretchville's houſe; I to ſtay at Mrs. Sinclair's; the ſtake I have in my country; my reverſions; my oeconomy; my perſon; my addreſs; all are brought in my favour, to induce her now <hi>not</hi> to leave me. How do I love to puzzle theſe <hi>long</hi>-ſighted girls!</p>
               <p>Yet <hi>my teazing ways,</hi> it ſeems, <hi>are intolerable.</hi>—Are women only to teaze, I trow?—The Sex may thank themſelves for learning me to out-teaze them. So the headſtrong Charles XII. of Sweden learned the Czar Peter to beat him, by continuing a war with the Muſcovites againſt the antient maxims of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>May eternal vengeance</hi> PURSUE <hi>the villain</hi> [Thank heaven, ſhe does not ſay <hi>overtake], if he give room to doubt his honour!</hi>—Women can't ſwear, Jack—Sweet ſouls! they can only curſe.</p>
               <p>I am ſaid, <hi>to doubt her love.</hi>—Have I not reaſon? And ſhe, <hi>to doubt my ardor?</hi>—Ardor, Jack!—Why, 'tis very right—Women, as Miſs Howe ſays, and as every Rake knows, love ardors!</p>
               <p>She apprizes her of the <hi>ill ſucceſs of the application made to her uncle.</hi>—By Hickman, no doubt!—I muſt
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:0447200104:139"/>
have this fellow's ears in my pocket, very quickly, believe.</p>
               <p>She ſays, <hi>She is equally ſhocked and enraged againſt all her family: Mrs. Norton's weight has been try'd upon Mrs. Harlowe, as well as Mr. Hickman's upon the uncle: But never were there,</hi> ſays the vixen, <hi>ſuch determin'd brutes in the world. Her uncle concludes her ruin'd already.</hi>—Is not that a call upon me, as well as a reproach?—<hi>They all expected applications from her when in diſtreſs—but were reſolved not to ſtir an inch to ſave her life.</hi> She was <hi>accuſed of premedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and contrivance.</hi> Miſs Howe is <hi>concerned,</hi> ſhe tells her, <hi>for the revenge my pride may put me upon taking for the diſtance ſhe has kept me at.</hi>—And well ſhe may.—<hi>She has now but one choice</hi> [for her couſin Morden, it ſeems, is ſet againſt her too], <hi>and that's to be mine.</hi>—An act of neceſſity, of convenience.—Thy friend, Jack, to be already made a woman's conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience!—Is this to be borne by a Lovelace?</p>
               <p>I ſhall make great uſe of this letter. From Miſs Howe's hints of what paſſed between her uncle Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe and Hickman [It muſt be Hickman], I can give room for my <hi>invention</hi> to play; for ſhe tells her, that <hi>ſhe will not reveal all.</hi> I muſt endeavour to come at this letter myſelf; I muſt have the very words; extracts will not do. This letter, when I have it, muſt be my compaſs to ſteer by.</p>
               <p>The fire of friendſhip then blazes out and crackles. I never before imagin'd, that ſo fervent a friendſhip could ſubſiſt between two ſiſter-beauties, both toaſts. But even here it may be inflamed by oppoſition, and by that contradiction which gives ſpirit to female ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of a warm and romantic turn.</p>
               <p>She raves about <hi>coming up, if by ſo doing ſhe could prevent ſo noble a creature from ſtooping too low, or ſave her from ruin</hi>—One reed to ſupport another! Theſe girls are frenzical in their friendſhip. They know not what a ſteady fire is.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="133" facs="tcp:0447200104:140"/>How comes it to paſs, that I cannot help being pleaſed with this virago's ſpirit, tho' I ſuffer by it? Had I her but here, I'd engage in a week's time, to teach her ſubmiſſion without reſerve. What pleaſure ſhould I have in breaking ſuch a ſpirit! I ſhould wiſh for her but for one month, in all, I think. She would be too tame and ſpiritleſs for me after that. How ſweetly pretty to ſee the two lovely friends, when humbled and tame, both ſitting in the darkeſt corner of a room, arm in arm, weeping and ſobbing for each other!—And I their emperor, their then <hi>acknowleged</hi> emperor, reclined on a ſophee, in the ſame room, Grand Signor like, uncertain to which I ſhould firſt throw out my handkerchief?</p>
               <p>Mind the girl: <hi>She is enraged at the Harlowes:</hi> She <hi>is angry at her own mother; ſhe is exaſperated againſt her fooliſh and low-vanity'd Lovelace.</hi>—FOOLISH, a little toad! [God forgive me for calling a virtuous girl a toad!] <hi>Let us ſtoop to lift the wretch out of his dirt, tho' we ſoil our fingers in doing it! He has not been guilty of direct indecency to you.</hi>—It ſeems <hi>extraordinary</hi> to Miſs Howe that I have not.—<hi>Nor dare he</hi>—She ſhould be ſure of that. If women have ſuch things in their heads, why ſhould not I in my heart?—<hi>Not ſo much of a devil as that comes to neither. Such villainous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions would have ſhewn themſelves before now, if I had them.</hi>—Lord help them!—</p>
               <p>She then puts her friend upon urging for <hi>ſettlements, licence,</hi> and ſo forth.—<hi>No room for delicacy now,</hi> ſhe ſays.—And tells her what ſhe ſhall ſay, to <hi>bring all forward from me.</hi>—Doſt think, Jack, that I ſhould not have carried my point long ago, but for this vixen?—She <hi>reproaches her for having</hi> MODESTY'D-<hi>away,</hi> as ſhe calls it, <hi>more than one opportunity, that ſhe ought not to have ſlipt.</hi>—Thus thou ſeeſt, that the nobleſt of the Sex mean nothing in the world by their ſhyneſs and diſtance, but to pound a poor fellow, whom they diſlike not, when he comes into their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  <pb n="134" facs="tcp:0447200104:141"/>Annexed to this letter is a paper the moſt ſaucy that ever was wrote of a mother by a daughter. There are in it ſuch free reflections upon widows and batchel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors, that I cannot but wonder how Miſs Howe came by her learning. Sir George Colmar, I can tell thee, was a greater fool than thy friend, if ſhe had it all for nothing.</p>
               <p>The contents of this paper acquaints Miſs Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe, that her uncle Antony has been making pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals of marriage to her mother. The old fellow's heart ought to be a tough one, if he ſucceed, or ſhe who broke that of a much worthier man, the late Mr. Howe, will ſoon get rid of him. But be this as it may, the ſtupid family is more irreconcileable than ever to their goddeſs-daughter, for old Antony's thoughts of marrying: So I am more ſecure of her than ever; ſince, as Miſs Howe ſays, <hi>ſhe can have but one choice now.</hi> Though this diſguſts my pride, yet I believe, at laſt, my tender heart will be moved in her favour. For I did not wiſh, that ſhe ſhould have nothing but perſecution and diſtreſs.—But why loves ſhe the <hi>brutes,</hi> as Miſs Howe juſtly calls them, ſo much; me ſo little?—But I have ſtill more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonable tranſcripts from other letters.</p>

               </p>
               <p>This indeed alarms me. Now the contention be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes arduous. Now wilt thou not wonder, if I let looſe my plotting genius upon them both. I will not be <hi>out-Norris'd,</hi> Belford.</p>

               <p>Mr. Lovelace then tranſcribes, from his ſhort-hand notes, that part of Miſs Howe's letter, which relates to the deſign of engaging Mrs. Townſend (in caſe of neceſſity) to give her protection till Colonel Morden comes <note n="(a)" place="bottom">

                     <p>I Was at the play laſt night with Mr. Lovelace and Miſs Horton. It is, you know, a deep and moſt affecting tragedy in the reading. You have my remarks upon it, in the little book you made me write upon the principal acting plays. You will not won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that Miſs Horton, as well as I, was greatly moved at the repreſentation, when I tell you, and have ſome pleaſure in telling you, that Mr. Lovelace himſelf was very ſenſibly touched with ſome of the moſt affecting ſcenes.

                     <p>HE was very earneſt to dine with me. But I was reſolved to carry this one ſmall point; and ſo denied to dine myſelf.

                     <p>He was very buſy in writing, Dorcas ſays, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued it without dining, becauſe I denied him my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.</p>

However, I repeated my promiſe to meet him as early as he pleaſed in the morning, or to breakfaſt with him.</p>
                     <p>Dorcas ſays, he raved. I heard him loud, and I heard his ſervant fly from him, as I thought. You, my deareſt friend, ſay, in one of yours <note n="(a)" place="bottom">

                     <p>HE has juſt ſent me word, that he inſiſts upon ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping with me. As we had been in a good train for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral days paſt, I thought it not prudent to break with him, for little matters. Yet, to be, in a manner, threaten'd into his will, I know not how to bear that.</p>
                     <p>WHILE I was conſidering, he came up, and, tapping at my door, told me, in a very angry tone, he muſt ſee

                     <p>I went down to wait that half-hour. All the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſet me hard to give her cauſe for this tyranny.

diſpoſed to be angry—But by the fierceneſs of mine, as my trembling hands ſeized hers, I ſoon made fear her predominant paſſion.

                     <p>NO generoſity in this lady. None at all. Wouldſt thou not have thought, that after I had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted her to withdraw, primed for miſchief as I was, that ſhe would meet me next morning early; and that with a ſmile; making me one of her beſt cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſies?</p>
                     <p>I was in the dining-room before ſix, expecting her. She opened not her door. I went up-ſtairs and down, and hemm'd, and called Will. called Dorcas: Threw the doors hard to; but ſtill ſhe opened not her door. Thus till half an hour after eight, fooled I away my time; and then, breakfaſt ready, I ſent Dorcas to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt her company.</p>
                     <p>But I was aſtoniſhed, when, following the wench at the firſt invitation, I ſaw her enter dreſſed, all but her gloves, and thoſe and her fan in her hand; in the
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:0447200104:153"/>
ſame moment, bidding Dorcas direct Will. to get her a chair to the door.</p>
                     <p>Cruel creature, thought I, to expoſe me thus to the deriſion of the women below!</p>
                     <p>Going abroad, Madam?</p>
                     <p>I am, Sir.</p>
                     <p>I looked curſed ſilly, I am ſure.—You will break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt firſt, I hope, Madam, in a very humble ſtrain: Yet with an hundred tenter-hooks in my heart.</p>
                     <p>Had ſhe given me more notice of her intention, I had perhaps wrought myſelf up to the frame I was in the day before, and begun my vengeance. And im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately came into my head all the virulence that had been tranſcribed for me from Miſs Howe's let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and in that I had tranſcribed myſelf.</p>
                     <p>Yes, ſhe would drink one diſh; and then laid her gloves and fan in the window juſt by.</p>
                     <p>I was perfectly diſconcerted. I hemm'd and haw'd, and was going to ſpeak ſeveral times; but knew not in what key. Who's modeſt now, thought I! Who's inſolent now!—How a tyrant of a woman confounds a baſhful man!—She was my Miſs Howe, I thought; and I the ſpiritleſs Hickman.</p>
                     <p>At laſt, I <hi>will</hi> begin, thought I.</p>
                     <p>She a diſh—I a diſh.</p>
                     <p>Sip, her eyes her own, ſhe; like an haughty and imperious ſovereign, conſcious of dignity, every look a favour.</p>
                     <p>Sip, like her vaſſal, I; lips and hands trembling, and not knowing that I ſipp'd or taſted.</p>
                     <p>I was—I was—Iffp'd—drawing in my breath and the liquor together, tho' I ſcalded my mouth with it—I was in hopes, Madam—</p>
                     <p>Dorcas came in juſt then.—Dorcas, ſaid ſhe, is a chair gone for?</p>
                     <p>Damn'd impertinence, thought I, putting me out of my ſpeech! And I was forced to wait for the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant's anſwer to the inſolent miſtreſs's queſtion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="147" facs="tcp:0447200104:154"/>William is gone for one, Madam.</p>
                     <p>This coſt me a minute's ſilence before I could be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin again.—And then it was with my hopes, and my hopes, and my hopes, that I ſhould have been early admitted to—</p>
                     <p>What weather is it, Dorcas? ſaid ſhe, as regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs of me, as if I had not been preſent.</p>
                     <p>A little lowering, Madam—The ſun is gone in—It was very fine half an hour ago.</p>
                     <p>I had no patience—Up I roſe. Down went the tea-cup, ſaucer and all.—Confound the weather, the ſunſhine, and the wench!—Begone for a devil, when I am ſpeaking to your lady, and have ſo little oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity given me.</p>
                     <p>Up roſe the lady, half frighted; and ſnatched from the window her gloves and fan.</p>
                     <p>You muſt not go, Madam!—By my ſoul, you muſt not—Taking her hand.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Muſt not,</hi> Sir!—But I muſt—You can curſe your maid in my abſence, as well as if I were preſent—Except—Except—you intend for <hi>me,</hi> what you di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect to <hi>her.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Deareſt creature, you muſt not go!—You muſt not leave me!—Such determined ſcorn! Such con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts!—Queſtions aſk'd your ſervant of no mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but to break in upon me; who could-bear it?</p>
                     <p>Detain me not, ſtruggling.—I will not be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ld.—I like you not, nor your ways.—You ſought to quarrel with me yeſterday, for no reaſon in the world that I can think of, but becauſe I was too obliging. You are an ingrateful man; and I hate you with my whole heart, Mr. Lovelace!</p>
                     <p>Do not make me deſperate, Madam.—Permit me to ſay, that you ſhall not leave me in this humour. Where-ever you go, I will attend you.—Had Miſs Howe been my friend, I had not been thus treated.—It is but too plain to whom my difficulties are owing. I have long obſerved, that every letter you receive
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:0447200104:155"/>
from her, makes an alteration in your behaviour to me. She would have <hi>you</hi> treat <hi>me,</hi> as <hi>ſhe</hi> treats Mr. Hickman, I ſuppoſe: But neither does that treatment become your admirable temper to offer, nor me to receive.</p>
                     <p>This ſtartled her. She did not care to have me think hardly of Miſs Howe.</p>
                     <p>But recollecting herſelf, Miſs Howe, ſaid ſhe, is a friend to virtue, and to good men.—If ſhe like not you, it is becauſe you are not one of thoſe.</p>
                     <p>Yes, Madam; and therefore, to ſpeak of Mr. Hickman and Myſelf, as you both, I ſuppoſe, think of each, ſhe treats <hi>him</hi> as ſhe would not treat a <hi>Love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace.</hi>—I challenge you, Madam, to ſhew me but one of the many letters you have received from her, where I am mentioned.</p>
                     <p>Whither will this lead us? replied ſhe. Miſs Howe is juſt; Miſs Howe is good.—She writes, ſhe ſpeaks, of every-body as they deſerve. If you point me out but any one occaſion, upon which you have reaſon to build a merit to yourſelf, as either juſt or good, or even generous, I will look out for her letter on that occaſion (if it be one I have acquainted her with); and will engage it ſhall be in your favour.</p>
                     <p>Deviliſh ſevere! And as indelicate as ſevere, to put a modeſt man upon hunting backward after his own merits.</p>
                     <p>She would have flung from me: I <hi>will</hi> go out, Mr. Lovelace. I will <hi>not</hi> be detained.</p>
                     <p>Indeed you muſt not, Madam, in this humour. And I placed myſelf between her and the door.—And then ſhe threw herſelf into a chair, fanning her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, her ſweet face all crimſoned over with paſſion.</p>
                     <p>I caſt myſelf at her feet.—Begone, Mr. Lovelace, ſaid ſhe, with a rejecting motion, her fan in her hand; for your own ſake leave me!—My ſoul is above thee, man! With both her hands puſhing me from her!—Urge me not to tell thee, how ſincerely I think my ſoul above thee!—Thou haſt a proud, a too proud
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:0447200104:156"/>
heart, to contend with!—Leave me, and leave me for ever!—Thou haſt a proud heart to contend with!</p>
                     <p>Her air, her manner, her voice, were bewitchingly noble, tho' her words were ſo ſevere.</p>
                     <p>Let me worſhip an angel, ſaid I, no woman. For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give me, deareſt creature!—Creature if you be, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give me!—Forgive my inadvertencies! Forgive my inequalities!—Pity my infirmity!—Who is equal to my Clariſſa?</p>
                     <p>I trembled between admiration and love; and wrapt my arms about her knees, as ſhe ſat. She try'd to riſe at the moment; but my claſping round her thus ardently, drew her down again; and never was wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man more affrighted. But free as my claſping emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion might appear to her apprehenſive heart, I had not, at the inſtant, any thought but what reverence inſpired. And till ſhe had actually withdrawn (which I permitted under promiſe of a ſpeedy return, and on her conſent to diſmiſs the chair), all the motions of my heart were as pure as her own.</p>
                     <p>She kept not her word. An hour I waited, before I ſent to claim her promiſe. She could not poſſibly ſee me yet, was the anſwer. As ſoon as ſhe could, ſhe would.</p>
                     <p>Dorcas ſays, ſhe ſtill exceſſively trembled; and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered her to give her water and hartſhorn.</p>
                     <p>A ſtrange apprehenſive creature!—Her terror is too great for the occaſion.—Evils in apprehenſion are often greater than evils in reality. Haſt thou never obſerved, that the terrors of a bird caught, and actually in the hand, bear no compariſon to what we might have ſuppoſed thoſe terrors would be, were we to have formed a judgment of the ſame bird by its ſhy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs before taken?</p>
                     <p>Dear creature!—Did ſhe never romp? Did ſhe never from girlhood to now, hoyden? The <hi>innocent</hi> kinds of freedom taken and all owed on theſe occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, would have familiarized her to greater. Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:0447200104:157"/>
but to touch the hem of her garment!—Exceſs of delicacy!—O the conſecrated beauty!—How can ſhe think to be a wife!</p>
                     <p>But how do I know till I try, whether ſhe may not by a leſs alarming treatment be prevailed upon, or whether [Day, I have done with thee!] ſhe may not yield to nightly ſurprizes? This is ſtill the burden of my ſong, I can marry her when I will. And if I do, after prevailing (whether by ſurprize or reluctant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent) whom but myſelf ſhall I have injured?</p>
                     <p>IT is now eleven o'clock. She will ſee me as ſoon as ſhe can, ſhe tells Polly Horton, who made her a tender viſit, and to whom ſhe is leſs reſerved than to any-body elſe. Her emotion, ſhe aſſures her, was not owing to perverſeneſs, to nicety, to ill-humour; but to <hi>weakneſs of heart.</hi> She has not <hi>ſtrength of mind</hi> ſufficient, ſhe ſays, to enable her to ſupport her condition, and her apprehenſions, under the weight of a father's curſe; which ſhe fears is more than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to operate.</p>
                     <p>Yet what a contradiction!—<hi>Weakneſs of heart,</hi> ſays ſhe, with ſuch a <hi>ſtrength of will!</hi>—O Belford! ſhe is a lion-hearted lady, in every caſe where her ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, her punctilio rather, calls for ſpirit. But I have had reaſon more than once in her caſe, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that the paſſions of the gentleſt, ſlower to be moved than thoſe of the quick, are the moſt flaming, the moſt irreſiſtible, when raiſed.—Yet her charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing body is not equally organized. The unequal partners pull two ways; and the divinity within her tears her ſilken frame. But had the ſame ſoul inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a maſculine body, never would there have been a truer hero.</p>

                     <p>MY beloved not yet viſible. She is not well. What <hi>expectations</hi> had ſhe from my ardent admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:0447200104:158"/>
of her!—More rudeneſs than revenge appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended. Yet, how my ſoul thirſts for revenge upon both theſe ladies!—I muſt have recourſe to my maſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrokes. This curſed project of Miſs Howe and her Mrs. Townſend, if I cannot contrive to render it abortive, will be always a ſword hanging over my head. Upon every little diſobligation my beloved will be for taking wing; and the pains I have taken, to deprive her of every other refuge or protection, in order to make her abſolutely dependent upon me, will be all thrown away. But, perhaps, I ſhall find out a Smuggler to counteract Miſs Howe.</p>
                     <p>Thou remembreſt the contention between the Sun and the North wind, in the fable; which ſhould firſt make an honeſt Traveller throw off his cloak.</p>
                     <p>Boreas began firſt. He puffed away moſt vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently; and often made the poor fellow curve and ſtagger: But with no other effect, than to cauſe him to wrap his ſurtout the cloſer about him.</p>
                     <p>But when it came to Phoebus's turn, he ſo played upon the traveller with his beams, that he made him firſt unbutton, and then throw it quite off:—Nor left he, till he obliged him to take to the friendly ſhade of a ſpreading beech; where proſtrating himſelf on the thrown-off cloak, he took a comfortable nap.</p>
                     <p>The victor-god then laughed outright, both at Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reas and the Traveller, and purſued his radiant courſe, ſhining upon, and warming and cheriſhing a thouſand new objects, as he danced along: And at night, when he put up his fiery courſers, he diverted his Thetis with the relation of his pranks in the paſſed day.</p>
                     <p>I, in like manner, will diſcard all my boiſtrous inventions; and if I can oblige my ſweet Traveller to throw aſide, but for one moment, the cloak of her rigid virtue, I ſhall have nothing to do, but, like the Sun, to bleſs new objects with my rays.—But my choſen hours of converſation and repoſe, after all my peregrinations, will be devoted to my goddeſs.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="152" facs="tcp:0447200104:159"/>AND now, Belford, according to my new ſyſtem, I think this houſe of Mrs. Fretchville an emba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſs upon me. I will get rid of it; for ſome time at leaſt. Mennell, when I am out, ſhall come to her, inquiring for me. What for? thou'lt ask. What for!—Haſt thou not heard what has befallen poor Mrs. Fretchville?—Then I'll tell thee.</p>
                     <p>One of her maids, about a week ago, was taken with the ſmall-pox. The reſt-kept their miſtreſs ignorant of it till Friday; and <hi>then</hi> ſhe came to know it by accident.—The greater half of the plagues poor mortals of condition are tormented with, proceed from the ſervants they take, partly for ſhew, partly for uſe, and with a view to leſſen their cares.</p>
                     <p>This has ſo terrified the widow, that ſhe is taken with all the ſymptoms which threaten an attack from that dreadful enemy of fair faces.—So muſt not think of removing: Yet cannot expect, that we ſhould be further delayed on her account.</p>
                     <p>She now wiſhes, with all her heart, that ſhe had known her own mind, and gone into the country at firſt when I treated about the houſe: This evil then had not happened!—A curſed croſs accident for <hi>us,</hi> too!—High-ho! Nothing elſe, I think, in this mortal life!—People need not ſtudy to bring croſſes upon themſelves by their petulancies.</p>
                     <p>So this affair of the houſe will be over; at leaſt, for one while. But then I can fall upon an expedient which will make amends for this diſappointment. Since I muſt move <hi>ſlow,</hi> in order to be <hi>ſure,</hi> I have a charming contrivance or two in my head—Even ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing ſhe ſhould get away, to bring her back again.</p>
                     <p>But what is become of Lord M. I trow, that he writes not to me, in anſwer to my invitation? If he would ſend me ſuch a letter, as I could ſhew, it might go a great way towards a perfect reconciliation. I have written to Charlotte about it. He ſhall ſoon
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:0447200104:160"/>
hear from me, and that in a way he won't like, if he writes not quickly. He has ſometimes threatened to diſinherit <hi>me:</hi> But if I ſhould renounce <hi>him,</hi> it would be but juſtice, and would vex him ten times more, than any thing he can do, will vex me. Then, the ſettlements unavoidably delayed, by his neglect!—How ſhall I bear ſuch a life of procraſtination! I, who, as to my will, and impatience, and ſo forth, am of the true <hi>lady-make!</hi> and can as little bear con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul and diſappointment as the beſt of them!</p>
                     <p>ANOTHER letter from Miſs Howe. I ſuppoſe it is <hi>that</hi> which ſhe promiſes in her laſt to ſend her, relate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the courtſhip between old Tony the uncle, and Annabella the mother. I ſhould be extremely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joiced to ſee it. No more of the ſmuggler-plot in it, I hope. This, it ſeems, ſhe has put in her pocket. But I hope I ſhall ſoon find it depoſited with the reſt.</p>

                     <p>AT my repeated requeſt ſhe condeſcended to meet me in the dining-room to afternoon tea, and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
                     <p>She entered with baſhfulneſs, as I thought; in a pretty confuſion, for having carried her apprehenſions too far. Sullen and ſlow moved ſhe towards the tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table.—Dorcas preſent, buſy in tea cup preparations. I took her reluctant hand, and preſſed it to my lips.—Deareſt, lovelieſt of creatures, why this diſtance? Why this diſpleaſure?—How can you thus torture the faithfulleſt heart in the world?—She diſengaged her hand. Again I would have ſnatch'd it.</p>
                     <p>Be quiet, peeviſhly withdrawing it; and down ſhe ſat; a gentle palpitation in the beauty of beauties in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicating mingled ſullenneſs and reſentment; her ſnowy handkerchief riſing and falling, and a ſweet fluſh overſpreading her charming cheeks.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="154" facs="tcp:0447200104:161"/>For God's ſake, Madam!—And a third time I would have taken her repulſing hand.</p>
                     <p>And for the ſame ſake, Sir; no more teazing.</p>
                     <p>Dorcas retired; I drew my chair nearer hers, and with the moſt reſpectful tenderneſs took her hand; and told her, that I could not, without the utmoſt concern, forbear to expreſs my apprehenſions (from the diſtance ſhe was ſo deſirous to keep me at), that if any man in the world was more <hi>indifferent</hi> to her, to uſe no harſher a word, than another, it was the unhappy wretch before her.</p>
                     <p>She looked ſteadily upon me for a moment, and with her other hand, not withdrawing that I held, pulled her handkerchief out of her pocket; and by a twinkling motion, tried to diſſipate a tear or two, which ſtood ready in each eye, to meander themſelves a paſſage down her glowing cheeks; but anſwered me only with a ſigh, and an averted face.</p>
                     <p>I urged her to ſpeak; to look up at me; to bleſs me with an eye more favourable.</p>
                     <p>I had reaſon, ſhe told me, for my complaint of her indifference. She ſaw nothing in my mind that was generous. I was not a man to be obliged or favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. My ſtrange behaviour to her ſince Saturday night, for no cauſe at all that ſhe knew of, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced her of this. Whatever hopes ſhe had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of me, were utterly diſſipated: All my ways were diſguſtful to her.</p>
                     <p>This cut me to the heart. The guilty, I believe, in every caſe, leſs patiently bear the detecting truth, than the innocent do the degrading falſhood.</p>
                     <p>I beſpoke her patience, while I took the liberty to account for this change, on my part.—I re-acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leged the pride of my heart, which could not bear the thought of that want of preference in the heart of a lady, whom I hoped to call mine, which ſhe had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways manifeſted. Marriage, I ſaid, was a ſtate that
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:0447200104:162"/>
was not to be entered upon with indifference on either ſide.</p>
                     <p>It is inſolence, interrupted ſhe, it is preſumption, Sir, to expect tokens of value, without reſolving to <hi>deſerve</hi> them. You have no whining creature before you, Mr. Lovelace, overcome by weak motives, to love where there is no merit. Miſs Howe can tell you, Sir, that I never loved the <hi>faults</hi> of my friend; nor ever wiſhed her to love me for mine. It was a rule with us, not to ſpare each other. And would a man who has nothing but faults (for pray, Sir, what are your virtues?) expect that I ſhould ſhew a value for him? Indeed, if I did, I ſhould not deſerve even <hi>his</hi> value, but ought to be deſpiſed by him.</p>
                     <p>Well have you, Madam, kept up to this noble manner of thinking. You are in no danger of being deſpiſed for any marks of tenderneſs or favour ſhewn to the man before you. You have been perhaps, <hi>you'll</hi> think, <hi>laudably</hi> ſtudious of making and taking occaſions to declare, that it was far from being owing to your choice, that you had any thoughts of me. My whole ſoul, Madam, in all its errors, in all its wiſhes, in all its views, had been laid open and naked before you, had I been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged by ſuch a ſhare in your confidence and eſteem, as would have ſecured me againſt your appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended worſt conſtructions of what I ſhould from time to time have revealed to you, and conſulted you upon. For never was there a franker heart; nor a man ſo ready to accuſe himſelf. [This, Belford, is true]. But you know, Madam, how much other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it has been between us.—Doubt, diſtance, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, on your part, begat doubt, fear, awe, on mine.—How little confidence! as if we apprehended each other to be a plotter rather than a lover. How have I dreaded every letter that has been brought you from Wilſon's!—And with reaſon; ſince the laſt,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:0447200104:163"/>
from which I expected ſo much, on account of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </hi> too, to avoid my attendance on you), ſet you againſt me more than ever.</p>
                     <p>I was guilty, it ſeems, of going to church, ſaid the indignant charmer; and without the company of a man, whoſe choice it would not have been to go, had I not gone. I was guilty of deſiring to have the whole Sunday to myſelf, after I had obliged you, againſt my will, at a play; and after you had detained me, equally to my diſlike, to a very late hour over night.—Theſe were my faults: For theſe I was to be puniſhed; I was to be compelled to ſee you, and to be terrified when I did ſee you, by the moſt ſhocking ill-humour that was ever ſhewn to a creature in my circumſtances, and not bound to bear it. You have pretended to find free fault with my father's temper, Mr. Lovelace: But the worſt that he ever ſhewed <hi>after</hi> marriage, was not in the leaſt to be compared to what you have ſhewn twenty times <hi>beforehand.</hi>—And what are my proſpects with you, at the very beſt?—My indignation riſes againſt you, Mr. Love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, while I ſpeak to you, when I recollect the many inſtances, equally ungenerous and unpolite, of your behaviour to one whom you have brought into di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs—And I can hardly bear you in my ſight.</p>
                     <p>She turned from me, ſtanding up; and lifting up her folded hands and charming eyes, ſwimming in tears—O my dear papa, ſaid the inimitable creature, you might have ſpared your heavy curſe, had you known how I have been puniſhed, ever ſince my ſwerving feet led me out of your garden-doors to meet this man! Then, ſinking into her chair, a burſt of paſſionate tears forced their way down her glowing cheeks.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="157" facs="tcp:0447200104:164"/>My deareſt life, taking her ſtill folded hands in mine, who can bear an invocation ſo affecting, tho' ſo paſſionate? [And, as I hope to live, my noſe tingled, as I once when a boy, remember it did (and indeed once more very lately), juſt before ſome tears came into my eyes; and I durſt hardly truſt my face in view of hers] What have I done to deſerve this impatient exclamation?—Have I, at any time, by word, by deeds, by looks, given you cauſe to doubt my ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, my reverence, my <hi>adoration,</hi> I may call it, of your virtues?—All is owing to miſapprehenſion, I hope, on both ſides.—Condeſcend to clear up but your part, as I will mine, and all muſt ſpeedily be happy.—Would to heaven I loved that heaven as I love you! And yet, if I doubted a return in love, let me periſh if I ſhould know how to wiſh you mine!—Give me hope, deareſt creature, give me but hope, that I am your preferable choice!—Give me but hope, that you hate me not; that you do not deſpiſe me.</p>
                     <p>O Mr. Lovelace, we have been long enough to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, to be tired of each others humours and ways; ways and humours ſo different, that perhaps you ought to diſlike <hi>me,</hi> as much as I do <hi>you.</hi>—I think, I think, that I cannot make an anſwerable return to the value you profeſs for me. My temper is utterly ruined. You have given me an ill opinion of all mankind; of yourſelf in particular: And withal ſo bad a one of myſelf, that I ſhall never be able to look up, having utterly and for ever loſt all that ſelf-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency, and conſcious pride, which are ſo neceſſary to carry a woman through this life with tolerable ſatisfaction to herſelf.</p>
                     <p>She pauſed. I was ſilent. By my ſoul, thought I, this ſweet creature will at laſt undo me!</p>
                     <p>She proceeded.—What now remains, but that you pronounce me free of all obligation to you? And that you will not hinder me from purſuing the deſtiny that ſhall be allotted me?</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="158" facs="tcp:0447200104:165"/>Again ſhe pauſed. I was ſtill ſilent; meditating whether to renounce all further deſigns upon her; whether I had not received ſufficient evidence of a virtue, and of a greatneſs of ſoul, that could not be queſtioned, or impeached.</p>
                     <p>She went on: Propitious to me be your ſilence, Mr. Lovelace!—Tell me, that I am free of all obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to you. You know, I never made <hi>you</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes.—You know, that you are not under any to <hi>me.</hi>—My broken fortunes I matter not.—</p>
                     <p>She was proceeding.—My deareſt life, ſaid I, I have been all this time, tho' you fill me with doubts of your favour, buſy in the nuptial preparations.—I am actually in treaty for equipage.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Equipage,</hi> Sir!—Trappings, Tinſel!—What is Equipage; what is Life; what is Any-thing, to a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſunk ſo low, as I am in my own opinion!—La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring under a father's curſe!—Unable to look back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward without reproach, or forward without terror!—Theſe reflections ſtrengthen'd by every croſs acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent!—And what but croſs accidents befal me!—All my darling ſchemes daſhed in pieces; all my hopes at an end; deny me not the liberty to refuge myſelf in ſome obſcure corner, where neither the enemies you have made me, nor the few friends you have left me, may ever hear of the ſuppoſed raſh one, till thoſe happy moments are at hand, which ſhall expiate for all!</p>
                     <p>I had not a word to ſay for myſelf. Such a war in my mind had I never known. Gratitude, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration of the excellent creature before me, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bating with villainous habit, with reſolutions ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meditately made, and with views ſo much gloried in!—An hundred new contrivances in my head, and in my heart, that, to be honeſt, as it is called; muſt all be given up, by a heart delighting in intrigue and difficulty—Miſs Howe's virulences endeavoured to be recollected—Yet recollection refuſing to bring them forward with the requiſite efficacy—I had certainly
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:0447200104:166"/>
been a loſt man, had not Dorcas come ſeaſonably in, with a letter.—On the ſuperſcription written—<hi>Be pleaſed, Sir, to open it now.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I returned to the window—opened it.—It was from herſelf.—Theſe the contents—
<q rend="inline margQuotes">'Be pleaſed to detain my lady; a paper of importance to tranſcribe.—I will cough when I have done.'</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>I put the paper in my pocket, and turned to my charmer, leſs diſconcerted, as ſhe, by that time, had alſo a little recovered herſelf.—One favour, deareſt creature—Let me but know, whether Miſs Howe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves or diſapproves of my propoſals?—I know her to be my enemy. I was intending to account to you for the change of behaviour you accuſed me of at the beginning of this converſation; but was diverted from it by your vehemence.—Indeed, my beloved creature, you was <hi>very</hi> vehement.—Do you think, it muſt not be matter of high regret to me, to find my wiſhes ſo often delayed and poſtponed, in favour of your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant view to a reconciliation with relations, who will not be reconciled to you?—To this was owing your declining to celebrate before we came to town, tho' you were ſo atrociouſly treated by your ſiſter, and your whole family; and tho' ſo ardently preſſed to celebrate by me? To this was owing the ready of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence you took at my four friends; and at the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>availing attempt I made to ſee a dropt letter, little imagining that there could be room for mortal diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure on that account, from what two ſuch ladies could write to each other.—To this was owing the week's diſtance you held me at, till you knew the iſſue of another application.—But when they had rejected that; when you had ſent my coldly-received propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals to Miſs Howe for her approbation or advice, as indeed I adviſed, and had honoured me with your company at the play on Saturday night (my whole behaviour unobjectible to the laſt hour); muſt not, Madam, the ſudden change in your conduct, the very
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:0447200104:167"/>
next morning, aſtoniſh and diſtreſs me?—And this perſiſted in with ſtill ſtronger declarations, after you had received the impatiently-expected letter from Miſs Howe; muſt I not conclude, that all was owing to her influence; and that ſome other application or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject was meditating, that made it neceſſary to keep me again at diſtance till the reſult were known, and which was to deprive me of you for ever? for was not that your conſtantly propoſed preliminary?—Well, Madam, might I be wrought up to a half-frenzy by this apprehenſion; and well might I charge you with hating me.—And now, deareſt creature, let me know, I once more aſk you, what is Miſs Howe's opinion of my propoſals?</p>
                     <p>Were I diſpoſed to debate with you, Mr. Lovelace, I could very eaſily anſwer your fine harangue. But at preſent, I ſhall only ſay, that your ways have been very unaccountable. You ſeem to me, if your meanings were always juſt, to have taken great pains to embaraſs them. Whether owing in you to the want of a clear head, or a ſound heart, I cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine; but it is to the want of one of them, I verily think, that I am to aſcribe the greateſt part of your ſtrange conduct.</p>
                     <p>Curſe upon the heart of the little devil, ſaid I, who inſtigates you to think ſo hardly of the faithfulleſt heart in the world!</p>
                     <p>How dare you, Sir?—And there ſhe ſtopt; having almoſt overſhot herſelf; as I deſigned ſhe ſhould.</p>
                     <p>How dare I <hi>what,</hi> Madam? And I looked with meaning. How dare I <hi>what?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Vile man!—And do you—And there again ſhe ſtopt.</p>
                     <p>Do I <hi>what,</hi> Madam?—And why <hi>vile man?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>How dare you to curſe <hi>any-body</hi> in my preſence?</p>
                     <p>O the ſweet receder!—But that was not to go off ſo with a Lovelace.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="161" facs="tcp:0447200104:168"/>Why then, deareſt creature, is there <hi>any-body</hi> that inſtigates you?—If there be, again I curſe them, be they who they will.</p>
                     <p>She was in a charming pretty paſſion.—And this was the firſt time that I had the odds in my favour.</p>
                     <p>Well, Madam, it is juſt as I thought. And now I know how to account for a temper, that I hope is not <hi>natural</hi> to you.</p>
                     <p>Artful wretch! And is it thus you would entrap me?—But know, Sir, that I receive letters from no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body but Miſs Howe. Miſs Howe likes ſome of your ways as little as I do; for I have ſet every-thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore her.—Yet ſhe is thus far <hi>your</hi> enemy, as ſhe is <hi>mine:</hi>—She thinks I ſhould not refuſe your offers; but endeavour to make the beſt of my lot. And now you have the truth. Would to heaven you were capable of dealing with equal ſincerity!</p>
                     <p>I <hi>am,</hi> Madam. And here, on my knee, I renew my vows, and my ſupplication, that you will make me yours—Yours for ever.—And let me have cauſe to bleſs you and Miſs Howe in the ſame breath.</p>
                     <p>To ſay the truth, Belford, I had before begun to think, that that vixen of a girl, who certainly likes not Hickman, was in love with <hi>me.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Riſe, Sir, from your too-ready knees; and mock me not.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Too-ready knees,</hi> thought I!—Tho' this humble poſture ſo little affects this proud beauty, ſhe knows not how much I have obtained of others of her ſex, nor how often I have been forgiven the laſt attempts, by kneeling.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Mock you,</hi> Madam!—And I aroſe, and re-urged her for the day. I blamed myſelf at the ſame time, for my invitation to Lord M. as it might ſubject me to delay, from his infirmities: But told her, that I would write to him to excuſe me, if ſhe had no ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection; or to give him the day ſhe would give me, and not wait for him, if he could not come in time.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="162" facs="tcp:0447200104:169"/>My day, Sir, ſaid ſhe, is never. Be not ſurprized<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> A perſon of politeneſs judging between us, would not be ſurprized that I ſay ſo. But indeed, Mr. Lovelace, and wept thro' impatience, you either know not how to treat with a mind of the leaſt degree of delicacy, notwithſtanding your birth and education, or you are an ingrateful man; and (after a pauſe) a worſe than ingrateful one. But I will retire. I will ſee you again to-morrow. I cannot before. I think I hate you—You may look—Indeed I think I hate you. And if, upon a re-examination of my own heart, I find I do, I would not for the world that matters ſhould go on farther between us.</p>
                     <p>I was too much vex'd, diſconcerted, mortify'd, to hinder her retiring—And yet ſhe had not gone, if Dorcas had not cough'd.</p>
                     <p>The wench came in, as ſoon as her lady had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired, and gave me the copy ſhe had taken.

Time and patience will ſubdue all things. My proſpects of happineſs are extremely contracted. A huſband's right will be always the ſame. In my life-time I could wiſh nothing to be done of this ſort.

wicked defiance, by it: For is it not rejecting at once all that expoſtulatory meekneſs, and gentle reaſoning, mingled with ſighs as gentle, and graced with bent knees, ſupplicating hands, and eyes lifted up to your imperial countenance, juſt running over, that ſhould make a reconciliation ſpeedy, and as laſting as ſpeedy? Even ſuppoſe the huſband is wrong, will not his being ſo, give the greater force to her expoſtulation?</p>
               <p>Now I think of it, a man <hi>ſhould</hi> be wrong now-and-then, to make his wife ſhine. Miſs Howe tells my charmer, that adverſity is <hi>her</hi> ſhining-time. 'Tis a generous thing in a man, to make his wife ſhine at his own expence: To give her leave to triumph over him by patient reaſoning: For were he to be too <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial</hi> to acknowlege his fault on the ſpot, ſhe will find the benefit of her duty and ſubmiſſion <hi>in future,</hi> and in the high opinion he will conceive of her pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and obligingneſs—And ſo, by degrees, ſhe will be her maſter's maſter.</p>
               <p>But for a wife to come up with a kemboed arm, the other hand thrown out, perhaps, with a pointing finger—Look ye here, Sir!—Take notice!—If <hi>you</hi> are wrong, <hi>I'll</hi> be wrong!—If <hi>you</hi> are in a paſſion, <hi>I'll</hi> be in a paſſion!—Rebuff, for rebuff, Sir!—If <hi>you</hi>

<pb n="168" facs="tcp:0447200104:175"/>
ſaw her pop a paper into the drawer, as ſhe came in; and there, on her miſtreſs's going to meet me in the dining-room, ſhe found it: And to be This.</p>
               <p>But I had better not to have had a copy of it, as far as I know: For, determined as I was before upon my operations, it inſtantly turned all my reſolutions in her favour. Yet I would give ſomething to be convinced, that ſhe did not pop it into her drawer before the wench, in order for me to ſee it; and perhaps (if I were to take notice of it) to diſcover whether Dorcas, according to Miſs Howe's advice, were moſt <hi>my</hi> friend, or <hi>hers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The very ſuſpicion of this will do her no good: For I cannot bear to be artfully treated. People love to enjoy their own peculiar talents in <hi>monopoly,</hi> as I may ſay. I am aware, that it will ſtrengthen thy argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments againſt me in her behalf. But I know every tittle thou canſt ſay upon it: So ſpare thy wambling nonſenſe, I deſire thee; and leave this ſweet excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and me to our fate: That will determine for us, as it ſhall pleaſe itſelf: For, as Cowley ſays,
<q>
                     <l>An unſeen hand makes all our moves:</l>
                     <l>And ſome are great, and ſome are ſmall;</l>
                     <l>Some climb to good, ſome from good fortune fall:</l>
                     <l>Some wiſe men, and ſome fools we call:</l>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>But, after all, I am ſorry, <hi>almoſt</hi> ſorry (for how ſhall I do to be <hi>quite</hi> ſorry, when it is not <hi>given</hi> to me to be ſo?), that I cannot, without making any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther trials, reſolve upon wedlock.</p>
               <p>I have juſt read over again this intended anſwer to my propoſals: And how I adore her for it!</p>

               <p>Nay, ſhe has not <hi>intended</hi> to ſend it to me: Sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> has even torn it, perhaps with indignation, as think<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:0447200104:176"/>
it too <hi>good</hi> for me. By this action ſhe abſolutely retracts it. Why then does my fooliſh fondneſs ſeek to eſtabliſh for her the ſame merit in my heart, as if ſhe avowed it? Prythee, dear Belford, once more leave us to our fate; and do not thou interpoſe with thy nonſenſe, to weaken a ſpirit already too ſqueamiſh, and ſtrengthen a conſcience that has declared itſelf of her party.</p>
               <p>Then again, remember thy recent diſcoveries, Love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace!—Remember her indifference, attended with all the appearance of contempt and hatred. View her, even <hi>now,</hi> wrapt up in reſerve and myſtery; medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating plots, as far as thou knoweſt, againſt the ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty thou haſt, by right of conqueſt, obtained over her: Remember, in ſhort, all thou haſt <hi>threatened</hi> to remember againſt this inſolent beauty, who is a rebel to the power ſhe has liſted under!</p>
               <p>But yet, how doſt thou propoſe to ſubdue thy ſweet enemy?—Abhorr'd be <hi>force,</hi> be the <hi>neceſſity</hi> of force, if that can be avoided! There is no triumph in <hi>force!</hi> No conqueſt over the will!—No prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by gentle degrees, over the gentle paſſions! <hi>Force</hi> is the devil!</p>
               <p>My curſed character, as I have often ſaid, was againſt me at ſetting out!—Yet is ſhe not a <hi>woman?</hi> Cannot I find one but half-yielding moment, if ſhe do not abſolutely hate me?</p>
               <p>But with what can I tempt her?—RICHES ſhe was born to, and deſpiſes, knowing what they are. JEW<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ELS and ornaments, to a mind ſo much a jewel, and ſo richly ſet, her worthy conſciouſneſs will not let her value. LOVE, if ſhe be ſuſceptible of Love, it ſeems to be ſo much under the direction of prudence, that one unguarded moment, I fear, cannot be reaſonably hoped for: And ſo much VIGILANCE, ſo much Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiveneſs, that her fears are ever aforehand with her dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers. Then her LOVE OF VIRTUE ſeems to be <hi>prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,</hi> native, or, if <hi>not</hi> native, ſo deeply rooted, that
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:0447200104:177"/>
its fibres have ſtruck into her heart, and, as ſhe grew up, ſo blended and twiſted themſelves with the ſtrings of life, that I doubt there is no ſeparating of the one, without cutting the others aſunder.</p>
               <p>What then can be done to make ſuch a matchleſs creature as this get over the firſt teſts, in order to put her to the grand proof, whether once overcome, ſhe will not be always overcome?</p>
               <p>By my faith, Jack, as I ſit gazing upon her, my whole ſoul in my eyes, contemplating her perfections, and thinking, when I have ſeen her eaſy and ſerene, what would be her thoughts, did <hi>ſhe</hi> know my heart as well as <hi>I</hi> know it; when I behold her diſturbed and jealous, how <hi>juſt</hi> her apprehenſions, and that ſhe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not fear ſo much as there is <hi>room</hi> for her to fear; my heart often miſgives me.</p>
               <p>And muſt, think I, O creature ſo divinely excellent, and ſo beloved of my ſoul, thoſe arms, thoſe incir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cling arms, that would make a monarch happy, be uſed to repel brutal force; all their ſtrength, unavail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly perhaps, exerted to repel it, and to defend a perſon ſo delicately framed? Can violence enter into the heart of a wretch, who might intitle himſelf to all thy willing, yet virtuous love, and make the bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings thou aſpireſt after, her <hi>duty</hi> to confer?—Begone, villain-purpoſes!—Sink ye all to the hell that could only inſpire ye!—And I am ready to throw myſelf at her feet, confeſs my villainous deſigns, avow my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and put it out of my power to act un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily by ſuch a peerleſs excellence.</p>
               <p>How then comes it, that all theſe compaſſionate, and, as ſome would call them, <hi>honeſt</hi> ſenſibilities go off?—Why, Miſs Howe will tell thee: She ſays, I am the <hi>devil.</hi>—By my conſcience, I think he has, at preſent, a great ſhare in me.</p>
               <p>There's ingenuity!—How I lay myſelf open to thee!—But ſeeſt thou not, that the more I ſay againſt myſelf, the leſs room there is for thee to take me to

taſk?—O Belford, Belford! I cannot, cannot (at leaſt at preſent I cannot) marry.</p>
               <p>Then her family, my bitter enemies!—To ſupple to them, or, if I do not, to make her <hi>as</hi> unhappy, as ſhe can be from my <hi>attempts</hi>—</p>
               <p>Then muſt ſhe love Them too much, Me too little.</p>
               <p>She now ſeems to deſpiſe me: Miſs Howe declares, that ſhe really does deſpiſe me. To be <hi>deſpiſed by a</hi> WIFE!—What a thought is that!—To be <hi>excelled by a</hi> WIFE too, in every part of praiſeworthy know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege!—To <hi>take leſſons,</hi> to <hi>take inſtructions,</hi> from a WIFE!—<hi>More</hi> than deſpiſe me, ſhe herſelf has taken time to conſider whether ſhe does not <hi>hate</hi> me:—<hi>I hate you,</hi> Lovelace, <hi>with my whole heart,</hi> ſaid ſhe to me but yeſterday!—<hi>My ſoul is above thee, man!—Urge me not to tell thee, how ſincerely I think my ſoul above thee!</hi>—How poor indeed was I then, even in my own heart!—So <hi>viſible</hi> a ſuperiority, to ſo proud a ſpirit as mine!—And <hi>here</hi> from Below, from BE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LOW indeed! I am ſo goaded on—</p>
               <p>Yet 'tis poor too, to think myſelf a machine.—I am <hi>no</hi> machine.—Lovelace, thou art baſe to thyſelf, but to <hi>ſuppoſe</hi> thyſelf a machine.</p>
               <p>But having gone thus far, I ſhould be unhappy, if, after marriage, in the petulance of ill humour, I had it to reproach myſelf, that I did not try her to the utmoſt. And yet I don't know how it is, but this lady, the moment I come into her preſence, half aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milates me to her own virtue.—Once or twice (to ſay nothing of her triumph over me on Sunday night) I was prevailed upon to fluſter myſelf, with an intention to make ſome advances, which, if obliged to recede, I might lay upon raiſed ſpirits: But the inſtant I beheld her, I was ſoberized into awe and reverence: And the majeſty of her even <hi>viſible</hi> purity firſt damped, and then extinguiſhed, my <hi>double</hi> flame.</p>
               <p>What a ſurpriſingly powerful effect, ſo much and ſo

long in my power, <hi>ſhe!</hi> ſo inſtigated by ſome of her own ſex, and ſo ſtimulated by paſſion, <hi>I!</hi>—How can this be accounted for, in a Lovelace!</p>
               <p>But what a heap of ſtuff have I written!—How have I been run away with!—By what?—Canſt thou ſay, by what?—O thou lurking varleteſs CON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SCIENCE!—Is it Thou, that haſt thus made me of party againſt myſelf?—How cameſt thou in?—In what diſguiſe, thou egregious haunter of my more agreeable hours?—Stand <hi>thou,</hi> with <hi>fate,</hi> but neuter in this controverſy; and, if I cannot do credit to human nature, and to the female ſex, by bringing down ſuch an angel as this to claſs with and adorn it (for adorn it ſhe does in her very foibles), then I am all yours, and never will reſiſt you more.</p>
               <p>Here I aroſe. I ſhook myſelf. The window was open.

               <p>Now this letter gives the ſervant the ſmall-pox: And ſhe has given it to her unhappy vapouriſh lady. Vapouriſh people are perpetual ſubjects for diſeaſes to work upon. <hi>Name</hi> but the malady, and it is <hi>theirs</hi> in a moment. <hi>Ever</hi> fitted for inoculation.—The phyſical tribe's milch-cows.—A vapouriſh or ſple<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>netic patient is a fiddle for the doctors; and they are eternally playing upon it. Sweet muſic does it make them. All their difficulty, except a caſe extraordinary happens (as poor Mrs. Fretchville's, who has <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized</hi> her apprehenſions), is but to hold their counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, while their patient is drawing up a bill of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment againſt himſelf;—and when they have heard it, proceed to <hi>puniſh:</hi>—The right word for <hi>preſcribe.</hi> Why ſhould they not, when the criminal has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed his guilt?—And <hi>puniſh</hi> they generally do with a vengeance.</p>
               <p>Yet, ſilly toads too, now I think of it! For why, when they know they cannot do good, may they not as well endeavour to gratify, as to nauſeate, the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient's palate?</p>
               <p>Were I a phyſician, I'd get all the trade to myſelf: For Malmſey, and Cyprus, and the generous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts of the Cape, a little diſguiſed, ſhould be my principal doſes: As theſe would create new ſpirits,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:0447200104:181"/>
how would the revived patient covet the phyſic, and adore the doctor!</p>
               <p>Give all the paraders of the faculty whom thou knoweſt, this hint.—There could but one inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience ariſe from it. The APOTHECARIES would find their medicines coſt them <hi>ſomething:</hi> But the demand for quantities would anſwer that: Since the honeſt NURSE would be the patient's taſter; perpetually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring repetitions of the laſt cordial julap.</p>
               <p>Well, but to the letter—Yet what need of further explanation after the hints in my former? The widow cannot be removed; and that's enough: And Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell's work is over; and his conſcience left to plague him for his own ſins, and not another man's: And, very poſſibly, plague enough will it give him for thoſe.</p>
               <p>This letter is directed, <hi>To Robert Lovelace, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> or, in his abſence, To his Lady.</hi> She had refuſed dining with me, or ſeeing me; and I was out when it came. She open'd it: So is my lady by her own conſent, proud and ſaucy as ſhe is.</p>
               <p>I am glad at my heart that it came before we intirely make up. She would elſe, perhaps, have concluded it to be contrived for a delay: And now, moreover, we can accommodate our old and new quarrels together; and that's contrivance, you know. But how is her dear haughty heart humbled to what it was when I knew her firſt, that ſhe can apprehend <hi>any</hi> delays from me; and have nothing to do but to vex at them!</p>
               <p>I came in to dinner. She ſent me down the letter, deſiring my excuſe for opening it. Did it before ſhe was aware. Lady-Pride, Belford!—Recollection, then Retrogradation!</p>
               <p>I requeſted to ſee her upon it that moment. But ſhe deſires to ſuſpend our interview till morning. I will bring her to own, before I have done with her, that ſhe can't ſee me too often.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="175" facs="tcp:0447200104:182"/>My impatience was ſo great, on an occaſion ſo <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected,</hi> that I could not help writing, to tell her,
<q rend="inline margQuotes">'how much vex'd I was at the accident: But that it need not delay my happy day, as That did not depend upon the houſe [She knew That before, ſhe'll think, and ſo did I]: And as Mrs. Fretchville, by Mr. Mennell, ſo handſomely expreſſed her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern upon it, and her wiſhes, that it could ſuit us to bear with the unavoidable delay, I hoped, that going down to The Lawn for two or three of the ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer-months, when I was made the happieſt of men, would be favourable to all round.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>The dear creature takes this incident to heart, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve: And ſends word to my repeated requeſt to ſee her, notwithſtanding her denial, that ſhe cannot till the morning: It ſhall be then at ſix o'clock, if I pleaſe!</p>

               <p>Can ſee her but once a day now, Jack!</p>
               <p>Did I tell thee, that I wrote a letter to my couſin Montague, wondering that I heard not from Lord M. as the ſubject was ſo very intereſting? In it I acquainted her with the houſe I was about taking; and with Mrs. Fretchville's vapouriſh delays.</p>
               <p>I was very loth to engage my own family, either man or woman, in this affair; but I muſt take my meaſures ſecurely: And already they all think as bad of me as they well can. You obſerve by my Lord M.'s to yourſelf, that the well-manner'd Peer is afraid I ſhould play this admirable creature one of my <hi>uſual dog's tricks.</hi>

               <p>I have received juſt now an anſwer from Charlotte.</p>
               <p>Charlotte i'n't well. A ſtomach-diſorder.</p>
               <p>No wonder a girl's ſtomach ſhould plague her. A ſingle lady; that's it. When ſhe has a man to plague, it will have ſomething beſides itſelf to prey upon. Knoweſt thou not moreover, that man is the woman's

               <p>Poor Charlotte! But I <hi>heard</hi> ſhe was not well: That encouraged me to write to her; and to expreſs myſelf a little concerned, that ſhe had not of her own accord thought of a viſit in town to my charmer.</p>
               <p>Here follows a copy of her letter: Thou wilt ſee by it, that every little monkey is to catechiſe me. They all depend upon my good-nature.</p>

                     <p>WE have been in daily hope for a long time, I muſt call it, of hearing that the happy knot was ty'd. My Lord has been very much out of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: And yet nothing would ſerve him, but he would himſelf write an anſwer to your letter. It was the only opportunity he ſhould ever have, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, to throw in a little good advice to you, with the hope of its being of any ſignification; and he has been ſeveral hours in a day, as his gout would let him, buſied in it: It wants now only his laſt reviſal. He hopes it will have the greater weight with you, if it appear all in his own hand-writing.</p>
                     <p>Indeed, Mr. Lovelace, his worthy heart is wrapt up in you. I wiſh you loved yourſelf but half as well. But I believe too, that if all the family loved you leſs, you would love yourſelf more.</p>
                     <p>His Lordſhip has been very buſy, at the times he could not write, in conſulting Pritchard about thoſe eſtates, which he propoſes to transfer to you on the happy occaſion, that he may anſwer your letter in the moſt acceptable manner; and ſhew, by effects, how kindly he takes your invitation. I aſſure you, he is mighty proud of it.</p>
                     <p>As for myſelf, I am not at all well, and have not been for ſome weeks paſt, with my old ſtomach-diſorder. I had certainly elſe before now have done

But you may aſſure yourſelf, that when our dear relation-elect ſhall be enter'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the new habitation you tell me of, we will do our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the honour of viſiting her; and if any delay ariſes from the dear lady's want of courage, which, conſidering her man, let me tell you, may very well be, we will endeavour to inſpire her with it, and be ſponſors for you;—for, couſin, I believe you have need to be chriſten'd over again before you are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled to ſo great a bleſſing.

               <p>THE Lady, in her next letter, gives Miſs Howe an account of what has paſſed between Mr. Lovelace and herſelf.

<pb n="179" facs="tcp:0447200104:186"/>
the ſettlements and our equipages were preparing. But on any other account, there was no great matter in it; ſince when my happy day was over, we could, with ſo much convenience, go down to the Lawn, or to my Lord M.'s, or to either of my aunts in town; which would give full time to provide ourſelves with ſervants, and other accommodations.</p>
               <p>How ſweetly the charmer liſten'd!</p>
               <p>I aſked her, If ſhe had had the ſmall-pox?</p>
               <p>'Twas always a doubtful point with her mother and Mrs. Norton, ſhe own'd. But altho' ſhe was not afraid of it, ſhe choſe not unneceſſarily to ruſh into places where it was.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Right, thought I</hi>—Elſe, I ſaid, it would not have been amiſs for her to ſee the houſe before ſhe went into the country; for, if <hi>ſhe</hi> liked it not, I was not obliged to have it.</p>
               <p>She aſked, If ſhe might take a copy of Miſs Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tague's letter?</p>
               <p>I ſaid, She might keep the letter itſelf, and ſend it to Miſs Howe, if ſhe pleaſed; for that, I ſuppoſed, was her intention. She bow'd her head to me. There, Jack!—I ſhall have her courteſy to me, by-and-by, I queſtion not. What a-devil had I to do, to terrify the ſweet creature by my termagant projects!—Yet it was not amiſs, I believe, to make her afraid of me. She <hi>ſays,</hi> I am an unpolite man—And every polite inſtance from ſuch a one, is deem'd a favour.</p>
               <p>Talking of the ſettlements, I told her, that I had rather Pritchard (mentioned by my couſin Charlotte), had not been conſulted on this occaſion. Pritchard, indeed, was a very honeſt man; and had been for a generation in the family; and knew the eſtates, and the condition of them, better than either my Lord or myſelf: But Pritchard, like other old men, was diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and ſlow; and valued himſelf upon his ſkill as a draughts-man; and for the ſake of that paltry repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:0447200104:187"/>
muſt have all his forms preſerved, were an imperial crown to depend upon his diſpatch.</p>
               <p>I kiſſed her unrepulſing hand no leſs than five times during this converſation. Lord, Jack, how my ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous heart run over!—She was quite obliging at parting.—She in a manner aſked me <hi>leave</hi> to retire; to reperuſe Charlotte's letter.—I think ſhe bent her knees to me; but I won't be ſure.—How happy might we have both been long ago, had the dear crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture been always as complaiſant to me! For I do love reſpect, and, whether I deſerved it or not, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways had it, till I knew this proud beauty.</p>
               <p>And now, Belford, are we in a train, or the duce is in it. Every fortified town has its ſtrong and its weak place. I had carried on my attacks againſt the impregnable parts. I have no doubt but I ſhall either <hi>ſhine</hi> or <hi>ſmuggle</hi> her out of her cloak, ſince ſhe and Miſs Howe have intended to employ a ſmuggler againſt <hi>me.</hi>—All we wait for now, is my Lord's letter.</p>
               <p>But I had like to have <hi>forgot</hi> to tell thee, that we have been not a little alarm'd, by ſome inquiries that have been made after me and my beloved, by a man of good appearance; who yeſterday procured a tradeſman in the neighbouroood to ſend for Dorcas: Of whom he aſked ſeveral queſtions relating to us; and particularly (as we boarded and lodged in one houſe), whether we were married?</p>
               <p>This has given my beloved great uneaſineſs. And I could not help obſerving upon it, to her, how right a thing it was, that we had given out below that we were married. The inquiry, moſt probably, I ſaid, was from her brother's quarter; and now, perhaps, that our marriage was owned, we ſhould hear no more of his machinations. The perſon, it ſeems, was curious to know the day that the ceremony was performed. But Dorcas refuſed to give him any other particulars, than that we <hi>were</hi> married; and was the more reſerved, as he declined to tell her the motives of his inquiry.</p>

               <p>THE devil take this uncle of mine! He has at laſt ſent me a letter, which I cannot ſhew, without expoſing the head of our family for a fool. A con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded parcel of pop-guns has he let off upon me. I was in hopes he had exhauſted his whole ſtock of this ſort, in his letter to you.—To keep it back, to delay ſending it, till he had recollected all this <hi>farrago</hi> of nonſenſe—Confound his <hi>Wiſdom of nations,</hi> if ſo much of it is to be ſcraped together, in diſgrace of it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, to make one egregious ſimpleton!—But I am glad I am fortified with this piece of flagrant folly, however; ſince, in all human affairs, the <hi>convenient</hi> and <hi>inconvenient,</hi> the <hi>good</hi> and the <hi>bad,</hi> are ſo mingled, that there is no having the one without the other.</p>
               <p>I have already offer'd the bill incloſed in it to my beloved; and read to her part of the letter. But ſhe refuſed the bill: And I, being in caſh, ſhall return it. She ſeemed very deſirous to peruſe the whole let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And when I told her, that were it not for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the writer, I would oblige her, ſhe ſaid, It would not be expoſing his Lordſhip to ſhew it to her; and that ſhe always preferred the heart to the head. I knew her meaning—But did not thank her for it.</p>
               <p>All that makes for me in it, I will tranſcribe for her—Yet, hang it, ſhe ſhall have the letter, and my ſoul with it, for one conſenting kiſs.</p>
               <p>SHE has got the letter from me, without the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. Duce take me, if I had the courage to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the condition! A new character this of baſhful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in thy friend.—I ſee, that a truly modeſt woman

may make even a confident man keep his diſtance. By my ſoul, Belford, I believe, that nine women in ten, who fall, fall either from their own vanity, or levity, or for want of circumſpection, and proper re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves.</p>
               <p>I DID intend to take my reward on her returning a letter ſo favourable to us both. But ſhe ſent it to me, ſealed up by Dorcas.—I might have thought that there were two or three hints in it, that ſhe would be too nice immediately to appear to.

               <p>I know, you have vowed revenge againſt this fine lady's family: But no more of that, now. You muſt
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:0447200104:190"/>
look upon them all as your relations; and forgive, and forget. And when they ſee you make a good huſband, and a good father (which God ſend, for all our ſakes!), they will wonder at their nonſenſical antipathy, and beg your pardon: But while they think you a vile fellow, and a rake, how can they either love you, or excuſe their daughter?</p>
               <p>And methinks I could wiſh to give a word of comfort to the lady, who, doubtleſs, muſt be under great fears, how ſhe ſhall be able to hold-in ſuch a wild creature, as you have hitherto been. I would hint to her, that, by ſtrong arguments, and gentle words, ſhe may do any thing with you; for tho' you are too apt to be hot, gentle words will cool you, and bring you into the temper that is neceſſary for your cure.</p>
               <p>Would to God, <hi>my</hi> poor lady, your aunt, who is dead and gone, had been a proper patient for the ſame remedy! God reſt her ſoul! No reflections upon her memory! <hi>Worth is beſt known by want!</hi> I know <hi>hers</hi> now; and if I had went firſt, ſhe would by this time have known <hi>mine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is great wiſdom in that ſaying, <hi>God ſend me a friend, that may tell me of my faults: If not, an enemy; and he will.</hi> Not that I am your enemy; and that you know well. <hi>The more noble any one is, the more humble:</hi> So bear with me, if you would be thought noble.—Am I not your uncle? And do I not deſign to be better to you, than your father could be? Nay, I will be your father too, when the happy day comes; ſince you deſire it: And pray make my compliments to my dear niece; and tell her, I wonder much that ſhe has ſo long deferred your happineſs.</p>
               <p>Pray let her know, I will preſent HER (not <hi>you</hi>) either my Lancaſhire ſeat, or <hi>The Lawn</hi> in Hert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fordſhire; and ſettle upon her a thouſand pounds a year, peny-rents; to ſhew her, that we are not a family to take baſe advantages: And you may have
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:0447200104:191"/>
writings drawn, and ſettle as you will.—Honeſt Pritchard has the rent-roll of both theſe eſtates at his fingers end; and has been a good old ſervant. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend him to your Lady's favour. I have already conſulted him: He will tell you what is beſt for you, and moſt pleaſing to me.</p>
               <p>I am ſtill very bad with my gout; but will come in a litter, as ſoon as the day is fixed: It would be the joy of my heart, to join your hands. And let me tell you, if you do not make the beſt of huſbands to ſo good a young lady, and one who has had ſo much courage for your ſake, I will renounce you; and ſettle all I can upon her and hers by you, and leave you out of the queſtion.</p>
               <p>If any thing be wanting for your further ſecurity, I am ready to give it (tho' you know, that my word has always been look'd upon as my bond): And when the Harlowes know all this, let us ſee whether they are able to bluſh, and take ſhame upon themſelves.</p>
               <p>Your two aunts want only to know the day, to make all the country round them blaze, and all their tenants mad. And, if any one of mine be ſober upon the occaſion, Pritchard ſhall eject him. And, on the birth of the firſt child, if a ſon, I will do ſomething more for you, and repeat all our rejoicings.</p>
               <p>I ought indeed to have written ſooner. But I knew, that if you thought me long, and were in haſte as to your nuptials, you would write and tell me ſo. But my gout was very troubleſome: And I am but a ſlow writer, you know, at beſt: For Compoſing is a thing, that tho' formerly I was very ready at it (as my Lord Lexington uſed to ſay); yet having left it off a great while, I am not ſo now. And I choſe, on this occaſion, to write all out of my own head and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory; and to give you my beſt advice; for I may never have ſuch an opportunity again. You have had (God mend you!) a ſtrange way of turning your back upon all I have ſaid; This once, I hope, you
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:0447200104:192"/>
will be more attentive to the advice I give you for your own good.</p>
               <p>I had ſtill another end; nay, two other ends.</p>
               <p>The one was, That now you are upon the borders of wedlock, as I may ſay, and <hi>all your wild cats will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e ſown,</hi> I would give you ſome inſtructions as to your public as well as private behaviour in life; which, intending you ſo much good as I'do, you ought to hear; and perhaps would never have liſten'd to, on any leſs extraordinary occaſion.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is, That your dear lady-elect (who is, it ſeems, herſelf ſo fine and ſo ſententious a writer) will ſee by this, that it is not our faults, nor for want of the beſt advice, that you was not a better man than you have hitherto been.</p>
               <p>And now, in few words, for the conduct I would wiſh you to follow in public, as well as in private; if you would think me worthy of adviſing. It ſhall be ſhort; ſo be not uneaſy.</p>
               <p>As to the <hi>private</hi> life: Love your Lady as ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves. <hi>Let your actions praiſe you.</hi> Be a good huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band; and ſo give the lye to all your enemies; and make them aſham'd of their ſcandals: And let us have pride in ſaying, that Miſs Harlowe has not done either herſelf, or family, any diſcredit by coming among us. Do this; and I, and your aunts, will love you for ever.</p>
               <p>As to your <hi>public</hi> conduct:—This is what I could wiſh: But I reckon your Lady's wiſdom will put us both right—No diſparagement, Sir; ſince, with all your wit, you have not hitherto ſhewn much wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, you know.</p>
               <p>Get into parliament as ſoon as you can: For you have talents to make a great figure there. Who ſo proper to aſſiſt in making new holding laws, as thoſe whom no law in being could hold?</p>
               <p>Then, for ſo long as you will give attendance, in St. Stephen's chapel—(Its being called a chapel, I hope,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:0447200104:193"/>
will not <hi>diſguſt</hi> you: I am ſure I have known many a riot there:—A Speaker has a hard time of it! But we <hi>Peers</hi> have more decorum.—But what was I going to ſay?—I muſt go back.</p>
               <p>For ſo long as you will give your attendance in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament) for ſo long will you be out of miſchief; out of <hi>private</hi> miſchief, at leaſt: And may St. Stephen's fate be yours, if you wilfully do <hi>public</hi> miſchief!</p>
               <p>When a new election comes, you will have two or three Boroughs, you know, to chooſe out of:—But if you ſtay till then, I had rather you were for the Shire.</p>
               <p>You'll have intereſt enough, I am ſure; and being ſo handſome a man, the women will make their huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands vote for you.</p>
               <p>I ſhall long to read your ſpeeches. I expect you will ſpeak, if occaſion offers, the very firſt day. You want no courage; and think highly enough of your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and lowly enough of every-body elſe, to ſpeak on all occaſions.</p>
               <p>As to the methods of the houſe, you have ſpirit enough, I fear, to be too much above them: Take care of that.—I don't ſo much fear your want of good-manners. To <hi>men,</hi> you want no decency, if they don't provoke you: As to that, I wiſh you'd only learn to be as patient of contradiction from others, as you would have other people be to <hi>you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Altho' I would not have you to be a Courtier; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would I have you be a Malecontent. I remember (for I have it down) what my old friend Archibald Hutcheſon ſaid, and it was a very good ſaying—(to Mr. Secretary Craggs, I think, it was)—
<q rend="inline margQuotes">'I look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an adminiſtration, as intitled to every vote I can with good conſcience give it; for a Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons ſhould not needleſly put drags upon the wheels of Government: And, when I have not given it my vote, it was with regret: And, for my Country's ſake, I wiſh'd with all my heart, the meaſure had been ſuch as I could have approved.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="187" facs="tcp:0447200104:194"/>And another ſaying he had, which was this;
<q rend="inline margQuotes">'Neither can an Oppoſition, neither can a Miniſtry, be always wrong. To be a plumb man therefore with either, is an infallible mark, that that man muſt mean more and worſe than he will own he does mean.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>Are theſe Sayings bad, Sir? Are they to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed?—Well then, why ſhould I be deſpiſed for remembering them, and quoting them, as I love to do? Let me tell you, if you loved my company more than you do, you would not be the worſe for it: I may ſay ſo without any vanity; ſince it is other mens wiſdom, and not my own, that I am ſo fond of. But to add a word or two more, on this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; and I may never have ſuch another; for you <hi>muſt</hi> read this thro'—Love honeſt men, and herd with them, in the houſe and out of the houſe; by whatever names they be dignified or diſtinguiſhed: <hi>Keep good men company, and you ſhall be of the number.</hi> But did I, or did I not, write this before?—Writing, at ſo many different times, and ſuch a quantity, one may forget.</p>
               <p>You may come in for the title when I am dead and gone—God help me!—So I would have you keep an equilibrium. If once you get the name of being a fine ſpeaker, you may have any thing: And, to be ſure, you have naturally a great deal of elocution; a tongue that would delude an angel, as the women ſay: To their ſorrow, ſome of them, poor creatures!—A leading man in the Houſe of Commons, is a very import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant character; becauſe that houſe has the giving of money: And <hi>Money makes the mare to go</hi>; ay, and Queens and Kings too, ſometimes, to go in a manner very different from what they might otherwiſe chooſe to go, let me tell you.</p>
               <p>However, methinks, I would not have you take a place neither—It will double your value, and your

               <p>THOU ſeeſt, Belford, how we now drive before the wind.—The dear creature now comes almoſt at the firſt word, whenever I deſire the honour of her company.

                  </gap>o thoſe of my own mother; which I put into his hands at the ſame time. It had been, I ſaid, no ſmall part of my concern, that her frequent diſpleaſure, and our mutual miſapprehenſions, had hindered me from adviſing with her before, on this ſubject. Indeed, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ndeed, my deareſt life, ſaid I, you have hitherto af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded me but a very thorny courtſhip.</p>
               <p>She was ſilent. <hi>Kindly</hi> ſilent. For well know I, that ſhe could have recriminated upon me with a ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance.—But I was willing to ſee, if ſhe were not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="190" facs="tcp:0447200104:197"/>Now, Belford, I have actually depoſited theſe writings with Counſellor Williams; and I expect the draughts in a week at furtheſt. So ſhall be doubly armed. For if I attempt, and fail, theſe will be ready to throw in, to make her have patience with me till I can try again.</p>
               <p>I have more contrivances ſtill in embryo. I could tell thee of an hundred, and ſtill hold another hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred in petto, to pop in, as I go along, to excite thy ſurprize, and to keep up thy attention. Nor rave thou at me; but, if thou art my friend, think of Miſs Howe's letters, and of her ſmuggling ſcheme. All owing to my fair captive's informations and incite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.—Am I not a <hi>villain,</hi> a <hi>fool,</hi> a <hi>Beelzebub,</hi> with them already?—Yet no harm done by me, nor ſo much as attempted?</p>
               <p>Every thing of this nature, the dear creature an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered (with a downcaſt eye, and a bluſhing cheek), ſhe left to me.</p>
               <p>I propoſed my Lord's chapel for the celebration, where we might have the preſence of Lady Betty, Lady Sarah, and my two couſins Montague.</p>
               <p>She ſeemed not to favour a public celebration; and waved this ſubject for the preſent. I did ſuppoſe, that ſhe would not chooſe to be married in public, any more than me: So I preſſed not this matter further juſt then.</p>
               <p>But patterns I actually produced; and a jeweller was to bring as this day ſeveral ſets of jewels, for her choice. But the patterns ſhe would not open. She ſighed at the mention of them; The ſecond patterns, ſhe ſaid, that had been offered to her <note n="(a)" place="bottom">See Vol. <hi>I.</hi> p. <hi>279.</hi>
                  </note>: And very peremptorily forbid the jeweller's coming; as well as declined my offer of getting my own mother's to be new-ſet; at leaſt for the preſent.</p>
               <p>I do aſſure thee, Belford, I was in earneſt in all this. My whole eſtate is nothing to me, put in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition with her hoped-for favour.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="191" facs="tcp:0447200104:198"/>She then told me, that ſhe had written her opinion of my general propoſals; and there had expreſſed her mind, as to cloaths and jewels:—But on my beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour to her, for no cauſe that ſhe knew of, on Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day night, ſhe had torn the paper in two. I earneſtly preſſed her to let me be favoured with a ſight of this paper, torn as it was. And after ſome heſitation, ſhe withdrew, and ſent it to me by Dorcas.</p>
               <p>I peruſed it again. It was in a manner new to me, tho' I had read it ſo lately; and by my ſoul I could hardly ſtand it. An hundred admirable creatures I called her to myſelf.—But I charge thee, write not a word to me in her favour, if thou meaneſt her well; for if I ſpare her, it muſt be all <hi>ex mero motu.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You may eaſily ſuppoſe, when I was re-admitted to her preſence, that I ran over in her praiſes, and in vows of gratitude, and everlaſting love. But here's the devil; ſhe ſtill receives all I ſay with reſerve; or if it be not with reſerve, ſhe receives it ſo much as her due, that ſhe is not at all raiſed by it. Some women are undone by praiſe, by flattery. I myſelf am proud of praiſe.—Perhaps thou wilt ſay, that thoſe are moſt proud of it, who leaſt deſerve it—As thoſe are of riches and grandeur, who are not born to either. I own, that it requires a ſoul to be ſuperior to theſe foibles. Have I not then a ſoul?—Surely, I have.—Let me then be conſider'd as an exception to the rule.</p>
               <p>Now have I a foundation to go upon in my terms. My Lord, in the exuberance of his generoſity, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions a thouſand pounds a year peny-rents. <hi>This</hi> I know, that were I to marry this Lady, he would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſettle upon her all he has a mind to ſettle, than upon me: And has even threatened, that if I prove not a good huſband to her, he will leave all he can at his death, from me, to her.—Yet conſiders not, that a woman ſo perfect, can never be diſpleaſed with her huſband but to <hi>his</hi> diſgrace; for who will blame <hi>her?</hi>
                  <pb n="192" facs="tcp:0447200104:199"/>
Another reaſon, why a Lovelace ſhould not wiſh to marry a CLARISSA.</p>
               <p>But what a pretty fellow of an uncle mine, to think of making a wife independent of her emperor, and a rebel of courſe—Yet ſmarted himſelf for an error of this kind!</p>
               <p>My beloved, in her torn paper, mentions but two hundred pounds a year, for her ſeparate uſe. I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted upon her naming a larger ſum. She ſaid, it might then be three; and I, for fear ſhe ſhould ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect very large offers, named five, and the intire diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal of all arrears in her father's hands, for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of Mrs. Norton, or whom ſhe pleaſed.</p>
               <p>She ſaid, that the good woman would be uneaſy, if any thing more than a competency were done for her. She was for ſuiting all her diſpoſitions of this kind, ſhe ſaid, to the uſual way of life of the perſon. To go beyond it, was but to put the benefited upon projects, or to make them aukward in a new ſtate, when they might ſhine in that they were accuſtomed to. And to put it into ſo good a mother's power to give her ſon a beginning in his buſineſs, at a proper time; yet to leave her ſomething for herſelf, to ſet her above want, or the neceſſity of taking back from her child what ſhe had been enabled to beſtow upon him, would be the height of ſuch a worthy parent's ambition.</p>
               <p>Here is prudence! Here is judgment in ſo young a creature! How do I hate the Harlowes for producing ſuch an angel!—O why, why, did ſhe refuſe my ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere addreſs to tie the knot before we came to this houſe!</p>
               <p>But yet, what mortifies my pride, is, that this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted creature, if I were to marry her, would not be governed in her behaviour to me by love, but by ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity merely, or by blind duty; and had rather live ſingle, than be mine.</p>
               <p>I cannot bear this. I would have the woman whom I honour with my name, if ever I confer this honour
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:0447200104:200"/>
upon any, forego even her ſuperior duties for me. I would have her look after me when I go out, as far as ſhe can ſee me, as my Roſebud after her Johnny; and meet me at my return with rapture. I would be the ſubject of her dreams, as well as of her waking thoughts. I would have her look upon every moment loſt, that is not paſſed with me: Sing to me, read to me, play to me when I pleaſed; no joy ſo great as in obeying me. When I ſhould be inclined to love, overwhelm me with it; when to be ſerious or ſolitary, if intruſive, awfully ſo; retiring at a nod; approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me only if I ſmiled encouragement: Steal into my preſence with ſilence; out of it, if not noticed, on tiptoe. Be a <hi>Lady Eaſy</hi> to all my pleaſures, and valuing thoſe moſt, who moſt contributed to them; only ſighing in private, that it was not <hi>herſelf</hi> at the time.—Thus of old did the contending wives of the honeſt patriarchs; each recommending her handmaid to her lord, as ſhe thought it would oblige him, and looking upon the genial product as her own.</p>
               <p>The gentle Waller ſays, <hi>Women are born to be controul'd.</hi> Gentle as he was, he knew that. A ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant-huſband makes a dutiful wife. And why do the Sex love rakes, but becauſe they know how to direct their uncertain wills, and manage them?</p>
               <p>ANOTHER agreeable converſation. The day of days the ſubject. As to fixing a particular one, that need not be done till the ſettlements are completed. As to marrying at my Lord's chapel, the ladies of my family preſent, that would be making a public affair of it; and my charmer obſerved with regret, that it ſeemed to be my Lord's intention to make it ſo.</p>
               <p>It could not be imagined, I ſaid, but that his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip's ſetting out in a litter, and coming to town, as well as his taſte for glare, and the joy he would take to ſee me married at laſt, would give it as much the
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:0447200104:201"/>
air of a public marriage, as if the ceremony were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed at his own chapel, all the ladies preſent.</p>
               <p>She could not bear the thoughts of a public day. It would carry with it an air of inſult upon her whole family. And, for her part, if my Lord would not take it amiſs (and perhaps he would not, as the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion came not from himſelf, but from me), ſhe would very willingly diſpenſe with his Lordſhip's preſence; the rather, as dreſs and appearance would then be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary. For ſhe could not bear to think of decking her perſon, while her parents were in tears.</p>
               <p>How excellent this, did not her parents richly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to be in tears!</p>

               <p>All obedience, all reſignation—No will but hers. I withdrew, and wrote directly to my Lord; and ſhe not diſapproving of it, ſent it away. The purport as follows; for I took no copy.</p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline margQuotes">'That I was much obliged to his Lordſhip for his intended goodneſs to me, on an occaſion that was the moſt ſolemn and awful of my life. That the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Lady, whom he ſo juſtly praiſed, thought his Lordſhip's propoſals in her favour too high. That ſhe choſe not to make a public appearance, if, without diſobliging my friends, ſhe could avoid it, till a reconciliation with her own could be effected. That altho' ſhe expreſſed a grateful ſenſe of his Lordſhip's conſent to give her to me with his own hand; yet preſuming, that the motive to his kind intention, was rather to do her honour, than that it otherwiſe would have been his own choice (eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially as travelling would be at this time ſo incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to him), ſhe thought it adviſeable to ſave his Lordſhip trouble on this occaſion; and hoped he would take, as meant, her declining the favour.'</q>

               </p>
               <p>And is not this going a plaguy length? What a figure ſhould I make in rakiſh annals, if at laſt I ſhould be caught in my own gin?</p>
               <p>The Sex may ſay what they will, but a poor inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent fellow had need to take great care of himſelf, when he dances upon the edge of the matrimonial pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipice. Many a faint-hearted man, when he began in jeſt, or only deſigned to ape gallantry, has been forced into earneſt, by being over-prompt, and taken at his word, not knowing how to own that he meant leſs, than the Lady ſuppoſed he meant. I am the better enabled to judge that this muſt have been the caſe of many a ſneaking varlet; becauſe I, who know the female world as well as any man in it of my ſtanding, am ſo frequently in doubt of myſelf, and know not what to make of the matter.</p>
               <p>Then theſe little ſly rogues, how they lie couchant, ready to ſpring upon us harmleſs fellows, the moment we are in their reach!—When the ice is once broken for them, how ſwiftly can they make to port!—Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, the ſubject they can leaſt <hi>ſpeak</hi> to, they moſt <hi>think</hi> of. Nor can you talk of the ceremony before they have laid out in their minds how it is all to be.—Little ſaucy-face deſigners! how firſt they draw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in, then us!</p>

               <head>LETTER XXXIV. Mr. <hi>LOVELACE,</hi> To <hi>JOHN BELFORD,</hi> 
                  <abbr>Eſq</abbr>
               </head>
               <p>IF, Belford, thou likeſt not my plot upon Miſs Howe, I have three or four more as good in my own opinion; better, perhaps, they will be in thine: And ſo 'tis but getting looſe from thy preſent engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and thou ſhalt pick and chooſe. But as for thy three brethren, they muſt do as I'd have them: And ſo, indeed, muſt thou:—Elſe why am I your general?—But I will refer this ſubject to its proper ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Thou knoweſt, that I never abſolutely conclude upon a project, till 'tis time for execution: And then lightning ſtrikes not quicker than I.</p>
               <p>And now to the ſubject next my heart.</p>
               <p>Wilt thou believe me, when I tell thee, that I have ſo many contrivances riſing up and crouding upon me for preference, with regard to my Gloriana, that I hardly know which to chooſe?—I could tell thee of no leſs than ſix princely ones, any of which <hi>muſt</hi> do. But as the dear creature has not grudged giving me trouble, I think I ought not, in gratitude, to ſpare combuſtibles for her; but, on the contrary, to make her ſtare and ſtand aghaſt, by ſpringing three or four mines at once.</p>
               <p>Thou remembreſt what Shakeſpeare, in his Troilus and Creſſida, makes Hector, who, however, is not uſed to boaſt, ſay to Achilles, in an interview between them; and which, applied to this watchful Lady, and to the vexation ſhe has given me, and to the certainty I now think I have of ſubduing her; will run thus:—Suppoſing the charmer before me; and I meditating her ſweet perſon from head to foot:
<q>
                     <l>Henceforth, <hi>O watchful fair one,</hi> guard thee well:</l>
                     <l>For I'll not kill thee There! nor There! nor There!</l>
                     <l>But, by the <hi>zone that circles Venus' waiſt,</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>
                        <pb n="198" facs="tcp:0447200104:205"/>I'll kill thee Ev'ry-where; yea, o'er and o'er,</l>
                     <l>Thou, wiſeſt <hi>Belford,</hi> pardon me this brag:</l>
                     <l>
                        <hi>Her watchfulneſs</hi> draws folly from my lips;</l>
                     <l>But I'll endeavour <hi>deeds</hi> to match the <hi>words,</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>Or may I never—</l>
                  </q>
Then, I imagine thee interpoſing to qualify my impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, as Ajax did to Achilles:
<q>
                     <l>—Do not chafe thee, couſin:</l>
                     <l>—And let theſe threats alone,</l>
                     <l>Till <hi>accident</hi> or <hi>purpoſe</hi> bring thee to it.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>And now, Jack, what doſt think?</p>
               <p>That thou art a curſed fellow, if—</p>
               <p>If! No If's—But I ſhall be very ſick to-morrow. I ſhall, 'faith.</p>
               <p>Sick!—Why ſick?—What a devil ſhouldſt thou be ſick for?</p>
               <p>For more good reaſons than one, Belford.</p>
               <p>I ſhould be glad to hear but one.—Sick, quotha! Of all thy roguiſh inventions, I ſhould not have thought of this.</p>
               <p>Perhaps thou thinkeſt my view to be, to draw the lady to my bedſide: That's a trick of three or four thouſand years old; and I ſhould find it much more to my purpoſe, if I could get to her's. However, I'll condeſcend to make thee as wiſe as myſelf.</p>
               <p>I am exceſſively diſturb'd about this ſmuggling ſcheme of Miſs Howe. I have no doubt, that my fair one will fly from me, if ſhe can, were I to make an attempt, and miſcarry. I once believed ſhe loved me: But now I doubt whether ſhe does or not: At leaſt, that it is with ſuch an <hi>ardor,</hi> as Miſs Howe calls it, as will make her overlook a premeditated fault, ſhould I be guilty of one.</p>
               <p>And what will being ſick do for thee?</p>
               <p>Have patience. I don't intend to be ſo very bad as Dorcas ſhall repreſent me to be. But yet I know
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:0447200104:206"/>
I ſhall reach confoundedly, and bring up ſome clot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted blood. To be ſure, I ſhall break a veſſel: There's no doubt of that; and a bottle of Eaton's ſtyptic ſhall be ſent for; but no doctor. If ſhe has <hi>humanity,</hi> ſhe will be concerned. But if ſhe has <hi>love,</hi> let it have been puſh'd ever ſo far back, it will, on this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, come forward, and ſhew itſelf; not only in her eye, but in every line of her ſweet face.</p>
               <p>I will be very intrepid. I will not fear death, or any thing elſe. I will be ſure of being well in an hour or two, having formerly found great benefit by this balſamic medicine, on occaſion of an inward bruiſe by a fall from my horſe in hunting, of which, perhaps, this malady may be the remains. And this will ſhew her, that tho' thoſe about me may make the moſt of it, I don't; and ſo can have no deſign in it.</p>
               <p>Well, methinks thou ſayeſt, I begin to think to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerably of this device.</p>
               <p>I knew thou wouldſt, when I explained myſelf. Another time prepare to wonder; and baniſh doubt.</p>
               <p>Now, Belford, if ſhe be not much concerned at the broken veſſel, which, in one ſo fiery in his temper as I have the reputation to be thought, may be very dangerous; a malady that I ſhall calmly attribute to the haraſſes and doubts, that I have laboured under for ſome time paſt; which will be a further proof of my love, and will demand a grateful return—</p>
               <p>What then, thou egregious contriver?</p>
               <p>Why then I ſhall have the leſs remorſe, if I am to uſe a little violence: For can ſhe deſerve compaſſion, who ſhews none?</p>
               <p>And what if ſhe ſhew a great deal of concern?</p>
               <p>Then ſhall I be in hope of building on a good foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation. Love hides a multitude of faults, and dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes thoſe it cannot hide. Love, when found out, or acknowleged, authorizes freedom; and freedom
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:0447200104:207"/>
begets freedom; and I ſhall then ſee how far I can go.</p>
               <p>Well but, Lovelace, how the duce wilt thou, with that full health and vigour of conſtitution, and with that bloom in thy face, make any-body believe thou art ſick?</p>
               <p>How!—Why take a few grains of Ipecacuanha; enough to make me reach like a fury.</p>
               <p>Good!—But how wilt thou manage to bring up blood, and not hurt thyſelf?</p>
               <p>Fooliſh fellow! Are there not pigeons and chick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens in every poulterer's ſhop?</p>
               <p>Cry thy mercy.</p>
               <p>But then I will be perſuaded by Mrs. Sinclair, that I have of late confined myſelf too much; and ſo will have a chair called, and be carried to the Park; where I will try to walk half the length of the Mall, or ſo; and in my return, amuſe myſelf at White's or the Cocoa.</p>
               <p>And what will this do?</p>
               <p>Queſtioning again?—I am afraid thou'rt an infidel, Belford.—Why then ſhall I not know if my beloved offers to go out in my abſence?—And ſhall I not ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And now, Belford, wilt thou, or wilt thou not, allow, that it is a right thing to be ſick?—Lord, Jack, ſo much delight do I take in my contrivances, that I ſhall be half-ſorry, when the occaſion for them is over; for never, never ſhall I again have ſuch charming exerciſe for my invention.</p>
               <p>Mean time theſe plaguy women are ſo impertinent, ſo full of reproaches, that I know not how to do any thing but curſe them. And then, truly, they are for helping me out with ſome of their trite and vulgar artifices.—Sally particularly; who pretends to be a mighty contriver, has juſt now, in an inſolent manner,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:0447200104:208"/>
told me, on my rejecting her proffer'd aids, that I had no mind to conquer; and that I was ſo <hi>wicked</hi> as to intend to marry, tho' I would not own it to her.</p>
               <p>Becauſe this little devil made her firſt ſacrifice at my altar, ſhe thinks ſhe may take any liberty with me: And what makes her outrageous at times, is, that I have, for a long time, <hi>ſtudiouſly,</hi> as ſhe ſays, ſlighted her too readily offer'd favours: But is it not very impudent in her to think, that I will be any man's ſucceſſor? It is not come to that neither. This, thou knoweſt, was always my rule—<hi>Once any other man's,</hi> and <hi>I</hi> know it, and <hi>never more mine.</hi> It is for ſuch as thou, and thy brethren, to take up with <hi>harlots.</hi> I have been always aiming at the merit of a firſt diſcoverer.</p>

               <p>But now this was to take down my countenance. It has done it: For, with violent reachings, having taken enough to make me ſick, and not enough water to carry it off, I preſently looked as if I had kept my bed a fortnight. <hi>Ill-jeſting,</hi> as I thought in the midſt of the exerciſe, <hi>with edge-tools,</hi> and worſe with <hi>phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical ones.</hi>

               <p>Two hours it held me.

               <p>EVERY one now is ſure, that ſhe loves me. Tears were in her eyes more than once for me. She ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd me to take her hand, and kiſs it as often as I pleaſed.

               <p>While Mrs. Sinclair, and Dorcas, and Polly, and even poor ſilly Mabell (for Sally went out, as my angel came in), with uplifted hands and eyes, ſtood thanking Heaven that I was better, in audible whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers: See the power of love, cry'd one!—What a charming huſband, another!—Happy couple, all!</p>

               <p>MR. Lovelace, my dear, has been very ill. Sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly taken. With a vomiting of blood in great quantities. Some veſſel broken. He complained of a diſorder in his ſtomach over-night. I was the more affected with it, as I am afraid it was occaſioned by the violent contentions between us.—But was I in fault?</p>
               <p>How lately did I think I hated him!—But hatred and anger, I ſee, are but temporary paſſions with me. One cannot, my dear, hate people in danger of death, or who are in diſtreſs or affliction. My heart, I find, is not proof againſt kindneſs, and acknowlegement of errors committed.</p>
               <p>He took great care to have his illneſs concealed from me as long as it could. So tender in the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of his diſorder!—So deſirous to make the beſt of it!—I wiſh he had not been ill in my ſight. I was too much affected—Every-body alarming me with his danger—The poor man, from ſuch high health ſo <hi>ſuddenly</hi> taken!—And ſo unprepared!—</p>
               <p>He is gone out in a chair. I adviſed him to do ſo. I fear that my advice was wrong; ſince Quiet in ſuch a diſorder muſt needs be beſt. We are apt to be ſo ready, in caſes of emergency, to give our advice, without judgment, or waiting for it!—I propoſed a phyſician indeed; but he would not hear of one. I have great honour for the faculty; and the greater, as I have always obſerved, that thoſe who treat the
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:0447200104:217"/>
profeſſors of the art of healing contemptuouſly, too generally treat higher inſtitutions in the ſame manner.</p>
               <p>I am really very uneaſy. For I have, I doubt, expoſed myſelf to him, and to the women below. <hi>They</hi> indeed will excuſe me, as they think us mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried. But if he be not generous, I ſhall have cauſe to regret this ſurprize; which has taught me more than I knew of myſelf; as I had reaſon to think my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf unaccountably treated by him.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſs let me tell you (what I hope I may juſtly tell you, that if again he give me cauſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume diſtance and reſerve, I hope my reaſon will ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtrength enough from his imperfections (for Mr. Lovelace, my dear, is not a wiſe man in all his ways) to enable me to keep my paſſions under.—What can we do more than govern ourſelves by the temporary lights lent us?</p>
               <p>You will not wonder that I am grave on this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection—<hi>Detection,</hi> muſt I call it? What can I call it?—I have not had heart's-eaſe enough, to inſpect that heart as I ought.</p>
               <p>Diſſatisfied with myſelf, I am afraid to look back upon what I have written. And yet know not how to have done writing. I never was in ſuch an odd frame of mind.—I know not how to deſcribe it.—Was <hi>you</hi> ever <hi>ſo?</hi>—Afraid of the cenſure of her I love—Yet not conſcious that I deſerve it.</p>
               <p>Of this, however, I am convinced, that I ſhould <hi>indeed</hi> deſerve cenſure, if I kept any ſecret of my heart from you.</p>
               <p>But I will not add another word, after I have aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured you, that I will look ſtill more narrowly into myſelf: And that I am</p>

               <p>I Had a charming airing. No return of my ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady. My heart perfectly eaſy, how could my ſtomach be otherwiſe?</p>
               <p>But when I came home, I found that my ſweet ſoul had been alarmed by a new incident. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry after us both, in a very ſuſpicious manner, and that by deſcription of our perſons, and not by names, by a ſervant in a blue livery turned up and trimmed with yellow.</p>
               <p>Dorcas was called to him, as the upper ſervant, and ſhe refuſing to anſwer any of his queſtions, unleſs he told his buſineſs, and from whom he came, the fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, as ſhort as ſhe, ſaid, That if ſhe would not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer <hi>him,</hi> perhaps ſhe might anſwer ſomebody <hi>elſe</hi>; and went away out of humour.</p>
               <p>Dorcas hurried up to her lady, and alarmed her not only with the fact, but with her own conjectures; adding, that he was an ill-looking fellow, and ſhe was ſure could come for no good.</p>
               <p>The livery and the features of the ſervant were particularly inquired after, and as particularly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed—<hi>Lord bleſs her! no end of her alarms, ſhe thought!</hi> And then was ſhe aforehand with every evil that could happen.</p>
               <p>She wiſhed Mr. Lovelace would come in.</p>
               <p>Mr. Lovelace came in ſoon after; all lively, grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, full of hopes, of duty, of love, to thank his charmer, and to congratulate with her upon the cure ſhe had performed. And then ſhe told the ſtory, with all its circumſtances; and Dorcas, to point her lady's fears, told us, that the ſervant was a ſun-burnt fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and looke as if he had been at ſea.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="212" facs="tcp:0447200104:219"/>He was then, no doubt, Captain Singleton's ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, and the next news ſhe ſhould hear, was, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> the houſe was ſurrounded by a whole ſhip's crew; th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> veſſel lying no farther off, as ſhe underſtood, than Rotherhith.</p>
               <p>Impoſſible, I ſaid. Such an attempt would not be uſher'd in by ſuch a manner of inquiry. And why may it not rather be a ſervant of your couſin Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den's, with notice of his arrival, and of his deſign to attend you?</p>
               <p>This ſurmize delighted her. Her apprehenſions went off, and ſhe was at leiſure to congratulate me upon my ſudden recovery; which ſhe did in the moſt obliging manner.</p>
               <p>But we had not ſat long together, when Dorcas again came fluttering up to tell us, that the footman, the <hi>very</hi> footman, was again at the door, and inquired, whether Mr. Lovelace and his Lady, by name, had no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> lodgings in this houſe? He aſked, he told Dorcas, for no harm: But this was a demonſtration with my appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive fair-one, that harm was intended. And as the ſellow had not been anſwered by Dorcas, I propoſed to go down to the ſtreet-parlour, and hear what he had to ſay.</p>
               <p>I ſee your cauſeleſs terror, my deareſt life, ſaid I, and your impatience—Will you be pleaſed to walk down—And without being obſerved, as he ſhall come no farther than the parlour-door, you may hear all that paſſes?</p>
               <p>She conſented. We went down. Dorcas bid the man come forward.—Well, friend, what is your bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs with Mr. or Mrs. Lovelace?</p>
               <p>Bowing, ſcraping, I am ſure you are the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, Sir. Why, Sir, my buſineſs is only to know if your honour be here, and to be ſpoke with; or it you ſhall be here for any time?</p>
               <p>Who came you from?</p>
               <p>From a gentleman who ordered me to ſay, if I was
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:0447200104:220"/>
                  <hi>made</hi> to tell, but not elſe, it was from a friend of Mr. John Harlowe's, Mrs. Lovelace's eldeſt uncle.</p>
               <p>The dear creature was ready to ſink upon this. It was but of late, that ſhe had provided herſelf with ſalts. She pulled them out.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing of Colonel Morden, friend, ſaid I?</p>
               <p>No; I never heard of his name.</p>
               <p>Of Captain Singleton?</p>
               <p>No, Sir. But the gentleman, my maſter, is a cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain too.</p>
               <p>What is his name?</p>
               <p>I don't know if I ſhould tell.</p>
               <p>There can be no harm in telling the gentleman's name, if you come upon a good account.</p>
               <p>That I do; for my maſter told me ſo; and there is not an honeſter gentleman on the face of <hi>God's earth.</hi>—His name is Captain Tomlinſon, Sir.</p>
               <p>I don't know ſuch a one.</p>
               <p>I believe not, Sir. He was pleaſed to ſay, He don't know your honour, Sir; but I heard him ſay, as how he ſhould not be an unwelcome viſitor to you, for all that.</p>
               <p>Do you know ſuch a man as Captain Tomlinſon, my deareſt life, <hi>aſide,</hi> your uncle's friend?</p>
               <p>No; but my uncle may have acquaintance, no doubt, that I don't know.—But I hope, trembling, this is not a trick.</p>
               <p>Well, friend, if your maſter has any thing to ſay to Mr. Lovelace, you may tell him, that Mr. Love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace is here; and will give him a meeting whenever he pleaſes.</p>
               <p>The dear creature looked as if afraid that my en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement was too prompt for my own ſafety; and away went the fellow.—<hi>I</hi> wondering, that <hi>ſhe</hi> might not wonder, that this Captain Tomlinſon, whoever he was, came not himſelf, or ſent not a letter the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time, when he had reaſon to ſuppoſe that I might be here.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="214" facs="tcp:0447200104:221"/>Mean time, for fear that this ſhould be a contrive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of James Harlowe's, who, I ſaid, loved plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, though he had not a head turned for it, I gave ſome precautionary directions to the ſervants, and the women, whom, for the greater parade, I aſſembled before us: And my beloved was reſolved not to ſtir abroad till ſhe ſaw the iſſue of this odd affair.</p>
               <p>And here muſt I cloſe though in ſo great a puzzle.</p>
               <p>Only let me add, that poor Belton wants thee; for I dare not ſtir for my life.</p>
               <p>Mowbray and Tourville ſkulk about like vaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonds, without heads, without hands, without ſouls; having neither Thee nor Me to conduct them. They tell me, they ſhall ruſt beyond the power of oil or action to brighten them up, or give them motion.</p>

               <p>THIS ſtory of Captain Tomlinſon employed us not only for the time we were together laſt night, but all the while we ſat at breakfaſt this morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. She would ſtill have it, that it was the prelude to ſome miſchief from Singleton. I inſiſted, that it might much more probably be a method taken by Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel Morden to alarm her, previous to a perſonal viſit. Travelled gentlemen affected to ſurprize in this manner. And why, deareſt creature, ſaid I, muſt every thing that happens, which we cannot im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately account for, be what we leaſt wiſh?</p>
               <p>She had had ſo many diſagreeable things befal her of late, that her fears were too often ſtronger than her hopes.</p>
               <p>And this, Madam, makes me apprehenſive, that you will get into ſo low-ſpirited a way, that you will
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:0447200104:222"/>
not be able to enjoy the happineſs that ſeems to await us.</p>
               <p>Her duty and her gratitude, ſhe gravely ſaid, to the Diſpenſer of all good, would ſecure her, ſhe hoped, againſt unthankfulneſs. And a thankful ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit was the ſame as a joyful one.</p>
               <p>So, Belford, for all her future joys ſhe depends in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely upon the Inviſible Good. She is certainly right; ſince thoſe who fix leaſt upon Second Cauſes are the leaſt likely to be diſappointed—And is not this gravity for her gravity?</p>
               <p>She had hardly done ſpeaking, when Dorcas came running up in a hurry—She ſet even <hi>my</hi> heart into a palpitation—Thump, thump, thump, like a precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated pendulum in a clock-caſe—Flutter, flutter, flut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter my charmer's, as by her ſweet boſom riſing to her chin I ſaw.</p>
               <p>This lower claſs of people, my Beloved herſelf ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, were for ever aiming at the ſtupid Wonderful, and for making even common incidents matter of ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize.</p>

               <p>Sir, I have no intereſt in the affair I come about. I may appear officious; and if I thought I ſhould, I would decline any concern in it, after I have juſt hinted what it is.</p>
               <p>And what, pray, Sir, is it?</p>
               <p>May I aſk you, Sir, without offence, whether you wiſh to be reconciled, and to co-operate upon honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able terms, with <hi>one</hi> gentleman of the name of Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe; preparative, as it may be hoped, to a general reconciliation?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>O how my heart flutter'd,</hi> cried my charmer!</p>
               <p>I can't tell, Sir [<hi>And then it flutter'd ſtill more, no doubt</hi>]: The whole family have uſed me extremely ill. They have taken greater liberties with my cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter than are juſtifiable, and with my family <hi>too</hi>; which I can leſs forgive.</p>
               <p>Sir, Sir, I have done. I beg pardon for this intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>My Beloved then was ready to ſink, and thought very hardly of me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But pray, Sir, to the immediate purpoſe of your preſent commiſſion; ſince a commiſſion it ſeems to be?</p>
               <p>It <hi>is</hi> a commiſſion, Sir; and-ſuch a one, as I thought would be agreeable to all parties, or I ſhould not have given myſelf concern about it.</p>
               <p>Perhaps it <hi>may,</hi> Sir, when known. But let me aſk you one previous queſtion? Do you know Colonel Morden, Sir?</p>
               <p>No, Sir. If you mean <hi>perſonally,</hi> I do not. But I have heard my good friend Mr. John Harlowe talk of him with great reſpect; and as a co-truſtee with him in a certain truſt.</p>
               <p>I thought it probable, Sir, ſaid I, that the Colonel might be arrived; that you might be a gentleman of
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:0447200104:225"/>
his acquaintance; and that ſomething of an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſurprize might be intended.</p>
               <p>Had Colonel Morden been in England, Mr. John Harlowe would have known it; and then I ſhould not have been a ſtranger to it.</p>
               <p>Well but, Sir, have you then any commiſſion to me from Mr. John Harlowe?</p>
               <p>Sir, I will tell you, as briefly as I can, the whole of what I have to ſay; but you'll excuſe <hi>me</hi> alſo a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious queſtion, for which curioſity is not my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive; but it is neceſſary to be anſwered before I can proceed; as you will judge when you hear it.</p>
               <p>What, pray, Sir, is your queſtion?</p>
               <p>Briefly, Whether you are actually, and <hi>bona fide,</hi> married to Miſs Clariſſa Harlowe?</p>
               <p>I ſtarted, and, in a haughty tone, Is this, Sir, a queſtion that <hi>muſt</hi> be anſwered before you can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in the buſineſs you have undertaken?</p>
               <p>I mean no offence, Mr. Lovelace. Mr. Harlowe ſought to me to undertake this office. I have daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and nieces of my own. I thought it a good office, or I, who have many conſiderable affairs upon my hands, had not accepted of it. I know the world; and will take the liberty to ſay, That if that young Lady—</p>
               <p>Captain Tomlinſon, I think you are called?</p>
               <p>My name is Tomlinſon.</p>
               <p>Why then, Captain Tomlinſon, no <hi>liberty,</hi> as you call it, will be taken well, that is not extremely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate, when that lady is mentioned.</p>
               <p>When you had heard me out, Mr. Lovelace, and had found, I had ſo behaved, as to make the caution neceſſary, it would have been juſt to have given it.—Allow me to ſay, I know what is due to the character of a woman of virtue, as well as any man alive.</p>
               <p>Why, Sir! Why, Captain Tomlinſon, you ſeem warm. If you intend any-thing by this [<hi>O how I trembled!</hi> ſaid the Lady, <hi>when ſhe took notice of this
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:0447200104:226"/>
part of our converſation afterwards:</hi>], I will only ſay, that this is a privileged place. It is at preſent my home, and an aſylum for any gentleman who thinks it worth his while to inquire after me, be the manner or end of his inquiry what it will.</p>
               <p>I know not, Sir, that I have given occaſion for this. I make no ſcruple to attend you <hi>elſewhere,</hi> if I am troubleſome here. I was told, I had a warm young gentleman to deal with: But as I knew my intention, and that my commiſſion was an amicable one, I was the leſs concerned about that. I am twice your age, Mr. Lovelace, I dare ſay: But I do aſſure you, that if either my meſſage, or my manner, give you of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, I can ſuſpend the one or the other for a day, or for ever, as you like. And ſo, Sir, any time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore eight to-morrow morning, you will let me know your further commands.—And was going to tell me where he might be found.</p>
               <p>Captain Tomlinſon, ſaid I, you anſwer well. I love a man of ſpirit. Have you not been in the army?</p>
               <p>I have, Sir; but have <hi>turned my ſword into a plough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhare,</hi> as the Scripture has it [<hi>There was a clever fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, Jack!—He was a good man with ſomebody, I warrant!</hi>].—And all my delight, added he, for ſome years paſt, has been in cultivating my paternal eſtate. I love a brave man, Mr. Lovelace, as well as ever I did in my life. But, let me tell you, Sir, that when you come to my time of life, you will be of opinion, that there is not ſo much true bravery in youthful choler, as you may now think there is.</p>
               <p>A clever fellow again, Belford—Ear and heart, both at once, he took in my charmer.—<hi>'Tis well,</hi> ſhe ſays, <hi>there are ſome men who have wiſdom in their anger.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Well, Captain, that is reproof for reproof. So we are upon a foot. And now give me the pleaſure of hearing your commiſſion.</p>
               <p>Sir, you muſt firſt allow me to repeat my queſtion:
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:0447200104:227"/>
Are you really, and <hi>bona fide,</hi> married to Miſs Clariſſa Harlowe? Or are you not yet married?</p>
               <p>Bluntly put, Captain. But if I anſwer that I <hi>am,</hi> what then?</p>
               <p>Why then, Sir, I ſhall ſay, that you are a man of honour.</p>
               <p>That I hope I am, whether you <hi>ſay</hi> it or not, Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Tomlinſon.</p>
               <p>Sir, I will be very frank in all I have to ſay on this ſubject.—Mr. John Harlowe has lately found out, that you and his niece are both in the ſame lodgings; that you have been long ſo; and that the lady was at the Play with you yeſterday was ſe'ennight; and he hopes, that you are actually married: He has indeed heard that you are; but, as he knows your enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing temper, and that you have declared, that you diſdain a relation to their family, he is willing by me to have your marriage confirmed from your own mouth, before he takes the ſteps he is inclined to take in his niece's favour. You will allow me to ſay, Mr. Lovelace, that he will not be ſatisfied with an anſwer that admits of the leaſt doubt.</p>
               <p>Let me tell you, Captain Tomlinſon, that it is a damn'd degree of vileneſs for any man to ſuppoſe—</p>
               <p>Sir—Mr. Lovelace—don't put yourſelf into a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. The Lady's relations are jealous of the honour of their family. They have prejudices to overcome as well as you—Advantage may have been taken—and the Lady, at the <hi>time,</hi> not to blame.</p>
               <p>This Lady, Sir, could give no ſuch advantages: And if ſhe <hi>had,</hi> what muſt the <hi>man</hi> be, Captain Tom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linſon, who could have taken them?—Do you know the Lady, Sir?</p>
               <p>I never had the honour to ſee her but once; and that was at church; and ſhould not know her again.</p>
               <p>Not know her again, Sir!—I thought that there was not a man living who had once ſeen her, and would not know her among a thouſand.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="221" facs="tcp:0447200104:228"/>I remember, Sir, that I thought I never ſaw a finer woman in my life. But, Mr. Lovelace, I believe, you will allow, that it is better that her relations ſhould have wronged <hi>you,</hi> than you the <hi>Lady.</hi> I hope, Sir, you will permit me to repeat my queſtion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Enter Dorcas, in a hurry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A <hi>gentleman,</hi> this minute, Sir, deſires to ſpeak with your honour—<hi>My Lady, Sir!—[Aſide.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Could the dear creature put <hi>Dorcas</hi> upon telling this fib, yet want to ſave <hi>me</hi> one?—</p>
               <p>Deſire the gentleman to walk into one of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours. I will wait on him preſently.</p>
               <p>[<hi>Exit Dorcas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The dear creature, I doubted not, wanted to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct me how to anſwer the Captain's home-put. I knew how I intended to anſwer it—Plumb<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thou may'ſt be ſure—But Dorcas's meſſage ſtagger'd me. And yet I was upon one of my maſter-ſtrokes—Which was, To take advantage of the Captain's inquiries, and to make her own her marriage before him, as ſhe had done to the people below; and if ſhe had been brought to that, to induce her, for her uncle's ſatisfaction, to write him a letter of gratitude; which of courſe muſt have been ſigned <hi>Clariſſa Lovelace.</hi> I was loth, therefore, thou may'ſt believe, to attend her ſudden commands: And yet, afraid of puſhing matters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond recovery with her, I thought proper to lead him from the queſtion, to account for himſelf; for Mr. Harlowe's coming at the knowlege of where we are; and for other particulars which I knew would engage her attention; and which might poſſibly convince her of the neceſſity there was for her to acquieſce in the affirmative I was diſpoſed to give. And this for her own ſake; for what; as I aſked her afterwards, is it to me, whether I am ever reconciled to a family I muſt for ever deſpiſe?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="222" facs="tcp:0447200104:229"/>You think, Captain, that I have anſwered doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to the queſtion you have put. You <hi>may</hi> think ſo. And you muſt know, that I have a good deal of pride: And only, that you are a gentleman, and ſeem in this affair to be governed by generous principles, or I ſhould ill brook being interrogated as to my honour to a lady ſo dear to me.—But before I anſwer more directly to the point, pray ſatisfy me in a queſtion or two that I ſhall put to <hi>you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>With all my heart, Sir. Aſk me what queſtions you pleaſe, I will anſwer them with ſincerity and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour.</p>
               <p>You ſay, That Mr. Harlowe has found out that we were at a Play together: And that we are both in the ſame lodgings—How pray, came he at his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege?—For, let me tell you, that I have, for certain conſiderations not reſpecting myſelf, condeſcended, that our abode ſhould be kept ſecret. And this has been ſo ſtrictly obſerved, that even Miſs Howe, tho' ſhe and my beloved correſpond, knows not directly whither to ſend to us.</p>
               <p>Why, Sir, the perſon who ſaw you at the Play, was a tenant of Mr. John Harlowe. He watched all your motions. When the Play was done, he follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed your coach to your lodgings. And early the next day, Sunday, he took horſe, and acquainted his land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord with what he had obſerved.</p>
               <p>How oddly things come about, Captain Tomlin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon!—But does any other of the Harlowes know where we are?</p>
               <p>It is an abſolute ſecret to every other perſon of the family; and ſo it is intended to be kept: As alſo that Mr. John Harlowe is willing to enter into treaty with you, by me, if his niece be actually married; for perhaps he is aware, that he ſhall have difficulty enough with ſome people to bring about the deſirable
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:0447200104:230"/>
reconciliation, altho' he could give them this aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance.</p>
               <p>I doubt it not, Captain.—To James Harlowe is all the family folly owing.—Fine fools! [<hi>heroically ſtalk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about</hi>] to be governed by one to whom malice, and not genius, gives the buſy livelineſs that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhes him from a natural!—But how long, pray, Sir, has Mr. John Harlowe been in this pacific diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition?</p>
               <p>I will tell you, Mr. Lovelace, and the occaſion; and be very explicit upon it, and upon all that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns you to know of me, and of the commiſſion I have undertaken; and this the rather, as when you have heard me out, you will be ſatisfied, that I am not an officious man in this my preſent addreſs to you.</p>
               <p>I am all attention, Captain Tomlinſon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And ſo I doubt not was my beloved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline margQuotes">'You muſt know, Sir, ſaid the Captain, that I have not been many months in Mr. John Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe's neighbourhood. I removed from North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amptonſhire, partly for the ſake of better managing one of two Executorſhips, which I could not avoid engaging in (the affairs of which frequently call me to town, and are part of my preſent buſineſs), and partly for the ſake of occupying a neglected farm, which has lately fallen into my hands. But tho' an acquaintance of no longer ſtanding, and that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencing on the Bowling-green [Uncle John is a great bowler, Belford] (upon my deciſion of a point to every one's ſatisfaction, which was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed to me by all the gentlemen; and which might have been attended with bad conſequences), no two brothers have a more cordial eſteem for each other. You know, Mr. Lovelace, that there is a <hi>conſent,</hi> as I may call it, in ſome minds, which will unite them ſtronger in a few hours, than years will

               </p>

                  <q rend="inline margQuotes">'It was on the foot of this avowed friendſhip on both ſides, that on Monday the 15th, as I very well remember, Mr. Harlowe invited himſelf home with me. And when there, he acquainted me with the whole of the unhappy affair, that had made them all ſo uneaſy. Till then I knew it only by report; for, intimate as we were, I forbore to ſpeak of what was ſo near his heart, till he began firſt. And then he told me, that he had had an application made to him two or three days before by a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man whom he named <note n="(a)" place="bottom">See Miſs Howe's Letters, Numb. <hi>iv.</hi> p. <hi>19.</hi> and Numb. <hi>x.</hi> p. <hi>37.</hi> of this Volume.</note>, to induce him not only to be reconciled to his niece himſelf, but to forward for her a general reconciliation.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline margQuotes">'A like application, he told me, had been made to his ſiſter Harlowe, by a good woman whom every-body reſpected; who had intimated, that his niece, if encouraged, would again put herſelf into the protection of her friends, and leave you: But if not, that ſhe muſt unavoidably be yours.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>I hope, Mr. Lovelace, I make no miſchief.—You look concerned—You ſigh, Sir.</p>
               <p>Proceed, Captain Tomlinſon. Pray proceed.—<hi>And I ſighed ſtill more profoundly.</hi>

               <p>Pray, Captain—Pray, Mr. Tomlinſon—No more of this ſubject. My beloved is an angel. In every thing unblameable. Whatever faults there have been, have been theirs and mine. What you would further ſay, is, that the <hi>unforgiving</hi> family rejected her appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. They did. She and I had had a miſunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.

                  <q rend="inline margQuotes">'Well, Sir; but Mr. John Harlowe could not but better conſider the matter afterwards. And he deſired my advice how to act in it.

               </p>
               <p>And what, pray, Captain, was your advice?</p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline margQuotes">'I gave it as my opinion, that if his niece were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily treated, and in diſtreſs, as he apprehended from the application to him, he would ſoon hear of her again: But that it was likely, that this applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was made without expecting it would ſucceed; and as a ſalvo only, to herſelf, for marrying without their conſent. And the rather, as he had told me, that it came from a young lady her friend, and not in a direct way from herſelf; which young lady was no favourite of the family; and therefore would hardly have been employed, had ſucceſs been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

good fortune before he ſet out; and this made him come booted and ſpurred, as I ſaw him.</p>
               <p>He dropped a hint in commendation of the people of the houſe; but it was in ſuch away, as to give no room for ſuſpicion, that he thought it neceſſary to make any inquiries after the character of perſons who make ſo genteel an appearance, as he obſerved they do.</p>
               <p>And here let me remark, to the ſame purpoſe, that my beloved might collect another circumſtance in their favour, had ſhe doubted them, from the ſilence of her uncle's inquiriſt on Tueſday, among the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.</p>

               <p>It muſt be early if I do. I muſt reach my own houſe to-morrow night, or I ſhall make the beſt of wives unhappy. And I have two or three places to call at in my way.</p>

               <p>After I had attended the Captain down to the very paſſage, I returned to the dining-room, and put on a joyful air, on my beloved's entrance into it.—O my deareſt creature, let me congratulate you on a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect ſo agreeable to your wiſhes!—And I ſnatched her hand, and ſmothered it with my kiſſes.</p>
               <p>I was going on; when, interrupting me,—You ſee, Mr. Lovelace, ſaid ſhe, how you have embaraſſed yourſelf, by your own obliquities!—You ſee, that you have not been able to return a direct anſwer to a plain and honeſt queſtion, tho' upon it depends all the happineſs you congratulate me upon the proſpect of.</p>
               <p>You know, my beſt love, what my prudent, and I will ſay, my <hi>kind</hi> motives were, for giving out, that we were married. You ſee, that I have taken
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:0447200104:236"/>
no advantage of it; and that no inconvenience has followed it.—You ſee; that your uncle wants only to be aſſured from ourſelves, that it is ſo—</p>
               <p>Not another word to this purpoſe, Mr. Lovelace. I will not only riſk, but I will forfeit, the reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſo near my heart, rather than I will go on to countenance a ſtory ſo untrue!</p>
               <p>My deareſt ſoul—Would you have me appear—</p>
               <p>I would have you appear, Sir, as <hi>you are!</hi> I am reſolved that I will appear to my uncle's friend, and to my uncle, as <hi>I am.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For one week, my deareſt life, cannot you for one week, only till the ſettlements—</p>
               <p>Not for one hour, with my own conſent.—You don't know, Sir, how much I have been afflicted, that I have appeared to the people below what I am not. But my uncle, Sir, ſhall never have it to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braid me, nor will I to upbraid myſelf, that I have wilfully paſſed myſelf upon him in falſe lights.</p>
               <p>What, my dear, would you have me to ſay to the Captain to-morrow morning?—I have given him room to think—</p>
               <p>Then put him right, Mr. Lovelace. Tell the truth. Tell him what you pleaſe of your relations favour to me: Tell him what you will about the ſettlements: And if when drawn, you will ſubmit them to his peruſal and approbation, it will ſhew him how much you are in earneſt.</p>
               <p>My deareſt life—Do you think, that he would diſapprove of the terms I have offer'd?—No.</p>
               <p>Then may I be accurſed, if I willingly ſubmit to be trampled under foot by my enemies!</p>
               <p>And may I, Mr. Lovelace, never be happy in this life, if I ſubmit to the paſſing upon my uncle Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe a wilful and premeditated falſhood for truth!—I have too long laboured under the affliction which the rejection of all my friends has given me, to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:0447200104:237"/>
their reconciliation now at ſo dear a price as at that of my veracity.</p>
               <p>The women below, my dear—</p>
               <p>What are they to me?—I want not to eſtabliſh myſelf with them. Need they know all that paſſes between my relations and you and me?</p>
               <p>Neither are they any thing to me, Madam. Only, that when, for the ſake of preventing the fatal miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs which might have attended your brother's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, I have made them think us married, I would not appear to them in a light, which you yourſelf think ſo ſhocking. By my ſoul, Madam, I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther die, than contradict myſelf ſo flagrantly, after I have related to them ſo many circumſtances of our marriage.</p>
               <p>Well, Sir, the women may believe what they pleaſe. That I have given countenance to what you told them, is my error. The many circumſtances which you own <hi>one</hi> untruth has drawn you in to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, is a juſtification of my refuſal in the preſent caſe.</p>
               <p>Don't you ſee, Madam, that your uncle wiſhes to find us married? May not the ceremony be privately over, before his mediation can take place?</p>
               <p>Urge this point no farther, Mr. Lovelace. If <hi>you</hi> will not tell the truth, <hi>I</hi> will to-morrow morning, if I ſee Captain Tomlinſon, tell it myſelf. Indeed I will.</p>
               <p>Will you, Madam, conſent, that things paſs as before with the people below? This mediation of Tomlinſon <hi>may</hi> come to nothing. Your brother's ſchemes <hi>may</hi> be purſued; the rather, that now he will know (perhaps from your uncle), that you are not under a legal protection.—You will, at leaſt, conſent, that things paſs <hi>here</hi> as before?</p>
               <p>To permit this, is to go on in an error, Mr. Love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace. But as the occaſion for ſo doing (if there <hi>can</hi> be an occaſion in your opinion, that will warrant an untruth), will, as I preſume, ſoon be over, I ſhall the
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:0447200104:238"/>
leſs diſpute that point with you. But a new error I will not be guilty of, if I can avoid it.</p>
               <p>Can I, do you think, Madam, have any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honourable view in the ſtep I ſuppoſed you would not ſcruple to take towards a reconciliation with your own family?—Not for <hi>my own</hi> ſake, you know, did I hope you to take it.—For what is it to me, if I am never reconciled to your family? I want no favours from them.</p>
               <p>I hope, Mr. Lovelace, there is no occaſion, in our preſent <hi>not</hi> diſagreeable ſituation, to anſwer ſuch a queſtion. And let me ſay, that I ſhall think my proſpects ſtill more agreeable, if, to-morrow morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, you will not only own the very truth, but give my uncle's friend ſuch an account of the ſteps you have taken, and are taking, as may keep up my uncle's favourable intentions towards me. This you may do under what reſtrictions of ſecrecy you pleaſe. Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Tomlinſon is a prudent man; a promoter of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily-peace, you find; and, I dare ſay, may be made a friend.</p>
               <p>I ſaw there was no help. I ſaw that the inflexible Harlowe ſpirit was all up in her.—A little witch!—A little—Forgive me, Love, for calling her names: And ſo I ſaid, with an air, We have had too many miſunderſtandings, Madam, for me to wiſh for new ones; I will obey you without reſerve. Had I not thought I ſhould have obliged you by the other me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod (eſpecially as the ceremony might have been over, before any thing could have operated from your uncle's intentions, and of conſequence no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth perſiſted in), I would not have propoſed it.—But think not, my beloved creature, that you ſhall enjoy, without condition, this triumph over my judgment.</p>
               <p>And then, claſping my arms about her, I gave her ſtruggled-away cheek (her charming lip deſigned) a ſervent kiſs.—And your forgiveneſs of this ſweet freedom (bowing) is that condition.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="232" facs="tcp:0447200104:239"/>She was not mortally offended.—And now muſt I make out the reſt as well as I can. But this I will tell thee, that altho' her triumph has not diminiſhed my love for her; yet has it ſtimulated me more than ever to Revenge, as thou wilt be apt to call it. But Victory or Conqueſt is the more proper name.</p>
               <p>There is a pleaſure, 'tis true, in ſubduing one of theſe watchful beauties. But, by my ſoul, Belford, men of our caſt take twenty times the pains to be rogues, that it would coſt them to be honeſt; and dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, with the ſweat of our brows, and to the puzzling of our brains (to ſay nothing of the hazards we run), do we earn our purchaſe: And ought not therefore to be grudged our ſucceſs, when we meet with it—Eſpecially as, when we have obtained our end, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiety ſoon follows; and leaves us little or nothing to ſhew for it. But this, indeed, may be ſaid of all worldly delights.—And is not that a grave reflection from me?</p>
               <p>I was willing to write up to the time. Altho' I have not carried my principal point, I ſhall make ſomething turn out in my favour from Captain Tom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linſon's errand.—But let me give thee this caution; that thou do not pretend to judge of my devices by <hi>parts</hi>; but have patience till thou ſeeſt the <hi>whole.</hi> But once more I ſwear, that I will not be <hi>out-Norris'd</hi> by a pair of novices. And yet I am very apprehenſive, at times, of the conſequences of Miſs Howe's Smug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling ſcheme.</p>
               <p>'Tis late, or rather early; for the day begins to dawn upon me. I am plaguy heavy. Perhaps I need not to have told thee that. But will only indulge a doze in my chair, for an hour; then ſhake myſelf, waſh, and refreſh. At my time of life, with my conſtitution, that's all that's wanted.</p>
               <p>Good night to me!—It cannot be broad day till I am awake.—Aw-w-w-w-haugh—Pox of this yawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing!</p>

               <p>NOW have I eſtabliſhed myſelf for ever in my charmer's heart.</p>
               <p>The Captain came at ſeven, as promiſed, and ready equipped for his journey. My beloved choſe not to give us her company till our firſt converſation was over.—Aſhamed, I ſuppoſe [But to my ſhame, if ſhe was], to be preſent at that part of it, which was to reſtore her to her virgin ſtate, by my confeſſion, after her <hi>wifehood</hi> had been reported to her uncle. But ſhe took her cue nevertheleſs, and liſtened to all that paſſed.</p>
               <p>The modeſteſt women, Jack, muſt <hi>think,</hi> and think deeply ſometimes.—I wonder whether they ever bluſh at thoſe things by themſelves, at which they have ſo charming a knack of bluſhing in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.—If not; and if bluſhing be a ſign of grace or modeſty, have not the ſex as great a command over their bluſhes, as they are ſaid to have over their tears? This reflection would lead me a great way into female minds, were I diſpoſed to purſue it.</p>
               <p>I told the Captain, that I would prevent his que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion; and accordingly, after I had injoined the ſtricteſt ſecrecy, that no advantage might be given to James Harlowe; and which he anſwered for as well on Mr. Harlowe's part as his own; I acknowleged nakedly and fairly the whole truth.—To wit,
<q rend="inline margQuotes">'That we were not yet married.—I gave him hints of the cauſes of procraſtination.—Some of them owing to

                     </gap> and to a delicacy that had no example.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>Leſs nice ladies than this, Jack, love to have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays, wilful and <hi>ſtudied</hi> delays, imputed to them in theſe caſes—Yet are indelicate in their affected deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy; for do they not thereby tacitly confeſs, that they expect to be the greateſt gainers in wedlock; and that there is <hi>ſelf-denial</hi> in the pride they take in delaying?</p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline margQuotes">'I told him the reaſon of our paſſing to the people below as marry'd—Yet as under a vow of reſtriction<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as to conſummation, which had kept us both to the height, one of <hi>ſorbearing,</hi> the other of <hi>vigilant</hi> punctilio; even to the denial of thoſe innocent free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, which betrothed lovers never ſcruple to allow and to take.</q>

                  <q rend="inline margQuotes">'I then communicated to him a copy of my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals of ſettlement; the ſubſtance of her written anſwer; the contents of my letter of invitation to Lord M. to be her nuptial father; and of my Lord's generous reply.

               <p>I have told the Captain, my dear creature—And then I briefly repeated, as if I had ſuppoſed ſhe had not heard it, all I had told him.</p>
               <p>He was aſtoniſh'd, that any-body could be diſpleaſed one moment with ſuch an angel. He undertook her cauſe as the higheſt degree of merit to himſelf.</p>
               <p>Never, I muſt needs ſay, did the angel ſo much <hi>look</hi> the angel. All placid, ſerene, ſmiling, ſelf-aſſured: A more lovely fluſh than uſual heightening her natural graces, and adding charms, even to ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diance, to her charming complexion.</p>
               <p>After we had ſeated ourſelves, the agreeable ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject was renew'd, as we took our chocolate. How happy ſhould ſhe be in her uncle's reſtored favour!</p>
               <p>The Captain engaged for it—No more delays, he hoped, of her part! Let the happy day be but <hi>once</hi> over, all would then be right!—But was it improper to aſk for copies of my propoſals, and of her anſwer, in order to ſhew them to his dear friend her uncle?</p>

               <p>I held out my hand (firſt conſecrating it with a kiſs) for hers. She condeſcended to give it me. I preſſed it to my lips: You know not, Captain Tom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linſon (with an air), all ſtorms overblown, what a happy man—</p>
               <p>Charming couple! His hands lifted up—How will my good friend rejoice!—O that he were preſent!—You know not, Madam, how dear you ſtill are to your uncle Harlowe!—</p>

               <p>He repeated his reſolutions of ſervice, and that in ſo acceptable a manner, that the dear creature wiſhed, that neither he, nor any of his, might ever want a friend of equal benevolence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>None of his,</hi> ſhe ſaid; for the captain brought it in, that he had five children living, by one of the beſt of wives and mothers, whoſe excellent management made him as happy, as if his eight hundred pounds a year (which was all he had to boaſt of) were two thouſand.</p>
               <p>

               <p>The happieſt breakfaſt-time, my beloved owned, that ſhe had ever known ſince ſhe had left her father's houſe. <hi>She might have let this alone.</hi> The Captain renewed all his proteſtations of ſervice.

And we parted with great profeſſions of mutual eſteem; my beloved putting up vows for the ſucceſs of his generous mediation.</p>
               <p>When I returned from attending the Captain down ſtairs, which I did to the outward door, my beloved met me as I entered the dining-room; complacency reigning in every lovely feature.</p>
               <p>You ſee me already, ſaid ſhe, another creature. You know not, Mr. Lovelace, how near my heart this hoped-for reconciliation is. I am now willing to baniſh every diſagreeable remembrance. You know not, Sir, how much you have obliged me.

When my dear mamma (You don't know, Sir, half the excellencies of my dear mamma! and what a kind heart ſhe has, when it is left to follow its own impulſes—When this bleſſed mamma) ſhall once more fold me to her indulgent boſom! When I ſhall

again have uncles and aunts, and a brother and ſiſter, all ſtriving who ſhall ſhew moſt kindneſs and favour to the poor outcaſt, then <hi>no more</hi> an outcaſt!—And you, Mr. Lovelace, to behold all this, and to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into a family ſo dear to me, with welcome—What tho' a little cold at firſt? when they come to know you better, and to ſee you oftener, no freſh cauſes of diſguſt occurring, and you, as I hope, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing enter'd upon a new courſe, all will be warmer and warmer love on both ſides, till every one perhaps will wonder, how they came to ſet themſelves againſt you.</p>
               <p>Then drying her eyes with her handkerchief, after a few moments pauſing, on a ſudden, as if recollecting that ſhe had been led by her joy to an expreſſion of it, which ſhe had not intended I ſhould ſee, ſhe retired to her chamber with precipitation—Leaving me almoſt as unable to ſtand it, as herſelf.</p>
               <p>In ſhort, I was—I want words to ſay how I was—My noſe had been made to tingle before; my eyes have before been made to gliſten by this ſoul-moving beauty; but ſo <hi>very</hi> much affected, I never was—for, trying to check my ſenſibility, it was too ſtrong for me, and I even ſobbed—Yes, by my ſoul, I <hi>audibly</hi> ſobbed, and was forced to turn from her before ſhe had well finiſhed her affecting ſpeech.</p>
               <p>I want, methinks, now I have owned the odd ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, to deſcribe it to thee—The thing was ſo ſtrange to me—Something choaking, as it were, in my throat—I know not how—Yet, I muſt needs ſay, tho' I am out of countenance upon the recollection, that there was ſomething very pretty in it; and I wiſh I could know it again, that I might have a more perfect idea of it, and be better able to deſcribe it to thee.</p>
               <p>But this effect of her joy on ſuch an occaſion gives me a high notion of what that virtue muſt be [What other name can I call it?] which in a mind ſo capabl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But if it can, how intirely right are parents to cultivate their daughters minds, and to inſpire them with notions of reſerve and diſtance to our ſex; and indeed to make them think highly of their own?

               </head>
               <p>AND now it is time to confeſs (and yet I know, that thy conjectures are aforehand with my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition), that this Captain Tomlinſon, who is ſo great a favourite with my charmer, and who takes ſo much delight in healing breaches, and reconciling differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, is neither a greater man nor a leſs, than honeſt Patrick M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Donald, attended by a diſcarded footman of his own finding out.</p>
               <p>Thou knoweſt what a various-lifed raſcal he is; and to what better hopes born and educated. But that ingenious knack of Forgery, for which he was expell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Dublin-Univerſity, and a detection ſince in Evidenceſhip, have been his ruin. For theſe have thrown him from one country to another; and at laſt, into the way of life, which would make him a fit huſband for Miſs Howe's Townſend with her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trabands. He is, thou knoweſt, admirably qualified for any enterprize that requires adroitneſs and ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity. And can there, after all, be a higher piece of juſtice aimed at, than to keep one Smuggler in readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to play againſt another?</p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline margQuotes">'Well but, Lovelace (methinks thou queſtioneſt), how cameſt thou to venture upon ſuch a contrive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:0447200104:249"/>
as this, when, as thou haſt told me, the Lady uſed to be a month at a time at this uncle's; and muſt therefore, in all probability, know, that there was not a Captain Tomlinſon in all his neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood; at leaſt no one of the name ſo intimate with him, as this man pretends to be?'</q>—</p>
               <p>This objection, Jack, is ſo natural a one, that I could not help obſerving to my charmer, that ſhe muſt ſurely have heard her uncle ſpeak of this gentleman. No, ſhe ſaid, ſhe never had. Beſides, ſhe had not been at her uncle Harlowe's for near ten months [<hi>This I had heard her ſay before</hi>]: And there were ſeveral gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men who uſed the ſame Green, whom ſhe knew not.</p>
               <p>We are all very ready, thou knoweſt, to believe what we like.</p>
               <p>And what was the reaſon, thinkeſt thou, that ſhe had not been of ſo long time at this uncle's?—Why, this old ſinner, who imagines himſelf intitled to call me to account for my freedoms with the Sex, has lately fallen into familiarities, as it is ſuſpected, with his houſekeeper, who aſſumes airs upon it.—A curſed deluding Sex!—In youth, middle age, or dotage, they take us all in.</p>
               <p>Doſt thou not ſee, however, that this houſekeeper knows nothing, nor is to know any thing, of the treaty of reconciliation deſigned to be ſet on foot; and therefore the Uncle always comes to the Captain, the Captain goes not to the Uncle: And this I ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to the Lady. And then it was a natural ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion, that the Captain was the rather applied to, as he is a ſtranger to the reſt of the family: Need I tell thee the meaning of all this?</p>
               <p>But this intrigue of the <hi>Antient</hi> is a piece of private hiſtory, the truth of which my beloved cares not to own, and indeed affects to diſbelieve. As ſhe does alſo ſome puiſny gallantries of her fooliſh brother; which, by way of recrimination, I have hinted at, without naming my informant in their family.</p>

                  <pb n="243" facs="tcp:0447200104:250"/>Well but, methinks, thou queſtioneſt again, Is it not probable that Miſs Howe will make inquiry after ſuch a man as Tomlinſon?—And when ſhe cannot—</p>
               <p>I know what thou wouldſt ſay—But I have no doubt, that Wilſon will be ſo good, if I deſire it, as to give into my own hands any letter that may be brought by Collins to his houſe, for a week to come. And now I hope thou'rt ſatisfied.</p>
               <p>I will conclude with a ſhort ſtory.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Do thou, Belford, make the application. This I know, that I have given greater joy to my Beloved, than ſhe had thought would ſo ſoon fall to her ſhare.

                     <p>My Lord regrets,
<q rend="inline margQuotes">'that he is not to be the Lady's nuptial father. He ſeems apprehenſive that I have

                     <p>With all my heart. If I can have Miſs Clariſſa Harlowe, the devil take every thing elſe.</p>
                     <p>A good deal of other ſtuff writes this ſtupid Peer; ſcribbling in ſeveral places half a dozen lines, appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently for no other reaſon, but to bring in as many muſty words in an old ſaw.</p>

                     <p>ALL ſtill happier and happier. A very high honour done me: A chariot, inſtead of a coach, permitted, purpoſely to indulge me in the ſubject of ſubjects.</p>
                     <p>Our diſcourſe in this ſweet airing turned upon our future manner of life. The day is baſhfully promiſed me. <hi>Soon,</hi> was the anſwer to my repeated urgency. Our equipage, our ſervants, our liveries, were parts of the delightful ſubject. A deſire that the wretch who had given me intelligence out of the family [honeſt Joſeph Leman] might not be one of our menials; and her reſolution to have her faithful Hannah, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther recovered or not; were ſignified; and both as readily aſſented to.</p>
                     <p>The reconciliation proſpect was enlarged upon. If her uncle Harlowe will but pave the way to it, and if it can be brought about, ſhe ſhall be happy.—Happy, with a ſigh, <hi>as it is Now poſſible ſhe can be!</hi>—She won't forbear, Jack!</p>
                     <p>I told her, that I had heard from Pritchard, juſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ſet out, and expected him in town to-morrow from Lord M. to take my directions. I ſpoke with gratitude of my Lord's kindneſs to me; and with pleaſure of my aunt's and couſin's veneration for her: As alſo of his Lordſhip's concern that his gout hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd him from writing a reply with his own hand to my laſt.</p>
                     <p>She pitied my Lord. She pitied poor Mrs. Fretcli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:0447200104:257"/>
too; for ſhe had the goodneſs to inquire after her. The dear creature pitied every-body that ſeemed to want pity. Happy in her own proſpects, ſhe has lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to look abroad, and wiſhes every-body equally happy.</p>
                     <p>It is likely to go very hard with Mrs. Fretchville. Her face, which ſhe had valued herſelf upon, will be utterly ruin'd. This good, however, ſhe may reap from ſo great an evil:—As the greater malady generally ſwallows up the leſs, ſhe may have a grief on this occaſion, that may diminiſh the other grief, and make it tolerable.</p>
                     <p>I had a gentle reprimand for this light turn on ſo heavy an evil.—For what was the loſs of beauty to the loſs of a good huſband?—Excellent creature!</p>
                     <p>Her hopes, and her pleaſure upon thoſe hopes, that Miſs Howe's mother would be reconciled to her, were alſo mentioned. <hi>Good</hi> Mrs. Howe was her word, for a woman ſo covetous, and ſo remorſeleſs in her cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs, that no one elſe would call her <hi>good.</hi> But this dear creature has ſuch an extenſion in her love, as to be capable of valuing the moſt inſignificant animal related to thoſe whom ſhe reſpects. <hi>Love me, and love my dog,</hi> I have heard Lord M. ſay.—Who knows, but that I may in time, in compliment to myſelf, bring her to think well of thee, Jack?</p>
                     <p>But what am I about?—Am I not all this time arraigning my own heart?—I know I am, by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe I feel in it, while my pen bears teſtimony to her excellence. But yet I muſt add (for no ſelfiſh conſideration ſhall hinder me from doing juſtice to this admirable creature), that in this converſation ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated ſo much prudent knowlege in every thing that relates to that part of the domeſtic management, which falls under the care of a miſtreſs of a family, that I believe ſhe has no equal of her years in the world.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I break off, to re-peruſe ſome of Miſs Howe's viru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.</hi>

                        <hi>Curſed letters, theſe of Miſs Howe, Jack!—Do thou turn back to thoſe of mine, where I take notice of them.</hi>—I proceed—</p>
                     <p>Upon the whole, my charmer was all gentleneſs, all eaſe, all ſerenity, throughout this ſweet excurſion. Nor had ſhe reaſon to be otherwiſe: For it being the firſt time that I had the honour of her company <hi>ſola,</hi> I was reſolved to encourage her, by my reſpectful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to repeat the favour.</p>
                     <p>On our return, I found the counſellor's clerk waiting for me, with a draught of the marriage-ſettlements.</p>
                     <p>They are drawn, with only the neceſſary variations, from thoſe made for my mother. The original of which (now returned by the counſellor), as well as the new draughts, I have put into my Beloved's hands.</p>
                     <p>This made the lawyer's work eaſy; nor can ſhe have a better precedent; the great Lord S. having ſettled them, at the requeſt of my mother's relations; all the difference, my charmer's are 100 <hi>l. per annum</hi> more than my mother's.</p>
                     <p>I offer'd to read to her the old deed, while ſhe looked over the draught; for ſhe had refuſed her preſence at the examination with the clerk: But this ſhe alſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined.</p>
                     <p>I ſuppoſe ſhe did not care to hear of ſo many chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, firſt, ſecond, third, fourth, fifth, ſixth, and ſeventh ſons, and as many daughters, <hi>to be begotten upon the body of the ſaid Clariſſa Harlowe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Charming matrimonial recitativoes!—tho' it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſaid <hi>lawfully begotten</hi> too—As if a man could beget children <hi>unlawfully</hi> upon the body of his own wife.—But thinkeſt thou not that theſe arch rogues the lawyers hereby intimate, that a man may have children by his wife <hi>before</hi> marriage?—This muſt be what they mean. Why will theſe ſly fellows put an honeſt man in mind of ſuch rogueries?—But hence,
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:0447200104:259"/>
as in numberleſs other inſtances, we ſee, that <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Goſpel</hi> are two very different things.</p>
                     <p>Dorcas, in our abſence, tried to get at the wain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcot box in the dark cloſet. But it cannot be done without violence. And to run a riſque of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence now, for mere curioſity-ſake, would be inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable.</p>
                     <p>Mrs. Sinclair and the nymphs are all of opinion, that I am now ſo much of a favourite, and have ſuch a viſible ſhare in her confidence, and even in her affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that I may do what I will, and plead violence of <hi>paſſion</hi>; which, they will have it, makes violence of <hi>action</hi> pardonable with their ſex; as well as an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed extenuation with the unconcerned of both ſexes; and they all offer their helping hands. Why not? they ſay: Has ſhe not paſſed for my wife before them all?—And is ſhe not in a fine way of being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to her friends; which was the pretence for poſtponing conſummation?</p>
                     <p>They again urge me, ſince it is ſo difficult to make <hi>night</hi> my friend, to an attempt in the <hi>day.</hi> They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mind me, that the ſituation of their houſe is ſuch, that no noiſes can be heard out of it; and ridicule me for making it neceſſary for a lady to be undreſſed. It was not always ſo with me, poor old man! Sally told me; ſaucily flinging her handkerchief in my face.</p>

                     <p>I endeavoured to juſtify my paſſion, by laying over-delicacy at her door. That was <hi>not,</hi> ſhe ſaid, <hi>my</hi> fault, if it were <hi>hers.</hi> She muſt plainly tell me, that I appeared to her incapable of diſtinguiſhing what were the requiſites of a pure mind. Perhaps, had the <hi>liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> preſumption to imagine, that there was no differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in <hi>heart,</hi> nor any but what proceeded from <hi>edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> and <hi>cuſtom,</hi> between the pure and the impure—And yet cuſtom <hi>alone,</hi> as ſhe obſerved, would make a ſecond nature, as well in good as in bad habits.</p>
                     <p>I HAVE juſt now been called to account for ſome innocent liberties which I thought myſelf intitled to take before the women; as they ſuppoſe us married, and now within view of conſummation.</p>
                     <p>I took the lecture very hardly; and with impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence wiſh'd for the happy day and hour, when I might call her all my own, and meet with no check from a niceneſs that had no example.</p>
                     <p>She looked at me with a baſhful kind of contempt. I thought it <hi>contempt,</hi> and required the reaſon for it; not being conſcious of offence, as I told her.</p>
                     <p>This is not the firſt time, Mr. Lovelace, ſaid ſhe, that I have had cauſe to be diſpleaſed with you, when <hi>you,</hi> perhaps, have not thought yourſelf exception<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.—But, Sir, let me tell you, that the married ſtate, in my eye, is a ſtate of purity, and (I think ſhe told me) not of <hi>licentiouſneſs</hi>; ſo at leaſt, I underſtood her.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="254" facs="tcp:0447200104:261"/>
                        <hi>Marriage-purity,</hi> Jack!—Very comical, 'faith—Yet, ſweet dears, half the female world ready to run away with a rake, <hi>becauſe</hi> he is a rake; and for no <hi>other</hi> reaſon; nay, every other reaſon <hi>againſt</hi> their choice.</p>
                     <p>But have not you and I, Belford, ſeen young wives, who would be thought modeſt; and when maids, were fantaſtically ſhy; permit freedoms in public from their <hi>lambent</hi> huſbands, which have ſhewn, that they have forgot what belongs either to prudence or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency? While every modeſt eye has ſunk under the ſhameleſs effrontery, and every modeſt face been co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with bluſhes for thoſe who could not bluſh.</p>
                     <p>I once, upon ſuch an occaſion, propoſed to a circle of a dozen, thus ſcandalized, to withdraw; ſince they muſt needs ſee that as well the <hi>lady,</hi> as the gentleman, wanted to be in private. This motion had its effect upon the amorous pair; and I was applauded for the check given to their licentiouſneſs.</p>
                     <p>But, upon another occaſion of this ſort, I acted a little more in character.—For I ventured to make an attempt upon a bride, which I ſhould not have had the courage to make, had not the unbluſhing paſſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with which ſhe received her fond huſband's public toyings (looking round her with triumph rather than with ſhame, upon every lady preſent), incited my curioſity to know if the ſame complacency might not be ſhewn to a private friend. 'Tis true, I was in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour obliged to keep the ſecret. But I never ſaw the turtles bill afterwards, but I thought of Number Two to the ſame female; and in my heart thanked the fond huſband for the leſſon he had taught his wife.</p>
                     <p>From what I have ſaid, thou wilt ſee, that I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of my beloved's exception to <hi>public</hi> loves. That, I hope, is all the charming Iſicle means by <hi>marriage-purity.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>From the whole of the above, thou wilt gather, that I have not been a mere dangler, a Hickman, in
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:0447200104:262"/>
the paſſed days, though not abſolutely active, and a Lovelace.</p>
                     <p>The dear creature now conſiders herſelf as my wife-elect. The <hi>unſadden'd</hi> heart, no longer prudiſh, will not now, I hope, give the fable turn to every action of the man ſhe diſlikes not. And yet ſhe muſt keep up ſo much reſerve, as will juſtify paſt inflexibilities. Many and many a pretty ſoul would yield, were ſhe not afraid that the man ſhe favoured would think the worſe of her for it. This is alſo a part of the Rake's Creed. But ſhould ſhe reſent ever ſo ſtrongly, ſhe cannot now break with me; ſince, if ſhe does, there will be an end of the family reconciliation; and that in a way highly diſcreditable to herſelf.</p>

                     <p>JUST returned from Doctors-Commons. I have been endeavouring to get a licence. Very true, Jack. I have the mortification to find a difficulty in obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this all-fettering inſtrument, as the Lady is of rank and fortune, and as there is no conſent of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or <hi>next friend.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I made report of this difficulty. It is very right, ſhe ſays, that ſuch difficulties ſhould be made. But not to a man of my known fortune, ſurely, Jack, tho' the woman were the daughter of a duke.</p>
                     <p>I aſked, If ſhe approved of the ſettlements? She ſaid, She had compared them with my mother's, and had no objection. She had written to Miſs Howe upon the ſubject, ſhe owned; and to inform her of our preſent ſituation <note n="(a)" place="bottom">As this Letter of the Lady contains no new matter, but what may be collected from thoſe of Mr. Lovelace, it is omitted.</note>.</p>
                     <p>JUST now, in high good humour, my beloved re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned me the draughts of the ſettlements; a copy of which I had ſent to Captain Tomlinſon. She com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plimented me, that ſhe never had any doubt of my
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:0447200104:263"/>
honour in caſes of this nature.—In matters between man and man nobody ever had, thou knoweſt. I had need, thou'lt ſay, to have ſome good qualities.</p>
                     <p>Great faults and great virtues are often found in the ſame perſon. In nothing <hi>very</hi> bad, but as to women: And did not one of them begin with me <note n="(a)" place="bottom">

                     <p>We have held, that women have no ſouls: I am a very Jew in this point, and willing to believe they have not. And if ſo, to whom ſhall I be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for what I do to them? Nay, if ſouls they have, as there is no ſex in Ethereals, nor need of any, what plea can a lady hold of injuries done her in her lady-<hi>ſtate,</hi> when there is an end of her lady-<hi>ſhip?</hi>

               <p>I Am now almoſt in deſpair of ſucceeding with this charming froſt-piece by love or gentleneſs.—A copy of the draughts, as I told thee, has been ſent to Captain Tomlinſon; and that by a ſpecial meſſenger. Ingroſſments are proceeding with. I have been again at the Commons. Should in all probability have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured a licence by Malory's means, had not Malory's friend the proctor been ſuddenly ſent for to Cheſhunt, to make an old lady's will. Pritchard has told me by word of mouth, <hi>though my charmer ſaw him not,</hi> all that was neceſſary for her to know in the letter my Lord wrote, which I could not ſhew her; and taken my directions about the eſtates to be made over to me on my nuptials.—Yet with all theſe favourable ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances no conceding moment to be ſound, no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proveable tenderneſs to be raiſed.</p>
               <p>Twice indeed with rapture, which once ſhe called rude, did I ſalute her; and each time, reſenting the freedom, did ſhe retire; tho', to do her juſtice, ſhe
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:0447200104:264"/>
favoured me again with her preſence at my firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaty, and took no notice of the cauſe of her with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing.</p>
               <p>Is it policy to ſhew ſo open a reſentment for inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent liberties, which, in her ſituation, ſhe muſt ſo ſoon forgive?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Yet the woman who reſents not initiatory freedoms muſt be loſt.</hi> For Love is an incroacher. Love never goes backward. Love is always aſpiring. Always muſt aſpire. Nothing but the higheſt act of Love can ſatisfy an indulged Love. And what advantages has a lover, who values not breaking the peace, over his miſtreſs, who is ſolicitous to keep it!</p>
               <p>I have now at this inſtant wrought myſelf up, for the dozenth time, to a half-reſolution. A thouſand agreeable things I have to ſay to her. She is in the dining-room. Juſt gone up. She always expects me when there.</p>
               <p>HIGH diſpleaſure!—followed by an abrupt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture.</p>
               <p>I ſat down by her. I took both her hands in mine. I would <hi>have</hi> it ſo. All gentle my voice.—Her father mentioned with reſpect. Her mother with reverence. Even her brother amicably ſpoken of. I never thought I could have wiſhed ſo ardently, as I told her I did wiſh, for a reconciliation with her family.</p>
               <p>A ſweet and grateful fluſh then overſpread her fair face; a gentle ſigh now-and-then heaved her hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerchief.</p>
               <p>I perfectly long'd to hear from Captain Tomlinſon. It was impoſſible for her uncle to find fault with the draught of the ſettlements: I would not, however, be underſtood, by ſending them down, that I intended to put it in her uncle's power to delay my happy day. When, when, was it to be?</p>
               <p>I would haſten again to the Commons; and would not return without the licence.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="258" facs="tcp:0447200104:265"/>The Lawn I propoſed to retire to, as ſoon as the happy ceremony was over. This day and that day I propoſed.</p>
               <p>It was time enough to name the day, when the ſettlements were completed, and the licence obtained. Happy ſhould ſhe be, could the kind Captain Tom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linſon obtain her uncle's preſence privately!</p>
               <p>A good hint!—It may perhaps be improved upon—Either for a <hi>delay,</hi> or a <hi>pacifier.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>No new delays, for heaven's ſake, I beſought her; reproaching her gently for the paſt. Name but the day—(an early day, I hoped in the following week)—that I might hail its approach, and number the tardy hours.</p>
               <p>My cheek reclined on her ſhoulder—kiſſing her hands by turns. Rather baſhfully than angrily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctant, her hands ſought to be withdrawn; her ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der avoiding my reclined cheek—Apparently loth and more loth to quarrel with me; her downcaſt eye confeſſing more than her lips could utter.—Now ſurely, thought I, it is my time to try if ſhe can for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give a ſtill bolder freedom than I had ever yet taken.</p>
               <p>I then gave her ſtruggling hands liberty. I put one arm round her waiſt: I imprinted a kiſs on her ſweet lips, with a <hi>Be quiet</hi> only, and an averted face, as if ſhe feared another.</p>
               <p>Encouraged by ſo gentle a repulſe, the tendereſt things I ſaid; and then, with my other hand, drew aſide the handkerchief that concealed the beauty of beauties, and preſſed with my burning lips the charmingeſt breaſt that ever my raviſhed eyes beheld.</p>
               <p>A very contrary paſſion to that which gave her bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom ſo delightful a ſwell, immediately took place. She ſtruggled out of my incircling arms with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation. I detained her reluctant hand. Let me go, ſaid ſhe. I ſee there is no keeping terms with you. Baſe incroacher! Is this the deſign of your flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering ſpeeches?—Far as matters have gone, I will
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:0447200104:266"/>
for ever renounce you. You have an odious heart. Let me go, I tell you.—</p>
               <p>I was forced to obey, and ſhe flung from me, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating <hi>baſe,</hi> and adding <hi>flattering,</hi> incroacher.</p>
               <p>IN vain have I urged by Dorcas for the promiſed favour of dining with her. She would not dine <hi>at all.</hi> She <hi>could not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But why makes ſhe every inch of her perſon thus ſacred?—So near the time too, that ſhe muſt ſuppoſe, that all will be my own, by deed of purchaſe and ſettlement?</p>
               <p>She has read, no doubt, of the art of the Eaſtern monarchs, who ſequeſter themſelves from the eyes of their ſubjects, in order to excite their adoration, when, upon ſome ſolemn occaſions, they think fit to appear in public.</p>
               <p>But let me aſk thee, Belford, whether (on theſe ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn occaſions) the preceding cavalcade; here a great officer, and there a great miniſter, with their ſatellites, and glaring equipages; do not prepare the eyes of the wondering beholders, by degrees, to bear the blaze of canopy'd majeſty (what tho' but an ugly old man per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps himſelf? yet) glittering in the collected riches of his vaſt empire?</p>
               <p>And ſhould not my beloved, for her own ſake, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend, by <hi>degrees,</hi> from <hi>goddeſs-hood</hi> into <hi>humanity?</hi> If it be <hi>pride</hi> that reſtrains her, ought not that pride to be puniſhed? If, as in the Eaſtern emperors, it be <hi>art</hi> as well as <hi>pride, art</hi> is what ſhe of all women need not uſe. If <hi>ſhame,</hi> what a ſhame to be aſhamed to communicate to her adorer's ſight the moſt admirable of her perſonal graces?</p>
               <p>Let me periſh, Belford, if I would not forego the brighteſt diadem in the world, for the pleaſure of ſeeing a Twin-Lovelace at each charming breaſt, drawing from it his firſt ſuſtenance; the pious taſk continued for one month, and no more!</p>

               <p>A Letter received from the worthy Captain Tom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linſon, has introduced me into the preſence of my charmer, ſooner than perhaps I ſhould otherwiſe have been admitted.</p>
               <p>Sullen her brow, at her firſt entrance into the dine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-room. But I took no notice of what had paſſed, and her anger ſlid away upon its own ice.</p>

                  <q rend="inline margQuotes">'The Captain, after letting me know, that he choſe not to write, till he had the promiſed draught of the ſettlements, acquaints me, that his friend Mr. John Harlowe, in their firſt conference (which was held as ſoon as he got down), was extremely ſurprized, and even grieved (as he feared he would be) to hear, that we were not married.

               <p>
                  <q rend="inline margQuotes">'His nephew James, he was ſure, would make a great handle of it againſt any motion that might be made towards a reconciliation; and with the greater

ſucceſs, as there was not a family in the kingdom more jealous of their honour than theirs.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>This is true of the Harlowes, Jack: They have been called <hi>The proud Harlowes:</hi> And I have ever found, that all young Honour is ſupercilious and touchy.</p>
               <p>But ſeeſt thou not how right I was in my endeavour to perſuade my fair one to allow her uncle's friend to think us married; eſpecially as he came <hi>prepared</hi> to believe it; and as her uncle <hi>hoped</hi> it was ſo?—But nothing on earth is ſo perverſe, as a woman when ſhe is ſet upon carrying a point, and has a <hi>meek</hi> man, or one who loves his <hi>peace,</hi> to deal with.</p>
               <p>My Beloved was vexed. She pulled out her hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerchief: But was more inclined to blame me, than herſelf.</p>
               <p>Had you kept your word, Mr. Lovelace, and left me when we came to town—And there ſhe ſtopt; for ſhe knew, that it was her own fault that we were not marry'd before we left the country; and how could I leave her afterwards, while her brother was plotting to carry her off by violence?</p>
               <p>Nor has he yet given over his machinations.</p>
               <p>For, as the Captain proceeds,
<q rend="inline margQuotes">'Mr. John Harlowe owned to him (but in confidence), that his nephew is at this time buſied in endeavouring to find out where we are; being aſſured, as I am not to be heard of at any of my relations, or at my uſual lodgings, that we are together. And that we are not mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, is plain, as he will have it, from Mr. Hick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's application ſo lately made to her uncle; and which was ſeconded by Mrs. Norton to her mother.

                  <pb n="262" facs="tcp:0447200104:269"/>I read on to the following effect:</p>

               <p>Here again ſhe wept, took a turn croſs the room; then returned—Read on, ſaid ſhe—</p>

               <p>I will take the letter with me, by-and-by—I cannot <hi>ſee</hi> to read it juſt now, wiping her eyes.—Read on—Let me hear it all—that I may know your ſentiments upon this letter, as well as give my own.</p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline margQuotes">'The Captain then told uncle John, the reaſons that induced me to give out that we were married; and the conditions on which my Beloved was brought to countenance it; which had kept us at the moſt punctilious diſtance.</q>

               <p>UNSUCCESSFUL as hitherto my application to thee has been, I cannot for the heart of me for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear writing once more in behalf of this admirable
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:0447200104:274"/>
woman: And yet am unable to account for the zeal which impels me to take her part with an earneſtneſs ſo ſincere.</p>
               <p>But all her merit thou acknowlegeſt; all thy own vileneſs thou confeſſeſt, and even glorieſt in it; what hope then of moving ſo harden'd a man?—Yet, as it is not too late, and thou art nevertheleſs upon the criſis, I am reſolved to try what another letter will do. It is but my writing in vain, if it do no good; and if thou wilt let me prevail, I know thou wilt hereafter think me richly intitled to thy thanks.</p>
               <p>To <hi>argue</hi> with thee would be folly. The caſe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not require it. I will only <hi>intreat</hi> thee, therefore, that thou wilt not let ſuch an excellence loſe the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of her vigilant virtue.</p>
               <p>I believe, there never were libertines ſo vile, but purpoſed, at ſome future period of their lives, to ſet about reforming; and let me beg of thee, that thou wilt, in this great article, make thy future repentance as eaſy, as ſome time hence thou wilt wiſh thou <hi>hadſt</hi> made it. If thou proceedeſt, I have no doubt, that this affair will end tragically, one way or other. It muſt. Such a woman muſt intereſt both gods and men in her cauſe. But what I moſt apprehend, is, that with her own hand, in reſentment of the perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated outrage, ſhe (like another Lucretia) will aſſert the purity of her heart: Or, if her piety preſerve her from this violence, that waſting grief will ſoon put a period to her days. And in either caſe, will not the remembrance of thy <hi>ever-during</hi> guilt, and <hi>tranſitory</hi> triumph, be a torment of torments to thee?</p>
               <p>'Tis a ſeriouſly ſad thing, after all, that ſo fine a creature ſhould have fallen into ſuch vile and remorſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs hands: For, from thy cradle, as I have heard thee own, thou ever delightedſt to ſport with and torment the animal, whether bird or beaſt, that thou lovedſt, and hadſt a power over.</p>
               <p>How different is the caſe of this fine woman from
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:0447200104:275"/>
that of any other whom thou haſt ſeduced! I need not mention to thee, nor inſiſt upon the ſtriking differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: Juſtice, gratitude, thy intereſt, thy vows, all engaging thee; and thou certainly loving her, as far as thou art capable of love, above all her ſex. She not to be drawn aſide by art, or to be made to ſuffer from credulity, nor for want of wit and diſcernment (that will be another cutting reflection to ſo fine a mind as hers): The contention between you only unequal, as it is between naked innocence and armed guilt. In every thing elſe, as thou owneſt, her talents greatly ſuperior to thine!—What a fate will hers be, if thou art not at laſt overcome by thy reiterated remorſes!</p>

                  </note>, and (till I obſerved her meaning air, and heard her ſpeak), I ſuppoſed that ſhe had no very uncommon <hi>judgment</hi> to boaſt of: For I made, as I thought, but <hi>juſt</hi> allowances for her bloſſoming youth, and for that lovelineſs of perſon, and eaſineſs of dreſs, which I imagined muſt have taken up half her time and ſtudy to cultivate; and yet I had been prepared by thee to entertain a very high opinion of her ſenſe and her reading. Her choice of this gay fellow, upon ſuch hazardous terms (thought I), is a confirmation that her <hi>wit</hi> wants that maturity which only <hi>years</hi> and <hi>experience</hi> can give it. Her <hi>knowlege</hi> (argued I to my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf) muſt be all <hi>theory</hi>; and the complaiſance ever conſorting with an age ſo green and ſo gay, will make ſo inexperienced a lady at leaſt forbear to ſhew her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf <hi>diſguſted</hi> at freedoms of diſcourſe, in which thoſe preſent of her own ſex, and ſome of ours (ſo learned, ſo well read, and ſo travelled), allow themſelves.</p>
               <p>In this preſumption, I run on; and, having the advantage, as I conceited, of all the company but thee, and being deſirous to appear in her eyes a mighty clever fellow, I thought I <hi>ſhewed away,</hi> when I ſaid any fooliſh things that had more ſound than ſenſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

them; and when I made ſilly jeſts, which attracted the ſmiles of thy Sinclair, and the ſpecious Partington; and that Miſs Harlowe did not ſmile too, I thought was owing to her youth or affectation, or to a mixture of both, perhaps to a greater command of her fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.—Little dreamt I, that I was incurring her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt all the time.</p>
               <p>But when, as I ſaid, I heard her ſpeak; which ſhe did not till ſhe had fathomed us all; when I heard her ſentiments on two or three ſubjects, and took no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of that ſearching eye, darting into the very inmoſt cells of our frothy brains, by my faith, it made me look about me; and I began to recollect, and be aſhamed of all I had ſaid before; in ſhort, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to ſit ſilent, till every one had talk'd round, to keep my folly in countenance. And then I raiſed the ſubjects that ſhe <hi>could</hi> join in, and which ſhe <hi>did</hi> join in, ſo much to the confuſion and ſurprize of every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one of us!—For even thou, Lovelace, ſo noted for ſmart wit, repartee, and a vein of raillery, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteth all who come near thee, ſatteſt in palpable darkneſs, and lookedſt about thee, as well as we.</p>
               <p>One inſtance only, of this, ſhall I remind thee of?</p>
               <p>We talked of <hi>wit,</hi> and of <hi>wit,</hi> and aimed at it, bandying it like a ball from one to another of us, and reſting it chiefly with thee, who wert always proud enough and vain enough of the attribute; and then more eſpecially, as thou hadſt aſſembled us, as far as I know, principally to ſhew the lady thy ſuperiority over us; and us thy triumph over her. And then Tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville (who is always ſatisfied with wit at ſecond-hand; wit upon memory; other mens with), repeated ſome verſes, as applicable to the ſubject; which two of us applauded, tho' full of double entendre. Thou, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the lady's ſerious air on one of thoſe repetitions, appliedſt thyſelf to her, deſiring her notions of wit: A quality, thou ſaidſt, which every one prized, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther flowing from himſelf, or found in another.</p>

                  <pb n="270" facs="tcp:0447200104:277"/>Then it was ſhe took all our attention:—It was a quality much talked of, ſhe ſaid, but, ſhe believed, very little underſtood:—At leaſt, if ſhe might be ſo free as to give her judgment of it, from what had paſſed in the preſent converſation, ſhe muſt ſay, that Wit with Gentlemen was one thing; with Ladies, another.</p>
               <p>This ſtartled us all:—How the women looked!—How they purſed in their mouths, a broad ſmile the moment before upon each, from the verſes they had heard repeated, ſo well underſtood, as we ſaw, by their looks—While I beſought her to let us know, for our inſtruction, what Wit was with <hi>Ladies:</hi> For ſuch I was ſure it <hi>ought</hi> to be, with <hi>Gentlemen.</hi>

<pb n="272" facs="tcp:0447200104:279"/>
by the ſovereign contempt, mingled with a diſdainful kind of pity, that ſhewed, at once, her own conſcious worthy, and our deſpicable worthleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>O Lovelace! what then was the triumph, even in my eye, and what is it ſtill upon reflection, of <hi>true</hi> modeſty, of <hi>true</hi> wit, and <hi>true</hi> politeneſs, over frothy jeſt, laughing impertinence, and an obſcenity ſo ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, even to the guilty, that they cannot hint at it but under a double meaning!</p>
               <p>Then, as thou haſt ſomewhere obſerved, all her correctives <hi>avowed</hi> by her eye. Not poorly, like the generality of her ſex, affecting ignorance of meanings too obvious to be concealed; but ſo reſenting, as to ſhew each impudent laugher, the offence given to, and taken by, a purity, that had miſtaken its way, when it fell into ſuch company.</p>
               <p>Such is the woman, ſuch is the angel, whom thou haſt betrayed into thy power, and wouldſt deceive and ruin.—Sweet creature! did ſhe but know, how ſhe is ſurrounded (as I then thought as well as now think), and what is <hi>intended,</hi> how much ſooner would death be her choice, than ſo dreadful a ſituation!—And how effectually would her ſtory, were it generally known, warn all the Sex againſt throwing themſelves into the power of ours, let our vows, oaths, and proteſtations, be what they will!</p>
               <p>But let me beg of thee, once more, my dear Love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, if thou haſt any regard for thy honour, for the honour of thy family, for thy future peace, or for my opinion of thee (who yet pretend not to be ſo much moved by principle, as by that dazling merit, which ought ſtill more to attract <hi>thee</hi>), to be prevailed upon—to be—to be <hi>humane,</hi> that's all—Only, that thou wouldeſt not diſgrace our common humanity!</p>
               <p>Hardened as thou art, I know, that they are the abandoned people in the houſe who keep thee up to a reſolution againſt her. O that the ſagacious fair one,
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:0447200104:280"/>
with ſo much innocent charity in her own heart, had not ſo reſolutely held thoſe women at diſtance!—That, as ſhe boarded there, ſhe had oftener tabled with them. Specious as they are, in a week's time, ſhe would have ſeen thro' them; they could not have been always ſo guarded, as they were when they ſaw her but ſeldom, and when they prepared themſelves to ſee her; and ſhe would have fled their houſe as a place infected. And yet, perhaps, with ſo determined an enterprizer, this diſcovery might have accelerated her ruin.</p>
               <p>I know that thou art nice in thy loves. But are there not hundreds of women, who, tho' not utterly abandoned, would be taken with thee for mere <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal</hi> regards? Make a toy, if thou wilt, of principle, with regard to ſuch of the Sex as regard it as a toy; but rob not an angel of thoſe purities, which, in her own opinion, conſtitute the difference between ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic and brutal qualities.</p>
               <p>With regard to the paſſion itſelf, the leſs of ſoul in either man or woman, the more ſenſual are they. Thou, Lovelace, haſt a ſoul, tho' a corrupted one; and art more intent (as thou even glorieſt) upon the preparative ſtratagem, than upon the end of conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>See we not the natural bent of idiots and the crazed?—The very appetite is <hi>body</hi>; and when we ourſelves are moſt fools, and crazed, then are we moſt eager in theſe purſuits. See what fools this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion makes the wiſeſt men! What ſnivellers, what dotards, when they ſuffer themſelves to be run away with by it!—An <hi>unpermanent paſſion!</hi>—Since, if (aſhamed of its <hi>more proper</hi> name) we muſt call it <hi>Love, Love gratified, is Love ſatisfied—And Love ſatisfied, is Indifference begun.</hi> And this is the caſe where <hi>conſent</hi> on one ſide adds to the obligation on the other. What then but remorſe can follow a forcible attempt?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="274" facs="tcp:0447200104:281"/>Do not even chaſte lovers chooſe to be alone in their courtſhip preparations, aſhamed to have even a child to witneſs to their fooliſh actions, and more fooliſh expreſſions?—Is this deified paſſion, in its greateſt altitudes, fitted to ſtand the day?—Do not the lovers, when mutual conſent awaits their wills, retire to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts and to darkneſs, to complete their wiſhes? And ſhall ſuch a ſneaking paſſion as this, which can be ſo eaſily gratified by viler objects, be permitted to debaſe the nobleſt?</p>
               <p>Were not the delays of thy vile purpoſes owing more to the awe which her majeſtic virtue has in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired thee with, than to thy want of adroitneſs in villainy [I <hi>muſt</hi> write my free ſentiments in this caſe; for have I not <hi>ſeen</hi> the angel?]; I ſhould be ready to cenſure ſome of thy contrivances and pretences to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend the expected day, as <hi>trite, ſtale,</hi> and (to me, who know thy intention) <hi>poor</hi>; and too often reſorted to, as nothing comes of them, to be gloried in; parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly that of Mennell, the vapouriſh lady, and the ready-furniſhed houſe.</p>
               <p>She muſt have thought ſo too, at times, and in her heart deſpiſed thee for them, or love thee (ingrateful as thou art) to her misfortune; as well as entertain hope againſt probability. But this would afford an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other warning to the Sex, were they to know her ſtory; as it would ſhew them what poor pretences they muſt <hi>ſeem</hi> to be ſatisfied with, if once they put themſelves into the power of a deſigning man.</p>

                  </note>, enough ſurely haſt thou tried this paragon of virtue and vigilance. But I knew thee too well, to expect, at the <hi>time,</hi> that thou wouldeſt ſtop there. Men of our caſt, whenever they form a deſign upon any of the Sex, put no other bound to their views, than what want of power gives them. I knew, that from one advantage gained, thou wouldeſt proceed to

attempt another. Thy habitual averſion to wedlock too well I knew; and indeed thou avoweſt thy hope to bring her to <hi>cohabitation,</hi> in that very letter in which thou pretendeſt <hi>trial</hi> to be thy principal view <note n="(a)" place="bottom">

               <p>But do not even thy own frequent and involuntary remorſes, when thou haſt time, place, company, and every other circumſtance, to favour thee in thy wicked deſign, convince thee, that there can be no room for a hope ſo preſumptuous?—Why then, ſince thou wouldſt chooſe to marry her, rather than loſe her, wilt thou make her hate thee for ever?</p>
               <p>But if thou dareſt to meditate <hi>perſonal</hi> trial, and art ſincere in thy reſolution to reward her, as ſhe behaves in it, let me beſeech thee to remove her from this vile houſe: That will be to give her and thy conſcience fair play. So intirely now does the ſweet deluded excellence depend upon her ſuppoſed happier pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, that thou needeſt not to fear that ſhe will fly from thee, or that ſhe will wiſh to have recourſe to that ſcheme of Miſs Howe, which has put thee upon what thou calleſt thy <hi>maſter-ſtrokes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But whatever be thy determination on this head; and if I write not in time, but that thou haſt actually pulled off the maſk; let it not be one of thy devices, if thou wouldſt avoid the curſes of every heart, and hereafter of thy own, to give her, no not for one hour (be her reſentment ever ſo great), into the power of that villainous woman, who has, if poſſible, leſs remorſe than thyſelf; and whoſe <hi>trade</hi> it is to break the reſiſting ſpirit, and utterly to ruin the heart un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practiſed in evil.—O Lovelace, Lovelace, how many dreadful ſtories could this horrid woman tell the Sex! And ſhall that of Miſs Clariſſa Harlowe ſwell the guilty liſt?</p>
               <p>But this I might have ſpared. Of this, devil as
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:0447200104:283"/>
thou art, thou canſt not be capable. Thou couldſt not enjoy a triumph ſo diſgraceful to thy wicked pride, as well as to humanity.</p>
               <p>Shouldſt thou think, that the melancholy ſpectacle hourly before me has made me more ſerious than uſual, perhaps thou wilt not be miſtaken. But no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more is to be inferr'd from hence (were I even to return to my former courſes), but that whenever the time of cool reflection comes, whether brought on by our own diſaſters, or by thoſe of others, we ſhall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly, if capable of thought, and if we have time for it, think in the ſame manner.</p>
               <p>We neither of us are ſuch fools, as to diſbelieve a futurity, or to think, whatever be our practice, that we came hither by chance, and for no end but to do all the miſchief that we have in our power to do.—Nor am I aſhamed to own, that in the prayers which my poor uncle makes me read to him, in the abſence of a very good clergyman, who regularly attends him, I do not forget to put in a word or two for my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
               <p>If, Lovelace, thou laugheſt at me, thy ridicule will be more conformable to thy <hi>actions,</hi> than to thy <hi>belief.—Devils believe and tremble.</hi> Canſt thou be more abandoned than they?</p>
               <p>And here let me add, with regard to my poor old man, that I often wiſh thee preſent but for one half hour in a day, to ſee the dregs of a gay life running off in the moſt excruciating tortures, that the colic, the ſtone, and the gangrene, can unitedly inflict; and to hear him bewail the diſſoluteneſs of his paſt life, in the bittereſt anguiſh of a ſpirit every hour expecting to be called to its laſt account.—Yet, by all his confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, he has not to accuſe himſelf in ſixty-ſeven years of life, of half the <hi>very</hi> vile enormities, which you and I have committed in the laſt ſeven only.</p>

               <p>Yet once more, I'll take thee up.</p>

That of the widow's particularly!—I have no patience with thee.—Had not that contrivance its effect at the time, for a procraſtination?—And had I not then reaſon to fear, that ſhe would find enough to make her diſlike this houſe?

                  </gap> time, with a notion, that a houſe of her own would be ready for her ſoon, in order to induce her to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue here till it was?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Trite, ſtale,</hi> and <hi>poor!</hi>—Thou art a ſilly fellow, and no judge, when thou ſayeſt this. Had I not, like a blockhead, revealed to thee, as I <hi>went along,</hi> the ſecret purpoſes of my heart, but had kept all in, till
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:0447200104:285"/>
the event had explained my myſteries, I would have defy'd thee to have been able, any more than the lady, to have gueſſed at what was to befal her, till it had actually come to paſs. Nor doubt I, in this caſe, that, inſtead of preſuming to reflect upon her for credulity, as <hi>loving me to her misfortune,</hi> and for <hi>hoping againſt probability,</hi> thou wouldeſt have been readier by far, to cenſure her for nicety and over-ſcrupulouſneſs. And let me tell thee, that had ſhe loved me, as I wiſhed her to love me, ſhe could not poſſibly have been ſo very apprehenſive of my deſigns; nor ſo ready to be influenced by Miſs Howe's pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cautions, as ſhe has always been, altho' my general character made not for me with her.</p>
               <p>But in thy opinion, I ſuffer for that ſimplicity in my contrivances, which is their principal excellence. No machinery make I neceſſary. No unnatural flights aim I at. All pure nature, taking advantage of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as nature tends; and ſo ſimple my devices, that when they are known, thou, even thou, imagineſt, thou couldeſt have thought of the ſame. And indeed thou ſeemeſt to <hi>own,</hi> that the ſlight thou putteſt upon them, is owing to my letting thee into them before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand; undiſtinguiſhing, as well as ingrateful as thou art!</p>
               <p>Yet, after all, I would not have thee think, that I do not know my weak places. I have formerly told thee, that it is difficult for the ableſt general to ſay what he <hi>will</hi> do, or what he <hi>can</hi> do, when he is obliged to regulate his motions by thoſe of a watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful enemy <note n="(a)" place="bottom">

               <p>But let me curſorily enter into this debate with thee on this ſubject, now I am within ſight of my journey's end.</p>

               <p>All that thou ſayeſt in this charming creature's praiſe, is ſhort of what I have ſaid and written, on this inexhauſtible ſubject.</p>
               <p>Her virtue, her reſiſtance, which are her merits, are my <hi>ſtimulatives.</hi> Have I not told thee ſo twenty times over?</p>

And I have perhaps been ſpared the guilt of many ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions, in the time.</p>
               <p>What of uncommon would there be in this caſe, but for her watchfulneſs?—As well as I love intrigue and ſtratagem, doſt think, that I had not rather have gained my end with leſs trouble and leſs guilt?</p>
               <p>The man, let me tell thee, who is as wicked as he <hi>can</hi> be, is a worſe man than I am. Let me aſk any Rake in England, if, reſolving to carry his point, he would have been ſo long about it? or have had ſo much compunction as I have had?</p>
               <p>Were every Rake, nay, were every Man, to ſit down, as I do, and write all that enters into his head or into his heart, and to accuſe himſelf with equal freedom and truth, what an army of miſcreants ſhould I have to keep me in countenance!</p>
               <p>It is a maxim with ſome, that if they are left alone with a woman, and make not an attempt upon her, ſhe will think herſelf affronted.—Are not ſuch men as theſe worſe than I am?—What an opinion muſt they have of the whole Sex?</p>
               <p>Let me defend the Sex I ſo dearly love.—If theſe elder brethren of ours, thirſk they have general reaſon for their aſſertion, they muſt have kept very bad company, or muſt judge of womens hearts by their

own. She muſt be an abandoned woman, who will not ſhrink as a ſnail into its ſhell, at a groſs and ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den attempt. A modeſt woman muſt be naturally cold, reſerved, and ſhy. She cannot be ſo much, and ſo ſoon affected, as libertines are apt to imagine; and muſt, at leaſt, have ſome confidence in the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and ſilence of a man, before deſire can poſſibly put forth in her, to encourage and meet his flame. For my own part, I have been always decent in the company of women, till I was ſure of them. Nor have I ever offered a <hi>great</hi> offence, till I have found <hi>little</hi> ones paſſed over; and that they ſhunn'd me not, when they knew my character.</p>
               <p>My divine Clariſſa has puzzled me, and beat me out of my play: At one time, I hoped to overcome by <hi>intimidating</hi> her, at another by <hi>Love</hi>; by the amorous <hi>See-ſaw,</hi> as I have called it <note n="(a)" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Vol.</hi> III. <hi>p.</hi> 99.</note>. And I have only now to join <hi>ſurprize</hi> to the other two, and ſee what can be done by all three.</p>
               <p>And whoſe property, I pray thee, ſhall I invade, if I purſue my ſchemes of love and vengeance?—Have not thoſe who have a right in her, renounced that right?—Have they not wilfully expoſed her to dangers?—Yet muſt know, that ſuch a woman would be conſidered as lawful prize, by as many as could have the opportunity to attempt her?—And had they not thus cruelly expoſed her, is ſhe not a <hi>ſingle woman?</hi>—And need I tell thee, Jack, that men of our caſt, the <hi>beſt</hi> of them [the <hi>worſt</hi> ſtick at no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing] think it a great grace and favour done to the married men, if they leave them their wives to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and compound for their ſiſters, daughters, wards, and nieces?—Shocking as theſe principles muſt be to a reflecting mind; yet ſuch thou knoweſt are the principles of thouſands (who would not act by the Sex as I have acted by them, when in my power); and as often carried into practice, as their opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:0447200104:288"/>
or courage will permit.—Such therefore have no right to blame me.</p>
               <p>Thou repeatedly pleadeſt her ſufferings from her family. But I have too often anſwered this plea, to need to ſay any more now, than that ſhe has not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered for <hi>my ſake.</hi> For has ſhe not been made the victim of the malice of her rapacious brother and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious ſiſter, who only waited for an occaſion to ruin her with her other relations; and took this as the firſt, to drive her out of the houſe; and, as it happen'd, into my arms?—Thou knoweſt how much <hi>againſt her inclination.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for her <hi>own</hi> ſins, how many has the dear crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to anſwer for to <hi>Love</hi> and to <hi>me!</hi>—Twenty, and twenty times twenty, has ſhe not told me, that ſhe refuſed not the odious Solmes in favour to me? And as often has ſhe not offered to renounce me for the ſingle life, if the Implacables would have received her on that condition?—What repetitions does thy weak pity make me guilty of?</p>
               <p>To look a little farther back: Canſt thou forget what my ſufferings were from this haughty beauty, in the whole time of my attendance upon her proud mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, in the purlieus of Harlowe-Place, and at the little White Hart at Neale, as we called it?—Did I not threaten vengeance upon her then (and had I not reaſon?) for diſappointing me [I will give but this one inſtance] of a promiſed interview?</p>
               <p>O Jack! what a night had I of it, in the bleak coppice adjoining to her father's paddock!—My linen and wig frozen; my limbs abſolutely numbed; my fingers only ſenſible of ſo much warmth, as enabled me to hold a pen; and that obtained by rubbing the ſkin off, and beating with my hands my ſhivering ſides.—Kneeling on the hoar moſs on one knee, writing on the other, if the ſtiff ſcrawl could be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led writing.—My feet, by the time I had done, ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to have taken root, and actually unable to ſupport
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:0447200104:289"/>
me for ſome minutes!—Love and Rage kept then my heart in motion (and only Love and Rage could do it), or how much more than I <hi>did</hi> ſuffer, muſt I have ſuffered?</p>
               <p>I told thee, at my melancholy return, what were the contents of the letter I wrote <note n="(a)" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Vol.</hi> II. <hi>p.</hi> 118.</note>. And I ſhewed thee afterwards, her tyrannical anſwer to it <note n="(b)" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Vol.</hi> III. <hi>p.</hi> 120.</note>. Thou then, Jack, lovedſt thy friend; and pitiedſt thy poor ſuffering Lovelace. Even the affronted God of Love approved then of my threatened vengeance againſt the fair promiſer; tho' now with thee, in the day of my power, forgetful of the night of my ſufferings, he is become an advocate for her.</p>
               <p>Nay, was it not he himſelf that brought to me my adorable <hi>Nemeſis</hi>; and both together put me upon this very vow,

               <p>When I parted with my charmer (which I did with infinite reluctance, half an hour ago), it was upon her promiſe, that ſhe would not ſit up to write or read.

               <p>Once again, Why and for what all theſe convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions? This project is not to end in matrimony ſurely!</p>

               <p>At a little after two, when the whole houſe was ſtill, or ſeem'd to be ſo, and, as it proved, my Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſſa abed, and faſt aſleep; I alſo in a manner undreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for an hour before, and in my gown and ſlippers, tho', to oblige thee, writing on;—I was alarm'd by a trampling noiſe over head, and a confuſed buz of mix'd voices, ſome louder than others, like ſcolding, and little ſhort of ſcreaming, all raiſed to vocatives, as in a fright: And while I was wondering what could be the matter, down ſtairs ran Dorcas, and at my door, in an accent rather frightedly and hoarſly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, than ſhrilly clamorous, cried out Fire! Fire! And this the more alarmed me, as ſhe ſeem'd to endeavour to cry out louder, but could not.</p>
               <p>My pen (its laſt ſcrawl a benediction on my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved) dropt from my fingers; and up ſtarted I; and making but three ſteps to the door, open'd it, and cry'd Where! Where! almoſt as much terrify'd as

               <p>I was there in a moment, and found all owing to the careleſſneſs of Mrs. Sinclair's cook-maid, who, having ſat up to read the ſimple hiſtory of Doraſtus and Fau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>She had had the preſence of mind, in her fright, to tear down the half-burnt vallens, as well as curtains, and had got them, tho' blazing, into the chimney, by the time I came up; ſo that I had the ſatisfaction to find the danger happily over.</p>
               <p>Mean time Dorcas, after ſhe had directed me up ſtairs, not knowing the worſt was over, and expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every minute the houſe would be in a blaze, out of tender regard for her lady [I ſhall for ever love the wench for it] ran to her door, and rapping loudly at it, in a recovered voice, cry'd out, with a ſhrilneſs equal to her love, Fire! Fire!—The houſe is on fire!—Riſe, Madam!—This inſtant riſe—if you would not be burnt in your bed!</p>
               <p>No ſooner had ſhe made this dreadful outcry, but I heard her lady's door, with haſty violence, unbar, unbolt, unlock, and open, and my charmer's voice ſounding like that of one going into a fit.</p>
               <p>You may believe how much I was affected. I trembled with concern for her, and haſtened down faſter than the alarm of fire had made me run up, in order to ſatisfy her, that all the danger was over.</p>

but could only ſay, Oh, Mr. Lovelace! and down was ready to ſink.</p>
               <p>I claſped her in my arms with an ardor ſhe never felt before: My deareſt life! fear nothing: I have been up—The danger is over—The fire is got under—And how (fooliſh devil! to Dorcas) could you thus, by your hideous yell, alarm and frighten my angel!</p>
               <p>Oh Jack! how her ſweet boſom, as I claſp'd her to mine, heav'd and panted! I could even diſtinguiſh her dear heart flutter, flutter, flutter, againſt mine; and for a few minutes, I fear'd ſhe would go into fits.</p>
               <p>Leſt the half-lifeleſs charmer ſhould catch cold in this undreſs, I lifted her to her bed, and ſat down by her upon the ſide of it, endeavouring with the utmoſt tenderneſs, as well of action as expreſſion, to diſſipate her terrors.</p>
               <p>But what did I get by this my generous care of her, and by my <hi>ſucceſsful</hi> endeavour to bring her to her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf?—Nothing, ungrateful as ſhe was! but the moſt paſſionate exclamations: For we had both already for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got the occaſion, dreadful as it was, which had thrown her into my arms; I, from the joy of incircling the almoſt diſrobed body of the lovelieſt of her ſex; ſhe, from the greater terrors that aroſe from finding herſelf in my arms, and both ſeated on the bed, from which ſhe had been ſo lately frighted.</p>
               <p>And now, Belford, reflect upon the diſtance the watchful charmer had hitherto kept me at. Reflect upon my love, and upon my ſufferings for her: Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon her vigilance, and how long I had lain in wait to elude it; the awe I had ſtood in, becauſe of her frozen virtue and over-niceneſs; and that I never before was ſo happy with her; and then think how <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> never ſaw a bitterer, or more moving grief, when ſhe came fully to herſelf.</p>
               <p>She appealed to Heaven againſt my <hi>treachery,</hi> as ſhe called it; while I, by the moſt ſolemn vows, pleaded my own equal fright, and the reality of the danger that had alarmed us both.</p>
               <p>She conjur'd me, in the moſt ſolemn and affecting manner, by turns threatening and ſoothing, to quit her apartment, and permit her to hide herſelf from the light, and from every human eye.</p>
               <p>I beſought her pardon, yet could not avoid offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and repeatedly vow'd, that the next morning's ſun ſhould witneſs our eſpouſals: But taking, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, all my proteſtations of this kind, as an indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that I intended to proceed to the laſt extremity, ſhe would hear nothing that I ſaid; but, redoubling her ſtruggles to get from me, in broken accents, and exclamations the moſt vehement, ſhe proteſted, that ſhe would not ſurvive, what ſhe called a treatment ſo diſgraceful and villainous; and, looking all wildly round her, as if for ſome inſtrument of miſchief, ſhe eſpied a pair of ſharp-pointed ſciſſars on a chair by the bed-ſide, and endeavoured to catch them up, with deſign to make her words good on the ſpot.</p>
               <p>Seeing her deſperation, I begged her to be pacify'd; that ſhe would hear me ſpeak but one word, declaring that I intended no diſhonour to her: And having ſeized
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:0447200104:301"/>
the ſciſſars, I threw them into the chimney; and ſhe ſtill inſiſting vehemently upon my diſtance, I permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her to take the chair.</p>
               <p>But, O the ſweet diſcompoſure!—Her bared ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and arms, ſo inimitably fair and lovely: Her ſpread hands croſſed over her charming neck; yet not half concealing its gloſſy beauties: The ſcanty coat, as ſhe roſe from me, giving the whole of her admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſhape, and fine-turn'd limbs: Her eyes running-over, yet ſeeming to threaten future vengeance: And at laſt her lips uttering what every indignant look, and glowing feature, portended; exclaiming as if I had done the worſt I could do, and vowing never to forgive me; wilt thou wonder, that I could avoid reſuming the incenſed, the already too-much-provoked fair one?</p>
               <p>I did; and claſped her once more to my boſom: But, conſidering the delicacy of her frame, her force was amazing, and ſhewed how much in earneſt ſhe was in her reſentment; for it was with the utmoſt difficulty that I was able to hold her: Nor could I prevent her ſliding through my arms, to fall upon her knees: Which ſhe did at my feet: And there, in the anguiſh of her ſoul, her ſtreaming eyes lifted up to my face with ſupplicating ſoftneſs, hands folded, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhevelled hair; for her night head-dreſs having fallen off in her ſtruggling, her charming treſſes fell down in naturally ſhining ringlets, as if officious to conceal the dazling beauties of her neck and ſhoulders; her lovely boſom too heaving with ſighs, and broken ſobs, as if to aid her quivering lips, in pleading for her—In this manner, but when her grief gave way to her ſpeech, in words pronounced with that emphatical propriety, which diſtinguiſhes this admirable creature in her elocution from all the women.

               <p>I ſat ſuſpended for a moment: By my ſoul, thought I, thou art, upon full proof, an angel and no woman! Still, however, cloſe claſping her to my boſom, as I had raiſed her from her knees, ſhe again ſlid through my arms, and dropt upon them:—

and deſperation enſue, I can but marry at laſt, and then I ſhall make her amends.</p>
               <p>But I was juſtly puniſh'd;—for her door was faſt: And hearing her ſigh and ſob, as if her heart would burſt, My beloved creature, ſaid I, rapping gently, and her ſobbings ceaſing, I want but to ſay three words to you, which muſt be the moſt acceptable you ever heard from me. Let me ſee you but for one moment.</p>
               <p>I thought I heard her coming to open the door, and my heart leapt in that hope; but it was only to draw another bolt, to make it ſtill the faſter, and ſhe either could not, or would not, anſwer me, but retired to the further end of her apartment, to her cloſet, probably: And more like a fool than before, again I ſneaked away.</p>
               <p>This was my mine, my plot!—And this was all I made of it!</p>
               <p>I love her more than ever!—And well I may!—Never ſaw I ſuch poliſhed ivory as her arms and ſhoulders ſeemed to be; never touched I velvet ſo ſoft as her ſkin: Then ſuch an elegance!

               <p>But ſeeſt thou not, that I have a claim of merit for a grace that every-body hitherto had denied me? And that is, for a capacity of being moved by prayers and tears: Where, where, on this occaſion, was the <hi>callus,</hi> where the flint, that my heart was ſaid to be ſurrounded by?</p>

               <p>What a triumph has her ſex obtained in my thoughts by this trial, and this reſiſtance!</p>

               <p>As to thy apprehenſions of her committing any raſhneſs upon herſelf, whatever ſhe might have done in her paſſion, if ſhe could have ſeized upon her ſciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſars, or found any other weapon, I dare ſay, there is no fear of that from her <hi>deliberate</hi> mind.

                     <p>Why now, Jack, were it not better, upon <hi>her own</hi> notions, that ſhe ſeemed not ſo ſenſible, as ſhe will make herſelf to be, if ſhe is very angry?</p>
                     <p>But perhaps I am more afraid than I need. I believe I am. From her <hi>over</hi>-niceneſs ariſes my fear, more than from any extraordinary reaſon for reſentment. Next time, ſhe may count herſelf very happy, if ſhe come off no worſe.</p>

                     <p>I NEVER long'd in my life for any thing with ſo much impatience, as to ſee my charmer. She has been ſtirring, it ſeems, theſe two hours.</p>
                     <p>Dorcas juſt now tapp'd at her door, to take her morning commands.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>She had none for her,</hi> was the anſwer.</p>

                     <p>THREE different times tapp'd I at the door, but had no anſwer.</p>
                     <p>Permit me, deareſt creature, to inquire after your health. As you have not been ſeen to-day, I am im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient to know how you do.</p>
                     <p>Not a word of anſwer; but a deep ſigh, even to ſobbing.</p>
                     <p>Let me beg of you, Madam, to accompany me up another pair of ſtairs—You'll rejoice to ſee what a happy eſcape we have all had.</p>
                     <p>A happy eſcape indeed, Jack!—For the fire had ſcorched the window-board, findged the hangings, and burnt through the ſlit-deal lining of the window-jambs.</p>
                     <p>No anſwer, Madam!—Am I not worthy of one word?—Is it thus you keep your promiſe with me?—Shall I not have the favour of your company for two minutes, only for two minutes, in the dining-room?</p>
                     <p>Hem!—And a deep ſigh!—was all the anſwer.</p>

This once believe me. When you ſee the reality of the danger, that gave occaſion for this your unhappy reſentment, you will think leſs hardly of me. And let me beſeech you to perform a promiſe, on which I made a reliance not altogether ungenerous.</p>
                     <p>I cannot ſee you! Would to heaven I never had! If I write, that's all I can do.</p>
                     <p>Let your writing then, my deareſt life, confirm your promiſe. And I will withdraw in expectation of it.</p>

               <p>Her reply was verbal, <hi>Tell him that I care not whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he goes, nor what he does.—And this,</hi> re-urged by Dorcas, <hi>was all ſhe had to ſay to me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I looked thro' her keyhole at my going by her door, and ſaw her on her knees, at her bed's feet, her head and boſom on the bed, her arms extended [ſweet creature!], and in an agony ſhe ſeemed to be, ſobbing, as I heard at that diſtance, as if her heart would break.—By my ſoul, Jack, I am a <hi>pity</hi> ful fellow.

               <p>I can tell her, how ſhe might behave, to make me her own for ever. She knows ſhe cannot fly me.

               <p>I have now given every-thing between my Beloved and me a full conſideration; and my puzzle is over.

               <p>But, after all, I am in hopes, that ſhe will have better conſidered of every-thing by the evening. That her threat of a <hi>week</hi>'s diſtance was thrown out in the heat of paſſion; and that ſhe will allow, that I have as much cauſe to quarrel with her for breach of her word, as ſhe has with me for breach of the peace.</p>

I call for her, now in the tendereſt, now in the moſt reproachful terms, as if within hearing: Wanting <hi>her,</hi> I want my own ſoul, at leaſt every-thing dear to it. What a void in my heart! what a chilneſs in my blood, as if its circulation were arreſted! From her room to my own; in the dining-room, and in and out of every place where I have ſeen the beloved of my heart, do I hurry; in none can I tarry; her lovely image in every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one, in ſome lively attitude, ruſhing cruelly upon me, in differently remembered converſations.</p>
               <p>But when in my firſt fury, at my return, I went up two pair of ſtairs, reſolved to find the locked-up Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cas, and beheld the vainly-burnt window-board, and recollected my baffled contrivances, baffled by my own weak folly, I thought my diſtraction completed, and down I ran as one frighted at a ſpectre, ready to howl for vexation; my head and my temples ſhooting with a violence I had never felt before; and my back aching as if the vertebrae were disjointed, and falling in pieces.</p>
               <p>But now that I have heard the mother's ſtory, and contemplated the dawning hopes given by the chair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's information, I am a good deal eaſier, and can make cooler reflections.

The diſgrace to be thus outwitted by a novice, an infant, in ſtratagem and contrivance, added to the violence of my paſſion for her, will either break my heart, or (what ſaves many a heart in evils inſupportable) turn my brain. What had I to do to go out a licence-hunting, at leaſt till I had ſeen her, and made up

               <p>I have collected, from the reſult of the inquiries made of the chairman, and from Dorcas's obſervations before the cruel creature eſcaped, a deſcription of her dreſs; and am reſolved, if I cannot otherwiſe hear of her, to advertiſe her in the Gazette, as an eloped wife, both by her maiden and acknowleged name; for her elopement will ſoon be known by every <hi>Enemy,</hi> why then ſhould not my <hi>Friends</hi> be made acquainted with it, from whoſe inquiries and informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions I may expect ſome tidings of her?</p>
               <p>She had on a brown luſtring night-gown, freſh, and looking like new, as every thing ſhe wears does, whether new or not, from an elegance natural to her. A beaver hat, a black ribband about her neck, and blue knots on her breaſt. A quilted petticoat of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation

coloured ſatten; a roſe-diamond ring, ſuppoſed on her finger; and in her whole perſon and appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, as I ſhall expreſs it, a dignity, as well as beauty, that commands the repeated attention of every-one who ſees her.</p>
               <p>The deſcription of her perſon, I ſhall take a little more pains about. My mind muſt be more at eaſe, before I can undertake that. And I ſhall threaten, that if, after a certain period given for her voluntary return, ſhe be not heard of, I will proſecute any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, who preſumes to entertain, harbour, abett, or encourage her, with all the vengeance that an injur'd gentleman and huſband may be warranted to take by Law, or otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>FRESH cauſe of aggravation!—But for this ſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling vein, or I ſhould ſtill run mad!</p>
               <p>Again going into her chamber, becauſe it was hers, and ſighing over the bed, and every piece of furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in it, I caſt my eye towards the drawers of the dreſſing-glaſs, and ſaw peep out, as it were, in one of the half-drawn drawers, the corner of a letter. I ſnatched it out, and found it ſuperſcribed by her, <hi>To Mr. Lovelace.</hi> The ſight of it made my heart leap, and I trembled ſo, that I could hardly open the ſeal.</p>
               <p>How does this damn'd Love unman me!—But nobody ever loved as I love!—It is even increaſed by her unworthy flight, and my diſappointment.

               <p>I will not give thee a copy of this letter. I owe her not ſo much ſervice.</p>
               <p>But wouldſt thou think, that this haughty promiſe-breaker could reſolve, as ſhe does, abſolutely and for ever to renounce me for what paſſed laſt night?

family, on which ſhe had ſet her whole heart?—Yet ſhe does!—She acquits me of all obligation to her, and herſelf of all expectations from me!—And for what?—O that indeed I had given her real cauſe! Damn'd confounded Niceneſs, Prudery, Affectation, or pretty Ignorance, if not Affectation!—By my ſoul, Belford, I told thee all—I was more indebted to her ſtruggles, than to my own forwardneſs. I cannot ſupport my own reflections upon a decency ſo ill-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quited.—She could not, ſhe would not have been ſo much a Harlowe in her reſentment had I deſerved, as I <hi>ought</hi> to have done, her reſentment. All ſhe feared, had then been over, and her own good-ſenſe, and even modeſty, would have taught her to make the beſt of it.</p>

               <p>Let me enjoy the thought!</p>
               <p>Shall I ſend this letter?—Thou ſeeſt I have left room, if I fail in the exact imitation of ſo charming a hand, to avoid too ſtrict a ſcrutiny.—Do they not both deſerve it of me?—Seeſt thou not how the rave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing girl threatens her mother?—Ought ſhe not to be puniſh'd?—And can I be a worſe devil, or villain, or
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:0447200104:353"/>
monſter, than ſhe calls me in this letter; and has cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led me in her former letters; were I to puniſh them both, as my vengeance urges me to puniſh them. And when I have executed That my vengeance, how charmingly ſatisfied may they both go down into the country, and keep houſe together, and have a much better reaſon than their pride could give them, for living the Single-life they have both ſeemed ſo fond of?</p>
               <p>I will ſet about tranſcribing it this moment, I think. I can reſolve afterwards. Yet what has poor Hick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man done to deſerve this of me?—But gloriouſly would it puniſh the mother (as well as daughter) for all her ſordid avarice; and for her undutifulneſs to honeſt Mr. Howe, whoſe heart ſhe actually broke. I am on tip-toe, Jack, to enter upon this project.—Is not one country as good to me as another, if I ſhould be obliged to take another tour upon it?</p>
               <p>BUT I will not venture. Mr. Hickman is a good man, they tell me. I love a good man. I hope one of theſe days to be a good man myſelf. Beſides, I have heard within this week, ſomething of this honeſt fellow that ſhews he has a ſoul; when I thought, if he had one, that it lay a little of the deepeſt to emerge to notice, except on very extraordinary occaſions; and that then it preſently ſunk again into its <hi>Cellula adi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſa.</hi>—The man is a <hi>plump man.</hi>—Didſt ever ſee him, Jack?</p>
               <p>But the principal reaſon that withholds me (for 'tis a tempting project!) is, for fear of being utterly blown up, if I ſhould not be quick enough with my letter, or if Miſs Howe ſhould deliberate on ſetting out, or try her mother's conſent firſt; in which time, a letter from my frighted beauty might reach her; for I have no doubt, where-ever ſhe has refuged, but her firſt work was to write to her vixen friend. I will therefore go on patiently; and take my revenge upon the little fury at my leiſure.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="347" facs="tcp:0447200104:354"/>But, in ſpite of my compaſſion for Hickman, whoſe better character is ſometimes my envy, and who is one of thoſe mortals that bring clumſineſs into credit with the <hi>mothers,</hi> to the diſgrace of us clever fellows, and often to our diſappointment with the <hi>daughters</hi>; and who has been very buſy in aſſiſting theſe double-arm'd beauties againſt me; I ſwear by all the <hi>Dii Majores,</hi> as well as <hi>Minores,</hi> that I will have Miſs Howe, if I cannot have her more exalted friend!—And then, if there be ſo much flaming love between theſe girls as they pretend, what will my charmer profit by her eſcape?</p>
               <p>And now, that I ſhall permit Miſs Howe to reign a little longer, let me aſk thee, If thou haſt not, in the incloſed letter, a <hi>freſh</hi> inſtance, that a great many of my difficulties with her ſiſter-toaſt are owing to this flighty girl?—'Tis true, that here was natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a confounded ſharp wintry air; and, if a little cold water was thrown into the path, no wonder that it was inſtantly frozen; and that a poor honeſt traveller found it next to impoſſible to keep his way; one foot ſliding back as faſt as the other advanced; to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangering of his limbs or neck. But yet I think it impoſſible, that ſhe ſhould have baffled me as ſhe has done (novice as ſhe is, and never before from under her parents wing), had ſhe not been armed by a virago, who was formerly very near ſhewing, that ſhe could better adviſe than practiſe. But this, I believe, I have ſaid more than once before.</p>
               <p>I am loth to <hi>reproach myſelf,</hi> now the cruel crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture has eſcaped me; for what would that do, but add to my torment? Since evils ſelf-cauſed, and avoidable, admit not of palliation or comfort. And yet, if <hi>thou</hi> telleſt me, that all <hi>her</hi> ſtrength was owing to <hi>my</hi> weakneſs, and that I have been a curſed coward in this whole affair; why then, Jack, I may bluſh, and be vexed; but, by my ſoul, I cannot contradict thee.</p>
               <p>

               <p>AFter my laſt, ſo full of other hopes, the contents of This will ſurpriſe you. O my deareſt friend, the man has at laſt proved himſelf to be a villain! It was with the utmoſt difficulty laſt night, that I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved myſelf from the vileſt diſhonour. He extorted from me a promiſe of forgiveneſs; and that I would ſee him next day, as if nothing had happened: But if it were poſſible to eſcape from a wretch, who, as I have too much reaſon to believe, formed a plot to fire the houſe, to frighten me, almoſt naked, into his arms, how could I ſee him next day?</p>
               <p>I have eſcaped, Heaven be praiſed, I have! And have now no other concern, than that I fly from the only hope that could have made ſuch an huſband to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable to me; The reconciliation with my friends, ſo agreeably undertaken by my uncle.</p>
               <p>All my preſent hope is, To find ſome reputable family, or perſon of my own Sex, who is obliged to go beyond ſea, or who lives abroad; I care not whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but if I might chooſe, in ſome one of our American colonies—Never to be heard of more by my relations, whom I have ſo grievouſly offended.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="349" facs="tcp:0447200104:356"/>Nor let your generous heart be moved at what I write: If I can eſcape the dreadfulleſt part of my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's malediction (for the temporary part is already in a manner fulfilled, which makes me tremble in appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of the other), I ſhall think the wreck of my worldly fortunes a happy compoſition.</p>
               <p>Neither is there need of the renewal of your ſo often tender'd goodneſs to me: For I have with me rings and other valuables, that were ſent me with my cloaths, which will turn into money, to anſwer all I can want, till Providence ſhall be pleaſed to put me into ſome way to help myſelf, if, for my further puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, my life is to be lengthen'd beyond my wiſhes.</p>
               <p>Impute not this ſcheme, my beloved friend, either to dejection on one hand, or to that romantic turn on the other, which we have ſuppoſed generally to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain with our Sex, from Fifteen to Twenty-two: For, be pleaſed to conſider my unhappy ſituation, in the light in which it really muſt appear to every conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate perſon, who knows it. In the firſt place, the man, who has had the aſſurance to think me, and to endeavour to make me, his <hi>property,</hi> will hunt me, and to place to place, and ſearch after me as an eſtray: And he knows he may do ſo with impunity; for whom have I to protect me from him?</p>
               <p>Then as to my eſtate, the enviable eſtate, which has been the original cauſe of all my misfortunes, it ſhall never be mine upon litigated terms. What is there in being enabled to boaſt, that I am worth more than <hi>I can uſe,</hi> or <hi>wiſh to uſe?</hi>—And if my power is circumſcribed, I ſhall not have that to anſwer for, which I ſhould have, if I did not uſe it as I ought: Which very few do. I ſhall have no huſband, of whoſe intereſt I ought to be ſo regardful, as to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent me doing <hi>more</hi> than juſtice to others, that I may not do <hi>leſs</hi> to him.—If therefore, my father will be pleaſed (as I ſhall preſume, in proper time, to propoſe to him) to pay two annuities out of it, one to my
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:0447200104:357"/>
dear Mrs. Norton, which may make her eaſy for the remainder of her life, as ſhe is now growing into years; the other of 50 <hi>l. per annum,</hi> to the ſame good wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, for the uſe of <hi>My poor,</hi> as I have had the vanity to call a certain ſet of people, concerning whom ſhe knows all my mind; that ſo as few as poſſible may ſuffer by the conſequences of my error; God bleſs them, and give them heart's-eaſe and content with the reſt.</p>
               <p>Other reaſons for my taking the ſtep I have hinted at, are theſe:</p>
               <p>This wicked man knows I have no friend in the world but you: Your neighbourhood therefore would be the firſt he would ſeek for me in, were you to think it poſſible for me to be concealed in it: And in this caſe You might be ſubjected to inconveniencies greater even than thoſe which you have already ſuſtained on my account.</p>
               <p>From my couſin Morden, were he to come, I could not hope protection; ſince, by his letter to me, it is evident, that my brother has engaged him in his party: Nor would I, by any means, ſubject ſo worthy a man to danger; as might be the caſe, from the violence of this ungovernable ſpirit.</p>
               <p>Theſe things conſidered, what better method can I take, than to go abroad to ſome one of the Engliſh co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies; where nobody but yourſelf ſhall know any<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of me; nor You, let me tell you, preſently, nor till I am fixed, and, if it pleaſe God, in a courſe of living tolerably to my mind. For it is no ſmall part of my concern, that my indiſcretions have laid ſo heavy a tax upon You, my dear friend, to whom, once, I hoped to give more pleaſure than pain.</p>
               <p>I am at preſent at one Mrs. Moore's at Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead. My heart miſgave me at coming to this vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage, becauſe I had been here with him more than once: But the coach hither was ſo ready a conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency, that I knew not what to do better. Then I ſhall ſtay here no longer than till I can receive your
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:0447200104:358"/>
anſwer to this: In which you will be pleaſed to let me know, if I cannot be hid, according to your former contrivance [Happy, had I given into it at the time!] by Mrs. Townſend's aſſiſtance, till the heat of his ſearch be over. The Deptford road, I imagine, will be the right direction, to hear of a paſſage, and to get ſafely aboard.</p>
               <p>O why was the great fiend of all unchained, and permitted to aſſume ſo ſpecious a form, and yet allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to conceal his feet and his talons, till with the one he was ready to trample upon my honour, and to ſtrike the other into my heart!—And what had I done, that he ſhould be let looſe particularly upon me!</p>
               <p>Forgive me this murmuring queſtion, the effect of my impatience, my <hi>guilty</hi> impatience, I doubt: For, as I have eſcaped with my honour, and nothing but my worldly proſpects, and my pride, my ambition, and my vanity, have ſuffered in this wreck of my hopefuller fortunes, may I not ſtill be more happy than I deſerve to be? And is it not in my own power ſtill, by the divine favour, to ſecure the great ſtake of all? And who knows, that this very path into which my inconſideration has thrown me, ſtrew'd as it is with briars and thorns, which tear in pieces my gaudier trappings, may not be the right path to lead me into the great road to my future happineſs; which might have been endanger'd by evil communication?</p>
               <p>And after all, Are there not ſtill more deſerving perſons than I, who never failed in any capital point of duty, that have been more humbled than myſelf; and ſome too, by the errors of parents and relations, by the tricks and baſeneſs of guardians, and truſtees, and in which their own raſhneſs or folly had no part?</p>
               <p>I will then endeavour to make the beſt of my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent lot. And join with me, my beſt, my only friend, in praying, That my puniſhment may end here; and that my preſent afflictions may be ſanctified to me.</p>
               <p>This letter will enable you to account for a line or
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:0447200104:359"/>
two, which I ſent to Wilſon's, to be carried to you, only for a feint, to get his ſervant out of the way. He ſeemed to be left, as I thought, for a ſpy upon me. But returning too ſoon, I was forced to write a few lines for him to carry to his Maſter, to a tavern near Doctors-Commons, with the ſame view: And this happily anſwered my end.</p>
               <p>I wrote early in the morning a bitter letter to the wretch, which I left for him obvious enough; and I ſuppoſe he has it by this time. I kept no copy of it. I ſhall recollect the contents, and give you the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars of all, at more leiſure.</p>
               <p>I am ſure you will approve of my eſcape—The ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as the people of the houſe muſt be very vile: For they, and that Dorcas too, did hear me (I know they did) cry out for help: If the fire had been other than a villainous plot (altho' in the morning, to blind them, I pretended to think it otherwiſe), they would have been alarmed as much as I; and have run in, hearing me ſcream, to <hi>comfort me,</hi> ſuppoſing my terror was the fire; to <hi>relieve me,</hi> ſuppoſing it were any<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe. But the vile Dorcas went away, as ſoon as ſhe ſaw the wretch throw his arms about me!—Bleſs me, my dear, I had only my ſlippers and an under-petticoat on. I was frighted out of my bed, by her cries of fire; and that I ſhould be burnt to aſhes in a moment!—And ſhe to go away, and never to return, nor any-body elſe: And yet I heard wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens voices in the next room; indeed I did.—An evident contrivance of them all:—God be praiſed, I am out of their houſe!</p>
               <p>My terror is not yet over: I can hardly think my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſafe: Every well-dreſſed man I ſee from my win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, whether on horſeback or on foot, I think to be him.</p>
               <p>I know you will expedite an anſwer. A man and horſe will be procured me to-morrow early, to carry This. To be ſure, you cannot return an anſwer by the
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:0447200104:360"/>
ſame man, becauſe you muſt ſee Mrs. Townſend firſt: Nevertheleſs, I ſhall wait with impatience till you <hi>can</hi>; having no friend but you to apply to; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch a ſtranger to this part of the world, that I know not which way to turn myſelf; whither to go; nor what to do!—What a dreadful hand have I made of it!</p>
               <p>Mrs. Moore, at whoſe houſe I am, is a widow, and of a good character: And of this, one of her neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, of whom I bought a handkerchief, purpoſely to make inquiry before I would venture, informed me.</p>
               <p>I will not ſet my foot out of doors, till I have your direction: And I am the more ſecure, having dropt words to the people of the houſe where the coach ſet me down, as if I expected a chariot to meet me in my way to Hendon, a village a little diſtance from this.—And when I left their houſe, I walked back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and forward upon the hill, at firſt not knowing what to do, and afterwards, to be certain that I was not watched, before I ventured to inquire after a lodging.</p>
               <p>You will direct for me, my dear, by the name of Mrs. Harriot Lucas.</p>
               <p>Had I not made my eſcape when I did, I was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to attempt it again and again. He was gone to the Commons for a licence, as he wrote me word; for I refuſed to ſee him, notwithſtanding the promiſe he extorted from me.</p>
               <p>How hard, how next-to impoſſible, my dear, to avoid many leſſer deviations, when we are betrayed into a capital one!</p>
               <p>For fear I ſhould not get away at my firſt effort, I had appriſed him, that I would not ſet eye upon him under a week, in order to gain myſelf time for it in different ways—And were I ſo to have been watched, as to have made it neceſſary, I would, after ſuch an inſtance of the connivance of the women of the houſe, have run out into the ſtreet, and thrown myſelf into the
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:0447200104:361"/>
next houſe I could have enter'd, or claimed protection from the firſt perſon I had met—Women to deſert the cauſe of a poor creature, of their own Sex, in ſuch a ſituation, what muſt they be!—Then, ſuch poor guilty ſort of figures did they make in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, after he was gone out—ſo earneſt to get me up ſtairs, and to convince me, by the ſcorched window-boards, and burnt curtains and vallens, that the fire was real—that (although I ſeemed to believe all they would have me believe) I was more and more reſolved to get out of their houſe at all adventures.</p>
               <p>When I began, I thought to write but a few lines. But, be my ſubject what it will, I know not how to conclude, when I write to you. It was <hi>always</hi> ſo: It is not therefore owing peculiarly to that moſt intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and unhappy ſituation, which you will allow, however, to engroſs, at preſent, the whole mind of</p>

               <p>Methinks I am ſorry ſhe managed no better!—I ſhall find the recovery of her too eaſy a taſk, I fear!

If I have already got back my charmer?—I have not.—But knowing where ſhe is, is almoſt the ſame thing as having her in my power: And it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights me to think, how ſhe will ſtart and tremble, when I firſt pop upon her! How ſhe will look with conſcious guilt, that will more than wipe off my guilt of Wedneſday night, when ſhe ſees her injured lover, and acknowleged huſband, from whom, the greateſt of felonies, ſhe would have ſtollen herſelf.</p>

               <p>I received it about half an hour ago, juſt as I was going to lie down in my cloaths: And it has made me ſo much alive, that, midnight as it is, I have ſent for a Blunt's chariot, to attend me here by day-peep, with <hi>my uſual coachman,</hi> if poſſible; and knowing not elſe what to do with myſelf, I ſat down, and, in the joy of my heart, have not only wrote thus far, but have concluded upon the meaſures I ſhall take when admitted to her preſence: For well am I aware of the difficulties I ſhall have to contend with from her per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſeneſs.</p>

If you would not that I ſhould hate you for ever, ſend me half a line by the bearer, to aſſure me that you will not attempt to ſee me for a week to come. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not look you in the face without equal confuſion and indignation. The obliging me in This is but a poor atonement for your laſt night's vile behaviour.</p>
                     <p>You may paſs this time in a journey to your uncle's;
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:0447200104:365"/>
and I cannot doubt, if the Ladies of your family are as favourable to me, as you have aſſured me they are, but that you will have intereſt enough to prevail with one of them, to oblige me with her company. After your baſeneſs of laſt night, you will not wonder, that I inſiſt upon this proof of your future honour.</p>
                     <p>If Captain Tomlinſon comes mean time, I can hear what he has to ſay, and ſend you an account of it.</p>
                     <p>But in leſs than a week, if you ſee me, it muſt be owing to a freſh act of violence, of which you know not the conſequence.</p>

               <p>Now, Belford, what canſt thou ſay in behalf of this ſweet rogue of a Lady? What <hi>canſt</hi> thou ſay for her? 'Tis apparent, that ſhe was fully determined upon an elopement, when ſhe wrote it: And thus would ſhe make me of party againſt myſelf, by drawing me in to give her a week's time to compleat it in: And, wickeder ſtill, ſend me upon a fool's errand to bring up one of my couſins:—When we came, to have the ſatisfaction of finding her gone off, and me expoſed for ever!—What puniſhment can be bad enough for ſuch a little villain of a Lady!</p>
               <p>But mind, moreover, how plauſibly ſhe accounts by this billet (ſuppoſing ſhe had no opportunity of eloping before I returned) for the reſolution of not ſeeing me for a week; and for the bread and butter expedient!—So childiſh as we thought it!</p>
               <p>The chariot is not come; and if it were, it is yet too ſoon for every-thing but my impatience. And as I have already taken all my meaſures, and can think of nothing but my triumph, I will reſume her violent letter, in order to ſtrengthen my reſolutions againſt
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:0447200104:366"/>
her. I was <hi>before</hi> in too gloomy a way to proceed with it: But now the ſubject is all alive to me, and my gayer fancy, like the ſun-beams, will irradiate it, and turn the ſolemn deep green into a brighter ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure.</p>
               <p>When I have called upon my charmer to explain ſome parts of her letter, and to atone for others, I will ſend it, or a copy of it, to thee.</p>
               <p>Suffice it at preſent to tell thee, in the firſt place, that <hi>ſhe is determined never to be my wife.</hi>—To be ſure, there ought to be no compulſion in ſo material a caſe. Compulſion was her parents fault, which I have cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured ſo ſeverely, that I ſhall hardly be guilty of the ſame. And I am glad I know her mind as to this eſſential point.</p>
               <p>I have <hi>ruined</hi> her, ſhe ſays!—Now that's a fib, take it in her own way:—If I had, ſhe would not perhaps have run away from me.</p>
               <p>She is <hi>thrown upon the wide world:</hi> Now I own, that Hampſtead-Heath affords very pretty, and very <hi>extenſive</hi> proſpects; but 'tis not the <hi>wide world</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: And ſuppoſe <hi>that</hi> to be her grievance, I hope ſoon to reſtore her to a <hi>narrower.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I am the <hi>enemy of her ſoul, as well as of her ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour!</hi>—Confoundedly ſevere! Nevertheleſs, another fib!—For I love her ſoul very well; but think no more of it in this caſe than of my own.</p>
               <p>She is to be <hi>thrown upon ſtrangers!</hi>—And is not that her own fault?—Much againſt my will, I am ſure!</p>
               <p>She is caſt from a ſtate of <hi>independency into one of obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.</hi> She never was in a ſtate of <hi>independency</hi>; nor is it fit a woman ſhould, of any age, or in any ſtate of life. And as to the ſtate of obligation, there is no ſuch thing as living without being beholden to ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body. Mutual obligation is the very eſſence and ſoul of the ſocial and commercial life:—Why ſhould <hi>ſhe</hi> be exempt from it?—I am ſure the perſon ſhe raves
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:0447200104:367"/>
at, deſires not ſuch an exemption;—has been long <hi>dependent</hi> upon her, and would rejoice to owe <hi>further obligations</hi> to her, than he can boaſt of hitherto.</p>
               <p>She talks of her <hi>father's curſe:</hi>—But have I not repaid him for it an hundred-fold, in the ſame coin? But why muſt the faults of other people be laid at my door? Have I not enow of my own?</p>
               <p>But the grey-eyed dawn begins to peep—Let me ſum up all.</p>
               <p>In ſhort, then, the dear creature's letter is a col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of invectives not very new to <hi>me</hi>; though the occaſion for them, no doubt, is new to <hi>her.</hi> A little ſprinkling of the romantic and contradictory runs thro' it. She loves, and ſhe hates: She encourages me to purſue her, by telling me I ſafely may; and yet ſhe begs I will not: She apprehends poverty and want, yet reſolves to give away her eſtate: To gratify whom?—Why, in ſhort, thoſe who have been the cauſe of her misfortunes. And finally, tho' ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves never to be mine, yet ſhe has ſome regrets at leaving me, becauſe of the opening proſpects of a reconciliation with her friends.</p>
               <p>But never did morning dawn ſo tardily as this!—The chariot not yet come neither.</p>
               <p>A GENTLEMAN to ſpeak with me, Dorcas?—Who can want me thus early?</p>
               <p>Captain Tomlinſon, ſayſt thou! Surely he muſt have travelled all night!—Early riſer as I am, how could he think to find me up <hi>thus</hi> early?</p>
               <p>Let but the chariot come, and he ſhall accompany me in it to the bottom of the hill (tho' he return to town on foot; for the Captain is all obliging good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs), that I may hear all he has to ſay, and tell him all my mind, and loſe no time.</p>
               <p>Well, now am I ſatisfied, that this rebellious flight will turn to my advantage, as all cruſh'd rebellions do to the advantage of a Sovereign in poſſeſſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="361" facs="tcp:0447200104:368"/>DEAR Captain, I rejoice to ſee you: Juſt in the nick of time:—See! See!</p>

It will all turn out for the beſt. You muſt accompany me part of the way. I know the delight you take in compoſing differences. But 'tis the task of the Prudent to heal the breaches made by the raſhneſs and folly of the Imprudent.</p>
               <p>AND now (all around me ſo ſtill, and ſo ſilent) the rattling of the chariot-wheels at a ſtreet's diſtance, do I hear!—And to this angel of a Lady I fly!</p>
               <p>Reward, O God of Love (the cauſe is thy own); reward thou, as it deſerves, my ſuffering perſevere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance!—Succeed my endeavours to bring back to thy obedience, this charming fugitive!—Make her ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowlege her raſhneſs; repent her inſults; implore my forgiveneſs; beg to be re-inſtated in my favour, and that I will bury in oblivion the remembrance of her heinous offence againſt thee, and againſt me, thy faithful votary.</p>
               <p>THE chariot at the door!—I come! I come!—</p>
               <p>I attend you, good Captain—</p>
               <p>Indeed, Sir—</p>
