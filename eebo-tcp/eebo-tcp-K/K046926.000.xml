            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is now upwards of Four Years ſince the following Sheets were finiſh'd, and juſt going to the Preſs, when a tedious Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a dear Relation, which at laſt ended in Death, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, and not only for that time ſuſpended my Thoughts of publiſhing them then, but even extinguiſh'd my Intentions of ever doing it at all. This I thought neceſſary to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, that what may be found either in the Body, or Hiſtorical Accounts of the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Diſcourſe, may not be ſuppoſed in any way to relate to the Contentions which have ariſen between ſome eminent Practiſers, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Purging in the Declenſion of the Small Pox; but whatever is there, I look upon
<pb n="ij" facs="tcp:0090400300:4"/>my ſelf to be anſwerable for, whither Bad or Good.</p>
            <p>For as on one Hand, it would be an inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable Partiality and Peeviſhneſs, to find fault with any Diſcovery, that may be made in Practice upon ſo difficult a Diſeaſe as the <hi>Small-Pox</hi> frequently proves to be, in as much, as by ſuch Suggeſtion, ſick Perſons, or thoſe about them, may be deterred from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king uſe of ſuch Things as may be ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable and inſtrumental towards the ſaving their Lives: So would it be as unpardonable a Levity on the other Hand, for any one to depart from a Method he had found ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful, with very little Interruption, in a Diſeaſe under its general Deſignation; and without any at all, when ſo particularly circumſtantiated as the <hi>Small-Pox</hi> is in Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men with Child; which has been always look'd on as a ſingular Diſadvantage to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons labouring under it at that time.</p>
            <p>One of the firſt Inſtances the Learned Dr. <hi>Friend</hi> gives in his Treatiſe, <hi>de Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione in ſecunda fibre,</hi> &amp;c. is of a Perſon that miſcarried; upon which Account he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted with the celebrated Dr. <hi>Chamberlen,</hi> whoſe peculiar Buſineſs muſt frequently lead him into Obſervations of that kind more than any others; and as the Caſe is very extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary in all its Particulars, Dr. <hi>Friend</hi> cloſes the Relation after this Manner; That the learned Gentleman he conſulted with, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd
<pb n="iij" facs="tcp:0090400300:5"/>ſur'd him, that 'twas one of the firſt Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents he ever knew recover under thoſe Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantages. And indeed, Inſtances of ſuch Succeſs have been very rare. Which very Obſervation, well reflected on, ſufficiently juſtifies and vindicates any Regular and Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Attempt (and ſuch I hope the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing will appear to be) that may be made to prevent, if poſſible, the tender Sex being reduc'd to ſuch an unhappy Condition and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemma. For by Abortion, the Life of the Child is certainly deſtroy'd, and at the ſame time, and on the ſame Account (let others ſay what they pleaſe) that of the Mother is brought into the utmoſt Jeopardy. And as the firſt can be ſaved by no other Means than by preventing the Miſcarriage: So is the laſt in the moſt probable way of being preſerv'd by the ſame Meaſures.</p>
            <p>When I firſt laid theſe few Obſervations before the very learned Dr. <hi>Bateman,</hi> the then Preſident of the College of Phyſicians, he was pleaſed to encourage my publiſhing them in the following Terms.</p>
            <p>
               <q>
                  <hi>"Your Treatiſe of the</hi> Small-Pox <hi>deſerves highly to be publiſhed, not only for the Hiſtories you give of the good Succeſs of your Powder; but eſpecially for the Caſes of the Women, which is quite new. I thank you alſo for the rare Uſe of Bli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, in Caſe of</hi> Haemorrhages, <hi>which I never heard of before,</hi> &amp;c."</q>
            </p>
            <pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0090400300:6"/>
            <p>So kind an Approbation, and from ſo great a Hand, is ſufficient to encourage my Publiſhing it at this time, had I no other; but when I have, through God's Bleſſing, met with the ſame Succeſs here in <hi>London</hi> as in the <hi>Country;</hi> and at the ſame time look back upon the two laſt Years Bills of Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, and ſee ſo vaſt a Number of Perſons carried off by the <hi>Small-Pox,</hi> and the Week<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Bills ſtill continuing in that Article not low: I need make no Excuſe ſurely, if I endeavour to give a helping Hand in ſo great a Calamity.</p>
            <p>The Manner of treating Women with Child in the <hi>Small-Pox,</hi> is as the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd Learned Gentleman does me the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to aſſure the World, quite new. And yet I will take the liberty at the ſame time to affirm, that the Practice is founded upon Reaſon and Truth in the natural Diſpoſition, Adminiſtration and Function of the Parts during the time of their being ſo, which is indeed undeniable. By this Teſt all former Practice ought to be examin'd, and upon this Foundation all new Diſcoveries in Medicine ought to be laid. And if upon ſuch Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and Conſiderations, Succeſs has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly attended the Practice, what more can be deſir'd? And it will not certainly be taken for a precarious Way of proceeding, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume, that ſome of the Thouſands that were ſwept away by the <hi>Small-Pox</hi> the two
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:0090400300:7"/>laſt Years, might be Women with Child; and the being inſtrumental in the ſaving but one Life, will abundantly juſtify the preſent Work; which common Humanity obliges eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one to confeſs.</p>
            <p>As to the Powder here propoſed, I muſt freely acknowledge, that it chiefly conſiſts of ſuch Parts as are well and commonly known in Uſe and Practice. But the manner of its Compoſition is ſomewhat new; and then as to the Salt of <hi>Amber,</hi> being directed as an Alexipharmick, (and it is certainly the nobleſt and moſt generous one in the whole Pharmaceutick Kind) that I think is alſo ſomething new. But that I might neither impoſe upon my ſelf nor my Readers, I have again and again review'd the whole <hi>Materia</hi> of Dr. <hi>Sydenham,</hi> Dr. <hi>Morton,</hi> and others, and cannot once find it adminiſtred as ſuch; which has been Matter of greater Wonder than Pleaſure to obſerve. I could willingly enter into a long Account of its Excellency, and a Rationale of its Operation; but I ſhall abridge my ſelf of that Pleaſure, and in few Words only ſay, That though it be rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned among the Volatile Salts, yet as it vaſtly excells any of them in its Effects, it great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly differs from them in its very Nature. Moſt, if not all the other, have a Burning Canſtick Quality in them, as is evident in <hi>Sal volat. Corn. Cerv. Cranij, vel oſſium Humanorum.</hi> And all Sorts of Volatile Salts of Bones and
<pb n="vj" facs="tcp:0090400300:8"/>Bone-like Subſtances, or thoſe ſublim'd from other ſaline Bodies, as <hi>Sal Salis Armon. Sal Urinae,</hi> &amp;c. and even <hi>Sal Viperarum,</hi> is not much cooler. This any one may ſatisfy him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in, who will but venture to taſt them naked as they are. And muſt conſequently create a Thirſt, and are hardly in any Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hicle poſſible to be reconcil'd to the Taſte or Stomach. But <hi>Sal Succini</hi> is really almoſt as cool as the moſt natural Elemental Salt, and even extinguiſhes Feveriſh Heats. In ſhort, it is <hi>Alexipharmick,</hi> as it is an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Counterpoiſon; it is <hi>Cephalick,</hi> greatly relieving the Head, and the whole Nervous kind, and wonderfully reviving the Spirits at the ſame Time: It is <hi>Diuretick</hi> and <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoretick,</hi> in its provoking, and that gently, both Sweat and Urine: Nay, it prevents the other warm <hi>Alexipharmicks</hi> from acting in too inflamatory a Manner, and yet gives them Energy and Action. And further ſtill, it guards and Defends the Brain from the <hi>Deliriums, Stupors,</hi> or any <hi>Comatoſe</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, which the <hi>Opium</hi> might cauſe; ſo that thus taken, there is ſeldom any more than a gentle and refreſhing Sleep produc'd; ſo abſolutely neceſſary through all the Stages of the <hi>Small-Pox.</hi> I could here proceed to place it in Oppoſition to all the <hi>Theriacalia</hi> and <hi>Bezoardica</hi> whatever; but it would carry me too far; once for all I will ſay, that it is the beſt I ever made uſe of, neither
<pb n="vij" facs="tcp:0090400300:9"/>have I in ſome Hundreds found it diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Stomach or Head of any one.</p>
            <p>The Proportion of the <hi>Laudanum</hi> may be obſerv'd to be about one Grain to <hi>℈jj,</hi> and thus it may be adapted to the ſmalleſt Infant, for if <hi>℈jj</hi> be mix'd with a Julep of Six Ounces, or that may conſiſt of about Twelve Spoonfuls, one Spoonful at a Time will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſo little <hi>Laudanum,</hi> that not the leaſt of any Danger can be apprehended from it; and with Truth, Confidence, and Experience I can atteſt, that as an <hi>Anodyne</hi> it far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds <hi>Diacodium,</hi> or any the mildeſt Opiats: Beſides, it may be prepar'd without the <hi>Laudanum;</hi> but all this muſt be left to the Diſcretion of the attending Phyſician.</p>
            <p>Whether it may be of Uſe in the Time of the Plague, ſhould the Almighty for our Sins viſit us with that dreadful Scourge, I muſt ſubmit to the Learned of the Faculty. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, this in the mean time may be ſaid, that it is conformable to what we find in Books written on that Subject by Phyſicians, who liv'd and practiſed in ſuch Times, when this and other Nations were afflicted with the <hi>Plague.</hi> And is agreeable to the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures now taken in <hi>France</hi> by the <hi>French</hi> Phyſicians, as they have communicated their way of proceeding to the World in <hi>[The Succinct Account of the</hi> Plague <hi>at</hi> Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeilles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] Beſides, the <hi>Small-Pox</hi> is truly accounted amongſt Peſtilential Fevers; and
<pb n="viij" facs="tcp:0090400300:10"/>
               <hi>Portus</hi> with ſome others ſtick not to call it <hi>Peſtis Minoris Gradus,</hi> a Peſtilence of a lower Degree; and very properly they think, ſince from its manner of being communicated by Contagion; its too frequently fatal Event: the viſible Malignity with which it ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in ſome Perſons appears, together with many particular Analogical Symptoms, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembles the <hi>Plague</hi> not a little. But this only by the by.</p>
            <p>To proceed a little farther; the inventing of good efficacious Medicines, is the Duty and Buſineſs of every Phyſician, and the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of the Publick that he ſhould make it ſo, and is well recommended by a late In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious Author in the following Words: <hi>By Study and Practice (ſays he) the</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teria Medica <hi>is improv'd and enlarg'd by the Addition of Efficacious Medicines, as well Simple as Compound, not known be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, or not apply'd to ſuch Uſes for which they have been found to ſerve better than others in Uſe. For by every uſeful new Medicine ſo added, the Faculty is ſo much enlarg'd, and ſomething contributed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the common Benefit of Mankind.</hi> Which is a general, and I think a ſufficient Defence for the preſent Attempt in offering after this Manner, what (with ſome Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence I hope) may be ſerviceable to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick in a dangerous Diſeaſe, and ſuch an one from which this great Place, is ſeldom,
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:0090400300:11"/>if ever totally free, and which proves too generally fatal.</p>
            <p>To conclude; theſe are the Meaſures I have taken, this is the Method I have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly of late Years obſerv'd and follow'd; upon which I have had very great, I may ſay, unuſual Succeſs. And I can ſee no Reaſon why the ſame fairly and honeſtly applied, may not be as ſucceſsful in the Hands of another as my own, for which Reaſon I make them Publick.</p>
            <p>Let me throw one Word more into the Mouths of the Criticks, before they devour me, and I have done. It may be ſaid, that what is contain'd in the Regimen, is mean, common, or trifling: To which I An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that if what is there is truly uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, as I am ſure it is, the more common they are, the more practicable and intelligible they will certainly be; which I reckon as an Excellency, whatever others may do; and if a Man's Endeavours are but ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful, he need not much care who acts in the more pompous Manner. But let us in this hear what our great Maſter the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſays on that Head.</p>

            <p>With all Submiſſion I proceed to ſpeak of the following Diſeaſe, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Small-Pox,</hi> that is, of the Method I have taken in the curing of it.

               </gap>; ſuch Parts having been very copiouſly treated of by many great Authors, and in almoſt every Bodies Hands. The chief Streſs of what I humbly propoſe, depending upon Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical Inſtances, and Matters of Fact: Not but it will be allow'd, and it frequently happens, that the Succeſs of Medicines and their various and multiform manner of Uſe and Application, has given light into the Nature and Indoles of Diſeaſes; as the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of ſeveral Parts of an Animal in Food or Medicine, hath been made uſe of to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain their Nature, and even exemplify the Parts of which they may conſiſt; which may be ſeen in our two Famous Profeſſors Dr. <hi>Gliſſon</hi> and Dr. <hi>Willis,</hi> the firſt in his
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0090400300:14"/>
               <hi>Anatomia,</hi> Cap. vi. the other in many places of his <hi>Anima Brutorum;</hi> as alſo in Sir <hi>George Ent,</hi> Dr. <hi>Morton,</hi> and ſeveral others; ſo that Phyſiology and Practice thus attended to, may be obſerv'd to illuſtrate each other. And here, Sir, I muſt again beg your Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, that I ſhall be forced to place before you <hi>Cramben Recoctam,</hi> having already troubled you very much, with many of the Particulars I muſt here recount. But before I can come to them, I muſt ſpeak to a General or two: The firſt of which is as to the general <hi>Regimen</hi> to be uſed, the Cold or the Hot, as they are generally and vulgarly diſtinguiſh'd.</p>
            <p>For the Firſt, Dr. <hi>Sydenham</hi> and his Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers ſtrenouſly appear againſt the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Practice of thoſe that preceded him, as well as his Contemporaries; and I may ſay, againſt Nature her ſelf: For tho' we may find interſpers'd in their reciting the <hi>Pharmaceutica,</hi> ſometimes what will ſeem to countenance the Cold Regimen, (in which the Countries and Climates where they practis'd might probably be a great Inducement) yet it is very plain, that they chiefly depended on <hi>Alexipharmicks</hi> and the warm Method. <hi>Amatus Luſitanus,</hi> who was as bold, I think, as any one in the Uſe of the <hi>Refrigeria,</hi> yet has in a <hi>Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lium</hi> theſe Words, <hi>Quod variolarum &amp; Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>billorum ad Cutem eruptio, quaedam a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0090400300:15"/>non ſolum conſtituta, ſed deſtinata Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis ſit: Conſequens erit cum Hippocrate &amp; Galeno aſſeverare; quod quando Natura eam conficere tentat, tunc Medicus Materiam fluere diſpoſitam condenſare, aut a viâ ſua cohilere non debet; ſed Magis ipſam diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nere, ut per eam viam incedat per quam Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura expellere Conatur; juxta illud Hippoc. Quo Natura maxime vergit per loca confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentia, eo ducere.</hi> I muſt confeſs, this <hi>Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lium</hi> is hardly to be reconcil'd with his Practice, either in the Precedent, or fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing <hi>Curatio;</hi> in this laſt, he tells us, that being ſent for to a Boy blind for Three Days of the <hi>Small-Pox,</hi> which he mentions as an extraordinary Occurrence, he imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately fell to waſhing and other Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to his Eyes, and with great Pleaſure acquaints his Reader, <hi>ex tenebris Puer ipſe revocatus.</hi> This would be mad Practice in <hi>England,</hi> whatever it was in <hi>Tuſcany;</hi> but this I mention to ſhew, how little (as I ſaid before) is to be depended on Caſes Hiſtorically only related: And that in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Climates, it is not the diſcordant Opinions Phyſicians maintain againſt each other; but there is a Neceſſity for that very Reaſon to take Meaſures ſomewhat dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent. <hi>Reverius</hi> declares for the <hi>Alexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pharmicks,</hi> and the warm Regimen, <hi>Primo ut Aeger in loco Calidiuſculo detineatur, quo Pori Cutis aperiantur, &amp; variolarum Erup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0090400300:16"/>adjuvetur,</hi> &amp;c. I forbear quoting that celebrated Practiſer at length, that I may be as little troubleſome as poſſible, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of no great Conſequence to the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders I chiefly intend this for. The ſame Thing might be repeated out of all the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of any Conſideration, or Antiquity, which would be as Nauſeous, as it would be Endleſs. The Miſchief which has ariſen is this; that in Practice, while there have been Endeavours uſed towards an Inprove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſome have advanc'd from a Genial neceſſary Warmth to almoſt actual Fire; and inſtead of keeping the cold deſtructive Air out, have perfectly ſuffocated the poor Patients, by letting them have none at all; making at the ſame Time ſuch vaſt Fires (whatever be the Temper of the Air, or of the Sick Perſon) which cauſe Faintings with other Irregularities coincident with it. And on the other Hand, I ſhall take the Liberty to ſay, that the Reformers have ſtarted ſo far out of that Method, in order to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh themſelves by their new Diſcoveries in diſavowing the Warm Regimen; that one would think there's no being Cool or Refreſhing for the Patient without Freez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Let me therefore beg leave to follow the Celebrated Dr. <hi>Morton,</hi> whoſe Practice is Regular and Rational, and whoſe Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs was Anſwerable. He poſitively de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares for the Warm; and both throughout
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0090400300:17"/>his Precedent Rationale, as well as in the ſubſequent Hiſtories, reprehends the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Proceeding; which he deliberately confutes, and deſcends even to mention the <hi>Materia</hi> made uſe of in the Cold Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gimen; ſuch as <hi>Spiritus vitrioli, Decoctum Album, Diacodium,</hi> and the like; nay, he ſays, that he was inform'd Dr. <hi>Sydenham</hi> himſelf had towards the latter Part of his Life gone off from that Opinion. Be that as it will, he was in the wrong, as Dr. <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> thought, and will appear more to be ſo, if we take but very little Pains to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the Aetiology of the Diſeaſe it ſelf, or the Operations of Nature under it. For what is it that Nature is doing, or how can ſhe perform that viſible <hi>Diaploreſis,</hi> (if I may ſo call the Eruption) but by a Warmth ſomewhat higher than her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Tenor; ſo that ſhe acts her ſelf in the <hi>Alexipharmick</hi> way; and that muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond Contradiction be the right. Could we either ſubſtitute any other Diſcharge to carry off by it with ſafety the repell'd Morbid Humours, or if ever a Sudorifick, or Expulſive Operation (of that kind) could be perform'd, without the Conſtitution be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſomewhat more than commonly warm; there would be room to ſay ſomething; but when this can never be, which muſt be confeſs'd by all, there will need but very little Argument or Perſuaſion, to direct us
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0090400300:18"/>which of the two Regimens ought to be choſen. And yet, notwithſtanding the apparency of the Caſe, there are ſtill ſome ſo blindly devoted to the following that otherwiſe great Man; and even notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding their own ill Succeſs, they go on in a ſupine, fatal Bigotry, and Dependance on his Word; and think that <hi>Sydenham</hi>'s Name is ſufficient to ſhelter, and juſtify their own Inattention to Nature herſelf. Inſomuch that I have heard it (with ſome Pain) affirm'd, that <hi>Diacodium</hi> was the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacea,</hi> which would do every Thing, and that nothing could be done well without it: That it was in the <hi>Small-Pox,</hi> like the <hi>Cortex</hi> in intermitting Fevers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and however diverſified the Diſeaſe might be, it has been, upon the ill Succeſs of the firſt, doubled and trebled, and given the Patient without the leaſt Guard. <hi>Diacodium</hi> is queſtionleſs ſometimes a proper, as it is a Pacifick Medicine. But ſuppoſe we meet with a Comatoſe ſleepy Diſpoſition in the Beginning, and it ſhould attend the Diſtemper in the other Stages, which in Flegmatick Pituitoſe Habits is very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent; muſt we ſtill proceed to give this Roapy <hi>Opiat?</hi> Why, yes, if we believe the Sophiſtry above, and which I have known purſued as long as Nature has laſted. But enough of this unwelcome Subject.</p>
            <pb n="8" facs="tcp:0090400300:19"/>
            <p>The next General I ſhall trouble you with is Blood-letting. Tho' indeed, I think it ought not to be term'd a General, it being impoſſible, but that it muſt be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive in many Caſes, and I believe very dubious in its Succeſs in any. There is a Queſtion, Sir, I have wanted long to be reſolv'd, and is as difficult to ſtate, I believe as to reſolve. I have in debating occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally, whether Bleeding were generally good in the <hi>Small-Pox,</hi> heard it affirm'd, that it certainly was, if timely adminiſter'd: The ſame Affirmation I have under the Hands of ſome Men Eminent in Practice; we find it likewiſe in many celebrated Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors already extant among us. As to the Time, it is agreed as ſoon as poſſible, at leaſt before the Eruption is in any Meaſure perform'd; the Reaſons alledg'd are, that it gives ſome remiſſion to the excruciating Pains, and even diminiſhes the Morbid Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; ſo that the Enemy being weaken'd, Nature muſt be the better enabled to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the remaining Force. Before I come to expoſtualte on the Particulars, give me leave to ſuggeſt, Firſt, that it may be fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently obſerv'd, that the <hi>Small-Pox</hi> in ſome Families is very ſignally, and as it were Hereditarily Fatal. This we find both Dr. <hi>Sydenham</hi> and Dr. <hi>Morton</hi> have obſerv'd, and granted. Suppoſe then, Secondly, That in one Family Three Children of the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0090400300:20"/>ſame Father and Mother ſhould be treated in the <hi>Sydenhamian</hi> Way: The firſt is blooded, has the benign, diſtinct ſort of the <hi>Small-Pox,</hi> and does well. The next after the ſame manner is Blooded, has the Confluent, malign ſort, and dies. The Third under the ſame Adminiſtration of Bleeding, upon which appear the <hi>Maculae Nigrae, Lividae, Purpureae,</hi> &amp;c. and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture under ſo miſerable a Proſtration of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, that ſhe quite gives up the Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and yet for any Thing that could be ſeen or apprehended, this laſt might have been the diſtinct kind, which as Hiſtories are two to one. Such Events as theſe ought certainly to put us to a ſtand; and for the Truth of the Facts, I can produce undeniable Evidence; but wave it here, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I would not revive the Grief of thoſe, who make but too ſevere Remarks upon the Proceeding. What Meaſures therefore, Good Sir, muſt we take? Will the taking of Blood away, alter the Indoles of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe from the Malignant or Confluent kind, to the Benign and Diſcreet ſort; if ſo, it ought in all Subjects, and on all Occaſions to be uſed; and this is what they mean, by ſaying it will leſſen the Quantity, or for my Part I know not what to make on't: But if this be difficult and uncertain, nay, I will ſay impoſſible to make apparent; then they put Perſons on a very great Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0090400300:21"/>who make uſe of ſuch dangerous Methods by weakening Nature, and in no reſpect leſſening the Diſeaſe: Which Charge, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſevere and heavy, muſt in the general be confeſs'd to be true. For here, by the way, I muſt take ſo much Liberty, ſtrongly to preſume, that the kind of the Diſeaſe, in reſpect to its degree, is determin'd upon the firſt imparting of the Contagion: Tho' out of doubt, the Diſpoſition the Blood and other Juices of the Body are in at that Time, does ſtrongly diſpoſe to one or the other; ſuch as was before ſaid, the inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Craſis of the Blood and Spirits, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the Parents we are Deſcendants of, violent Exerciſe, hard Drinking, or other crapulous Diſorders, and the like; which not only expoſe us the ſooner to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the Infection (as is vulgarly and truly expreſs'd) but the Poiſonous <hi>Miaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mata</hi> of the Diſeaſe, are immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly imparted to every Particle of the Fluids, being thus made ſuſceptible of them; and thus the Confluent kind of the <hi>Small-Pox</hi> is form'd, and as I ſaid, determin'd, before it is poſſible to adminſter any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy. So that except by Bleeding we can undertake to change the very Indoles of the Diſeaſe, even after it is form'd, tho' not render'd Viſible, which I believe is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible; we ſhall be in Danger of adding to the Diſeaſe, and abſtracting from the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0090400300:22"/>Strength of the Patient. For 'twill hardly ever be found, that the taking of Blood away, can reſtore it, from a Fuſion to its natural Craſis, that is, the <hi>Sphaerical</hi> red Parts, to their juſt Magnitude, and the reſt, of what Denomination ſoever, to their Natural Size, Figure, and Coheſion

                  <hi>See Dr.</hi> Morton<hi>'s Eleventh Hiſt.</hi>
               </note>. By the Loſs of Blood, 'tis well known, that the Maſs is attenuated; and for that very Reaſon is Phlebotomy adminiſtred in many Inſtances, as in Pleuriſies, the <hi>Malacia, &amp;c.</hi> that ſo there may be more room for the Heart in its Pulſes, to daſh and toſs, as it were, the Blood, by which Action the Lentor or too cohaeſive Parts may be divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into ſmaller Portions. To this I muſt add, that <hi>Haemorrhages,</hi> from whatever Part they flow, are not occaſion'd, at leaſt very rarely, from a <hi>Plethora</hi> ſimply ſo call'd, or from the Strength and Force of the Pulſe; for then the moſt robuſt Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, and thoſe that uſe the moſt violent Exerciſe, would be moſt liable to them, either Man or Beaſt; which is hardly ever obſervable: But moſt frequently from the <hi>Prava Diatheſis</hi> of the Blood it ſelf in the Looſening of its Texture; ſo that in paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Capillaries, it is as it were perco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated through 'em, or render'd ſo keen, that
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0090400300:23"/>it breaks, and, as it were, eats through. For a Confirmation of which, I appeal to Dr. <hi>Lower</hi>'s Book <hi>de Corde.</hi> And where ſuch Symptoms attend the Beginning of the <hi>Small-Pox,</hi> Bleeding is ſeldom, I believe I might ſay never, of any Service. But Bliſters are of excellent Uſe, which is the next General.</p>
            <p>Two Queſtions therefore, I think, ariſe from theſe few laſt Periods.</p>

            </list>
            <p>You ſee, Sir, my Opinion by what has been already ſaid, which I very humbly ſubmit to better Judgments.</p>
            <p>At the End of the precedent Paragraph I have ſaid, that Bliſters are good in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving, or putting a Stop to that miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Symptom, namely, the <hi>Haemorrhages</hi> that frequently attend the Beginnings of the <hi>Small-Pox.</hi> Theſe ſometimes appear, even before any other Signs, and prevent
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0090400300:24"/>the Struggle Nature generally makes to throw off the Diſeaſe from the Center to the <hi>Peripheria</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Dr.</hi> Morton<hi>'s Seventh Hiſt.</hi>
               </note>. Sometimes Bleeding at the Noſe, Spitting of Blood, or an immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate Flux of the <hi>Menſes,</hi> appear juſt at the Eruption; by which Nature in that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Effort is ſo debilitated, that ſhe can't perform, nor go through that Task; and then the Enemy again retires to the Vitals, and acts all imaginable Miſchief. I am well aware what <hi>Botallus</hi> and many others ſay, that the Loſs of Blood will not produce the Effect here charg'd; but I muſt deſire to be excus'd, from reſigning my Senſe and Reaſon; both which I muſt do, ſhould I make any Doubt of the retiring of the poiſonous Particles of this Diſeaſe; when upon the Loſs of Blood, I ſee the Humours ſecreted from the Blood diſappear, and a viſible Paleneſs ſpread in its ſtead, both on the Face, and all over the Body, which no one can deny, who has made any Number of regular Obſervations. But to return to Bliſters. Theſe Bleedings, as I ſaid before, being occaſion'd by the diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Peſtilential Particles in the Serum of the Blood, breaking and dividing the Red Globules into a preternatural Smalneſs, and by that putting the Blood into a Fuſion,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0090400300:25"/>forces it through the Capillary Branches of the Blood-Veſſels: But the Bliſters drawing off Part of this Saline, Deleterious Serum, by abating its Quantity, the Globules afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid are at Liberty to attract each other, and by that means to form themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their genial and natural Size; and ſo the Symptom ceaſes: For I have had frequent Occaſion to obſerve in Perſons that have been ſeiz'd with the moſt violent Effuſion of Blood, that as ſoon as the Serum has be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to fill the Bliſter-Bladder, the Bleeding has conſtantly ceaſed. And thus even the Quantity of the peccant Matter may be ſaid to be diminiſh'd. But where Perſons are averſe to Bliſters, as too frequently they are, we need not be entirely at a Loſs, nor have recourſe to that deſperate Expedient of Phlebotomy; for I do aſſure you the Powder does it as certainly, and after a manner (as I ſuppoſe) much like the Bliſters; for by very ſoon procuring a <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoreſis,</hi> the morbid Matter is brought to the Exteriors, and by Sweat the Deleterious Serum leſſen'd.</p>
            <p>And here, by the way, give me Leave to ſay, with great Submiſſion, that I take the Blood to be the firſt <hi>Nidus</hi> of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious Particles, and not the Spirits, as Dr. <hi>Morton</hi> aſſerts; for as the Matter which fills the Bliſters, and alſo what fills the Puſtles of the <hi>Small-Pox,</hi> are Secretions
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0090400300:26"/>directly from the Blood; it is but reaſonable, I think, to conclude, that the <hi>Fomes</hi> or <hi>Pena</hi> is there for both. Beſides, as the Spirits are form'd from the finer Parts of the Blood, and conſtantly receive their Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply and Reſtoration from that Magazine; ſo it is but natural to conclude, (till the contrary can be demonſtrated) that what Detriment, Labefaction, or Pollution ſoever they receive, muſt be communicated the ſame way. As to the Quickneſs of its Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, that can be no Objection to any one, that conſiders the Pulſe of the Heart and Arteries, and the Motion of the Blood in them; ſo that it requires but a very few Minutes, after the receiving of the Infectious <hi>Lentor</hi> into the Blood, before it may by ſtopping in the fine Capillaries of the <hi>Meninges,</hi> Brain, and Spinal Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, give Occaſion to all thoſe violent Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaſms exercis'd, and communicated through the whole <hi>Syſtaſis Nervoſa;</hi> and which, while looſely carry'd in the <hi>Rivus</hi> of the Blood, has little Opportunity of exerting thoſe excruciating and dolorous Senſations. And farther ſtill, it may be made almoſt a daily Obſervation, that Perſons having been converſant in Places infected, have remov'd to others free of the Diſeaſe; yet after many Days the Inſults of the Diſeaſe have begun upon the Nerves, which is a pretty plain Inſtance. But this by the by. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0090400300:27"/>when we come to conſider the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper once form'd as Phyſicians, the Spirits have their Share, and ſuffer violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and except we conſider the Blood and Spirits in this complex View, we ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver diſcover the true curative Indications; which is what I come now to ſpeak of, and ſhall do it in a very few Words.</p>
            <p>Without repeating what has been already ſaid, the Oppreſſion of the Spirits, the <hi>Diatheſis</hi> the Blood is then in, and the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Diſeaſe, ſhew, I think, the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of Proceeding in the <hi>Alexipharmick</hi> Way, by promoting a general <hi>Diaphereſis</hi> in a gentle manner, by ſuch Medicines as will invigorate the Nerves and Spirits, by fitting them for, as well as putting them upon Action; and at the ſame time pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote a Sudoriferous Perſpiration over the whole Body: So that Neurotick, Volatil, Cephalick Medicines, mix'd with Anodines, and ſuch as will cauſe Sweat without an Inflamation, (all which is to be obtain'd by a Right proceeding, and the <hi>Alexipharma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con</hi> here propoſed) is, and muſt ſurely be acknowledg'd to be the regular Way and Means of aſſiſting Nature in this Exigency. I have often wonder'd to find ſo few of that Claſs of Medicines, call'd Cephalicks, in the <hi>Materia</hi> of Dr. <hi>Morton,</hi> who proceeds on ſuch Principles in affirming the firſt At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacks to be made upon the Nerves, and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0090400300:28"/>their Propagines; for want of which, many of the nobleſt <hi>Alexipharmicks</hi> are render'd not only ineffectual, but hurtful, by doing nothing elſe than inflaming the Blood, and ſcorching the Vitals, ſuch as Saffron, <hi>Rad. Serpent.</hi> &amp;c. The like Miſchief may be charg'd upon Opiates ſimply given, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Guard of Volatil Medicines to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend them; which ſtop and impede Nature in the Diſcharge; and inſtead of procuring that gentle Requies and Refreſhment of Sleep, ſo abſolutely neceſſary in the <hi>Small-Pox,</hi> cauſe horrible Deliriums, Convulſions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But that I may give you no farther Trouble, I proceed now to lay before you the Series of the Cure, a Method I have (by God's Bleſſing) found more than com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſucceſsful.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as there is any Suſpicion of the <hi>Small-Pox,</hi> let the Perſon attack'd go imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to Bed, and endeavour, if poſſible, to get ſome Sleep: Towards the attaining of which, let there be kept the profoundeſt Silence; (which is a Rule to be obſerv'd through the whole Courſe of the Diſeaſe:) For it is hardly to be imagin'd, what inexpreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Diſadvantages ſick Perſons labour un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and what Symptomatick Miſchiefs they heap upon themſelves, by ſtriving (as they call it) againſt the Diſeaſe: By going into the Air, they ſometimes repel the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid Humours to the Vitals; which may be
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0090400300:29"/>done even before there be any viſible Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of them upon the Surface of the Body. Others by Exerciſe, Diverſion, hard Drinking, and the like, thinking to divert, greatly increaſe the Diſeaſe. Which can be of no Advantage in the Beginning of any Fever, but in this does often prove perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious. Let the Patient be cover'd with as many Cloaths as may reaſonably be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd will produce ſuch a Warmth, as is natural, acceptable, and pleaſant in the Winter, and no farther. If the Pains and unquiet Toſſings be ſuch, that no Reſt can be obtain'd without Help; at the End of Twelve Hours from the firſt Attack, and not ſooner without apparent Neceſſity, let the following Draught be taken.</p>

            <p>And let it be repeated every Eight Hours. But if there be violent Symptoms, ſuch as Bleeding at the Noſe or Mouth, <hi>Fluxus Menſium immodicus vel praematurus,</hi> excru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciating Pains, Watching, or the like, it may be repeated every Six or every Four Hours. The precedent Doſe is fitted for Adult Perſons: But for Children of one, two, or three Years old, five Grains is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient; and to be repeated according to the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0090400300:30"/>Age and Strength of the Patient, or the Quantity each time given. The Vehicle above-mention'd is what I generally make uſe of; but the Powder may be given in a little Syrup, ſmall Sack-Whey, or any thing elſe, except <hi>Diacodium.</hi> If the ſick Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are able, let them be help'd out of Bed once every Day; but in this, let their own Deſires, join'd with common Prudence, be the Rule; for no other can be ſet.</p>
            <p>The next thing to be conſider'd, is the Quantity of Liquids to be allow'd. I am not for ſuch large Quantities of Malted Liquors, I mean Small Beer, as is generally in preſent Practice admitted; neither am I totally for denying them. But a Decoction of Figs with ſome <hi>Cochineel,</hi> and inſpirited with ſome ſmall Portion of right good Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, I permit in good Plenty almoſt to the Patient's Choice. As,
<q>
                  <hi>℞</hi> Ficuum Pinginum <hi>lbſs</hi> Cochinel. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>ſs.</hi> coqr. in aq.

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0090400300:31"/>that it exhilerates the Spirits, and abates the Thirſt: And I have not among ſome Hundreds met with any one Perſon, but was pleas'd with it. For in Small Beer, there is generally in Fevers a moſt unwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Clammineſs ſucceeding the drinking of it.</p>
            <p>When the Eurption is perfected, ſo that the firſt Symptoms are abated, the Draught above-mention'd need be repeated but every Night at the Hour of Reſt; nor even then if there be a Natural Propenſity to ſleep, and the <hi>Small-Pox,</hi> be of the mild diſtinct Kind, (yet I always adviſe to have it in <hi>promptu);</hi> but in the Confluent Kind I think it ought to be taken every twenty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>four Hours at leaſt, through the whole Courſe of the Diſeaſe. When the time of Maturation, or according to the Vulgar Idiom, the filling and ripening of the Puſtles commences; which according to Dr. <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> may be reckon'd to begin about three Days after the total Eruption; the foreſaid Draught is certainly neceſſary to be taken twice every Twenty-four Hours: And then I do very much recommend the drinking of large Quantities of what we call Milk-Porridge, made after this Manner: The Oatmeal being finely fifted may be boil'd in a due Quantity of Water for Half an Hour, or very little more, then add a Third Part of New Milk, and juſt give it
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0090400300:32"/>one Boil ſo as to mix it well together, and 'tis enough. This I order ſometimes to be taken Hot as <hi>Tea</hi> or <hi>Coffee,</hi> thus taken it will keep the Paſſages of the Throat clear; and frequently as I have obſerv'd, will make the Scabs of the <hi>Small-Pox,</hi> which are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd in the Paſſages ſcale off, and come away. At other Times to drink a good Draught of the ſame very near Cold, and ſometimes to be taken warm as Food. This ſmooth mild <hi>Pabulum</hi> cloaths, and indeed does as it were digeſt the <hi>Ichorous Serum</hi> of the Blood, to which <hi>Diatheſis</hi> in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluent Kind it is very much diſpoſed, and ſupplies it with a ſoft Chyloſe Matter, wherewith to fill the Puſtles. It likewiſe ſupplies the Salivation, where it happens with a proper Fluid, gently raiſes it when it abates, and keeps up the neceſſary Tume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſactions of the Extremities. It may be alſo a reaſonable Means to prevent any Tabid or Conſumptive Diſpoſitions, which are here frequently founded: And I have always ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd the Patients very ſoon recover their Strength, who have plentifully taken of this ſimple innocent Food. In the mean time, the Decoction of the Figs is not to be omitted being ſometimes taken.</p>
            <p>Thus, Sir, am I come to the laſt Stage, the Criſis and Declination of the Diſeaſe, which is attended with leſs or more Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, according as the Precedent have
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0090400300:33"/>been treated; and in which I have found little trouble, where I have had the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of directing its ſetting out; and even ſtill are the <hi>Alexipharmicks</hi> to be uſed, tho' at greater Diſtances, ſo that I recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the ſame Draught every Night, then every other Night, and ſo to be left off. I confeſs at this time, too frequently appears the direful Symptons in the confluent Kind, and require the utmoſt Penetration to find out Means to aſſiſt Nature, that ſhe may defend her ſelf againſt this laſt Aſſault. As for Bleeding, I hope, ſuch Adventrous Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings are quite out of Thought. And really, Sir, I have not been able to collect any great Advantage even from Bliſters as commonly directed, that is on any other Part of the Body except the Head; for at this time the chief Intention is to ſtimulate Nature in her ſeveral Offices to act the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining Part with ſome Vigor. Neither have I found there has been any reaſon to boaſt of the good Conſequences, though the Bliſters have had their common Effect; for there having been ſo vaſt an Expence of Juices already, there is apt to follow Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiums, and a great Proſtration of Spirits upon this ſecond additional Diſcharge; but Bliſters on the Head, from whoſe Office we expect little more than to excite and ſtir up the remaining Force, are, and have been of excellent Uſe. Nay, Sir, I have made uſe,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0090400300:34"/>I do aſſure you, of actual Fire upon the Head, and viſibly, under God, deliver'd two Perſons who were in the very Article, when all was thrown up, and others had withdrawn themſelves, and nothing but Death expected every Moment. But where the Uſe of this, by reaſon of its ſeeming Severity, ſhould be deny'd the Phyſician, inſtead of it I adviſe, that after as much Hair of the Head can be taken off, as the preſent Urgency will admit of (tho' I always order that to be done at the beginning of the Diſeaſe) then to fill a Broad, Thin, Linnen Bag, with bruiſed Cantharides, and having dipp'd it into boiling Vinegar, to lay it almoſt ſcalding Hot upon the Head. This, I confeſs, I never had occaſion to make Tryal of but once, and then 'twas with evident Succeſs, the Perſon being now living, but eſpecial Care muſt be taken to ſee the Bag keeps warm, for if it turn cold it may prove miſchievous.</p>
            <p>Having thus far ſpoken of the <hi>Small Pox,</hi> in regard to Perſons that may be Patients under it, in an indifferent and general Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; I now intreat your Permiſſion, Good Sir, to ſpeak of Women with Child, who are afflicted with that Diſeaſe, ſingularly, and in a Place by themſelves; their Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion having been always look'd on as full of Hazard upon many Accounts; and for whoſe Sake chiefly you have all this Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0090400300:35"/>and the preſent Publication (if it may be ſo) is made to the World. Not but that the Diſtemper is the ſame in every reſpect that regards it ſelf, and muſt be generally ſo treated. But the ſad Fatality which ſo commonly attends theſe poor People at that time; the conſidering that Two Lives are included in one Individual, and therefore that one Fate muſt attend them, and both be ſav'd or loſt together; with other Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, which too often go along with it, that it moſt frequently happens on a Woman's firſt Pregnancy; ſo that the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations of a Family on one Side are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly extinct, and ſometimes it hath fallen out that both have been.</p>
            <p>Theſe and other moving Incidents put me upon the utmoſt Streſs of conſidering their Caſes, with the greateſt and moſt heedful Attention I was Maſter of. And I do here, and ever muſt with all the Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of my Soul, acknowledge and adore the Divine Goodneſs on theſe poor Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours; and which I hope are agreeable to the Proceedure of Nature, and the <hi>Ars Medica,</hi> by what follows.</p>
            <p>Here I muſt again inculcate, as I muſt on all Occaſions, that the ſtrict Enquiry in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Animal Oeconomy is and has been the juſt, regular, and only Means for diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering uſeful Remedies; at leaſt the proper Way of rendring any of the Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0090400300:36"/>of the <hi>Materia Medica</hi> rationally, and therefore as conſtantly ſucceſsful as the Strength of the Diſeaſe, or the Weakneſs of Humanity will admit of. Thus Dr. <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Grabe</hi> puts it into a Kind of exempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Method; and in diſtinct Chapters tells us, what Ways we are to take, if ever we intend or deſire to make any commendable Diſcoveries in Chirurgery or Pharmacy; and therefore propoſes to our Imitation, the Examples of the moſt conſiderable Phyſiolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſts of the Time he liv'd in, or a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it; beginning at our Great Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Dr. <hi>Harvey,</hi> and inſtances in many Particulars, what Light the Knowledge of the Circulation of the Blood has given to the Pathology of Diſeaſes, and the Secrets that may be diſcloſed from the Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions thereon. He proceeds afterward to the Diſcoveries made by <hi>Bartholine, Whar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, Steno, Sylvius,</hi> and <hi>Willis;</hi> and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally hinting, what uſeful Inventions have been, and ſtill may be made for the Good of Mankind by following their Pattern, which he preſſes very earneſtly to all the Practiſers in that noble Art. And here I beg you will indulge me ſo far, to affirm to you, that if there be any thing valuable in what I now lay before you, it is owing to the conſidering the Parts of a Gravid Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male more intimately than ordinary, at the Time when theſe Parts of the Kingdom
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0090400300:37"/>were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> with the <hi>Small-Pox.</hi> And find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo little Encouragement; and on the contrary, ſo much Forbiddance in the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of the common Procedure, either in Books or Obſervation; there ſeem'd to me to be a Kind of tacit Demand made by the tender Sex upon all the Practiſers in the Science, to have their Caſe peculiarly conſider'd.</p>
            <p>To ſpeak firſt in general, and to conſider, that Nature is then intent upon the great Work of propagating and perpetuating her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the Species: And that this is a Task the moſt arduous in its Performance of all natural Functions, is ſufficiently obſervable from the great Turn, and, as it were, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution made in the Conſtitution. Not to entertain you with the ſhocking Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the Act of Generation, though really obſervable enough, but the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of it. Upon the firſt ſetting out of the <hi>Primordia</hi> of Conception, the <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> are intercepted; ſo that the Blood, Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, Lymph, and the whole <hi>Genus fluidum</hi> of the Syſtem take a new Turn; and this not purely for the Nutrition of the but juſt conceiv'd <hi>Faetus,</hi> which it does not, nor is it poſſible it ſhould receive the thouſandth Part, but for many other Uſes and Reaſons, and for this general one amongſt the reſt, becauſe ſhe would not admit of any Avoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or Interruption in this ſo great an
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0090400300:38"/>Undertaking. And we almoſt always ſee, that Miſcarriages (not to ſpeak of the Loſs of the <hi>Embryo,</hi> which however ought to be conſider'd, and ſeems to be a Duty im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd in our Oaths) are incomparably more full of Danger, and ruinous, even to the Health of the Mother, than natural and timely Births. And this, I ſuppoſe, no one will put me upon proving, when Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and every Day's Experience, manifeſts it to the moſt ſuperficial Obſervation. But when to this is added, the violent Inſults of a little leſs than Peſtilential Fever; when ſhe is forced from this her grand Intention, call'd off and diverted to contend with what is ſo frequently too ſtrong of it ſelf, and which God in his merciful Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Providence has ſo order'd, that human Nature is rarely, if ever, more than once in each Individual ſubjected to it. When to theſe general Diſadvantages, ſo conſiderable a Part of the Mother, as the <hi>Foetus,</hi> when of any Magnitude, muſt be accounted, is in Danger, if not timely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, of being torn from her; by which ſo great an Effuſion of Blood, and other Fluids, ſuch an Exhauſtion of Spirits muſt immediately follow: What Intenſeneſs of Thought and Sedulity muſt theſe Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations raiſe in every one, that deſires, or intends to make himſelf ſerviceable in his Employ, to which he has aſſign'd himſelf,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0090400300:39"/>and is, as it were, elected? Upon ſuch like Obſervations as theſe, I thought my ſelf excuſable, if I took a Method ſomewhat pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar, to prevent, if poſſible, that which might be otherwiſe deſtructive of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Offspring; and without this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing done, every Day's ſad Experience ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently ſhews, that both muſt generally be loſt together. To detain you therefore no longer; As ſoon as ever I have been call'd to a Woman with Child, and there has been Reaſon to believe ſhe would be ſeiz'd with the <hi>Small-Pox;</hi> as by the uſual Symptoms in the Perſon her ſelf, or the Place where ſhe lives being viſited, together with her own Fears and Apprehenſions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtrongly employ'd or affected; in ſuch a Caſe, without ſtaying for the appearing of any other Sign, to make the Diagnoſtick certain, I always give ſomething to prevent Miſcarriage; and in this, I dare preſume you, Sir, will agree with me, that I am regularly diſcharging my Duty, becauſe ſuch Adminiſtration can have no Male-Tendency: Beſides, the <hi>Lucta</hi> is ſo great, the Convulſion frequently ſo violent, at the ſame time that the poiſonous <hi>Miaſmata</hi> are making their Inſults upon the Internals be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Eruption, that the <hi>Placenta</hi> is in great Danger of being very much looſen'd, if not immediately torn and divided from the Mother; upon which, all the Symptoms
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0090400300:40"/>before recited, and many more, muſt be exaſperated. And under this Oppreſſion, while Nature is held in this unhappy Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemma of attending one or the other, either to expel the Diſeaſe, or preſerve the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bryo,</hi> and is not able to perform both; du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Heſitation, both Mother and Child are in the moſt eminent Danger of being loſt: Immediately therefore I order the following <hi>Bolus</hi> and Draught.</p>
            <q>
               <p>
                  <hi>℞</hi> Pulv. Rad. Tormentil. <hi>

            </q>
            <p>After this has been taken about Two Hours, I then order the <hi>Alexipharmick</hi> Draught before-mention'd. In which you ſee, I regard both the Pregnancy of the Mother, as well as endeavour to get the Enemy at the ſame time remov'd to that convenient Diſtance from the Vitals, that we may with ſome tolerable Safety parly with him. The <hi>Bolus</hi> and Draught againſt Abortion, I certainly repeat at the End of four Hours after taking the firſt; but then
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0090400300:41"/>omit it for twelve Hours, except ſome pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Reaſons from the Patient oblige me to repeat it ſooner. The Signs of an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching Miſcarriage, and that of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Birth being ſo very like, and Women being ſo abundantly ſenſible of the Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larities in that Caſe, I need not take up any room here in reciting them: Upon which Occaſions and Informations, I repeat the <hi>Bolus</hi> and Draught every three, four, or five Hours, as Need ſhall require; the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen herſelf being kept in Bed in the moſt quiet Diſpoſition and Poſture that is poſſible, till theſe threatning Signs abate. For at this time I am ſo intent on tying, as it were, all things faſt in the Communication be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Mother and <hi>Foetus,</hi> that in truth I think nothing ſafe, or like to be ſo, till that great Point is ſecur'd; and that the foremention'd <hi>Bolus,</hi> or the <hi>Rad. Tormentil.</hi> (in what Form the Phyſician ſhall think fit, or the Prtient can beſt take it) will do; at leaſt I never yet knew it fail. But ſtill I would have the Decoction of Figs before ſpoken of, in proper Intervals freely uſed (and likewiſe the <hi>Alexipharmick</hi> Draught ſometimes) as being what will dilute the Fervency of the Blood, and help to break and divide the morbid and peccant Matter from it, and is a good <hi>Diaphoretick</hi> beſides. After this, I generally repeat the two Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines againſt Abortion once every Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0090400300:42"/>four Hours, as there is Opportunity, ſo as not to interfere with the Medicines ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to bring forward the general Diſeaſe. But however, when that is near the State, and grows towards a Criſis, I never omit giving it twice at leaſt in Twenty four Hours. After that is over, I withdraw thoſe reſtringent Medicines to once in that Time: Then to once in Two natural Days; and then to once in three or four Days. But if the Diſeaſe be of the mildeſt Kind, then neither this, nor any other Medicine, directed to what Intention ſoever, need be ſo frequently repeated. But if it be of the Confluent, or even of the Cohaerent Kind, if we keep not upon the Guard, we ſhall be in Danger of being ſurprized; for in ſuch Kind of Fevers that are, or are near like Peſtilential, there is ſuch Relaxation, or, may I not call it, a Diſſolution in all the Juices, and alſo in the internal Membranes, that they too frequently fall, as it were, in ſunder; and thus ſometimes diſappoint us in our moſt confident and ſanguine Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. When the Criſis is paſs'd, and all the Symptoms much abated, and Nature un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a ſenſible Alleviation and Refreſhment, we may with Reaſon believe the Patient out of Danger, conſider'd ſingly in the Mother; ſo that the <hi>Embryo</hi> ought now to be our pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Regard. As ſoon therefore as it is manifeſt that it may be done without Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0090400300:43"/>I would have the inferior Inteſtines empty'd of the <hi>Faeces</hi> by the common do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtick Cliſter of Milk and Sugar. The ſame may be repeated the next Day; and then intermitting a Day, it may be again made uſe of, if the Strength of the Patient will admit of it. But I do poſitively de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare againſt any purging Medicine being taken at the Mouth by Women with Child; becauſe it puts the Child into the utmoſt Danger of being expell'd before its time: Of which, with Permiſſion, I ſhall give you Two pretty plain Inſtances.</p>
            <p>A Gentlewoman of this Town, who had the <hi>Small-Pox</hi> in the mildeſt manner ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable, ſo that there was little or no Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion for any Aſſiſtance on any reſpect whatever, was (tho' with Child) treated at the latter End, as in common Caſes, with purging Medicines, by which (in her own Opinion, and alſo in that of moſt about her) ſhe miſcarry'd. Again:</p>
            <p>Mrs. <hi>Snow,</hi> a Gentlewoman who was moſt ſeverely handled, as by her Caſe here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after recited appears, upon her Recovery from the utmoſt Danger, was ſo prepoſſeſs'd with the Neceſſity of being purg'd after ſuch a Diſeaſe, that notwithſtanding all I could ſay, would not be prevail'd with, but purg'd ſhe would be. I order'd her nothing elſe but</p>
            <p>℞ <hi>Mannae, Sal Cathartic. Glauberaa.</hi> ℥ſs.
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0090400300:44"/>to be taken in Gruel; by which ſhe had Five moderate Stools: Yet even this cauſed in the Child ſuch tremulous, fluttering and diſorder'd Motions, and in her ſelf ſuch parturient Pains, that without waiting to know whether the Purge had finiſh'd its full Operation, I was neceſſitated to give the Draught and <hi>Bolus</hi> againſt Abortion: Upon which ſhe was abundantly convinced, and deſir'd ſhe might have no more Purges. Neither indeed had ſhe any more, nor any one elſe with whom I was concern'd, who were with Child, any thing of that Kind, but the Cliſter before-mentioned, till after the Time of their Delivery. They and their Children are all alive, and in perfect Health, (Mrs. <hi>Dove</hi> being long ſince ſafely deliver'd.) And more I think I need not urge. I only therefore beg your Patience for one Word more of Comfort to Women with Child. And pardon, I intreat you, good Sir, any ſeeming Vanity in it. As I have laid their Caſe, as well as I can, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you, I may with ſome Aſſurance, as well as Pleaſure, ſay, that thus conſider'd, their Condition is even not ſo dangerous as other Women: For it is obſerv'd by Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, and may be ſo very often in our own Practice, that the Proceeding and Advance of the Diſeaſe, and its Cure, is interrupted by the Menſtruation of Female Patients, even in their timely and regular manner;
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0090400300:45"/>and is enumerated
<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Marton,</hi> Cap. 3. P. 207.</note> as one ſingular Diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage in their Caſe, and is much worſe when (as it frequently happens) it appears before its Time. For a Confirmation of what I now ſay, I refer my ſelf to Dr. <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>'s Hiſtorical Obſervations in the 9th, 18th, 36th, 37th, 41ſt, 52d Hiſtories of <hi>Puretology.</hi> And for the unhappy Events ſubſequent on Abortions, the 43d and 44th Hiſtories of the ſame Author are ſufficient Teſtimonies. I ſhall add but this one gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Obſervation more, on which it cannot but be imagin'd I muſt reflect with ſome Satisfaction, that during the Continuance of the <hi>Small-Pox</hi> in theſe Parts, there was not one Perſon with Child, for whom I was conſulted, whom I treated not in the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod above deſcrib'd; and not one of them but is now alive, and ſo are their Children: Except Mrs. <hi>Withnoe</hi>'s, which liv'd above a Fortnight, and then I believe died on the firſt Inſults of the <hi>Small-Pox;</hi> there being a Neceſſity, by reaſon of the weak Condition of the Mother, and other Diſorders of the Family, to keep it conſtantly in a Room, where Three others lay miſerably afflicted of the Confluent Sort of <hi>Small-Pox.</hi> And I can't learn from the ſtricteſt Enquiry I have made, that any eſcap'd that were not

            <p>After what has been ſaid, I ſhall take Leave to lay before you ſome Hiſtorical Caſes: Which I hope, Sir, will not only ſeem excuſable, but neceſſary, and even incumbent on me; that ſo any Perſon may be ſatisfied, that ſhall think fit to enquire into the Truth of the Relations from the Perſons themſelves.</p>

                  <hi>The Firſt</hi> CASE.</head>
               <p>A Servant-Maid of Mrs. <hi>Blythe,</hi> at the <hi>Red Lion</hi> in <hi>Stamford,</hi> was ſeiz'd on the 14th of <hi>April,</hi> 1715. with Vomiting, a racking Pain in her Head, Back, and Loins; which after about four Hours remitted, and ſhe was able, though very weakly, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the Buſineſs of the Houſe. On the 15th her Pains return'd, when I was ſent for; and enquiring whether ſhe had had the <hi>Small-Pox</hi> before, and being anſwer'd in the Negative, I told them there was great Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to believe ſhe now would. Preſently after the <hi>Menſes</hi> broke ſomewhat before the natural Time in a pretty large manner, at which the Patient was greatly terrified. At Night they remov'd her, with great Care,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0090400300:47"/>to another Part of the Town; and ſhewing a great Diſinclination to the taking of any Medicine, from a covetous Fear, as I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd, of the Charge, I left her without any. On the 16th, very early in the Morning, Mrs. <hi>Blythe</hi> came to me, told me that her Maid was dying, and that the <hi>Menſes</hi> flow'd from her like the Floodings of a Woman after Delivery. I found her indeed in a very weak Condition, her Pulſe quick and low, her ſelf very ſhort breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and in frequent <hi>Deliquiums.</hi> I order'd her to take the <hi>Alexipharmick</hi> Draught im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, and to be repeated every four Hours for three times; for ſhe had got no Sleep, and at the ſame time a large Bliſter to be laid to her Neck. At Night I found her much refreſh'd, and the <hi>Small-Pox</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to appear in large Spots on ſeveral Parts, as the Confluent Kind generally does: the <hi>Fluxus Catmeniorum</hi> was ſomewhat re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd. I order'd the ſame Draught to be repeated at the Hour of Reſt; and the Bliſter, which had been neglected, to be apply'd. On the 17th, in the Morning, I found the Eruption general, the Patient had taken pretty good Reſt, and the <hi>Delirium,</hi> which had before at intermitting times tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented her, gone off. The <hi>Menſtrua</hi> ſtill continued, and this Day more than that before. But the Bliſter, through the ſtupid Conceitedneſs of a poor ignorant Nurſe,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0090400300:48"/>was not yet apply'd; and finding there was no Dependance on her, I laid it on with my own Hands, and repeated the ſame Draught as before. At Night I found all things much amended, the <hi>Menſes</hi> ſtopp'd, the Eruption come much forward, the Bliſter having taken a full Effect, and the Patient, after a good Sleep, much refreſh'd. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued the Uſe of the Draught every Night only, till near the Criſis, and then repeated it Night and Morning for three or four Days. All this Time ſhe took plentifully of the Decoction of Figs; and towards the Time of ripening, very freely of Milk-Porridge: And thus, by God's Bleſſing, under many Diſadvantages, ſhe perfectly recover'd.</p>

                  <hi>The Second</hi> CASE.</head>
               <p>In <hi>Auguſt,</hi> 1715. The Wife of <hi>William Weight</hi> of <hi>Uffington</hi> near <hi>Stamford,</hi> was ſeiz'd with the <hi>Small-Pox.</hi> On the Fifth Day of the Diſeaſe, and ſecond of the Eruption, I was ſent for, by which time it ſufficiently appear'd to be the confluent Kind. She had for Twelve Hours been tormented with a violent Looſeneſs, and Griping before I came to her; and was now at every Stool Fainting and Swooning: Upon her Breaſt, Arms, and many other
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0090400300:49"/>Parts, appear'd Black, and Livid Spots; which I ſhewed her Siſter, who expreſſed a moſt tender Care and Concern for her; at the ſame time telling her how little Hopes there was of the Patient. This was the 21ſt of the Month, and about Noon I order'd her the Draught, with ℈ij. of the <hi>Alexipharmick</hi> Powder to be preſently taken, and ſtay'd by her to ſee the Event. In about an Hour an Half the <hi>Lax</hi> ſeem'd to be ſtopp'd, and ſhe fell into a Sleep for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt an Hour. She had no <hi>Delirium,</hi> but at the firſt Attack of the Diſeaſe, and ſhe now awak'd much refreſh'd, and was her ſelf ſenſible of it; ſo that ſhe told me ſhe could not but conceive ſome Hopes of her Recovery; I encourag'd her in that good Diſpoſition in order to keep up her Spirits, and deſir'd ſhe would obſerve the Rules that ſhould be ſet her, which ſhe promiſed to the beſt of her Power and Knowledge. I then enjoin'd her Siſter to let no one Perſon come near her on any Account whatever, that ſo ſhe might take all the Occaſions of repoſing that could offer. She took near a Quart of the <hi>Decoctum Ficuum</hi> every 24 Hours. I viſited her twice every Day, and every Night and Morning ſhe took the Draught till towards the State of the Diſeaſe. I order'd her Siſter to withdraw the Draught in the Morning, this was the 25th Day of the Month, and the Ninth or Tenth of the diſeaſe; <gap reason="missing" extent="1+ pages">
