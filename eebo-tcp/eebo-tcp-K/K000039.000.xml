            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>My LORD,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <hi>POetry,</hi> in its firſt Inſtitution, was prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally deſign'd to Correct, and rectify Manners. Thence it was that the <hi>Roman</hi> and <hi>Athenian Stages</hi> were accounted Schools of Divinity and Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; where the Tragick Writers of thoſe Days inſpired their Audiences with <hi>Noble</hi> and <hi>Heroick Sentiments,</hi> and the <hi>Comick</hi> laugh'd and diverted them out of their <hi>Vices;</hi> and by rediculing <hi>Folly, Intemperence,</hi> and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchery,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:1105700300:4"/>
gave them an Indignation for thoſe Irregularities, and made them purſue the oppoſite <hi>Virtues.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This caus'd the <hi>Dramatic Poets,</hi> in anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Times, not only to be reverenc'd by the lower ſort of People, but highly Eſteem'd and Courted by Perſons of the firſt Rank; and tho' the Writers of latter Ages, have, in a greater Meaſure, not to ſay in a ſcandelous Manner, deviated from the Foot-ſteps, and Examples of their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors; yet have they found Protection and Favour with thoſe, who have been ſo Generous as to aſcribe the Faults of the <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets</hi> to the Degeneracy of the <hi>Age</hi> wherein they liv'd.</p>
            <p>This conſideration, <hi>my Lord,</hi> has im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolden'd me to this Addreſs, for tho' on the one Hand I am ſenſible, that the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Piece does little Merit your <hi>Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip</hi>'s Patronage; yet your innate Goodneſs and Generoſity give me hopes, that your Lordſhip will Pardon this Intruſion, in
<pb facs="tcp:1105700300:5"/>
which I have the Examples of all thoſe that <hi>wrote</hi> before me to bear me out. I heartily wiſh this Play were more worthy of your <hi>Lordſhip</hi>'s Acceptance: Yet ſo much, I hope, will be forgiven to the fondneſs of a Mother for her Production; if, I ſay, in its Favour, that through the whole Piece, I have had a tender regard to good Manners, and by the main Drift of it, endeavour'd to Redicule and Correct one of the moſt reigning Vices of the Age. I might ſay, as many of my <hi>Brethren</hi> have done upon ſlighter Grounds, that this Play has had the good Fortune to Pleaſe and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the Niceſt, and Politeſt Part of the Town; but I ſhould ſet little Streſs on their Applauſe, had I not ſome reaſon to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon your <hi>Lordſhip</hi>'s Approbation, whoſe Judgement, Penetration and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment, are alone ſufficient to do full Juſtice to a performance of this Kind.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:1105700300:6"/>
And now, my <hi>Lord,</hi> if I follow'd the beaten Road of Dedicators, it would natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally Engage me in a <hi>Panegirick,</hi> upon your Lordſhip's Perſonal Virtues, and thoſe of your <hi>Noble</hi> and <hi>Pious Family;</hi> but I ſhall purpoſely decline a Talk to which I freely own my Ability is Unequal, and which, tho' manag'd by a <hi>Maſterly Pen,</hi> would make your Modeſty ſuffer. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſhall conclude, with begging your <hi>Lordſhip</hi>'s leave to Subſcribe my ſelf, with all imaginable Reſpect and Sincerity.</p>
