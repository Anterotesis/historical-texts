            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>GAther up the Fragments that remain, that nothing be Loſt,</hi> John 6. 12. Was the direction of our <hi>Saviour</hi> to his <hi>Diſciples,</hi> after he had fed the Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude. Which may well and uſefully be applied, to the Collecting and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the Accounts of the <hi>Lives</hi> of <hi>Good Men: Men</hi> who in their Day, have been eminently uſeful in thoſe Stations of Life, wherein <hi>God,</hi> by his good <hi>Providence,</hi> hath placed them. And this preſerving, by <hi>Publication,</hi> is the rather to be done, when themſelves do leave behind them, in Writing, an <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count</hi> of their <hi>Lives,</hi> and of the <hi>ſignal Mercies of God</hi> to them therein: For
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0726600200:3"/>
from ſuch <hi>Accounts,</hi> may beſt be gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by the <hi>Reader,</hi> the Man's <hi>particular State, Exerciſe</hi> and <hi>Growth</hi> in the <hi>Work</hi> of <hi>Reſtoration,</hi> out of the <hi>Fall</hi> and <hi>Dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neracy:</hi> And, in the Reading thereof, be not only excited to <hi>Bleſs the Name of the Lord,</hi> on his behalf; but alſo gain ſome direction from the <hi>Path,</hi> ſo fairly tract out, and ground of <hi>Hope;</hi> that by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Faithful,</hi> they may likewiſe attain to the ſame good <hi>Experience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is not with me any doubt, but ſomething of this kind may be the Lot of many, into whoſe Hands this <hi>Treatiſe</hi> may happen to come; for that they will herein meet with variety of <hi>Exerciſes,</hi> and the <hi>Providences</hi> of God therein, all related with great ſtrength and plainneſs of Speech: Our <hi>Deceaſed</hi> Friend <hi>Thomas Ellwood,</hi> having been a Man whom God had endued with <hi>ſingular Abilities,</hi> both as a <hi>Man,</hi> and as a <hi>Chriſtian;</hi> which is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident, not only from this ſhort Account of his <hi>Life,</hi> which was written by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and by the <hi>Supplement</hi> added here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto;
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0726600200:4"/>
but more largely from his many uſeful Labours and Services in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Books which he writ in the Defence of <hi>Truth,</hi> and the <hi>Friends</hi> thereof: For which <hi>Service</hi> he was in a particular manner qualified, by <hi>Spiritual Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Chriſtian Obedience;</hi> to which, in him, was added great ſtrength and depth of <hi>Judgment,</hi> wherein he could diſcern the Spirits of others, and was very much the Maſter of his own, as did appear to ſuch who knew him, not only by the ſoundneſs of his <hi>Reaſoning,</hi> and the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonableneſs of his <hi>Words;</hi> but alſo by his great and exemplary <hi>Modeſty,</hi> in that he was not haſty to <hi>propoſe,</hi> nor rudely tenacious to inſiſt on what he had propoſed; if any thing, though not well expreſt, yet well intended, was offered by any one much Weaker; nay, though but by a <hi>Babe</hi> in <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His <hi>Countenance</hi> was Manly and Chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; His <hi>Deportment</hi> Grave, yet Affable and Courteous, even to the meaneſt Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; His Converſation Innocent, Pleaſant
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0726600200:5"/>
and Inſtructive, yet ſevere againſt any thing that was beyond the Liberty of <hi>Truth.</hi> Theſe, with his other Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Mind,</hi> did render him both very Acceptable and very Uſeful, as a <hi>Friend,</hi> as a <hi>Neighbour,</hi> and as a <hi>Member</hi> and <hi>Elder</hi> in the <hi>Church of Chriſt;</hi> and the more, for that his Time was chiefly Imployed in being Service<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in one or other of theſe <hi>Capacities.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I might here particularly mention the ſeveral <hi>Labours</hi> of our <hi>Deceaſed Friend,</hi> according to their reſpective Times, and the Nature of their ſeveral Subjects; but much of this being already done in the enſuing Pages, I chuſe to remit the <hi>Reader</hi> thither; by which poſſibly he may be excited to the Peruſal of them, and ſhall only ſay concerning them, <hi>that the Judicious Reader will eaſily Obſerve, that his Method and Stile do denote him to have been a Scholar: And yet not farther ſo, than the Simplicity and Purity of the</hi> Truth, <hi>whereof he made Profeſſion, would permit him.</hi>

I was with our Friend <hi>Thomas Ell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood,</hi> the greater part of his <hi>Sickneſs:</hi> In which he was alſo very frequently viſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by our Friend <hi>George Bowles,</hi> who was his Neighbour; to whom therefore I refer, for the Account which he may give of his <hi>Sickneſs</hi> and <hi>Dying Words.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As it was my good Lot to be well acquainted with him (though only in the latter Years of his Life) and know that he did neither uſe nor encourage the beſtowing Elaborate <hi>Encomiums</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Perſons Deceaſed: So neither ſhall I add further concerning him, than to ſay with the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Faithful, <note place="margin">Heb. 11. 4.</note>

               <p>It is in my Heart briefly, on this Occaſion, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorate the <hi>tender Dealings</hi> of the Lord with his People in this latter Age of the World, when it hath pleaſed him, in Love to poor loſt Man, graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to appear, by the breaking forth of his <hi>Glorious Goſpel Day.</hi> And by the ſecret divine Reaches of the Hand of God, which hath been felt and ſeen in the Light of it, many have been drawn in their Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits to ſeek after the Lord, and to enquire after the Knowledge of the Way of <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Salvation;</hi> and bleſſed be his Holy Name, who was graciouſly pleaſed, by the Inſhinings of this <hi>Divine Light</hi> in the Hearts of many, to expel the <hi>Darkneſs</hi> and rend the <hi>Vail.</hi> And then was the Arm of his mighty Power made bare, for the gathering many Thouſands to the ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Knowledge of Himſelf.</hi> And in that Day was the Lord pleaſed according to his Promiſe, to <hi>pour forth of his Spirit upon Sons and upon Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;</hi> yea, upon Servants and upon Handmaids, and many were made to Propheſie; and being qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified by the Holy Spirit, which they received, and were baptized by it into his Name, became willing, and were freely given up in Obedience to the Lord, and in Bowels of tender Love to the Souls of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, in his Power, to preach the Goſpel of Life and Salvation to thoſe to whom they were ſent, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

were turned from <hi>Darkneſs to Light, and from the Power of Satan unto God,</hi> by their Miniſtry: Amongſt whom our dear deceaſed Friend and Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>THOMAS ELLWOOD,</hi> was one, whoſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience was reached and awakened by the Powerful Miniſtry of dear <hi>Edward Burrough,</hi> as I have heard him relate (and as by the following Sheets will more plainly appear.) And of that Day and Time, and the worthy Inſtrument by whoſe Miniſtry he was Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, and turned unto God, and made ſenſible of the <hi>Divine Principle</hi> of <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Light</hi> in his own Heart, have I heard him ſpeak with great Regard; and alſo of the Sufferings which did attend him after he received the Truth in his Father's Family, for the Truth's ſake: and how the Lord preſerved him in that time, under the various Exerciſes, which he paſſed through for Truth's Teſtimony; which for Chriſt's ſake he was Conſcientiouſly Concerned to ſtand in, according to that Plainneſs and Simplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which Truth then led, and ſtill continues to lead the ſincere Diſciples of Chriſt into, by which they were diſtinguiſhed from the World; and, for the ſake thereof, they were deſpiſed of Men, and hated of the World. Such was the Plain Langu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of <hi>Thou</hi> to one, and refuſing the <hi>Hat-Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour;</hi> For which, Dear <hi>T. E.</hi> ſuffered not a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle in that Day, as, by the following Account of his Life more fully appears. And it were well if all, who come up in a Profeſſion of the Bleſſed Truth in this Time, were Faithful in theſe, and in the other Branches of its Teſtimony. And let all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that the neglecting thereof, is, in a Degree,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0726600200:9"/>
a making void the Sufferings of the Faithful (and ſtrengthening the Hands of Evil Doers) who for the ſake of their <hi>Teſtimony, loved not their Lives to the Death;</hi> but underwent cruel <hi>Mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, Buffetings, Stonings, Whippings, Stock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, Revilings, Impriſonments,</hi> and <hi>Spoiling of Goods;</hi> Rejoycing in the Lord, that they were counted worthy to Suffer, either leſs or more, for his Name ſake. In reſpect of which, this my dear <hi>Friend</hi> was a good Example, he being a Man of a ſteady <hi>Mind,</hi> and very patient in <hi>Suffering,</hi> as well as Faithful in his Teſtimony for <hi>Truth,</hi> and took joyfully the Spoiling of his <hi>Goods,</hi> wherein he was tryed but a few Years before his Death. He was often Concerned in Defence of Truth's Teſtimony, both againſt our Profeſſed <hi>Adverſaries,</hi> and alſo againſt the <hi>Libertine Spirit</hi> which appeared in ſome, Profeſſing the ſame Truth with us, who Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed themſelves againſt that good Order and Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline which the <hi>Truth</hi> led <hi>Friends</hi> into. All which will abundantly appear from the Books themſelves, which are in Print, which he writ upon <hi>Various Occaſions,</hi> and upon <hi>Divers Subjects;</hi> and let not his great Labour and Induſtry be Forgotten, in his writing thoſe Two Hiſtorical Volumes, relating to the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New Teſtament:</hi> A Work truly Great, and is, and may be of great Uſe and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. By all which his many Labours, it may be perceived by the wary and inlightned <hi>Reader,</hi> that the Lord had Endowed him with an excellent Gift, and Qualified him for the Service of Truth, his Church and People; in which he imployed the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0726600200:10"/>
which the bountiful Lord had given him, to the Honour of the great Giver, and to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and Edification of the Church of Chriſt: But more eſpecially were his Services known to the <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren</hi> in this County of <hi>Bucks;</hi> Moſt of which are fallen aſleep, and but few remaining here, who knew him in his beginning, or his firſt Services for the Lord, his Church and People; amongſt whom he was a Zealous Aſſerter of that excellent Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline the Lord had opened in, and led his People to, for the preſerving his Church as a Garden en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed: for which cauſe how did many of thoſe <hi>Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines</hi> ſet themſelves fiercely againſt him, and ſhot their Arrows at him; but the Lord Defended him, and covered his Head in the <hi>Day of Battle, and his Bow abode in Strength, and his Bough ſpread over the Wall, and continued freſh and green:</hi> But a Blaſt from the Lord came upon their Evil Work; And how have they melted away? And how is their Strength failed, and their Work brought to Naught? But the Bleſſing of the Lord is with his People, even with the Faithful, to this Day, whom he hath preſerved as a peculiar Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to himſelf: Bleſſed be his Holy Name for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more. And furthermore, it may be truly ſaid of this our dear Friend, that as the Lord fitted him for his Service, ſo was he eminently ſerviceable in his Hand, in the Church of Chriſt; particularly in theſe Parts, of which there are many Living Witneſſes, in this and the adjacent Counties, of his great Labour of Love, having ſerved the Church Freely, with great Diligence and Faithfulneſs: The true ſenſe of which,

               <p>His <hi>Natural Capacity</hi> was large, and his <hi>Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,</hi> in the <hi>things of God,</hi> very deep; which excellent Qualifications meeting in one, rendred him uſeful beyond many, to his <hi>Country,</hi> as well as very ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable in the <hi>Church;</hi> by both which he is, and will be greatly miſſed.

               </p>

               <p>We have this farther to add, namely, That our Eſteem of him was great, becauſe of that real worth that was in him, through the Operation of the mighty Power of the Lord that ſeparated him from the <hi>Love</hi> of the <hi>World:</hi> So that he choſe (with <hi>Moſes</hi>) rather to <hi>ſuffer Affliction with the People of God, than to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the Pleaſures of Sin for a Seaſon,</hi> and it pleaſed the Lord to fit him with Wiſdom and Counſel, ſo that he was made able to give Judgment in difficult Caſes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in many of us have particularly received Benefit, and therefore have cauſe to lament the loſs we have by his Removal.

               <p>HE was a Man of great Wiſdom and Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and the Lord, the Giver of it, being pleaſed to viſit him in his early Days, made choice of him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and by the Sanctification of his Holy Spirit, fitted, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared him for his <hi>Work</hi> and <hi>Service,</hi> whereunto he was called. And although he did not often appear as a <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter;</hi> Yet, in thoſe Meetings ſet a-part for the Affairs of <hi>Truth;</hi> he often appeared in great <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an extraordinary Talent given of the Lord for that <hi>Work,</hi> more than many other Brethren: And faithful he was in waiting for Inſtruction from God, to improve the ſame to <hi>his Glory,</hi> and the <hi>Churches Advantage;</hi> for nothing was more deſirable to him, than to be imployed in the <hi>Lord's Service:</hi> So it pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Almighty</hi> to furniſh him with <hi>Underſtanding</hi> and <hi>Strength,</hi> faithfully to do his Days work. And now he hath taken him to himſelf, where his Soul is at Reſt; and although our Loſs be his Gain, therein I with many more are greatly comforted, for I can truly ſay, I loved him, in the Truth, from the Firſt of my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with him, and ſo it remained to the End of his Courſe, being near Fourty Years, ſince we knew each other: And when ever we converſed together, our Diſcourſe was chiefly, concerning <hi>Heavenly Things,</hi> and the Affairs of the <hi>Church,</hi> and I always thought my Time well ſpent with him; although opportunity would not ſerve for ſo much of it as I deſired, had it been the Will of God.</p>

                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:0726600200:24"/>
And this I can ſay, according to my Obſervation, He was a Man <hi>True</hi> to his <hi>Friend,</hi> and deliberate in the Choice of his <hi>Acquaintance,</hi> to whom he ſhewed real Love, and ſincerity of Heart. And he was one of a ſteady and ſound <hi>Judgment,</hi> as to the things of God; often deſiring, that thoſe who came amongſt us, eſpecially Children of Believing Parents, might not ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle down only in a <hi>Form</hi> of <hi>Godlineſs,</hi> without the <hi>Power</hi> (at which Door, the <hi>Apoſtacy</hi> entred) but that they might be raiſed up to walk in that, wherein the <hi>Saints</hi> Fellowſhip doth ſtand, which is the <hi>Light of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> enlightening <hi>every Man that cometh into the World:</hi> And then the Ancient <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of Truth</hi> will be more and more raiſed up in their Hearts, and they being Preſerved of the Lord in it, it will more be maintained in its ſeveral Branches, as in former Days. Bleſſed be the Name of the <hi>Lord,</hi> who hath a People in theſe latter Ages of the World, to whom he hath given <hi>Power</hi> to ſtand for his <hi>Truth, whilſt on Earth,</hi> and to be <hi>Tender</hi> of the <hi>Honour of his Name;</hi> of the Number of whom, this our <hi>Deceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Friend</hi> and <hi>Brother</hi> was; who, although <hi>Dead,</hi> yet his Memory <hi>Liveth,</hi> and will be preſerved amongſt the <hi>Righteous,</hi> in <hi>Generations yet to come.</hi>

            <p>Had I been continued at this School, and in due time preferred to an higher; I might in likelihood have been a Scholar: for I was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to have a Genius apt to learn.

For he thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on took me from School, to ſave the Charge of Maintaining me there: which was ſomewhat like plucking green Fruit from the Tree, and laying it by, before it was come to its due Ripe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0726600200:36"/>
which will thenceforth ſhrink and wi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther, and loſe that little Juice and Reliſh which it began to have.</p>
            <p>Even ſo it fared with me. For being taken home when I was but young, and before I was well ſettled in my Studies, (though I had made a good Progreſs in the <hi>Latin</hi> Tongue, and was entred in the <hi>Greek</hi>) being left too much to my ſelf, to ply, or play with my Books, or without them, as I pleaſed: I ſoon ſhook Hands with my Books by ſhaking my Books out of my Hands, and laying them, by degrees, quite a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide; and addicted my ſelf to ſuch youthfu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> Sports and Pleaſures as the Place afforded, and my Condition could reach unto.</p>
            <p>By this Means, in a little time, I began to loſe that little Learning I had acquired at School; and by a continued diſuſe of my Books, became at length ſo utterly a Stranger to Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that I could not have read, far leſs have underſtood a Sentence in <hi>Latin.</hi> Which I was ſo ſenſible of, that I warily avoided reading to others, even in an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Book, leſt, if I ſhould meet with a <hi>Latin</hi> Word, I ſhould ſhame my ſelf, by miſpronouncing it.</p>
            <p>Thus I went on, taking my Swing in ſuch vain Courſes, as were accounted harmleſs Recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations; entertaining my Companions, and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Acquaintance, with pleaſant Diſcourſes in our Converſations, by the meer Force of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-Wit and Natural Parts, without the Help of School-Cultivation: and was accounted good Company too.</p>

I knew not what I ayled, but I knew I ayled ſomething more than ordinary: and my Heart was very heavy.</p>
            <p>I found it was not ſo with my Father and Siſter: for as I rode after the Coach, I could hear them talk pleaſantly one to the other, but they could not diſcern how it was with me, becauſe I, riding on Horsback, kept much out of Sight.</p>
            <p>By that time we got home it was Night. And the next Day, being the firſt Day of the Week, I went in the Afternoon to hear the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of <hi>Chinner;</hi> and this was the laſt time I ever went to hear any of that Function. After the Sermon, I went with him to his Houſe, and in a Freedom of Diſcourſe (which, from a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Intimacy that was between us, I common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uſed with him) told him where I had been, what Company I had met with there, and what Obſervations I had made to my ſelf thereupon. He ſeemed to underſtand as little of them, as I had done before: and civilly ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained from caſting any unhandſome Reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on them.</p>
            <p>I had a Deſire to go to another Meeting of the <hi>Quakers;</hi> and bid my Father's Man enquire, if there was any in the Country thereabouts. He thereupon told me, he had heard at <hi>Iſaac</hi>

               <hi>Penington</hi>'s, that there was to be a Meeting at <hi>High-Wiccomb</hi> on <hi>Thurſday</hi> next.</p>
            <p>Thither therefore I went, though it was Seven Miles from me. And that I might be rather thought to go out a Courſing, than to a Meeting; I let my Gray-Hound run by my Horſe-ſide.</p>
            <p>When I came there, and had ſet up my Horſe at an Inn; I was at a Loſs how to find the Houſe where the Meeting was to be. I knew it not: and was aſhamed to ask after it. Wherefore having order'd the Horſtler to take Care of my Dog, I went into the Street, and ſtood at the Inn-Gate; muſing with my ſelf what Courſe to take. But I had not ſtood long, e're I ſaw an Horſe-man riding along the Street; whom I remember'd I had ſeen before at <hi>Iſaac Penington</hi>'s: and he put up his Horſe at the ſame Inn. Him therefore I reſolved to follow, ſuppoſing he was going to the Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as indeed he was.</p>
            <p>Being come to the Houſe (which proved to be <hi>John Raunce</hi>'s) I ſaw the People ſitting to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, in an outer Room: wherefore I ſtept in, and ſate down on the firſt void Seat, the End of a Bench juſt within the Door; having my Sword by my Side, and Black Cloaths on, which drew ſome Eyes upon me. It was not long e're one ſtood up and ſpake, whom I was afterwards well acquainted with (his Name was <hi>Samuel Thornton;</hi>) and what he ſpake was very ſuitable, and of good Service to me: for

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">date </seg>1659</label> it reached Home, as if it had been directed to me.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as ever the Meeting was ended, and the People began to riſe, I, being next the Door, ſtep't out quickly; and haſtning to my Inn, took Horſe immediately homewards: and (ſo far as I remember) my having been gone was not taken Notice of by my Father.</p>
            <p>This latter Meeting was like the Clinching of a Nail; confirming, and faſtening in my Mind, thoſe good Principles, which had ſunk into me at the former. My Underſtanding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to open, and I felt ſome Stirrings in my Breaſt, tending to the Work of a New Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in me. The general Trouble, and Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Mind, which had for ſome Days lain heavy upon me, and preſſed me down, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a diſtinct Diſcovery of the particular Cauſe for which it came, began now to wear off; and ſome Glimmerings of Light began to break forth in me; which let me ſee my Inward State, and Condition towards God. The Light (which before had ſhone in my Darkneſs, and the Darkneſs could not comprehend it) began now to ſhine out of Darkneſs, and in ſome Meaſure diſcovered to me what it was, that had before clouded me, and brought that Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Trouble upon me. And now I ſaw, that although I had been, in a great degree, preſerved from the common Immoralities, and groſs Pollutions of the World; yet the Spirit of the World had hitherto ruled in me, and led me into Pride, Flattery, Vanity and Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluity;

I found there were many Plants growing in me, which were not of the <hi>Heavenly Father's Planting:</hi> and that all theſe (of whatever ſort or kind they were, or how ſpecious ſoever they might appear) muſt be plucked up.</p>
            <p>Now was all my former Life ripped up, and my Sins, by Degrees, were ſet in order before me. And though they looked not with ſo black a Hue, and ſo deep a Dye, as thoſe of the lewdeſt Sort of People did: Yet I found that all Sin (even that which had the faireſt or fineſt ſhew, as well as that which was more courſe and foul) brought Guilt, and <hi>with</hi> and <hi>for Guilt,</hi> Condemnation on the Soul that ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. This I felt: and was greatly bowed down under the Senſe thereof.</p>
            <p>Now alſo did I receive a New Law, (an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Law</hi> ſuperadded to the <hi>Outward</hi>) <hi>The Law of the Spirit of Life in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> which wrought in me againſt all Evil, not only <hi>in Deed,</hi> and <hi>in Word,</hi> but even <hi>in Thought</hi> alſo: ſo that every thing was brought to Judgment, and Judgment paſſed upon all. So that I could not any longer go on, in my former Ways, and Courſe of Life: for when I did, Judgment took hold upon me for it.</p>
            <p>Thus the Lord was graciouſly pleaſed to deal with me, in ſomewhat like manner as he had dealt with his People <hi>Iſrael</hi> of Old (when they had tranſgreſſed his Righteous LAW) whom, by his Prophet, he called back, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired <hi>to put away the Evil of their Doings:</hi>

            <p>I was now required, by this <hi>Inward</hi> and <hi>Spiritual LAW (The Law of the Spirit of Life in Chriſt Jeſus)</hi> to <hi>put away the Evil of my Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings;</hi> and <hi>to Ceaſe to do Evil.</hi> And what, in Particulars, the <hi>Evil</hi> was, which I was requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to <hi>to put away,</hi> and <hi>to ceaſe from:</hi> that Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the <hi>Divine</hi> LIGHT, which was now manifeſted in me, diſcovered to me: and what the Light made manifeſt to be <hi>Evil,</hi> Judgment paſſed upon.</p>
            <p>So that here began to be a Way caſt up, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me, for me to walk in: A direct and plain Way; ſo plain, <hi>that a way-faring-Man,</hi> how weak and ſimple ſoever (<hi>though a Fool,</hi> to the Wiſdom, and in the Judgment of the World) <hi>could not Err,</hi> while he continued to walk in it: the Error <hi>coming in</hi> by his <hi>going out of it.</hi> And this Way, with reſpect to me, I ſaw was that Meaſure of <hi>Divine Light,</hi> which was manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in me; by which the <hi>Evil of my Doings,</hi> which I was to put away, and to ceaſe from, was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered to me.</p>

            <p>But the Lord looked on me with a tender Eye; and ſeeing my Heart was right to him, and that what I had done was meerly through Weakneſs, and Fear of Falling, and that I was ſenſible of my Failing therein, and ſorry for it: he was graciouſly pleaſed to paſs it by, and ſpeak Peace to me again. So that, before I got home, as when I went in the Morning, my Heart was full of Breathing Prayer to the Lord, that he would vouchſafe to be with me, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold and carry me through that Days Exerciſe: So now at my Return in the Evening, my Heart was full of thankful Acknowledgments, and Praiſes unto Him, for his great Goodneſs and Favour to me, in having thus far preſerved, and kept me from falling into any thing that might have brought Diſhonour to his Holy Name, which I had now taken on me.</p>
            <p>But notwithſtanding that it was thus with me, and that I found Peace and Acceptance with the Lord in ſome good degree, according to my Obedience to the Convictions I had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, by his <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> in me: yet was not the Vail ſo done away, or fully rent, but that there ſtill remained a Cloud upon my Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, with reſpect to my Carriage towards my Father.

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">date </seg>1659</label> had brought into my Mind, That <hi>I ought to put ſuch a Difference between him all others, as that, on the Account of Paternal Relation, I ſhould ſtill deport my ſelf towards him, both in Geſture and Language, as I had always heretofore done;</hi> did yet prevail with me. So that when I came home, I went to my Father bare headed, as I uſed to do; and gave him a particular Account of the Buſineſs he had given me in Command, in ſuch manner, that he, obſerving no altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in my Carriage towards him, found no Cauſe to take Offence at me.</p>
            <p>I had felt for ſometime before, an earneſt Deſire of Mind to go again to <hi>Iſaac Penington</hi>'s. And I began to queſtion whether, when my Father ſhould come (as I concluded e're long he would) to underſtand I enclined to ſettle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> he would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit me the Command of his Horſes, as before. Wherefore, in the Morning when I went to <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> I gave Direction to a Servant of his, to go that Day to a Gentleman of my Acquaintance (who I knew had a Riding Nag to put off, either by Sale, or to be kept for his Work;) and deſire him, in my Name, to ſend him to me; which he did, and I found him in the Stable, when I came home.</p>
            <p>On this Nag I deſigned to ride next Day to <hi>Iſaac Penington</hi>'s: and in order thereunto, aroſe betimes and got my ſelf ready for the Journey. But becauſe I would pay all due Reſpects to my Father, and not go without his Conſent, or Knowledge at the leaſt, I ſent one up to him

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">date </seg>1659</label> (for he was not yet ſtirring) to acquaint him, that I had a Purpoſe to go to <hi>Iſaac Peuington</hi>'s; and deſired to know if he pleaſed to Command me any Service to them. He ſent me Word, He <hi>would ſpeak with me before I went; and would have me come up to him:</hi> which I did; and ſtood by his Bed-Side.</p>
            <p>Then in a mild and gentle Tone, he ſaid, <hi>I underſtand you have a Mind to go to Mr.</hi> Pening<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton<hi>'s.</hi> I anſwered, I have ſo. <hi>Why,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>I wonder why you ſhould. You were there, you know, but a few Days ago; and unleſs you had Buſineſs with them, don't you think it will look odly?</hi> I ſaid, I I thought not. <hi>I doubt,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>You'll tire them with your Company, and make them think they ſhall be troubled with you.</hi> If, replyed I, I find any thing of that, I'll make the ſhorter Stay. <hi>But,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>can you propoſe any ſort of Buſineſs with them, more than a meer Viſit?</hi> Yes, ſaid I, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to my ſelf not only to ſee them; but to have ſome Diſcourſe with them. <hi>Why,</hi> ſaid he (in a Tone a little Harſher) <hi>I hope you don't en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline to be of their Way.</hi> Truly, anſwered I, I like them, and their Way, very well; ſo far as I yet underſtand it: and I am willing to Go to them, that I may underſtand it better.</p>
            <p>Thereupon he began to reckon up a Bead-Roll of Faults againſt the <hi>Quakers;</hi> Telling me <hi>They were a rude unmannerly People, that would not give Civil Reſpect or Honour to their Superiors; no not to Magiſtrates: That they held many dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Principles: That they were an immodeſt, ſhameleſs People; and that one of them ſtrip't him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf</hi>

            </p>
            <p>To all the other Charges, I anſwered only, That perhaps they might be either miſreport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or miſunderſtood, as the beſt of People had ſometimes been. But to the laſt Charge, of <hi>Going Naked,</hi> a particular Anſwer, by way of Inſtance, was juſt then brought into my Mind, and put into my Mouth, which I had not thought of before: and that was the Example of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> who went <hi>Naked,</hi> among the People, for a long time, (<hi>Iſai.</hi> 20. 4.) <hi>Aye,</hi> ſaid my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>but you muſt conſider, that He was a Prophet of the Lord, and had an expreſs Command from God to Go ſo.</hi> Yes, Sir, replied I, I do conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that: but I conſider alſo, that the <hi>Jews</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong whom he lived, did not own him for a Prophet, nor believe that he had ſuch a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand from God. And, added I, how know we but that this <hi>Quaker</hi> may be a Prophet too, and might be commanded to do as he did, for ſome Reaſon which we underſtand not.</p>
            <p>This put my Father to a ſtand; ſo that let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting fall his Charges againſt the <hi>Quakers,</hi> he only ſaid, <hi>I would wiſh you not to go ſo ſoon; but take a little time to conſider of it: you may Viſit Mr.</hi> Penington <hi>hereafter.</hi> Nay, Sir, replied I, Pray don't hinder my going now: for I have ſo ſtrong a Deſire to go, that I do not well know how to forbear. And as I ſpake thoſe Words, I withdrew gently to the Chamber-Door; and then haſtning down Stairs, went immediately

            <p>This Diſcourſe with my Father had caſt me ſomewhat back in my Journey, and it being Fifteen long Miles thither, the Ways bad, and my Nag but ſmall: it was in the Afternoon that I got thither. And underſtanding by the Servant that took my Horſe, that there was then a Meeting in the Houſe (as there was Weekly on that Day, which was the <hi>Fourth Day</hi> of the Week, though I, till then, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood it not) I haſtened in; and knowing the Rooms, went directly to the <hi>Little Parlour,</hi> where I found a few Friends ſitting together in Silence: and I ſate down among them, well ſatisfied, though without Words.</p>
            <p>When the Meeting was ended, and thoſe of the Company, who were Strangers, withdrawn, I addreſſed my ſelf to <hi>Iſaac Penington</hi> and his Wife, who received me courteouſly: but not knowing what Exerciſe I had been in, and yet was under, nor having heard any thing of me, ſince I had been there before, in another Garb, were not forward at firſt to lay ſuddain Hands on me; which I obſerved, and did not diſlike.

But when he had them, and conſidered from what diſtant Parts of the Nation we came; he was amazed. For <hi>G.

            <p>Hereupon he told us, <hi>That our Caſe look't Ill, and he was ſorry for it: for how</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>can it be imagined that ſo many could jump altogether at one Time and Place, from ſuch remote Quarters and Parts of the Kingdom; if it was not by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination and Appointment.</hi>

That our Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings were publick, our Doors ſtanding open to all Comers, of all Ages, Sexes and Perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; Men, Women and Children, and thoſe that were not of our Religion, as well as thoſe that were: and that it was next to Madneſs, for People to Plot in ſuch Meetings.</p>
            <p>He told us, <hi>We muſt find Sureties for our good Behaviour, and to Anſwer our Contempt of the King's Proclamation, at the next General Quarter-Seſſions: or elſe he muſt Commit us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We told him, that knowing our Innocency, and that we had not miſ-behaved our ſelves, nor did meet in Contempt of the King's Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; but purely in obedience to the LORD's Requirings, to Worſhip Him, which we held our ſelves in Duty bound to do; we could not conſent to be bound, for that would imply Guilt, which we were free from.</p>

            <p>I knew not what he meant by this: but I cryed in Spirit to the Lord, that He would be pleaſed to be a Mouth and Wiſdom to me, and keep me from being Entangled in any Snare.</p>
            <p>He asked me many Queſtions, concerning my Birth, my Education, my Acquaintance in <hi>Oxfordſhire;</hi> particularly what Men of Note I knew there. To all which I gave him brief, but plain and true Anſwers; naming ſeveral Families, of the beſt Rank, in that Part of the Country where I dwelt.</p>
            <p>He asked me, How long I had been of this Way, and how I came to be of it: Which when I had given him ſome Account of; he began to perſwade me to leave it, and return to the right Way (the <hi>Church,</hi> as he called it.) I deſired him to ſpare his Pains in that reſpect, and forbear any Diſcourſe of that kind: for that I was fully ſatisfied, the Way I was in was the right Way; and hoped the Lord would ſo preſerve me in it, that nothing ſhould be able to draw, or drive me out of it. He ſeemed not pleaſed with that; and thereupon went out to the reſt of the Company; and I follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him; glad in my Heart, that I had eſcaped ſo well, and Praiſing God for my Deliverance.</p>

            <p>We told him, we did intend, if he did not otherwiſe diſpoſe of us, to ſpend that Night with our Friend <hi>Iſaac Penington;</hi> and would (if the LORD gave us leave) be there in the Morning, ready to Anſwer his Requirings. Whereupon he diſmiſt us all, willing (as we thought) to be rid of us: for he ſeemed not to be of an ill Temper, nor deſirous to put us to Trouble, if he could help it.</p>
            <p>Back then we went to <hi>Iſaac Penington</hi>'s.

            <p>The Sight of this ſmote him; and made him ſit down among them. And after the Meeting was ended, and the <hi>Friends</hi> departed to their ſeveral Homes; addreſſing himſelf to

               <hi>Mary Penington</hi> (as the Miſtreſs of the Houſe) he could not enough magnifie the Bravery and Courage of the Friends: nor ſufficiently debaſe himſelf. He told her how long he had been a Profeſſor, what Pains he had taken, what Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards he had run, in his Youthful Days, to get to Meetings; how, when the Ways were forelaid, and Paſſages ſtop't, he Swam through Rivers to reach a Meeting: <hi>And now,</hi> ſai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>Thus he bewailed himſelf to her.

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">date </seg>1662</label> I believe did ſo. For there were many Sick; and ſome very weak: though we were not long there, yet in that time one of our Fellow Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, who lay in one of thoſe Pallet-Beds, died.</p>
            <p>This cauſed ſome Buſtle in the Houſe. For the Body of the Deceaſed, being laid out, and put into a Coffin, was carried down, and ſet in the Room called the <hi>Lodge;</hi> that the <hi>Coroner</hi> might enquire into the Cauſe and Manner of his Death. And the manner of their doing it, is thus. As ſoon as the <hi>Coroner</hi> is come, the <hi>Turnkeys</hi> run out into the Street under the Gate; and ſeize upon every Man that paſſes by, till they have got enough to make up the <hi>Coroner's Inqueſt.</hi> And ſo reſolute theſe rude Fellows are, that if any Man reſiſt, or diſpute it with them; they drag him in by main Force, not regarding what Condition he is of. Nay, I have been told, the will not ſtick to ſtop a Coach, and pluck the Men out of it.</p>
            <p>It ſo happened, that at this time they lighted on an Ancient Man, a grave Citizen, who was trudging through the Gate in great Haſte; and him they laid hold on, telling him <hi>He muſt come in, and ſerve upon the Coroner's Inqueſt.</hi> He pleaded hard, beg'd and beſought them to let him go; aſſuring them <hi>He was going on very urgent Buſineſs, and that the ſtopping him would be greatly to his Prejudice.</hi> But they were deaf to all Intreaties; and hurried him in, the poor Man Chaffing without Remedy.</p>
            <p>When they had got their Complement, and were ſhut in together, the reſt of them ſaid to

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">date </seg>1662</label> this Ancient Man, <hi>Come Father, you are the oldeſt Man among us: You ſhall be our Foreman.</hi> And when the <hi>Coroner</hi> had Sworn them on the Jury, the Coffin was uncovered, that they might ;ook upon the Body. But the Old Man, diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his Mind at the Interruption they had given him; was grown ſomewhat fretful upon it: ſaid to them, <hi>To what purpoſe do you ſhew us a dead Body here! You would not have us think, ſure, that this Man died in this Room? How then ſhall we be able to judge how this Man came by his Death, unleſs we ſee the Place wherein he died, and wherein he hath been kept Priſoner before he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? How know we, but that the Incommodiouſneſs of the Place wherein he was kept, may have occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Death? Therefore ſhew us</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>the place wherein this Man died.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This much diſpleaſed the Keepers; and they began to banter the Old Man, thinking to have beaten him off it. But he ſtood up titely to them: <hi>Come, come,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>Though you have made a Fool of me, in bringing me in hither; ye ſhall not find a Child of me, now I am here. Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take not your ſelves: I underſtand my Place, and your Duty; and I require you to Conduct me, and my Brethren, to the Place where this Man died: Refuſe it at your Peril.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They now wiſhed they had let the Old Man go about his Buſineſs, rather than by troubling him, have brought this Trouble on themſelves. But when they ſaw he perſiſted in his Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and was peremptory, the <hi>Coroner</hi> told them, <hi>They muſt go ſhew him the Place.</hi>

When on a ſuddain we heard a great Noiſe of Tongues, and of Tramplings of Feet, coming up towards us. And by and by One of the <hi>Turnkeys,</hi> opening our Door, ſaid, <hi>Hold, hold, Don't undreſs your ſelves, here's the Coroner's Inqueſt coming to ſee you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As ſoon as they were come to the Door (for within the Door there was ſcarce room for them to come) the Foreman, who led them, lifting up his Hand, ſaid, <hi>Lord bleſs me, what a Sight is here! I did not think there had been ſo much Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the Hearts of</hi> Engliſhmen, <hi>to uſe</hi> Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men <hi>in this manner!

            <p>Whether he did ſo, or no; I cannot tell; but I am apt to think that he applied himſelf to the Mayor, or the Sheriffs of <hi>London.</hi> For the next Day, one of the Sheriffs (called Sir <hi>William Turner,</hi> a <hi>Wollen-Draper</hi> in <hi>Paul's-Yard</hi>) came to the Preſs-Yard; and having ordered the Porter of <hi>Bridewell</hi> to attend him there; ſent up a

            <p>Being come before him, in the Preſs-Yard, he looked kindly on us, and ſpake courteouſly to us. <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>I underſtand the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is very full; and I am ſorry for it. I wiſh it were in my Power to releaſe you, and the reſt of your Friends that are in it. But ſince I cannot do that, I am willing to do what I can for you. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I am come hither to enquire how it is; and I would have all you, who came from</hi> Bridewell, <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn thither again; which will be a better Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation to you: and your Removal will give the more room to thoſe that are left behind; and here is the Porter of</hi> Bridewell, <hi>your Old Keeper, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend you thither.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We duly acknowledged the Favour of the Sheriff, to us and our Friends above, in this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval of us; which would give them more Room, and us a better Air. But before we parted from him, I ſpake particularly to him, on another Occaſion: which was this.</p>
            <p>When we came into <hi>Newgate,</hi> we found a ſhabby Fellow there, among the <hi>Friends;</hi> who (upon Inquiry) we underſtood had thruſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf among our Friends, when they were taken at a Meeting, on purpoſe to be ſent to Priſon with them; in hopes to be maintained by them.

               </gap> he would be ſure to take enough.</p>
            <p>Thus lived this lazy Drone upon the Labours of the Induſtrious Bees; to his high Content, and their no ſmall Trouble: to whom his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany was as Offenſive, as his Ravening was Oppreſſive: nor could they get any Relief, by their complaining of him to the Keepers.</p>
            <p>This Fellow, hearing the Notice which was given, for the <hi>Bridewell</hi>-Men to go down, in order to be removed to <hi>Bridewell</hi> again; and hoping (no Doubt) that freſh Quarters would produce freſh Commons, and that he ſhould fare better with us, than where he was: thruſt himſelf amongſt us; and went down into the Preſs Yard with us. Which I knew not of, till I ſaw him ſtanding there, with his Hat on; and looking as demurely as he could, that the Sheriff might take him for a <hi>Quaker:</hi> at Sight of which, my Spirit was much ſtirred.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, as ſoon as the Sheriff had done ſpeaking to us, and we had made our Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of his Kindneſs; I ſtept a little nearer to him, and pointing to that Fellow, ſaid, That Man is not only none of our Company, for he is no <hi>Quaker:</hi> but is an idle diſſolute Fellow, who hath thruſt himſelf in among our Friends, to be ſent to Priſon with them, that he might

            <p>At this the Sheriff ſmiled; and calling the Fellow forth, ſaid to him, <hi>How came you to be in Priſon?</hi> I was taken at a Meeting, ſaid he, <hi>But what Buſineſs had you there?</hi> ſaid the Sheriff.

            </p>
            <p>Hitherto this Fellow had ſtood with his Hat on, as willing to have paſſed (if he could) for a <hi>Quaker;</hi> but as ſoon as he heard this Doom paſſed on him, off went his Hat: and to bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſcraping he fell, with <hi>Good your Worſhip have pity upon me, and ſet me at Liberty.

            <p>The common Side of <hi>Newgate</hi> is generally accounted, as it really is, the Worſt part of that Priſon; not ſo much from the Place, as the People: it being uſually ſtocked with the veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Rogues, and meaneſt ſort of Felons, and Pick-Pockets; who not being able to pay Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber-Rent on the Maſter's Side, are thruſt in there. And if they come in Bad, to be ſure they do not go out better: for here they have an Opportunity to inſtruct one another in their Art; and impart each to other what Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments they have made therein.</p>
            <p>The Common Hall (which is the firſt Room over the Gate) is a good Place to walk in, when the Priſoners are out of it (ſaving the danger of catching ſome Cattle, which they may have left in it:) and there I uſed to walk in a Morning, before they were let up; and ſometimes in the Day time, when they have been there.</p>
            <p>They all carried themſelves reſpectfully to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards me; which I imputed chiefly to this, That when any of our Women-Friends came there to Viſit the Priſoners, if they had not Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of their own there, to take care of them: I, (as being a young Man, and more at leiſure than moſt others, for I could not play the <hi>Taylor</hi> there) was forward to go down with them to

Yet this, I think, made them a little the more obſervant to me; for they would diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe themſelves to one ſide of the Room, that they might make way for me to walk on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And when I walked there, I had uſually a Book in my Hand; on which I had mine Eye: which made them think I did not heed what they ſaid. By this Means, mine Ear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing attentive to them, I heard them relate one to another many of their Roguiſh Pranks.</p>
            <p>One Day, as I was thus walking to and fro beſide them, I heard them recounting one to another what feats they had done at <hi>Pocket-picking</hi> and <hi>Shop-lifting.</hi> Whereupon, turning ſhort upon them, I asked them, Which of you all will undertake to pick my Pocket? They were not very forward to Anſwer; but viewed me round. I wore a long Gown, which was lap't over before, and tied about the Middle; and had no Pocket-Holes in it. When they had a while conſidered it, and I (having taken another Turn) was come up again to them, One of them ſaid, <hi>Why, Maſter, If you will Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe not to Proſecute us, we will ſhow you a Piece</hi>

               </gap> I eſpied his Maſter croſſing the Court. Where<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore ſtepping to him, I asked him, If he was willing to let me go out for a little while, to ſee ſome Friends of mine that Evening. <hi>Yes,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>very willing;</hi> and thereupon away walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed I to <hi>Newgate;</hi> where having ſpent the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing among <hi>Friends,</hi> I returned in good time.</p>
            <p>Under this eaſie Reſtraint we lay, till the Court ſate at the <hi>Old-Baily</hi> again: And then, whether it was that the Heat of the Storm was ſomewhat abated, or by what other means Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence wrought it, I know not; we were called to the Bar, and without further Queſtion, diſcharged.</p>
            <p>Whereupon we returned to <hi>Bridewell</hi> again, and having raiſed ſome Monies among us, and therewith gratified both the Maſter and his Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, for their Kindneſs to us; we ſpent ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time in a ſolemn Meeting, to return our thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Acknowledgement to the LORD, both for His Preſervation of us in Priſon, and Deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of us out of it: and then taking a ſolemn Farewel of each other, we departed with Bag and Baggage. And I took care to return my Hammack to the Owner; with due Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of his great Kindneſs, in lending it me.</p>
            <p>Being now at Liberty, I viſited more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally my Friends that were ſtill in Priſon; and more particularly my Friend and Benefactor, <hi>William Penington,</hi> at his Houſe: and then went to wait upon my Maſter <hi>Milton.</hi> With whom

            <p>Thither therefore I betook my ſelf, and the Weather being Froſty, and the Ways, by that means, clean and good; I walked it thorow in a Day: and was received by my Friends there, with ſuch Demonſtration of hearty Kindneſs, as made my Journey very eaſie to me.</p>
            <p>I had ſpent in my Impriſonment that Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Shillings, which I had received of <hi>William Penington;</hi> and Twenty of the Fourty, which had been ſent me from <hi>Mary Penington,</hi> and had the Remainder then about me. That therefore I now returned to her, with due Acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of her Husband's and her great Care of me, and Liberality to me, in the time of my Need. She would have had me kept it. But I beg'd her to accept it from me again; ſince it was the Redundancy of their Kindneſs, and the other Part had anſwered the Occaſion, for which it was ſent: and my Importunity pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed.</p>
            <p>I intended only a Viſit hither, not a Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance: and therefore purpoſed, after I had ſtaid a few Days, to return to my Lodging, and former Courſe in <hi>London:</hi> but Providence ordered it otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iſaac Penington</hi> had at that time two Sons and one Daughter (all then very young) of whom the Eldeſt Son <hi>(John Penington)</hi> and the

And being himſelf both Skilful and Curious in <hi>Pronouncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> he was very deſirous to have them well grounded in the <hi>Rudiments of the Engliſh Tongue:</hi> to which End he had ſent for a Man out of <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſhire</hi> (whom, upon enquiry, he had heard of) who was undoubtedly the moſt accurate <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Teacher,</hi> that ever I met with, or have heard of. His Name was <hi>Richard Bradley.</hi> But as he pretended no higher than the <hi>Engliſh Tongue;</hi> and had led them, by <hi>Grammar Rules,</hi> to the higheſt Improvement they were capable of in that: he had then taken his Leave of them, and was gone up to <hi>London,</hi> to Teach an <hi>Engliſh School</hi> of <hi>Friends</hi> Children there.</p>
            <p>This put my Friend to a freſh Straight. He had ſought for a New Teacher, to inſtruct his Children in the <hi>Latin Tongue,</hi> as the Old had done in the <hi>Engliſh:</hi> but had not yet found one. Wherefore one Evening as we ſate together by the Fire in his Bed-Chamber (which, for want of Health, he kept) He asked me (his Wife being by) <hi>If I would be ſo kind to him, as to ſtay a while with him, till he could hear of ſuch a Man as he aimed at; and in the mean time enter his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in the Rudiments of the</hi> Latin Tongue.</p>
            <p>This Queſtion was not more unexpected, than ſurprizing to me; and the more, becauſe it ſeemed directly to thwart my former Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and Undertaking, of endeavouring to improve my ſelf by following my Studies with my Maſter <hi>Milton:</hi> which this would give at

            <p>But the Senſe I had of the manifold Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions I lay under to theſe worthy Friends of mine, ſhut out all Reaſonings; and diſpoſed my Mind to an abſolute Reſignation to their Deſire; that I might teſtifie my Gratitude, by a Willingneſs to do them any friendly Service, that I could be capable of.</p>
            <p>And though I queſtioned my Ability to carry on that Work, to its due Height and Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; yet as that was not propoſed, but an Initiation only, by <hi>Accidence</hi> into <hi>Grammar:</hi> I conſented to the Propoſal, as a preſent Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient (till a more qualified Perſon ſhould be found;) without further Treaty, or mention of Terms between us, than that of mutual Friendſhip. And to render this Digreſſion from my own Studies the leſs uneaſie to my Mind, I recollected (and often thought of) that Rule in <hi>Lilly,</hi>

            <p>The particular Obligation I had to him as the immediate Inſtrument of my Convince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and high Affection for him, reſulting therefrom, did ſo deeply affect my Mind; that it was ſome pretty time, before my Paſſion could prevail, to expreſs it ſelf in Words: ſo true I found that of the <hi>Tragoedian,</hi>

            <p>Not only <hi>George,</hi> and <hi>Alexander Parker</hi> (who was with him) but divers of the Ancient Friends of that Country, endeavoured to quiet that troubleſom Man, and make him ſenſible of his Error: but his unruly Spirit would ſtill be Oppoſing what was ſaid unto him, and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying himſelf in that Practice.

            <p>This coming unexpectedly from me, a young Man, a Stranger, and one who had not inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medled with the Buſineſs of the Meeting, had that Effect upon the Caviller, that if it did not ſatisfie him, it did at leaſt ſilence him, and made him for the Preſent ſink down and be ſtill, without giving any further Diſturbance to the Meeting.

            <p>I had always entertained ſo high a Regard for Marriage, as it was a Divine Inſtitution, that I held it not lawful to make it a ſort of political Trade to riſe in the World by.

            <p>I made, at that time, but a ſhort Viſit.

            <p>A Copy of the foregoing Lines, incloſed in a Letter of <hi>Condoleance,</hi> I ſent by the firſt Poſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Buckinghamſhire,</hi> to my dear Friends the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted Parents: And upon my Return home, going to viſit them, we ſate down and ſolemnly mixed our Sorrows and Tears together.</p>
            <p>About this time (as I remember) it was, that ſome Bickerings happening between ſome <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts,</hi> and ſome of the People called <hi>Quakers</hi> in or about <hi>High-Wiccomb</hi> in <hi>Buckinghamſhire;</hi> oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by ſome reflecting Words a <hi>Baptist</hi>-Preacher had publickly uttered in one of their Meetings there, againſt the <hi>Quakers</hi> in general, and <hi>W. Penn</hi> in particular: it came, at length, to this Iſſue, that a Meeting for a publick Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute was appointed, to be holden at <hi>Weſt-Wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comb,</hi> between <hi>Jeremy Ives</hi> (who eſpouſed his Brother's Cauſe) and <hi>W. Penn.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this Meeting, it being ſo near me, I went; rather to Countenance the Cauſe, than for any Delight I took in ſuch Work: for indeed, I have rarely found the Advantage, equivolent to the

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">date </seg>1670</label> Trouble and Danger, ariſing from thoſe Conteſts. For which Cauſe I would not chuſe them, as, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing juſtly engaged, I would not refuſe them.</p>
            <p>The Iſſue of this proved better than I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected. For <hi>Ives</hi> having undertaken an Ill Cauſe, to argue againſt the <hi>Divine Light,</hi> and <hi>Univerſal Grace, conferr'd by God on all Men;</hi> when he had ſpent his Stock of Arguments, which he brought with him on that Subject: finding his Work go on heavily, and the Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory not well ſatisfied; ſtept down from his Seat, and departed, with purpoſe to have bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up the Aſſembly. But, except ſome few of his Party, who followed him, the People ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally ſtay'd, and were the more attentive to what was afterwards delivered amongſt them. Which <hi>Ives</hi> underſtanding came in again, and in an angry railing Manner, expreſſing his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like that we went not all away when he did, gave more Diſguſt to the People.</p>
            <p>After the Meeting was ended, I ſent to my Friend <hi>I. P.</hi> (by his Son and Servant, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned Home, though it was late, that Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) a ſhort Account of the Buſineſs in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing <hi>Diſtich.</hi>

The Clouds had been long gathering, and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned a Tempeſt. The Parliament had ſate ſome time before, and hatched that unaccountable Law, which was called <hi>The Conventicle Act:</hi> (If that may be allowed to be called a Law, by whomſoever made) which was ſo directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Fundamental Laws of <hi>England,</hi> to common Juſtice, Equity and right Reaſon; as this manifeſtly was. For</p>
            <p n="1">1<hi>ſt,</hi> It brake down and overrun the Bounds and Banks, anciently ſet for the Defence and Security of <hi>Engliſhmens</hi> Lives, Liberties and Properties, <hi>viz.

            </p>
            <p n="2">2. By that Act, the Informers (who Swear for their own Advantage, as being thereby en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled to a Third Part of the Fines) were many times concealed, driving on an underhand pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Trade: ſo that Men might be, and often were Convicted and Fined, without having any Notice or Knowledge of it, till the Officers came and took away their Goods, nor even then could they tell by whoſe Evidence they were convicted. Than which, what could be more oppoſite to common Juſtice? which requires that every Man ſhould be openly charged, and have his Accuſer Face to Face, that he might

            <p n="3">3. By that Act, the Innocent were puniſhed for the Offences of the Guilty. If the Wife or Child was convicted of having been at one of thoſe Aſſemblies, which by that Act was adjudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Unlawful; the Fine was levied on the Goods of the Husband or Father of ſuch Wife or Child: though he was neither preſent at ſuch Aſſembly, nor was of the ſame Religious Perſwaſion that they were of; but perhaps an Enemy to it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It was left in the arbitrary Pleaſure of the Juſtices to lay half the Fine for the Houſe or Ground where ſuch Aſſembly was holden, and half the Fine for a pretended unknown Preacher; and the whole Fines of ſuch and ſo many of the Meeters as they ſhould account Poor, upon any other or others of the People, who were preſent at the ſame Meeting (not exceeding a certain limitted Sum;) without any regard to Equity or Reaſon. And yet (ſuch Blindneſs doth the <hi>Spirit of Perſecution</hi> bring on Men, otherwiſe ſharp ſighted enough) that this Unlawful, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt, Unequal, Unreaſonable and Unrighteous Law took place in (almoſt) all Places, and was vigorouſly proſecuted againſt the Meetings of <hi>Diſſenters</hi> in general; though the Brunt of the Storm fell moſt ſharply on the People called <hi>Quakers:</hi> not that it ſeemed to be more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly levelled at them: but that they ſtood more fair, ſteady and open, as a But to receive all the

            <p>No ſooner had the Biſhops obtained this Law, for ſuppreſſing all other Meetings but their own, but ſome of the Clergy of moſt Ranks, and ſome others too, who were over-much bigotted to that Party, beſtirr'd themſelves with might and main, to find out and Encourage the moſt profligate Wretches to turn Informers; and to get ſuch Perſons into Parochial Offices, as would be moſt obſequious to their Commands, and ready at their Beck, to put it into the moſt ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous Execution. Yet it took not alike in all Places; but ſome were forwarder in the Work than others, according as the Agents intended to be chiefly imployed therein, had been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſed thereunto.</p>
            <p>For in ſome Parts of the Nation care had been timely taken, by ſome not of the loweſt Rank, to chuſe out ſome particular Perſons (Men of ſharp Wit, cloſe Countenances, pliant Tempers and deep Diſſimulation) and ſend them forth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Sectaries,</hi> ſo called; with Inſtructions to thruſt themſelves into all Societies, Conform to all, or any ſort of Religious Profeſſion, <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous</hi>-like change their Shapes, and transform themſelves from one Religious Appearance to another, as occaſion ſhould require.

The Entertainment he found amongſt them, deſerved a better Return than he made them. For, having ſmoothly wrought himſelf into their good Opinion, and cunningly drawn ſome of them into an unwary Openneſs, and Freedom of Converſation with him, upon the unpleaſing Subject of the Severi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of thoſe Times; he moſt villanouſly impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one of them (whoſe Name was <hi>— Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ach,</hi> a Man well reputed amongſt his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours) of having ſpoken <hi>Treaſonable Words:</hi> and thereby brought the Man in danger of loſing both his Eſtate and Life; had not a ſeaſonable Diſcovery of his abominable Practices elſewhere (imprinting Terror, the Effect of Guilt upon him) cauſed him to fly both out of the Court and Country; at that very inſtant of Time, when the honeſt Man ſtood at the Bar, ready to be arraigned upon his falſe Accuſation.</p>

            <p>Wherefore ſending for <hi>Ayrs,</hi> who had brought the Book, Juſtice <hi>Titchborn</hi> examined him if <hi>he knew me, and where I dwelt.</hi> Who telling him, He <hi>knew me well, and had been often at my Houſe:</hi> He gave him in charge to give me Notice, that <hi>I ſhould appear before him and the other Juſtice, at</hi> Rickmanſworth <hi>on ſuch a Day:</hi> Threatning that <hi>if I did not appear, he himſelf ſhould be Proſecuted for ſpreading the Book.</hi>

            <p>This put <hi>William Ayrs</hi> in a Fright. Over he came in haſte with this Meſſage to me; troubled that he ſhould be a means to bring me into Trouble.

            </p>
            <p>In the Interim I received Advice, by an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs out of <hi>Suſſex,</hi> that <hi>Guli Penn</hi> (with whom I had had an Intimate Acquaintance, and firm Friendſhip from our very Youths) was very dangerouſly Ill (her Husband being then abſent in <hi>Pennſylvania</hi>) and that ſhe had a great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to ſee and ſpeak with me.</p>
            <p>This put me to a great Straight, and brought a ſore Exerciſe on my Mind. I was divided betwixt Honour and Friendſhip. I had engag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my Word to appear before the Juſtices; which to omit, would bring Diſhonour on me and my Profeſſion. To ſtay till that time was come and paſt, might probably prove (if I

            <p>After ſome little Deliberation, I reſolv'd (as the beſt Expedient to anſwer both Ends) to go over next Morning to the Juſtices, and lay my Straight before them; and try if I cou'd procure from them a Reſpit of my Appearance before them, until I had been in <hi>Suſſex,</hi> and paid the Duty of Friendſhip to my Sick Friend. Which I had the more Hopes to obtain, becauſe I knew thoſe Juſtices had a great reſpect for <hi>Guli.</hi> For when <hi>William Penn</hi> and ſhe were firſt Married, they lived for ſome Years at <hi>Rickmanſworth;</hi> in which time they contracted a <hi>Neighbourly Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip</hi> with both theſe Juſtices and theirs; who ever after retained a kind regard for them both.</p>

He thereupon giving it into my Hand, when I had turned over the Leaves, and look'd it through, finding it to be as it came from the Preſs; I told him, I wrote the Book, and would own it, all but the Errors of the Preſs.

            <p>Having Innocency on my ſide, I was not at all daunted at either his Speech, or Looks: but feeling the Lord preſent with me, I replied, I know there are Errors of the Preſs in it, and therefore I excepted them: but I do not know there is any Error of mine in it, and therefore cannot except them. But (added I) if thou pleaſeſt to ſhew me any Error of mine in it, I ſhall readily both acknowledge and retract it. And thereupon I deſired him to give me an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, in any one Paſſage in that Book, wherein he thought I had Erred.

               <hi>But I can aſſure you,</hi> added he, <hi>the matter which will be laid to your Charge, concerning your Book, is of greater Importance, than you ſeem to think it.

            </p>
            <p>I wiſh, ſaid I, I could ſpeak with the Earl my ſelf: for I make no Doubt but to acquit my ſelf unto him: And, added I, if thou pleaſeſt to give me thy Letter to him; I will wait upon him, with it, forthwith. For although I know, continued I, that he hath no Favour for any of my Perſwaſion; yet knowing my ſelf to be whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly innocent in this matter, I can with Confidence appear before him, or even before the KING in Council.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Well,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>I ſee you are Confident; but for all that, let me tell you, how good ſoever your Intention was, you timed the publiſhing of your Book very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luckily: for you cannot be ignorant, that there is a very dangerous Plot lately diſcovered, contrived by the</hi> Diſſenters, <hi>againſt the</hi> Government, <hi>and</hi> His Majeſty's <hi>Life.</hi> (This was the <hi>Rie-Plot,</hi> then newly broke forth, and laid upon the <hi>Preſbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians:) And for you,</hi> added he, <hi>to publiſh a Book, juſt at that Juncture of time, to diſcourage the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, and other Officers, from putting in Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thoſe Laws, which were made to ſuppreſs their Meetings; looks, I muſt tell you, but with a ſcurvy Countenance upon you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If (replied I, with ſomewhat a pleaſanter Air) there was any Miſ-timing in the Caſe, it muſt

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">date </seg>1683</label> lie on the Part of thoſe Plotters, for timing the breaking forth of their Plot while my Book was a Printing: for I can bring very good Proof, that my Book was in the Preſs, and well-nigh wrought off, before any Man talked, or knew of a Plot; but thoſe who were in it.</p>
            <p>Here our Diſcourſe ended, and I, taking, for the preſent, my leave of him, went to my Horſe. and, changing my Companion, rode to Juſtice <hi>Titchborn</hi>'s, having with me <hi>William Ayrs,</hi> who was beſt acquainted with him, and who had caſually brought this Trouble on me.</p>
            <p>When he had introduced me to <hi>Titchborn,</hi> I gave him alike Account of the Occaſion of my coming at that time, as I had before given to the other Juſtice. And both he, and his Lady (who was preſent) expreſt much Concern for <hi>Guli Penn</hi>'s Ilneſs.</p>
            <p>I found this Man to be of quite another Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per than Juſtice <hi>Fotherly:</hi> for this Man was ſmooth, ſoft and oily; whereas the other was rather rough, ſevere and ſharp. Yet at the wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up, I found <hi>Fotherly</hi> my trueſt Friend.</p>
            <p>When I had told Sir <hi>B.

                     <p>Yea, Friends, this Spirit that hath led ſome now to ſet up their Separate Meetings, is the ſame that led <hi>Jeroboam</hi> the Son of <hi>Nebat</hi> to ſet up his ſeparate Altar at <hi>Bethel,</hi> of which you may read 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 12, and 13 Chapters. He was afraid, that if the People ſhould continue to go up to the Houſe of the Lord, to do Sacrifice there, as they had been accuſtomed to do, and as the Lord had required, they would then for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake him, and return to the Lord again. And this Spirit now is afraid, that if they whom he hath ſeduced, and drawn aſide, ſhould ſtill fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent the Aſſemblies of God's People, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to meet with Friends as before; that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Power which is eminently manifeſt in the Meetings of God's People, might at one time or other reach unto them, touch their Hearts, open the right Eye in them, and give them to ſee the Miſchief and miſery he is leading them into.

                     <p>But Friends, becauſe of the Straightneſs of this Gate, and the Narrowneſs of this Way, ſome that have attempted to walk in it, are grown weary of it, and have ſought out ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way, a way which (<hi>Jeroboam</hi> like) they have deviſed of their own Hearts; wherein they may have more Room, more Scope, more Company, Eaſe in the Fleſh, Liberty to the Fleſh, and all without controul. And this I am ſatisfied, hath not been the leaſt Motive to the Separation in this Day (as it was the greateſt in Days paſt) tho' ſome that have been drawn into it, may not perhaps ſee the Ground upon which it was undertaken.

Therefore all Friends every where, who have not yet a clear Sight, and a thorow Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Nature and Work, Deſign and Drift of this dividing Spirit; wait, I beſeech you, in Simplicity of Heart, and Lowlineſs of Mind, upon the Lord, and keep to the Meaſure of the Grace you have received from him; and ſuffer not your Minds to be ſwayed or byaſſed by any perſonal Kindneſs, natural Affection, Relation, Kindred or Acquaintance; but ſtand ſingle and

As this is the Exerciſe and Travel of my Spirit; ſo it is the Service I have been of late, and am at preſent engaged in. For Friends, 'tis not many Months ſince I ſaluted you with an Epiſtle, wherein my Spirit was drawn forth <hi>briefly to Commemorate the gracious Dealings of the Lord with his People;</hi> and, as in a general way, to remind you of the many Attempts the Enemy hath made, by Force and Fraud, to hinder the Work of God from going on: ſo more particularly to warn you <hi>to beware of that Spirit of Contention and Diviſion, which hath appeared of late in</hi> George Keith, <hi>and ſome few others that join with him, who have made a Separation from Friends in ſome parts of</hi> Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica. In writing that Epiſtle I did not conſult Fleſh and Blood, neither had I an Eye to my own Eaſe and Quit, as outwardly (for I had no Reaſon to expect Reſt from ſo reſtleſs a Man, nor fair Treatment from One, who in his late Writings and Perſonal Debates hath ſo notoriouſly let looſe his Pen and Tongue, to an <hi>unbridled Liberty</hi> of Railing and Reviling) But I clear'd my Conſcience, in diſcharging my Duty to God, and to his Church, and

            <p>And ſo he proceeds to clear himſelf of the Perverſions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which <hi>G.

Keith</hi> ever replied to it, being anſwered home, and having his Belly full, I ſuppoſe of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie with <hi>T. Ellwood;</hi> for though our Friend <hi>Thomas</hi> anſwered ſeveral other of <hi>G.

To the Honour of which I attribute it, that he was preſerved, and carried through and over all Oppoſition, and lived in Reputation and Renown to his Dying Day.</p>

That thus it was in the early Times of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, may be gathered from the Writings of the Apoſtles, particularly 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 14. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 18, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 3 <hi>John</hi> 9, <hi>&amp;c.

Then ſpeaking of the Motive or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducement to the Undertaking, Two things (he ſays) more eſpecially led him to it: One, That the Divine Providence, the Wiſdom, Power, Goodneſs and Favour of God, in ordering, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing, providing for, preſerving, defending, and wonderfully delivering his Servants and People out of the greateſt Straits, Difficulties, Hardſhips, Dangers and Sufferings, being more directly, and in a continued Series and Courſe of Actions ſet before the Readers Eye, he might be thereby the more ſtirred up, and engaged to admire and magnifie, to love, reverence and fear the Lord, and be the more careful not to offend Him. The other Motive was, That all, the Youth eſpecially, of either Sex, under what ſoever Religious Denomination they go, might be furniſhed with ſuch an Entertainment, to ſpend (at leaſt) their Leiſure Hours upon, as might yield them at once both Profit and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light.

As to the Chronology (eſpecially with reſpect to the Times of the Judges and Kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah</hi>) he found ſo much Incertainty, and ſo little Certainty or Agreement amongſt Interpreters about it, that he had a Mind to have left it out; but at the Deſire of ſome he added it in the Margin; wherein for the moſt part he followed <hi>R. Blome's Hiſtory of the Old and New Teſtament.</hi> 4. The few Helps (he ſays) he had, were chiefly from Dr. <hi>Gell's Eſſay towards an Amendment of the laſt</hi> Engliſh <hi>Tranſlation of the Bible. Hugh Brough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton's Conſent of Scripture, Godwin's Moſes and Aaron. The Annotations of</hi> Tremelius <hi>and</hi> Junius.

The ſecond Part beginning with the Book of <hi>Joſhua,</hi> goes through that, and the Book of <hi>Judges,</hi> with the firſt Book of <hi>Samuel,</hi> and carries on the Hiſtory from the Death of <hi>Moſes</hi> to the Death of <hi>Saul,</hi> and the Account that was brought to <hi>David</hi> of it. In which are recount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Tranſactions of chief Note under all the <hi>Judges</hi> and <hi>Saul,</hi> the firſt Anointed King of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> 8. The third Part (by much the largeſt) goes on with the ſecond Book of <hi>Samuel,</hi> thro' the reſt of the Canonical Scripture, ſets forth the Reigns of the Kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah</hi> throughout the <hi>Jewiſh Monarchy,</hi> with the moſt remarkable Acts and Occurrences therein, from <hi>David</hi> to the Return of the laſt <hi>Babyloniſh Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity,</hi> and Re-building of the Temple, taking in the Prophets, as near as may be, in their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Times.</p>

Blome's Hiſtory of the Old and New Teſtament.</hi> A Work indeed (ſays he) not only inſtructive and delightful, but pompous and magnificent. A Character that may juſtly be apply'd to his own (except the Word <hi>pompous.</hi>) A Work indeed it is both pleaſant and profit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; ſuch judicious Obſervations, and witty (though grave) Turns on Paſſages and Things, as make it (as well as his other Writings) not only pleaſant to read, but profitable to the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. A Work that will remain a Monument of his Worth and Ingenuity to Generations to come.</p>
            <p>I would only add, That there is a Book of <hi>Sulpitius Severus,</hi> intituled <hi>Sacred Hiſtory:</hi> but as that is in <hi>Latin,</hi> and far ſhort of this of <hi>T. E</hi>'s; ſo this cannot interfere with that, or be juſtly thought to be in Imitation of it.</p>
            <p>About this time we entred into a more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Correſpondence by Letters on ſeveral Occaſions; which we continued, at times, almoſt 'till his Death.

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">date </seg>1706</label> The next Year, <hi>viz.</hi> 1706, there followed an Intercourſe of ſome Letters between him and <hi>William Sewell</hi> of <hi>Holland,</hi> upon ſome particular Points; which led into a Friendly Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence between them, in ſome other Matters not unpleaſant to read.

            <p>His next publick Work was on this Occaſion.

            <p>In this Undertaking, he ſays, he aimed at the ſame End as in the former, <hi>viz.</hi> That all the Youth eſpecially, of either Sex, under whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver religious Denomination they go, might be further furniſhed, with ſuch an Entertainment, to ſpend, at leaſt, their Leiſure Hours upon, as might yield them at once both Profit and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light; and might be thereby drawn off from miſ-ſpending their precious Time upon other, either hurtful, or (at beſt) unprofitable Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. Then he gives Account why he hath, with the Matter of Fact, delivered the Diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, Speeches, Sermons and Doctrines delivered by our bleſſed Lord to his Diſciples, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> viz. That the Nature of the Hiſtory required it, and that without it the Diſcourſe would have been leſs profitable and pleaſant to the Reader; and by that means leſs conducive to the End he propoſed, which is to allure him to read the Holy Scriptures with Delight, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> according to the Poet,

But the Second Part (the Acts) being all written by one Hand, the Method (he ſays) is more regular, and the Courſe of the Hiſtory more clear. Yet the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical Epiſtles, being without Date, are hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he conceives, to be reduced with indubitable Certainty to exact Order; which yet he hath endeavour'd to place them right, according to the beſt of his Underſtanding. Then owning the Helps he had in Compiling this Hiſtory, had been chiefly from the <hi>Criticks,</hi> and <hi>Cradock</hi>'s <hi>Harmony of the four Evangeliſts,</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Hiſtory,</hi> with a few Words of the Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance; which if not done as it ſhould (nor as he would) yet as well as he could; And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in all Humility, recommending and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting it to the Divine Diſpoſal, he concludes his Preface.</p>
            <p>Next to the Preface is an Introduction, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Pen-men of the New Teſtament, and in what Language Originally written, and in what Order of Time; particularly of the four Evangeliſts, <hi>Matthew, Mark, Luke</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> what they were, the time of their Writing, and ſome particular Circumſtances concerning them and their Ends; well worth the Readers Peruſal, for the better underſtanding the Hiſtory, both of the Evangeliſts and Apoſtles.

(in the ſecond Part) in their proper Places (as near as could be) and gives an Account of them, the Occaſion why, the manner how, and time when they were written: ending with the Revelations, which he renders as a Revelation unrevealed; with ſome Brief Notes on it.

            <p>SINCE the Writing of the foregoing <hi>Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement,</hi> I have Underſtood, that our Friend <hi>Thomas Ellwood,</hi> after he had finiſhed and Publiſhed his <hi>Davideis,</hi> ſignified, <hi>That he had but one thing more that lay upon his Mind, and that was, to add ſomething to his</hi> Journal, <hi>or Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his</hi> Life; <hi>which was chiefly to give an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his</hi> Books <hi>and</hi> Writings: Which, as it ſhews he had not done it, or finiſhed it before, and 'tis to be doubted he did not after (not Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving long after that) and ſo no more to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected (more's the Pity) from his own Hand. So it ſhews what his deſign was, as to what he
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:0726600200:478"/>

            <p>WE received a Paper ſubſcribed by thee, and directed to the Church or People of God called <hi>Quakers,</hi> &amp;c. Which Paper contains ſome <hi>Objections,</hi> which (thou ſayſt) thou haſt heard ſpoken againſt us, and wherein thou deſireſt to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied. To which we ſay, It is no ſtrange Thing to us to be ſpoken againſt by the World's Teachers, that being no more than befel the People of God, in the Firſt breaking forth of Chriſtianity in the World, Of whom it was ſaid, <hi>Acts</hi> 28. 22. <hi>As concerning this Sect, we know that every where it is ſpoken againſt.</hi> But we are willing to endeavour thy Satisfaction, by Anſwering the <hi>Objections.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Firſt is, <hi>You own no Day, either the Firſt or Laſt, as a Sabbath to the Gentiles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> The Sabbath (which was the ſeventh or laſt Day of the Week) was given to the <hi>Jews, Ex.</hi> 16. 29. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 4. Not to the <hi>Gentiles, Pſal.</hi> 147. 19. 20. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 19. and was to laſt (as other typical Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0726600200:482"/>
were) <hi>untill the time of Reformation, Heb.</hi> 9. 10 <hi>till the Seed ſhould come, Gal.</hi> 3. 19. <hi>which was Chriſt. ver.</hi> 16. <hi>the Lord of the Sabbath, Mat.</hi> 12. 8. <hi>who, in the Fulneſs of time, did blot out the Hand writing of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and took it out of the way, nailing it to his Croſs, Col.</hi> 2. 14. From whence the Apoſtle thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, <hi>Let no man therefore judge you</hi> (the Saints and faithful Brethren, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 2.) <hi>in Meat or in Drink, or in reſpect of an Holy Day, or of the New Moon or of the Sabbath Days, Col.</hi> 2. 16. which, ſays he, <hi>are a Shadow of things to come, but the Body is of Chriſt. ver.</hi> 17. Thus was that <hi>Sabbath,</hi> which was given by God, to his People the <hi>Jews,</hi> ended and taken away by Chriſt, before the <hi>Gentiles</hi> were called to be his People. And as for the <hi>Firſt Day</hi> of the Week, we do not read in the Holy Scriptures, that it is called the <hi>Sabbath-Day,</hi> or commanded to be kept and obſerved for a <hi>Sabbath,</hi> as the <hi>Seventh Day</hi> had been. But, on the contrary, we find the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> writing to the <hi>Romans,</hi> who were <hi>Gentiles</hi> (though not without ſome mixture of believing <hi>Jews</hi> amongſt them, as appears, <hi>Acts</hi> 18. 2.) ſays, <hi>One Man eſteems one Day above an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other</hi> (there was the believing <hi>Jew</hi>) <hi>Another eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth every Day alike</hi> (there was the believing <hi>Gentile.</hi>) Well, what then? Doth he commend the Former of theſe, and condemn the latter? No; but he ſays, <hi>Let every Man be fully perſwaded in his own Mind,</hi> Rom. 14. 5. And in the 4<hi>th,</hi> 10<hi>th,</hi> and 13<hi>th</hi> verſes diſſwades them from judging one another about the Obſerving, or not obſerving a Day, as well as about the Eating, or not eating of Meats; and ſeems to lay no more Streſs upon the one, than the other. And if the Drift of the Apoſtle's diſcourſe there be heedfully minded, it will appear that, as he ſets him who believed he might eat all Things, with him that eſteemed every Day a like; and him that eſteemed one Day above another, with him that eat Herbs: So he imputes the Weakneſs to the Latter, <hi>ver.</hi> 2. and ſets himſelf on
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0726600200:483"/>
the other ſide, ſaying, <hi>We then that are ſtrong ought to bear the Infirmities of the weak,</hi> Chap. 15. 1. And he tells the <hi>Galatians</hi> (which though a <hi>Gentile Church,</hi> had alſo <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Believers in it) <hi>I am afraid of you, leſt I have beſtowed upon you Labour in vain,</hi> Gal. 4. 11. Why ſo? <hi>Ye obſerve Days, and Months, and Times, and Years,</hi> ſays he, <hi>ver.</hi> 10. So Jealous was the Apoſtle, leſt any that had been gathered from outward Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, and from a ſhadowy State, ſhould imbon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage themſelves again in Shadows, and fall ſhort of injoying the Subſtance, which is the true Goſpel <hi>Reſt that remains to the People of God,</hi> Heb. 4. 9. Which in the next Verſe is deſcribed to be, Their <hi>Ceaſing from their own Works, as God did from His. Into which Reſt we</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>that have believed, do en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> ver. 3. And in the 11. Verſe he preſſes others to labour to enter into that Reſt, Now when the Apoſtle ſays, <hi>There remains a Reſt,</hi> it plainly implies that the former Reſt, the outward Sabbatical Reſt did not <hi>remain,</hi> but was paſſed away and gone. Nor is it reaſonable to ſuppoſe, that the Reſt here men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, which is ſaid to <hi>Remain to the People of God,</hi> was an outward bodily Reſting, from outward bodily Labour, on whatſoever Day; both, as that would be but to change one Type or Figure for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other; And, as the entring into this Reſt is ſet forth in the Text, as a Matter of Labour and Difficulty, <hi>ver.</hi> 11. as it is indeed, yet bleſſed be the Lord, he hath enabled ſome, that have believed in his Name, and ſubjected to his Power, to enter into this Reſt, in this his Day; and many are preſſing after it, as the true abiding Goſpel-Reſt, which the Legal Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath was but a Type or Shadow of.</p>
            <p>The 2d Objection is, <hi>You deny the Scriptures to be any Rule for Man or Woman to walk by, ſo as to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect them to the ſaving of their Souls.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> In this we are miſrepreſented. We ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely own, love and regard the Holy Scriptures, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0726600200:484"/>
with the Apoſtle, that <hi>they were given by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration of God, and are profitable for Doctrine, for Reproof, for Correction, for Inſtruction in Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that the Man of God may be perfect, throughly furniſhed unto all good Works,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16, 17. and that <hi>they are able to make wiſe unto Salvation, through Faith that is in Chriſt Jeſus, ver.</hi> 15. And great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit and delight we find in them, reading them in the openings of that Divine Spirit, by which they were given forth. We are ſo far from denying them to be <hi rend="blackletterType">any</hi> Rule, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that we acknowledge them to contain <hi rend="blackletterType">many</hi> excellent Rules, Precepts, Doctrines and Inſtructions, directing Man and Woman how to walk, that they may obtain the Salvation of their Souls. Yet we do not ſay (as ſome have done) that the Scriptures are the <hi>only</hi> Rule, or the <hi>chief</hi> and <hi>principal</hi> Rule: becauſe we dare not give the Hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our and Office of the Holy Spirit unto the Scriptures; For the Scriptures themſelves declare, That <hi>it is the Office of the Holy Spirit to guide Believers into all Truth, John.</hi> 16. 13. And indeed, the true Meaning and Benefit of the Scriptures themſelves is not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to in the Reading of them, unleſs the Spirit that gave them forth do open them, and unſeal the Myſteries contained in them. So that the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is greater than the Scriptures, and therefore we cannot but give the chief Place unto him. For he is able to manifeſt himſelf unto Man, and to lead Man into the Way of Salvation, either with and by the Scriptures, or without them, as he pleaſes: But the Scriptures cannot do that without the Operation of the Holy Spirit. Juſtly therefore do we affirm the Spirit of God, to be the <hi>Chief</hi> Rule, and yet acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the Holy Scriptures to be a true Rule, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Inſtrument in the Hand of the Spirit, to direct Men and Women how they ought to walk, to obtain Salvation to their Souls, as the Spirit of the Lord makes uſe of the Scriptures to that End.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:0726600200:485"/>The 3d OBJECTION is, <hi>You deny the Reſurrection of this mortal Body, that this Mortal ſhall not put on Immortality.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> In this alſo we are miſrepreſented: We do not deny, but own the Reſurrection of the Dead; Believing, with the Apoſtle, that <hi>This Corruptible ſhall put on Incorruption, and this Mortal ſhall put on Immortality,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 54. And indeed, if we did not believe this, we might well ſay (as he did) <hi>If in this Life only we have Hope in Chriſt, we were of all Men moſt miſerable,</hi> ver. 19. <hi>And, Why ſtand we in jeopar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy every Hour,</hi> ver. 30. But the Lord knows, and we have openly and ſincerely declared, that we believe and own the Reſurrection of the Dead, according as the Holy Scriptures teſtify concerning it; Which ſay, <hi>Thou ſoweſt not that Body that ſhall be, but bare Grain</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But God giveth it a Body as it hath pleaſed him, and to every Seed his own Body,</hi> ver. 37, 38. <hi>It is ſown a natural Body; it is raiſed a Spiritual Body,</hi> ver. 44. the reaſon of which follows <hi>ver.</hi> 50. namely, <hi>That Fleſh and Blood cannot inherit the Kingdom of God, neither doth Corruption inherit Incorruption.</hi> And as we firmly believe this; So we take this to be ſufficient, without being ſo curiouſly inquiſitive as he, who would needs ask, <hi>How are the Dead raiſed up? and with what Body do they come?</hi> ver. 35. and was called <hi>Fool</hi> for his Pains, <hi>ver.</hi> 36.</p>
            <p>The 4th OBJECTION is, <hi>You ſuffer Women to be your Teachers, that were forbid by the Apoſtle, for he ſays, that they ſhould keep ſilence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> The <hi>Jews</hi> of old had a ſtrong Perſuaſion (grounded upon ſome miſunderſtood Places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) that the Salvation of God was confined to them, and belonged not at all to the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> And this Opinion had prevailed ſo far upon them, that even thoſe of them that received the Goſpel could not eaſily ſhake it off. In ſo much that, after <hi>Peter</hi> had been with <hi>Cornelius</hi> the <hi>Centurion,</hi> and was come
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0726600200:486"/>
back again to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> he was called before the Church for it, <hi>they that were of the Circumciſion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending with him,</hi> and <hi>ſaying, Thou went'ſt in to Men uncircumciſed, and did'ſt eat with them,</hi> Act. 11. 2, 3. To whom, having related the Occaſion and Particulars of that Matter, he concludes his Defence thus, <hi>For as much then as God gave them the like Gift as he did unto us, who believed on the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, what was I, that I could withſtand God?</hi> ver. 17. And in the next verſe it follows, <hi>when they heard theſe Things they held their Peace, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified God,</hi> &amp;c. This Anſwer, which the Apoſtle gave in that Caſe, may be ſuitable (we think) for us to give in this Caſe, to ſuch as (from ſome miſunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood Places of Scripture) are offended at us for Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering Women to ſpeak in our Aſſemblies, <hi>viz.</hi> For as much as God hath given them the like Gift as he did unto us, who believed on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, what are we that we ſhould withſtand God? God, by his Servant <hi>Joel,</hi> in the Time of the Law, had made this Promiſe, with Relation to the Times of the Goſpel, <hi>viz. And it ſhall come to paſs afterwards</hi> (<hi>or in the laſt Days, as</hi> Peter <hi>repeats it,</hi> Act. 2. 17.) <hi>that I will pour out my Spirit upon all Fleſh, and your Sons and your Daughters ſhall prophecy, your old Men ſhall dream Dreams, your young Men ſhall ſee Viſions: And alſo upon the Servants and upon the Handmaids in thoſe Days will I pour out my Spirit,</hi> Joel 2. 28, 29. (And they ſhall prophecy, adds <hi>Peter,</hi> Act. 2. 18.) Here was no Diſtinction of Sex made; But this Promiſe of <hi>pouring out the Spirit,</hi> and of <hi>propheſying</hi> thereby, is extended as expreſly and fully to the Daughters as to the Sons, to the Handmaids as to the Servants. And this the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> doth expreſly apply to that great <hi>pouring forth of the Spirit upon the Church,</hi> at the Pentecoſt immediately after Chriſt's Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, ſaying, <hi>This is that which was ſpoken by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet Joel,</hi> Acts 2. 16. Now at that great and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0726600200:487"/>
pouring forth of the Spirit it appears the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men were not excluded: For when, after the Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Apoſtles and Diſciples were returned from Mount <hi>Oliver</hi> to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> it is ſaid, <hi>Theſe all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued with one accord in Prayer and Supplication with the Women, and Mary the Mother of Jeſus,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 14. <hi>The Number of the Names together being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout an Hundred and Twenty,</hi> ver. 15. <hi>And when the Day of Pentecoſt was fully come, they were <hi rend="blackletterType">all</hi> with one accord in one Place,</hi> Chap. 2. 1. And in Ver. 3. it is ſaid, <hi>The cloven Tongues ſate upon <hi rend="blackletterType">each</hi> of them, and they were all filled with the Holy Ghoſt, and began to ſpeak with other Tongues, as the Spirit gave them ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terance,</hi> ver. 4. Here was no Diſtinction made, no ſhutting out the Women; but all were together, all received the Gift of the Spirit, and began to <hi>ſpeake with other Tongues, as the Spirit gave them ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terance.</hi> Nor was it thus only at that time, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that extraordinary Occaſion, but continued in the Church afterwards. For we read <hi>that Philip the Evangeliſt had four Daughters that did propheſie,</hi> Acts 21. 8, 9. <hi>Phebe,</hi> a Woman, is recommended by the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> to the Church at <hi>Rome,</hi> not only as a <hi>Siſter,</hi> but as a <hi>Servant of the Church,</hi> Rom. 16. 1. <hi>Priſcilla,</hi> a Woman, is called by the ſame Apoſtle, <hi>My Helper</hi> (or Fellow Labourer) <hi>in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> ver. 3. <hi>Tryphena</hi> and <hi>Tryphoſa,</hi> two Godly Women, are ſaluted by him as <hi>Labourers in the Lord.</hi> And of the beloved <hi>Perſis,</hi> another holy Woman, he teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies, that <hi>ſhe laboured much in the Lord,</hi> ver. 12. The ſame Apoſtle, in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Philippians,</hi> ſays, <hi>I entreat thee alſo, true Yoke Fellow, help thoſe Women which laboured with me in the Goſpel,</hi> Phil. 4. 3. Which is the Phraſe by which the Apoſtle doth frequently expreſs his own Miniſtry; and which he particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly applies to <hi>Timotheus,</hi> whom he calls <hi>Our Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Miniſter of God, and our Fellow Labourer in the Goſpel of Chriſt,</hi> 1 Theſ. 3. 2. Which is a clear Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0726600200:488"/>
that thoſe Women, that had received the Gift of Propheſy, did miniſter therein to the Edification of the Church, as well as the Men. Nay the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> in that very Epiſtle, wherein he is thought by ſome to diſcountenance <hi>Womens Preaching,</hi> doth give Directions for the Manner of their <hi>Preaching</hi> or <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſying,</hi> viz. <hi>That they ſhould do it with their Heads covered.</hi> For having firſt ſaid, <hi>Every Man praying or propheſying, having his Head covered, diſhonoureth his Head,</hi> 1 Cor. 11. 4. He adds, <hi>But every Woman that Prayeth or Propheſyeth with her Head uncovered diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honoureth her Head,</hi> ver. 5. This puts it out of doubt, that Womens <hi>Praying</hi> and <hi>Propheſying</hi> in the Church, was at that Time both lawful and uſual, as well as Mens.</p>
            <p>Now, that by <hi>Propheſying</hi> here is meant <hi>Preaching</hi> (not barely foretelling Things to come) may not only be inferred from the uſe of the ſame Word in the verſe foregoing, where, being ſpoken of Men, it is granted on all Hands to intend <hi>Preaching</hi> (and from thence the general practice of <hi>Mens Preaching uncovered</hi> is defended) but may alſo fairly be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, from the explanation the Apoſtle gives of it, in Chap. 14. ver. 31. where he tells that Church in general, <hi>We may all Propheſy one by one that <hi rend="blackletterType">all</hi> may <hi rend="blackletterType">learn</hi>
               </hi>; Which manifeſts that by <hi>Propheſying</hi> he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended <hi>Preaching</hi> or <hi>Teaching,</hi> that being the proper way or means of <hi>Learning.</hi> And in the Beginning of that Chapter, where he prefers <hi>Propheſying</hi> before <hi>Speaking whith Tongues,</hi> ver. 1. and 5. he ſays, <hi>He that Propheſyeth, Speaketh unto Men, to Edification, and Exhortation, and Comfort,</hi> ver. 3. And, <hi>He that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſyeth, Edifieth the Church,</hi> ver. 4. which plainly ſhew that by <hi>Propheſying</hi> he meant <hi>Preaching</hi> or <hi>Teaching,</hi> that being the proper means or way of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difying. And therefore, ſeeing he not only allowed Women to <hi>Prophecy,</hi> but directed and adviſed them how they ſhould perform it, <hi>Chap.</hi> 11. 5. and that in
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0726600200:489"/>
this Place <hi>Propheſying</hi> and <hi>Preaching</hi> appear to be one and the ſame Thing, it is unreaſonable to ſuppoſe he denied them the Liberty of <hi>Preaching,</hi> being gifted and called thereunto. As for thoſe Words of his, 1 Cor. 14. 34. <hi>Let your Women keep ſilence in the Churches: for it is not permitted unto them to ſpeak; but to be under Obedience, as alſo ſaith the Law.</hi> Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve firſt, that thoſe Words, [<hi>as alſo ſaith the Law</hi>] relate only to the Womens being under <hi>Obedience,</hi> not to their keeping <hi>ſilence</hi> in the Church: For that was never enjoyned them in the Law, but they were permitted to ſpeak in the Congregation; And both <hi>Miriam,</hi> who was a Propheteſs, did ſing the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs of the Lord, in the publick Congregation, <hi>Ex.</hi> 15. 20. 21. And <hi>Deborah,</hi> who was a Propheteſs, did recount the noble Acts of the Lord, and cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate his Praiſes in a Triumphant Song, <hi>Judges</hi> 5. Read alſo what <hi>Hanna</hi> ſpake in the Houſe of the Lord in <hi>Shiloh,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. And <hi>Anna,</hi> who was a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheteſs, did not only give thanks unto the Lord, but ſpake of Chriſt to all them that looked for Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption in <hi>Jeruſalem, Luke</hi> 2. 38. This was direct <hi>Preaching,</hi> and that <hi>in the Temple.</hi> So that the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men were not enjoyned <hi>ſilence</hi> under the Law, but were permitted to <hi>Speak.</hi> In the next Place, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what Speaking it was that was forbidden by the Apoſtle in that Place, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 34. which from his following Words will appear to be, not a Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Words of Life and Salvation, not a Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as the Spirit of God gives utterance; but ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſorderly, asking Queſtions unſeaſonably, and out of place; not ſpeaking for the Edification of Others, but ſpeaking for their own Information on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: for he immediatly adds, <hi>If they will learn any Thing, let them ask their Husbands at home,</hi> ver. 35. Theſe Words [<hi rend="blackletterType">learn</hi> and <hi rend="blackletterType">ask</hi>] plainly ſhew, that the Speaking here condemned was not a Speaking the <hi>Doctrines</hi> of the Goſpel for the Edification of the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0726600200:490"/>
Church, but <hi>asking Queſtions</hi> for their own Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, which they might have done at home, but not there: therefore he adds, <hi>For it is a Shame for Women to ſpeak in the Church.</hi> And ſo indeed it was in ſuch a diſorderly manner as they ſpake, to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate or Catechiſe either the Miniſter, or their Huſbands, openly in the Church, to aſk the Meaning of this, or call for an Explanation of that, which might look like a throwing off their Obedience to their Huſbands, and muſt needs occaſion Diſorders and Confuſion in the Aſſembly; which we may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive was the thing that troubled the Apoſtle, and which he laboured to reform: for he ſaid before, <hi>God is not the Author of Confuſion, but of Peace,</hi> ver. 33. and he concludes the Chapter with this Admonition <hi>Let all things be done decently and in order:</hi> So that it was the diſorderly Practice of ſome Women in that Church which he reproves, who, it ſeems, when any Thing was ſpoken which they did not underſtand, would interpoſe, and <hi>ask Queſtions</hi> for Information ſake, which was uncomely in them, offenſive and troubleſome to the Congregation. This ſort of <hi>Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> was not permitted them, but was a Shame to them, and from which they ought to have kept ſilence <hi>in the Church,</hi> and <hi>if they will learn any thing,</hi> ſays he, <hi>let them ask their Husbands at home.</hi> Of like import are thoſe other Words of the ſame Apoſtle to <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,</hi> and probably on the ſame Occaſion. <hi>Let the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> ſays he, <hi>learn in ſilence with all Subjection. But I ſuffer not a Woman to teach, nor to uſurp Authority over the Man, but to be in ſilence,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 11, 12. For hence it appears ſtill, that the Occaſion they took of ſpeaking, was under pretence of <hi rend="blackletterType">learning,</hi> wherein they took an undue Liberty to <hi>ask Queſtions,</hi> as if they would catechize or teach their Huſbands. But though the Apoſtle would not ſuffer ſuch ſort of Speaking in the Church, as might give Occaſion to any to think that the Women did caſt off the Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0726600200:491"/>
they owed, and did uſurp Authority over their Huſbands; nor after ſuch a Manner, as might breed Confuſion in the Congregation, for he was ſo watchful againſt that, that he enjoins the Man to be ſilent in that Caſe, as well as the Woman. <hi>If any Man,</hi> ſays he, <hi>ſpeaks in an unknown Tongue,— let one interpret: But if there be no Interpreter, let him keep ſilence in the Church,</hi> 1 Cor. 14. 27, 28. Yet we have before ſhewed, that he allowed of <hi>Women Propheſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and that by <hi>Propheſying</hi> he meant <hi>Preaching.</hi> We have alſo given many Inſtances of Women that laboured in the Work of the Goſpel in that Day; and could, from a living and ſure Experience, multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply inſtances of many Women in this Day, whom the Lord hath committed the Word of Life and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation unto, and who, in the quickning Power and Virtue thereof, have ſounded forth the ſame, to the awakening of many that were aſleep in Sin, and turning of many <hi>from darkneſs to Light,</hi> and from the <hi>Power of Satan to God,</hi> who are now become living Seals of their Miniſtry. Neither would this ſeem ſo ſtrange as it doth to ſome, did they duly conſider. That <hi>God is no Reſpecter of Perſons.</hi> But that, as, in the <hi>old Creation,</hi> Male and Female were Created in the Image of God: So, in the <hi>new Creation,</hi> Male and Female are all one in Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 28. But, as they that contended with <hi>Peter,</hi> for converſing with the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> when they had heard his Defence, held their Peace, and glorified God, ſaying, <hi>Then hath God alſo to the Gentiles granted Repentance unto Life, Acts</hi> 11. 18. So, we hope, they that have taken Offence at us, for ſuffering Women to ſpeak in the Church, when they ſhall have duly and impartially weighed what is herein offered for their Satisfaction, will hold their Peace (as to any Oppoſition thereunto) and Glorifie God, ſaying, <hi>Then hath God committed unto Women alſo the Word of Reconciliation.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:0726600200:492"/>The fifth Objection is, <hi>You are a People that have gained Health to your Immortal Souls, and are ſure of Heaven, when the Scriptures ſay, that</hi> the Righteous Man falls ſeven times a Day; <hi>and the Apoſtle</hi> Paul <hi>ſaid that</hi> Sin was ſtill actually in him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> We do not deſire to boaſt of any Attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Yet we cannot but confeſs, to the Glory of God, and the Praiſe of his Holy Name, that His ſaving Health hath appeared in this his Day, and we (through his Mercy) have taſted of it. Chriſt the Saviour, is manifeſted in Spirit, and we (through Grace) have felt the healing Virtue of his Divine Life and Power. Through the tender Mercy of our God, the Day-ſpring from on high hath viſited us, and hath given Light to us that ſate in Darkneſs and in the Shadow of Death, and hath guided our Feet into the way of Peace, and hath helped us to make our Calling and Election ſure. As for the Scripture thou mentioneſt, we do not find that the Scripture ſaith, <hi>The Righteous Man falls ſeven times a Day;</hi> but in <hi>Prov.</hi> 24. 16. we find it thus written, <hi>For a Juſt Man falleth ſeven times, and riſeth up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; but the Wicked ſhall fall into Miſchief.</hi> And as the Verſe before ſhews the Occaſion of theſe Words, where it is ſaid, <hi>Lay not wait, O wicked Man, againſt the Dwelling of the Righteous: ſpoil not his reſting place.</hi> So the latter Part of this 16th Verſe [<hi>but the wicked ſhall fall into Miſchief</hi>] implies, that the juſt Man doth not fall, as the wicked Man does, <hi>into Miſchief.</hi> And ſeeing all Sin is Miſchief, it ſeems as if the Fall here ſpoken of the juſt Man, were not a <hi>falling into Sin,</hi> but into ſome outward Calamity or Exerciſe. However the Place ſpeaks nothing of <hi>daily</hi> or <hi>continual falling.</hi> Nor do we remember that <hi>Paul</hi> doth uſe that very Expreſſion concerning him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>viz. That Sin was ſtill actually in him;</hi> though we know that he doth, in divers places, run through, as it were, and open the various States and Travels
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0726600200:493"/>
of the Soul; in ſome of which he cried out, <hi>O wretched Man that I am, who ſhall deliver,</hi> &amp;c! But he reſted not there, but quickly breaks forth into a Rejoycing, and cries out, <hi>I thank God, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord,</hi> Rom. 7. 24, 25. And then in the next Chapter, having ſaid, <hi>There is no Condemnation to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus, who walk not after the Fleſh, but after the Spirit,</hi> he ſays expreſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning himſelf. <hi>For the Law of the Spirit of Life in Chriſt Jeſus, hath made me free from the Law of Sin and Death,</hi> ver. 2. And again, <hi>Thanks be to God, which giveth us the Victory, through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 57. This <hi>Victory</hi> we preſs after; this <hi>Freedom from the Law of Sin and Death,</hi> we la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and travel to attain unto, by a Subjection (through Divine Aſſiſtance) to the <hi>Law of the Spirit of Life in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The 6th Objection is, <hi>Why your Teachers perſwade you, that all other People are in a barren and deſolate Condition, and are out of Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Our Teachers do not perſwade us ſo; nor do we Judge ſo of all other People: For we our ſelves were gathered out of various Profeſſions, States and Conditions; and ſome of us, who had been ſeeking after the Lord in other Profeſſions, can remember, that before we were thus gathered to this divine Principle of <hi>Light,</hi> which the Lord hath ſet up, in this his Day, as an Enſign for the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to be gathered unto, and to walk in: we were not wholly barren and deſolate; but had, at Seaſons, ſome touches and taſtes of the Vertue of that hidden Life, which we were then Strangers to; the Lord having regard to the Sincerity of our Hearts, and anſwering, in ſome meaſure, the Breathings of our Souls to him; ſo far, at leaſt, as to cheriſh and keep alive thoſe good Deſires which were begotten in us, and to beget in us a greater Hunger and Thirſt after him. And it is not hard to us to believe, that
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0726600200:494"/>
ſo it may be with others at this Day, who have an Integrity to the Lord, though not acquainted with his Outgoings, and Manifeſtations of himſelf in this Diſpenſation of <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Life:</hi> And both our Prayers to God the Father, in and through his Son Jeſus Chriſt, and our Labour and Endeavours, in the Openings of his Love and Life in our Hearts, are, That all theſe, in whatſoever Profeſſion, may be drawn off from all the dry Hills and barren Mountains, and gathered into the true Sheepfold. For we remember our Saviour ſaid, <hi>Other Sheep I have, which are not of this Fold: them alſo I muſt bring, and they ſhall hear my Voice; and there ſhall be one Fold, and one Shepherd,</hi> Joh. 10. 16. The Lord grant, that none of theſe may miſtake his Voice, or diſobey it.</p>
            <p>The laſt Objection is, <hi>You deny all outward Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, as</hi> Baptiſm, <hi>and the</hi> Six Principles, <hi>that were taught to the firſt primitive Chriſtians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> The Diſpenſation of the Law was <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> and the Ordinances appertaining to that Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation were <hi>outward</hi> alſo: But the Diſpenſation of the Goſpel is ſpiritual and <hi>inward,</hi> and the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances appertaining to this Diſpenſation are of a ſpiritual Nature. The <hi>Baptiſm with Water</hi> was <hi>John</hi>'s, and came up under the Diſpenſation of the Law, nor did properly belong to the Goſpel Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation, though for a time, by Condeſcention, continued; as Circumciſion, and ſome other Legal Rites, were. And this was that Baptiſm which <hi>Paul</hi> ſays Chriſt ſent him not to baptize with, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 17. But the <hi>Baptiſm of Chriſt,</hi> the true Goſpel-Baptiſm, that by which the true Believer is bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized into Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 3. and buried with him into Death, ver. 4. <hi>The one Baptiſm,</hi> Eph. 4. 5. is the <hi>Baptiſm with the Holy Ghoſt and with Fire,</hi> and is plainly diſtinguiſhed from the Baptiſm with Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, both by <hi>John,</hi> to whom the Water-Baptiſm
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0726600200:495"/>
belonged, and by Chriſt, to whom the Spirit-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm belonged. For <hi>John</hi> ſaid, <hi>I indeed baptize you with water unto Repentance; but he that cometh after me is mightier than I, whoſe Shoos I am not worthy to bear: He ſhall baptize you with the Holy Ghoſt and with Fire,</hi> Mat. 3. 11. And Chriſt, as <hi>Luke</hi> records a little before his Aſcenſion, ſaid, <hi>John truly bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized with Water, but ye ſhall be baptized with the Holy Ghoſt not many Days hence,</hi> Acts 1. 5. which was the Promiſe of the Father, <hi>ver.</hi> 4. delivered by Chriſt to his Apoſtles and Diſciples, juſt before his parting from them, <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 49. Let it therefore be fairly conſidered, 1. That the Diſpenſation of the Goſpel is <hi>Spiritual,</hi> and therefore the Ordinances belonging to it ſhould be ſo too. 2. That in <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19. (From which place the Commiſſion for Water-Baptiſm is uſually fetched) there is no Mention ef Water. 3. That Baptiſm with Water is no where in Scripture called Chriſt's Baptiſm. 4. That Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm with Water is frequently called <hi>John's Baptiſm.</hi> 5. That the Baptiſm with the Holy Ghoſt is called <hi>Chriſt's Baptiſm.</hi> 6. That the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges but <hi>One Baptiſm,</hi> Eph. 4. 5. which cannot be ſuppoſed to be that with <hi>Water,</hi> ſince then he muſt exclude the Baptiſm of the <hi>Spirit.</hi> 7. That the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> ſpeaking of the Baptiſm that ſaves, ſays expreſly, <hi>It is not the putting away the Filth of the Fleſh,</hi> 1 Pet. 3. 21. (which it is the Property of Water to do) as if he had ſaid, <hi>The Baptiſm which now ſaves us is not Water-Baptiſm.</hi> 8. That Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm with Water is no where expreſly commanded in Scripture, as it would doubtleſs have been, had it been intended by Chriſt for a Goſpel Ordinance. 9. That tho' it was ſometimes uſed after Chriſt's Aſcenſion, yet that cannot authorize the uſe of it now, any more than of Circumciſion, and other Legal Ordinances, which, in Condeſcention to the Weakneſs of Believers in that Day, were alſo uſed
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0726600200:496"/>
after Chriſt's Aſcenſion, yet are confeſt by all not to be in force now. For <hi>John,</hi> as himſelf ſaid, was to <hi>decreaſe,</hi> Joh. 3. 30. which related to his Miniſtry or Diſpenſation, not to his Perſon. Now a <hi rend="blackletterType">De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing</hi> implies a growing leſs, or wearing away by degrees, not all on a ſuddain; or at once; and therefore no wonder, if his Water-Baptiſm was continued for a time, even after Chriſt's Baptiſm of the Holy Spirit took place. But as Chriſt's Baptiſm was to <hi>increaſe,</hi> ſo <hi>John</hi>'s was to <hi>decreaſe,</hi> till Chriſt's came to be <hi>all in all,</hi> and <hi>John</hi>'s Water Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm wholly to give place. Let theſe things, we ſay, be duly weighed, and we hope we ſhall not be blamed, for leaving the Baptiſm of <hi>John,</hi> and cleaving to the Baptiſm of <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for the <hi>Six Principles</hi> thou mentioneſt, ſeeing thou haſt not declared what they are, it cannot be expected we ſhould ſpeak to them at this time. But we recommend to thee that holy divine Principle of <hi rend="blackletterType">Light</hi> wherewith Chriſt <hi>lighteth every Man that cometh into the World,</hi> Joh. 1. 9. <hi>In which Light the Nations of them that are ſaved ſhall walk,</hi> Rev. 21. 24. And we heartily deſire thou mayſt walk therein.</p>

And that it might not be extended be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond its appointed Time and Bounds, it pleaſed the Divine Wiſdom, to ſubject it to ſuch Ceremonial Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, as plainly rank it amongſt thoſe carnal Ordinances (Rites or Ceremonies) which were impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but <hi>till the Time of Reformation,</hi> ſpoken of <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 10. For as God appointed the <hi>Levites</hi> to be offered for a <hi>Wave-Offering,</hi> by <hi>Moſes,</hi> in the Name and on the Behalf of the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when he ſaid to <hi>Moſes, Thou ſhalt bring the Levites to the Tabernacle of the Congregation, and thou ſhalt gather the whole Aſſembly of the Children of Iſrael together; And thou ſhalt bring the Levites before the Lord, and the Children of Iſrael ſhall put their Hands upon the Levites: And Aaron ſhall offer</hi> (in the Margin <hi>Wave</hi>) <hi>the Levites before the Lord, for an Offering</hi> (in the Margin <hi>Wave-Offering</hi>) <hi>of the Children of Iſrael; that they may execute the Service of the Lord,</hi> Numb. 8, 9, 10, 11. So the Tythes, which were aſſigned for the Maintenance of the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites,</hi> were to be firſt offered, by the People, as an <hi>Heave-Offering</hi> unto the Lord. (<hi>The Tythes of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Iſrael, which they offer as an Heave-Offering unto the Lord, I have given to the Levites,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Numb.</hi> 18. 24.) And even the Tythe of thoſe Tythes, which the <hi>Levites</hi> were to yield unto the <hi>Prieſts,</hi> were to be offered, by the <hi>Levites,</hi> as an <hi>Heave-Offering</hi> to the Lord, before the <hi>Prieſts</hi> might have them. <hi>Thus ſpeak unto the Levites</hi> (ſaid God to <hi>Moſes</hi>) <hi>and ſay unto them, When ye take of the Children of Iſrael the Tythe which I have given you from them for your Inheritance; Then ye ſhall offer up an Heave Offering of it for the Lord, even</hi>

                  <hi>a Tenth Part of the Tythe. And this your Heave-Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhall be reckoned unto you, as though it were the Corn of the threſhing Floor,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Thus ye alſo ſhall offer an Heave-Offering unto the Lord, of all your Tythes, which ye receive of the Children of Iſrael: And ye ſhall give there of the Lord's Heave-Offering to Aaron the Prieſt,</hi> ver. 26, 27, 28. This makes it evident, beyond doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that the Tythes, which were given by the People to the <hi>Levites,</hi> and by the <hi>Levites</hi> to the <hi>Prieſts,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law, had their Dependence on the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial Law, as that Prieſthood had; And were to ſtand no longer than that Law and that Prieſthood ſtood: Which was but till <hi>Shiloh</hi> came, and by the Offering of himſelf once for all, had put an end to all the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowy Offerings under that Law.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This the Author of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> did ſo well underſtand, that he poſitively declared that <hi>the Levitical Prieſthood being changed, there was made of Neceſſity a Change alſo of the Law,</hi> (of that Law, by which that Prieſthood and the Maintenance of it had ſtood) See <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 12. And 'tis alſo evident from Scripture and Primitive Antiquity, that neither the Apoſtles themſelves, nor (for ſome ages after them) any of the Chriſtians, did meddle with, or at all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern themſelves about Tythes; But let them totally fall as they did the other abrogated Part, <hi>viz.</hi> Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and of the Ceremonial Law of <hi>Moſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. But after that the Myſtery of Iniquity, which in the Apoſtles time began to work (2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 7.) had wrought to that Degree amongſt ſome Chriſtians, and had drawn them ſo far from the Purity and Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of the Goſpel, as to form and model the Church in many things, by and according to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern amongſt other Ceremonial Parts of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Religion, which had been aboliſhed by the Coming and Death of Chriſt, Tythes were preached up again (about the latter end of the fourth Century, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the fifth) by ſome, at firſt, under the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0726600200:500"/>
of Alms and Charity (becauſe part of the Tythes under the Levitical Law, were appointed for the Maintenance of the Fatherleſs, the Widow and the Stranger, <hi>Deut.</hi> 14. 28, 29.) And by others, as then ſtill due by the Moſaic Law, which had required them to be paid to the Levitical Prieſthood. Which Plea afterwards (Corruptions increaſing in the Church, and in thoſe eſpecially who were called the <hi>Church-Men,</hi> or <hi>Clergy</hi>) more and more prevailing, the Payment of Tythes was re-introduced, as due by thoſe Levitical Laws, which had been given to the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> of old. And upon that Bottom, Tythes have ſtood, been claimed and the Claim defended unto this Day.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Now, not only he that thus claims, and receives Tythes; but he that conſents to, and complies with ſuch Claim, by paying Tythes thus brought in, and thus claimed, doth thereby implicitly, and vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally (at leaſt) deny that Chriſt has put an End to the Ceremonial Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and conſequently that he is come, and hath ſuffered in his Fleſh for Mankind.

               </p>
               <p n="6">6. By this it appears, that without regard had of the Perſon to whom, or the Uſe for which Tythes are paid, the paying of Tythes (as well as the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving them) being <hi>a Part</hi> of the abrogated Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> imports a denyal of the Coming, and Death of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Hence it is, that Tythes have been, and are commonly called <hi>Antichriſtian,</hi> or <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Chriſt.</hi> And hence hath riſen that ſaying (often uſed not only by our antient Friends, but by ſome of the Martyrs long before) <hi>viz. He that pays Tythes, doth thereby deny that Chriſt is come in the Fleſh.</hi> That Concluſion could not have been drawn, from the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Tythes to a wrong Miniſtry, or for a wrong uſe only, though ſuch Payment be evil: Nor could any thing juſtify that Inference, but the Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that Tythes, depending on the Ceremonial Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which muſt of Neceſſity and in courſe fall, and ceaſe when Chriſt ſuffered; the paying of Tythes carries in it a ſuppoſal, that that Law is not yet cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, but is ſtill in force: and conſequently that Chriſt, whoſe Death muſt needs have ended it, is not yet come, nor has yet ſuffered in his Fleſh for Mankind.</p>
               <p n="7">7. That other Objection, not leſs weighty than common againſt paying Tythes to the <hi>Clergy,</hi> ſo call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>viz.</hi> The unlawfulneſs of upholding a falſe Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, to perform a falſe Worſhip (being it ſelf ſo

clear and plain, that it needs no illuſtration) I ſhall, in this Diſcourſe, no further meddle with, than to obſerve in my way, how far it may affect thoſe Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes alſo, which the <hi>Impropriators</hi> claim. Wherefore having premiſed what is ſaid before concerning Tythes in general, to what Hand, or for what Uſe ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever paid, let us now inquire into thoſe Tythes, which are called <hi>Impropriate.</hi>
               </p>
            </div>
            <div type="section">
               <head>
                  <hi>Of Impropriate</hi> TYTHES.</head>
               <p n="1">1. THAT theſe Tythes, which are claimed by the <hi>Impropriators,</hi> are of the ſame Nature, and ſtand originally on the ſame Root and Ground, on which the other Tythes ſtand, which are claimed and exacted by the <hi>Prieſts,</hi> is evident from hence, that they were all heretofore, theſe as well as thoſe, claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by, and paid to ſome or other of the <hi>Romiſh Clergy,</hi> or their Appendices, the Religious Orders (ſo called) and upon the ſame Foot. That is, Theſe <hi>Impropriate Tythes</hi> were paid to thoſe Religious Orders or Houſes, as being due to God, by vertue of the <hi>Levitic Law;</hi> as well as the other Tythes were paid to the <hi>Pariſh-Prieſts,</hi> on the ſame ſuppoſed Right, from the ſame Law. But how theſe Tythes came to thoſe Religious Houſes firſt, and how afterwards from them to the <hi>Impropriators,</hi> is next to be inquired.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Until the <hi>Lateran Council</hi> (ſo named, becauſe it was holden in the <hi>Pope's</hi> Palace at <hi>Rome,</hi> called the <hi>Lateran</hi>) in the Year 1215. It was in the choice of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Man to give his Tythes to what Church he pleaſed, ſo he gave them to ſome Church. And even after that Council, the <hi>Popes,</hi> as Heads of that Church, by their diſpencing Power, did give leave to ſuch as would ſue, and pay for it, to give their Tythes from the <hi>Pariſh-Prieſt,</hi> to ſuch Order of Religious People (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Monks, Friers,</hi> or <hi>Nuns</hi>) as they were beſt affected to. By which means, the <hi>Pariſh-Prieſts</hi> (called <hi>Seculars,</hi>)
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0726600200:503"/>
and thoſe of the ſeveral Religious Orders (called by a general Title, <hi>Regulars</hi>) being left to ſcramble, as they could, for maintenance, the <hi>Regulars</hi> (<hi>mendicant Fryers,</hi> and others) ſwarming in all Places, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending, at leaſt, to greater Sanctity, and Auſterity of Life, than the <hi>Pariſh-Prieſts,</hi> prevailed with the People, either living or dying, to give not only very conſiderable Eſtates in Lands, but alſo the Tythes of other Lands, and of whole Pariſhes, from the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh-Prieſts,</hi> to their Religious Houſes or Convents.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Tythes, or Parſonages, ſo given, were then called <hi>Appropriations,</hi> becauſe they were appropriated to this, that, or the other Religious Houſe or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent. And I have read, that there were in <hi>England</hi> about 3845 Parſonages thus appropriated. And as Tythes were then held to be <hi>due to God and holy Church;</hi> and thoſe Religious Orders were reputed a part of that Church: So the Tythes, as well as the Lands thus given them, were continued to them, and poſſeſſed by them, till that general Storm aroſe, in K. <hi>Henry</hi> 8. his time, which overturned thoſe Religious Houſes and Orders together. And here, by the way, it may be noted, That while thoſe Religious Houſes ſtood, a great part of the Lands which had been given to them, were, by Papal Authority, exempted from paying Tythes: Whence it is, that many of thoſe Eſtates, which had belonged to thoſe Religious Houſes, remain diſcharged from the Burden of Tythes ſtill.</p>
               <p n="4">4. As Tythes were ſet up here on the Authority of the <hi>Levitic Law,</hi> and in imitation of the <hi>Jewiſh Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,</hi> conſonant to that Law: So while thoſe Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Houſes ſtood, and the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Power prevailed here, not only the <hi>Seculars</hi> or <hi>Pariſh-Prieſts,</hi> but all thoſe <hi>Regulars</hi> who received Tythes, were bound to pay the <hi>Tenths</hi> out of the Tythes they received to the Head of their Church, the <hi>Pope</hi> as the <hi>Levites,</hi> under the Ceremonial Law, were required to do to the Prieſts.</p>
               <p n="5">5. But after that K. <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. (upon a Quarrel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween

the <hi>Pope</hi> and him, about his Divorce from his firſt Queen <hi>Catharine,</hi> which he earneſtly deſired, and the <hi>Pope</hi> would not grant) fell off from the <hi>Pope</hi> (though not from <hi>Popery:</hi> For after that, he retained the moſt pernicious Doctrines of the <hi>Romiſh Church,</hi> contained in the ſix Articles, and burnt ſome for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying them) he threw off the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Supremacy here, and aſſumed it to himſelf; declaring himſelf, and being declared, firſt by the <hi>Clergy</hi> in their <hi>Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and ſoon after by <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons</hi> in <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, The only Supream Head in Earth of the Church of England.</hi> This was done by the Statute of 26 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. c. 1.

And indeed, the ſuppreſſing of thoſe 376 leſſer Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſteries, ſtruck ſo great a Fear into the greater, that the Statute made four Years after (31 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. cap. 13.) whereby the Reſt of the Religious Houſes were given to the King, recites, <q rend="inline margSglQuotes">'That divers and ſundry Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bots, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of their own free and voluntary Mind, ſince the fourth of <hi>Feb.</hi> in the 27 of his Reign, had by due Order of Law, and by their ſufficient Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Record, under their Convent and common Seals, ſeverally given, granted and confirmed to the King his Heirs and Succeſſors for ever, All their ſaid Monaſteries, Abbeys, Priories, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and all the Mannors, Lord-ſhips, Lands, Tenements, <hi>Tythes,</hi> &amp;c. to them belonging; and had voluntarily renounc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, left and forſaken the ſame.</q> And therefore, in the ſaid Statute it is enacted, <q rend="inline margSglQuotes">'That the King ſhall have, hold, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All ſuch late Monaſteries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and all the Sites, Circuits, Manners, Lands, Tenements, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> thereunto belonging.</q> In the ennumeration of the Particulars whereof, (which are many) <hi>Tythes,</hi> Parſonages, appropriate, and Vicarages are expreſly mentioned.

               <p n="11">11. From hence this Obſervation ariſes. That ſince thoſe Religious Orders did hold the <hi>Tythes</hi> which they poſſeſſed, upon the ſuppoſed Right of their being due <hi>to God and Holy Church,</hi> which they held themſelves, and were by others holden to be a part of; and the King received thoſe <hi>Tythes</hi> and <hi>Parſonages</hi> (amongſt the reſt of the Revenues of the Religious Houſes) as well thoſe that were reſigned to him by the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours of thoſe Houſes themſelves, as the reſt which by Act of Parliament he took, upon the ſame Right on which thoſe Religious Orders had holden them: He alſo muſt hold them upon that ſuppoſed Right of their being due <hi>to God and Holy Church;</hi> which he then held himſelf, and was holden by all, both <hi>Clergy</hi> and <hi>Laity,</hi> to be the only <hi>Supream Head</hi> of here in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> And as upon that ſuppoſed Right (of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>due to God and Holy Church</hi>) on which the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Houſes held them, they paſſed them from thoſe Houſes to the King, as <hi>ſupream Head of the Church:</hi> So on the ſame ſuppoſed Right (of their being <hi>due to God and Holy Church</hi>) they paſſed from the King, as <hi>ſupream Head of the Church,</hi> to thoſe (whether <hi>Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual</hi> or <hi>Lay</hi> Perſons) unto whom the King granted them. For they ſtuck not long in the King's Hand: But he, of his own meer Motion, Liberality and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nignity (as the Statute in the 33d Year of his Reign, cap. 39. relates) had by that time freely given and granted, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> unto divers and ſundry of the Lords and Nobles, as well <hi>Spiritual</hi> as <hi>Temporal,</hi> and unto divers and many other Perſons and Bodies politick, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> divers and many ſundry Honours, Caſtles, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, Lands, Tenements, and among the reſt, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="12">12. But great care was taken to retain, and keep up the Character of <hi>Spirituality,</hi> which had formerly been

ſtamped upon thoſe <hi>Rectories, Parſonages,</hi> and other Revenues by <hi>Tythes,</hi> into what Hands ſoever they were paſſed. And therefore, by the Statute of 32 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. cap. 7. in caſe of with-holding, or denying to pay the Tythes, all Perſons claiming them <hi>(Impropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,</hi> as well as <hi>Prieſts)</hi> are reſtrained from ſuing in the <hi>Temporal Courts,</hi> and limitted to the <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> or <hi>Spiritual Courts</hi> only, for the Recovery of them.</p>
               <p n="13">13. And that they might ſtill have Dependence upon the <hi>Supremacy,</hi> care was taken, from the firſt, by the Statute of 27 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. cap. 27.

               <p>Nor was Care taken of the <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Head</hi> (the <hi>King</hi>) only, but of the <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Members</hi> (the <hi>Clergy</hi>) alſo: Many, if not moſt, of which had Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, or Portions iſſuing out of thoſe Parſonages, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories, or other ſpiritual Benefices (as they were counted) which the Religious Orders held: for, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that upon the increaſing of thoſe <hi>Appropriations,</hi> whereby the <hi>Pariſh Prieſts</hi> were pinch'd, there had been Proviſion made early, in the time of K. <hi>Richard</hi> the <hi>Second,</hi> for the <hi>Vicars,</hi> as well as for the <hi>Poor;</hi> the Statute of 15 <hi>Ric.</hi> 2. 6. directing, <q rend="inline margSglQuotes">'That, upon the
